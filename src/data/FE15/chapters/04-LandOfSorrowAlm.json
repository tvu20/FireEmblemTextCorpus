But there is no denying fact\u2014you are the only son of Emperor Rudolf. Scion of the Rigelian imperial bloodline, and true heir to Rigel\u2019s throne."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "...How could you? You knew all this time, and yet you kept it from me...! You KNEW, and you still sent me off to kill my own FATHER!"}, {"speaker": "Mycen", "line": "Please remain calm, Alm. *sigh* Let me explain. ...Best I start at the very beginning. As you well know, Valentia has always been divided north from south\u2014 split between the two gods, Mila and Duma. But their involvement with mankind eventually grew too deep. When madness takes a god, man is lost. And where gods meet ruin, men die too. That is the plight Valentia now faces."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "You\u2019re saying the gods are...dying?"}, {"speaker": "Mycen", "line": "I fear so. Rudolf was among the first to understand the signs. He saw Duma\u2019s growing madness and knew it for a harbinger of ruin. But then you were born, Alm."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "What does that have to do with any of this?"}, {"speaker": "Mycen", "line": "You bore the Brand\u2014sign of the hero who would rise to save Valentia.

I will never forget the pain on his face when he placed you in my arms..."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Mycen", "line": "That day marked a change in him. He donned the mantle of one who would destroy the old world order\u2014 one who\u2019d free men to live by their own power, even if they hated him for it. He knew such heresy would bring forth those who wished for his death. So for that death to come at the hand of his beloved son was...a mercy. He told me himself that he could imagine no more peaceful end."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "And what of my peace?"}, {"speaker": "Mycen", "line": "This is not the time for mourning or self-pity, boy. Rudolf\u2019s purpose now falls to you. The true foe you must defeat is Duma. As well as the zealots tainted by his madness who seek control of Valentia: Jedah, and his Duma Faithful. If you do not hurry, Celica\u2019s life will also be in peril."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "Oh, gods! Celica!
