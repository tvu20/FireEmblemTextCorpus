Since before anyone could remember, the mountains had belonged to bandits, blights on the land whose acts of plunder, kidnapping, and arson knew no bounds. Out of fear, their victims gave these peaks another name: the Ghoul\u2019s Teeth; while the bandits who ruled atop the Teeth\u2019s craggy crowns took a name as well: the Samsooth Sires, or Soothsires..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Julian", "line": "Hey, Lena!

You should flee while you can. I can use my Warp staff to send you somewhere safe."}, {"speaker": "Julian", "line": "I can't let you do that. If I leave you here, then why did I betray the bandits and rescue you? We can worry about your staff later! I promise I'll come back for it. Let's get while the getting's good.

Since you made it all the way up here, what say I give you this axe? Not bad, eh? Not so fast! This Devil Axe consumes the lives of those who wield it. If I were you, I wouldn't use it in battle!
