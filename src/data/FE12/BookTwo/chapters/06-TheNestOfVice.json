Lang used his influence to steal belongings, daughters, and lives from the people of Grust. Was there ever a man as cruel as he is?", "\"I cannot forgive him. I shall take him down without fail!\" Prince Marth raised his sword to the skies and ordered firmly: \"Altean knights, charge!!\""], "intro": [{"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Kris, you should be aware that Lang is a general with high defense. To defeat him, you would do well to attack with magic or a special weapon like an armorslayer."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Duly noted."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "If you plan to defeat him with strength alone, you'd have to be extremely powerful."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Kris, your strength is simply tremendous. Against a blow from you, Lang's armor would crumple like paper. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Yes sir!"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Kris, your strength is quite impressive. You might just be able to defeat Lang. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Kris, you are, sadly, not very strong. But you could fight using your other talents. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man."}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "Heh heh heh... So the Alteans have come. Reinforcements are arriving soon; if we can hold out a little longer, we can make a pincer attack. Swordsman Navarre. When they open that door, you make your move. There is no need for restraint; slice them to pieces!"}, {"speaker": "Navarre", "line": "Yeah... sure. Though the knights of Altea are hardly worthy enemies."}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "Oh-ho! That's my Navarre. They say not even Ogma of Talys is your equal."}, {"speaker": "Navarre", "line": "What? Ogma?! N... Naturally... A guy like him is no match for me."}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "I see. Glad to hear it. Then I'll leave this place in your capable hands, Navarre!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Sire, there seems to be movement near the front of the castle. And it would appear to be moving towards our forces."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Are they enemy reinforcements? Or allies to our cause...?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "I do not know, but... I do hope they are allies."}, {"speaker": "Frey", "line": "Sire!"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Frey! Thank goodness you're safe."}, {"speaker": "Frey", "line": "You too, sire. Norne and I escaped from Altea Castle and we rode here as fast as we could."}, {"speaker": "Norne", "line": "But the rest of our forces were scattered... I'm sorry we couldn't all make it."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "You don't have to apologize, I'm just glad that you're safe. The others can take care of themselves."}, {"speaker": "Frey", "line": "Sire. From here on we shall accompany you. Please give us your orders."}, {"speaker": "Norne", "line": "Oh, and please be careful! I caught a glimpse of enemy troops approachin' the castle behind us.

Y-you're not Navarre! Who are you?", "recruiter": "Caeda", "recruit": "Samuel"}, {"speaker": "Samuel", "line": "Yikes, I've been exposed, huh? I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as Samuel. Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this famous \"Navarre\" swordsman guy. I got tired of it after a while, so I decided to pose as him and got myself hired.

Thank goodness you're unharmed."}, {"speaker": "Wendell", "line": "Lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned. Even though I told him that I must fulfill a mission assigned to me by Archsage Gotoh..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "A mission from Lord Gotoh?"}, {"speaker": "Wendell", "line": "That's correct... You have seen the \"Starsphere\"--the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface. In order to pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil, Lord Gotoh created a sacred spell named \"Starlight\" from that orb."}, {"speaker": "Wendell", "line": "Unfortunately, the strain on the Starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards, which scattered into the sky. Lord Gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power, and that if even one of them is lost, the world will fall into irreparable ruin. By any means possible, we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the Starsphere."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Is... Is this a joke? That the world could just end... This is all very hard to take in. But aren't these the star shards? If so, we already have a few. After we retake Altea, we'd be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs."}, {"speaker": "Wendell", "line": "Of course... Your country was only just invaded by the Empire... I understand, Prince... I too shall fight to restore Altea, then. Thinking about it, my meeting with you is like a sign from Lord Gotoh himself. In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate. But, please, let's stop by the Fane of Raman. We may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Understood. If it's the Fane of Raman, we can go there on our way to Altea!"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "General Lang has been defeated.

Thank you so much."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "It couldn't be helped, but... Some of our comrades were injured or passed on. I don't want to lose anyone from now. I know we can do it if you're there. Kris, please, help me."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "All I remember is seeing our companions fall, one by one... Enough! I don't want any of our comrades to suffer that pain. Kris, please, help me."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Sire, some new information has come in from the patrol. Just ahead, the enemy seems to be preparing some kind of ambush. It's not the Archanean Empire, but likely, I fear, mercenaries hired with coin."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Mercenaries, is it...? Do we continue as we are or take a longer, safer route? Personally, I'd rather not detour. We have to return to Altea as soon as possible."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Hmph, if you would allow me to speak as your tactician... I think we ought to stay here and fight. We will be facing mercenaries. The Altean knights would never lose to mere mercenaries."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Kris, your thoughts?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "I agree with Sir Jagen."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I see, thank you.
