the kingdom army meets with rodrigue in ailell the valley of torment with the strength of house fraldarius on their side the time to invade the empire is finally at hand
even though its in ruins in some strange way this monastery never truly changes does it i studied at the officers academy when i was young those memories come rushing back whenever i return what are you doing at this hour anyway
i couldnt sleep
 its the same for me
nothing
i see
perhaps youll allow me to join you 
 i keep recalling my eldest son  he was quite gifted in fact he was appointed a knight at the age of 15 i still vividly remember the day he was granted a sword from his majesty 
your son  isnt he 
dead he was killed nine years ago in duscur all that returned of him that day were his sword and his armor  after it happened i said something horrible to felix hes hated me ever since and i dont blame him no matter how much you grieve the dead will never return no magic in the world can bring them back thats why their memory clings to the living like a curse the more they were loved the tighter their hold and the more suffering they cause  i fear i am not a strong enough man to scold his highness for his foolishness
someone must
right you are  as adults it is our responsibility to scold him and help him find his way again but really  im just a failure of a man
i know how you feel 
since this war began weve seen countless generals soldiers and citizens die it never gets easier
professor  i entrust the young prince and the future of faerghus to you
this is unexpected 
i suppose that was a dramatic way of putting it my apologies
i wont let you down
youre a brave one arent you one worthy of leading the church of seiros i daresay
you should know that i have no intention of insisting that you take back fhirdiad all i ask is that you continue to rein in dimitris manic desire for revenge now then  we have received house riegans consent all thats left is for us to depart if we make it through gloucester territory and across the great bridge of myrddin well be in empire territory you are not afraid are you
a little
ha no need to worry dont you underestimate the power of my soldiers
i dont feel anything
yessuch is war 
im glad you were the one to lead the blue lion house professor i mean that 
if you stand in my way i will strike you down
leaving the house in my uncles hands what is the old man thinking i always knew my father was mad but this time hes gone too far
i agree
my uncle is a reliable man but still
im actually grateful to him
easy for you to say you hardly know the man
only a fool would abandon his own territory
the area around castle gaspard where i was living is under the control of house rowe who have submitted to the empire if i hadnt come to garreg mach i might have ended up as your enemy at ailell that thought makes me really happy to be here now i dont think i would have been able to handle facing all of you in battle
i had an encounter with lord gwendal  how many years ago was it back before the academy i met this girl who i fell madly in love with and her dad tried to kill me i suppose he just tried to scare me but i was sure i was gonna die oh yeah her dad lord gwendal crazy right i never thought id seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle i kind of dont know how to make sense of it
it looks like were all set with food supplies thanks to lord rodrigue we have more soldiers to feed now so well still need to ration  but i think we have enough extra to make some tasty treats ill go scout the pantry
that would be wonderful
we can enjoy it together over some tea
we shouldnt be wasteful 
thats true but its important to indulge every now and again its been so difficult lately and everyone is worn out we wont be able to go on if we dont treat ourselves
next we face the great bridge of myrddin  we actually crossed it a long time ago do you remember it was five whole years ago
during the battle of the eagle and lion
it seems like so long ago doesnt it its odd how fast time flies 
when we went to remire village
what are you talking about professor it was on the way to the battle of the eagle and lion
everyone was still friends then after the fighting we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses i often wish we could go back to those peaceful days 
just like house fraldarius house galatea is currently being invaded by the dukedom my family is not as wealthy as most others so we are incapable of sparing resources or reinforcements im sorry its just so frustrating not being able to do anything to help
what used to be aegir territory lies far to the east of the great bridge of myrddin downstream of the airmid river for the sake of my family i wish we could invade the empire from there but i do not have the power to advocate for that strategically myrddin is more important
someday well take it back
thank you professor i will not give in not until i have restored my noble pride
taking it back would be difficult
yes i know it would be difficult but i will not give in
since im originally from the empire it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks fine by me honestly id bet theyre watching my every move to make sure i can be trusted
im sure theyre not 
if i were in charge its what i would do
probably
i knew it war makes people crazy huh
the airmid river separates the empire and alliance its the largest river in f√≥dlan sometimes itll flood when theres lots of rain but  at least the land gets some extra water
war isnt kind to you if youre a recluse by the time you realize whats going on youre already under attack and if youre off by yourself you can get killed with no one ever finding out
sounds like youre learning
i highly doubt that would happen
oh thatd be awful  just terrible ok professor i get it i know ill have to come out
were going to invade the empire which means well be fighting people we know wont we if were attacked by someone we know or used to think of as a friend is it permitted to run away
no its not ok
makes sense a commander running away would be terrible for morale
i wouldnt blame you
really if something happens will you keep me safe
if we can suppress this myrddin we can invade into the empire right i was in the empire now i will be an enemy  i am having strange feelings it is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy
i finally got to eat a full meal for the first time in forever and its all thanks to lord rodrigue ive got so much energy let me at that great bridge of myrddin ill bust it down myself oh but then how do we cross
the great bridge of myrddin isnt just a bridge it has the features of a fortress i believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the adrestian empire in other words its even older than the monastery so if we occupy the great bridge well have to search it from top to bottom
im sure you know this already but house ordelia is aligned with the empire they face the empire from across a river similar to the gloucesters even so i refuse to yield to the empire a second time the empire did unthinkable things to my family and to me the only option here is winning professor you must promise we will overcome the empire
my adoptive father is planning on supporting the riegan family in the upcoming operation he says its the perfect opportunity to get both the alliance and the kingdom on his side he even insisted that i promote the good name of house edmund to the people of the kingdom
have you managed to do that
no  im not very good at this sort of thing
do you really need to promote them
hell see right through me if i lie so i cant ignore the request 
but i suppose i did just tell you so that must count for something
claude says hes on our side i know everything will be fine if we leave it to him he may act like a layabout but hes actually smart and although claude isnt honest about some things you can trust him when it counts
youre not calming my nerves
no im sure itll be fine thats just my gut feeling but still
yeah im not worried
yeah hell do us proud thats just my gut feeling but still
lord rodrigue seems reliable but even with his help arent we still a little shorthanded we can probably make it to the great bridge of myrddin but beyond that i dont know dont let dimitri push you too much professor itll shorten your life for sure
so the renowed shield of faerghus is now on our side that is quite reassuring not only will he provide valuable support in battle but he has also brought us much needed supplies we cannot grow complacent however we must take the imperial capital as soon as possible
being here brings back all manner of memories the days i spent studying here with you and everyone else  those days were so special to me they truly were some of the warmest days of my life i hold them dear in my heart and now to be forced to fight with those i was once so close to my friends  it is most saddening
the battle at ailell was a tactical marvel you grow stronger with each passing day where does your talent end and your crests power begin are they one and the same i wonder most intriguing yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions given the situation it is quite unfortunate i did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out so much unknown now i fear i will not have those answers even by conflicts end so very frustrating
oh hello there professor did you need something from me it doesnt look like youre wounded or anything you just looking for someone to talk to
yes
i thought so well im here for you making you feel better is my top priority
no
come on now you dont have to be shy helping you feel better is important to me
whether its physical pain or worries of the heart you can come to me for anything professor
house fraldarius is a military house they swore fealty to the royal family at the kingdoms founding the current family head lord rodrigue was raised like a brother to the former king he harbors a loyalty that goes beyond mere duty perhaps that is why he was willing to lend us his aid
i thought house fraldarius had an invasion of their own to worry about im impressed lord rodrigue was willing to provide us all these reinforcements and supplies the knights morale is really boosted seeing as they have had their first good meal in a while lets hope we can keep this up and take down the great bridge of myrddin
gwendal made the ultimate sacrifice in service of house rowe i understand that feeling id do anything for lady rhea
but  
you think we should have stopped him you might be right about that
i understand it too
im surprised i didnt peg you as the kind of person to say that sort of thing
at any rate its up to the individual how to demonstrate loyalty
so house riegan accepted i knew the leader of the alliance wouldnt refuse still we cant let our guard down theres no telling when hell turn on us if we advance through the alliance into the empire our chances for reconnaissance will be limited i just hope it goes according to plan
lady rhea must be so scared we gotta find her quick as we can we got reinforcements from the kingdom people now right then we oughta be able to go save her
even after all these decades the academy hasnt changed a bit i remember it well even now i used to sneak out of lectures with lambert almost every day  i suppose this is not the time for an old mans nostalgia we have received approval from house riegan we should set out as soon as youre ready
greetings professor nothing to report lord rodrigue is revered by all as the shield of faerghus i was imagining a more stern faced fellow but hes actually quite friendly shocking i heard that he recently spent the night drinking in the dining hall with soldiers from the church 
our scout has returned as expected there are quite a few imperial soldiers stationed there
i see so the enemy has prepared for our arrival  it matters not i will kill them all whether they are one or one hundred
thats not necessary
dont say such things 
what would you do if you saw the people who stole everything from you if you saw them right before your eyes living carefree lives and feeling no guilt would you feel nothing do nothing five years ago  did you not deem the woman who killed jeralt to be unforgivable i am most certain that you did you couldnt let her get away with her crime so you took up your sword in pursuit
youre wrong
i think not were the same you and i
youre right
precisely my point were the same you and i
youre wasting your time theres nothing to be gained from exchanging words with a boar that has lost its mind
felix 
this is war every last one of us has lost someone we care for but we choose to suppress our anger and go right on living do you know why
because weve given up
revenge cant bring the dead back to life unfortunately such a thing isnt possible hanging onto your anger like the boar here is futile
because its pointless
thats right all the boar is accomplishing is stacking up more corpses
tell me felix  if the dead are beyond reach is it not also pointless to mourn or even bury those who are lost
ha that mind of yours im done here remember professor its not compassion for this fool that has brought our army so far there are those of us who despise the empire and those who side with the church if we keep running down this path its only a matter of time before the ground beneath us collapses
thats enough felix
hmph youre a damned fool old man
the soldiers are ready to march on your command
then lets move out at once every moment counts
understood lets show those empire dastards the power of the knights of faerghus
intent on the imperial capital the kingdom army goes around the oghma mountains and marches through alliance territory as they continue south but this route takes them through the territory of house gloucester  imperial supporters  so they request help from claude the leader of house riegan claude agrees to to distract house gloucesters soldiers and the kingdom army marches onward toward the great bridge of myrddin to cross the airmid river which separates the alliance and the empire
after fending off the empire your forces decide its time to advance but first you must capture the great bridge of myrddin a strategic crossing point over the airmid river which borders the alliance and the empire
that symbol its an enemy raid stay calm and face them head on send a messenger to acheron immediately if were quick we might be able to pull off a pincer attack
edelgards dog huh all the more reason to kill her
attack ladislava and take the bridge shall we begin
lets deal with the enemies protecting the fortress quickly and take control of this area
enemies approaching get the soldiers standing by to join the fight we may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too protect the fortress
you think well let you take this bridge form us
this is no good  reinforcements keep coming and more will soon join them
your highness apologies for the late arrival
dedue  youre alive  how
we can discuss it later for now allow me to join your forces
i lorenz hellman gloucester have arrived to join the battle in my fathers stead
well ally ourselves with the imperial soldiers too
thanks for making your way here annihilate the enemy with the rest of them
is that the professor why would someone like that join such a senseless fight
lorenz here you are i am heading south so i will leave this area to you
acheron nows the time to show your loyalty to the empire attack the enemy from behind
ive got to make her name known to her majesty through distinguished service
acheron a minor lord of the alliance territory  if hes fighting for the empire weve no choice but to attack him
as they say if you cant beat them join them im not in for a beating am i
argh  i never should have allied with  the empire 
to repay her majestys favor i will not let you pass
i cant retreat  even if it costs me my life ive got to protect the great bridge
lady edelgard  im sorry 
ladislava no i will protect this area
after this battle i will be known far and wide as the legendary ferdinand of adrestia
edelgard has always been obsessed with you i am a little envious to be frank i will just have to impress her with my skills on the battlefield
oh ferdie you opposed edie for so long  i had real hopes for you you know now youre following her is that your duty as a noble follow your master when they say to heel
i will not try to explain my duty or hers you would not understand i wish you could anyway no time for idle chitchat
retreat ladislava tell her majesty about this
weve already sent a messenger i cant let you die while i flee
in that case  even if i die you must protect this area
even if i die please  protect this area
to oppose the empire at a time like this would be entirely too reckless
its been a while professor if this were anywhere but a battlefield i would offer you tea ive no choice but to follow the empire if i wish to live i hope you will not think ill of me
lay me to rest in a manner that is befitting of the nobility 
i yield though i will not beg for my life that would be unbecoming wouldnt it
youre inviting me to join you but to abandon house gloucester  no  i can convince my father i will help you topple the empire i swear it
its a farce all of it 
dedue why how are you here you died five years ago 
i was saved by my brothers men of duscur
those people you were with  they were of duscur and they saved you
your highness i asked that you fulfill your long held desire did i not allow me to once again act as your sword and shield please let me witness your triumph i want to behold the moment your wish is finally granted
dedue  of course and in exchange i ask that you swear something to me here and now do not ever throw your life away again understood
your highness  understood
idiots embracing death for the sake of that woman truly foolish 
arent you happy we won
what troubles you
i  i dont know
do you regret killing them
they were just beasts with human faces i had no choice but to kill them and so i did that that is all there is to it
its about time you two returned we must discuss our next course of action
please i need to join you no matter the cost
im sorry but my hands are tied 
by the goddess whats with all the commotion
gasps
what is this girl doing here this is an army not an orphanage
i believe shes from a nearby village she keeps insisting that she needs to join our ranks
and you thought we could use a child on the front lines hurry up and take her back to her parents
my family is gone i dont have anywhere else to go please i can use magic and i can fight i can cook do laundry anything
im sure there are plenty of more suitable places to find work why are you so fixated on this army young lady
i need to get revenge i must strike down the one who murdered my big brother
your highness  what should we do
let her do as she pleases
thank you very much
/***EOF***/
the kingdom army has captured fort merceus managing troops from the now stable western kingdom and former alliance territory the kingdom army returns to garreg mach to regroup and reorganize its forces with sufficient might to challenge the empire the kingdom army finalizes their plans to march on enbarr the imperial capital
ah there you are his highness was looking for you
where is he
hes gone ahead and started interrogating the prisoner viscount kleimans man he said hed like for you and i to be present as well will you come with me
i cannot overlook your reckless remarks are you really so keen to lose your head
i only did what i believed was right i swear to the goddess that im not lying amidst the turmoil of the tragedy lady patricia was supposed to be the only one who was unharmed we had been given orders ahead of time to not approach her carriage 
was patricia an accomplice
of course not what would my stepmother have had to gain from such a 
perhaps lady patricia would have done anything to return to the empire to her husband and daughter
what exactly are you implying
for the past few months ive been spying on lords who defected to the empire in order to investigate rumors about lady patricia cornelias words were true the two of them  i am afraid they conspired together after all
enough of this nonsense you say she wished to return home that isnt nearly enough reason to cause such a tragedy
 i do not intend to imply that the two of them were solely responsible for the whole affair there were likely nobles who opposed the king or potentially someone who wanted to throw the kingdom into chaos the empire and people like solon and kronya had their motives too
so my stepmother joined with them to cause the tragedy  is that what you believe
ultimately this is just conjecture based on the evidence at hand i have no idea what their true intentions were
i see we will hear what this man has to say for now 
my lord had long felt that king lamberts radical ways were dangerous at the time he was approached with an offer to take part in the incident at duscur  my lord loves his homeland to me he embodied justice we were only doing what we thought was right
and so in the name of justice he caused massacre upon massacre out of love for his homeland you murdered your own king killed our soldiers and involved innocent citizens and yet you have the gall to speak of justice
i am only standing before you now because i could no longer bear the weight of my sins
did you share those feelings about your homeland
yes  i believe i do
do you regret your actions
no i accept your hatred and even the punishment of death but i still believe it was a massacre in the name of justice
gilbert lock this man in his cell
are you not going to kill him
i will make that decision once i have had time to consider this mans definition of justice
yes your highness
 
are you ok
no  i cannot say that i am tell me professor  how well do you remember your father jeralt
not very well
i figured as much even the memory of those who pass away is taken from those they left behind little by little year by year
very well
soon enough you will come to understand how painful it is to forget the faces of those who have passed on
to be honest i cannot really remember my stepmothers that womans smile nor the sound of her voice i always told myself that i would not allow my mind to forget and yet all i can recall with clarity is her gazing away so forlorn did my stepmother wish to go home so badly that she would kill father and me kill her false family home to her own blood her true family
theres no way to know for sure
i dont have those answers
i suppose it doesnt make any difference now i am asking you questions you could not possibly know the answer to i am finished with thoughts like that i am finally able to go on living without clinging to hate if i truly treasure those who have died then i must earnestly atone for my sins father glenn all of the soldiers who have fallen  the people of duscur who still suffer persecution  the only atonement i can offer them now is to take responsibility for this broken kingdom that has been entrusted to me
thats true
take responsibility for the kingdom 
that is why i feel that i must meet with edelgard and try to talk to her do you think its a fools errand honestly  i think so too but i must swallow my feelings and grudges our whole history really and ask her about this future that she sees what she aims for once her domination is complete what kind of justice she clings to as she fights and why she felt it necessary to start this war  i believe that asking her these things is the true responsibility i have been tasked with as king
how will you accomplish this
we will march our troops to the imperial capital but before any battle begins we will set up camp nearby and send a messenger i will tell her that i need to speak with her in a safe place without any weapons or troops as to whether or not she will agree to my request  well that rests solely on edelgard
im certain shell agree
i would like to believe that as well you know professor  when we fought in fhirdiad cornelia mocked me and called me pitiful but even if it is true that my stepmother never loved me i am not to be pitied after all i have allies and dear friends who care for me and now i also have you by my side
our next battlefield will be the imperial capital there will be no turning back if you have any unfinished business here you had best settle it before we depart
theres not enough time
i apologize but youll have to make do with the time you have we cannot afford a delay
leave it to me
i knew i could count on you good luck
i believe in you but please ensure that his highness survives as well f√≥dlans future would be in peril if we lost him i would not be able to go on
leave it to me
thank you
i understand
good
he intends to speak to the emperor shes his stepsister i know but this seems risky
its important
pah i know that
youre against it
no im not im sure hes thought it through
if the two can settle this diplomatically that would be the best way out of this mess no more bloodshed lets just hope he doesnt become so overwhelmed with emotion that hes unable to strike her down  should the need arise
returning to the monastery brings back so many memories from five years ago hard to believe we only spent a year together here so much happened that it felt a lot longer than that but it was so exciting and so much fun honestly i think those memories are whats kept me fighting this long what was that year like for you professor
it was a lot of fun
i dont think i could ask for a better answer
it was challenging
ah yeah there were a lot of hard times too
lets all do our best to survive this so we can come back here when its all over i know thats what ill be doing
ive been thinking about how weve got our own ideas about justice and so does the empire and whats coming its not just a battle between us and them its our ideals that are fighting whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong and i get it thats how it goes  but nobodys willing to talk or compromise so well fight to the death to prove the other guys wrong it wont be an easy battle but lets make sure we come back alive right professor
well be heading for the capital soon so much rests on this moment will the war really be over if we take the capital
it might not end right away
youre probably right but well get there eventually
definitely
yay im sure it wont end right away but thats still great news
i truly believe that a peaceful future is waiting at the end of all this
i hope this is the final battle dont you professor when the war is over everyone will be busy with their own lives  but lets all meet up again someday right here at garreg mach you his highness my father our monastery friends the knights everyone
thats a great idea
it was just a silly whim i had but i really love it
i wonder if thats possible 
all that matters is whether we choose to make it happen i really hope that we do
ooh and ill bake a bunch of desserts for it reunion sweets all we have to do now is win lets get to it professor
im so glad you were assigned to the blue lion house professor we made it this far thanks to your guidance and leadership theres a bitter fight ahead   that much is certain you have my lance
were counting on you
we will prevail
yes lets do this together
professor at last the end is nigh i love the empire part of me wants it to survive but i know that is not reasonable the empires time has come the kingdom is battle scarred the alliance is in tatters  people must be terrified the world is crumbling around them what we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild f√≥dlan and rule it as a single nation nonetheless it saddens me that we will not have an adrestian emperor 
when you think of it as one approaches the end of a war the sacrifices only grow larger dont they the winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow  while those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor neither side will give i only wish wed consider those who lose their lives in that struggle
were far from being safe ourselves
yes exactly my point lets be careful to ensure we dont lose our lives professor
its a necessary sacrifice
perhaps but that doesnt make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice
its better than dragging the war out
i can appreciate that but just because a choice is better does not mean that its good
its such a relief that weve made it this far without having to fight my father
youll have to face him at some point
are you trying to scare me what if he turns up while were charging the capital
it sounds like youre scared
you bet im scared the imperial army hasnt lost a single battle with my father on the field
but still i wonder whatll happen to him if we win 
professor my um mother might be in the city i dont have many good memories of her if im being honest but shes dearer to me than my father if you happen to see her please make sure shes not caught up in all the fighting shes only a civil servant so hopefully she takes a cue from her bernie and stays inside
i keep thinking the war is near its end then it isnt  when can we finally put this dreadful war behind us
lets end it with the next battle
that would be wonderful imagine the last moment of combat then peace it sounds like a fairy tale i want to make this a world where there is no fighting where children can grow up happy and safe
there can be no end to war
i suppose youre right  but we should still try to make the world a place where children can grow up happy and safe
five years ago  edelgard said a thing to me brigid is a vassal of the empire but she also said i always have the freedom to be choosing whether i am with or not with her i will become the ruler of brigid so she said i must make my own path so now my path and her path will be colliding
at last weve come to the final confrontation ruin to the empire glory to faerghus of course to be perfectly honest i would have much preferred to march against the empire at the head of the alliance but i suppose i have claude to thank for denying me that satisfaction dont i
were heading up to enbarr next i hope i make it back safe so i can tell my little sis about it i hear they got a neat opera house there where manuela used to perform what was it called again
mitreflanc opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
mittelfrank opera company
ah thats the one
mildewplank opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
my little sis always goes on about how much shed like to see them perform i know we cant see a show but do you think we could at least see the building
were about to put the finishing touches on this war i wonder how f√≥dlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction i cant wait to see it on the other hand im terrified of what the future might hold who knows if ill survive the assault on the capital
wanting so desperately to speak with edelgard just as were about to fight  could it be that the prince is having doubts about killing her
i dont think so
then perhaps it is okay
its only a formality
i suppose theyre the only ones who fully understand the extent of their relationship
hes certainly changed from the vengeful person he once was i dont mean that in a bad way im actually relieved a king whos responsible for f√≥dlans future cant exact personal vendettas and have a cold heart
dear goddess 
praying again
yes  i was praying for your safety
what are you praying for
um for your safety
ill do all i can to survive but please please dont die out there professor
fighting in the capital ugh and were fighting against edelgard double ugh but with you leading us professor i know well win yeah wahoo fighting im a little scared to be honest im just shouting to relieve the tension but ill be fine
at last its time to face the flame emperor  edelgard i know that the future of all f√≥dlan rests on this battle nothing else is more important but for me this is personal for captain jeralts sake im going to give it all ive got and more
rhea will be somewhere in the city i wonder if she can sense us coming the battle will soon be upon us let us both be at our best for what is to come
i was born in enbarr my mother and father met in the church there not too long after i was brought into the world i do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place it is most regrettable
enbarrs streets are paved with unhappy memories professor ive avoided the damned place since i abandoned my nobility swore never to return now here we are to return in this manner  well i cant say it is something i ever imagined especially as im returning to end the empire what a strange feeling breaking ones history
life can be tough you know but if youve got your friends to help you through it can be a lot easier maybe you butt heads sometimes but thats ok thats how you build bonds right and ive got friends professor plenty of those its true love that seems to have passed me by
you should relax
relax im relaxed
theres still hope
but where is my true love to be found where is my ray of hope
time to give up
yeah  im starting to figure thats the most realistic option
at this point im just hoping you stay single too then at least we can share each others misery
it matters not how just our cause may be in the end war is nothing more than organized murder i understand the desire to reach a conclusion but we mustnt overlook the sins inherent in our deeds
i am well aware
i understand of course
heh sorry i have a tendency to preach we have lost so much and in return we have taken much from our enemies i pray we can put an end to this cycle of violence
here we are facing the final battle with the empire its been a long difficult struggle we have to get lady rhea back and we have to crush the empire in the name of captain jeralt hes watching over us now protecting us i know he is
looks like were nearing the end of this struggle im sure lady rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her
probably
 i was just kidding pay me no mind
i doubt it
oof  you dont mince your words try being a bit more mindful of other peoples feelings
lady rhea is not waiting for me i know no matter how much i might wish she were shes waiting for you
ten years ago dagda and brigid attacked the empire from the west their final target was the capital but they were countered at a port town long before they reached their destination we spent a lot of time going back and forth but at least we made it this far
whenever i think about how well be seeing lady rhea real soon i get happy and really get cleaning well get there for sure right well see her again
well meet her for sure
we dont know for sure
i just gotta believe lady rhea is waiting for us in the capital  we just have to find her
seems like the war is gonna end soon once the dust settles itll be back to rolling in fat stacks of gold for me
greetings professor nothing to report momentums really picking up for this final battle huh even im starting to feel tense me enbarrs history goes back 1400 years that even predates the founding of the empire its one of the sacred sites of the seiros faith so its a pretty big deal but hey no need to worry about the monastery while youre fighting the final battle ive got it covered ill defend it to my last
professor do you think edelgard will show up
she will
well well its been a long time professor and hello to you too dimitri
i doubt it
sorry to disappoint you professor
edelgard i did not think you would actually accept my request
call it a whim well then what did you want to talk about
i will get straight to the point why did you start this war there had to be a way to change things in your territory without the need for so many senseless casualties
it may be hard to believe but this is the way that leads to the fewest casualties in the end dont you see
how could i countless people have already lost their lives in this conflict
the longer we took to revolt the more victims this crooked world would have claimed i weighed the victims of war against the victims of the world as it is now and i chose the former i believe that i have chosen the best path the only path
even after seeing the faces of those who have suffered the ravages of war you would still force them to throw their lives away for the future you are obsessively devoted to this war and deaf to the screams of its victims you cannot change the cycle of the strong dominating the weak with a method like that
youre wrong that very cycle is exactly what i have devoted my life and my power to destroying if after all of this you believe the weak will still be weak that is only because they are too used to relying on others instead of on themselves
yes perhaps someone as strong as you are can claim something like that but you cannot force that belief onto others people arent as strong as you think they are there are those who cannot live without their faith and those who cannot go on once they have lost their reason for living your path will not be able to save them it is the path of the strong and so it could only benefit the strong
heh so you consider me strong do you even if one clings to their faith the goddess will never answer them countless souls will be lost that way living without purpose and i can be counted among those who have died that way as well but thats why i must change this world on behalf of the silent and weak
and do you intend to become a goddess yourself will you steal the power to take action from the broken hearted masses you claim to defend the ones who can truly change the way of the world are not the rulers but the people pushing your own sense of justice and your own ideals onto even one other person is no more than self righteousness
maybe it is self righteousness but it doesnt matter someone has to take action and put a stop to this worlds endless blood stained misery
do you not believe in the power of people to join together and rise up humans are weak creatures but they are also creatures who help each other support each other and together find the right path i have learned that humans are capable of all that from the professor and from everyone in my life
i doubt a highborn person like yourself could know how the poor feel or what motivates them
this is nonsense thought im finally starting to understand how you feel but that makes it even clearer to me that we can never fully understand each other
i feel the same i finally understand what you believe is right
good bye dimitri
wait edelgard there is something i must give you
this is for you use it to cut a path to the future you wish for and i will rise up to meet you there el
 
el so its true  youre really going away going back home
theres nothing i can do about it its all happening so fast  im as surprised as you are
el  um  here i want you to have this
el listen to me no matter how hard things get you cant give in ok youve got to cut a path to the future you wish for no matter what
its a dagger why would you give me something like this
oh um  im sorry i couldnt think of anything better to give you
edelgard what are you doing its time to go hurry and get in the carriage
oh i  im sorry uncle i have to go now  good bye dimitri
i i remember now you gave me a dagger all those years ago
heh im still sorry about that i should have given you something that wouldve made you happier
perhaps at the time i was quite flustered by such a dangerous gift i left without giving you a proper response and that was the last time we saw each other
true it is a sweet memory with a bitter ending
im afraid it will do no good to reminisce dimitri that girl you knew back then is gone as good as dead but ill tell you now what i wasnt able to tell you back then thank you my dear forgotten friend because of you i never lost my heart as for the future that will be decided in battle king of faerghus as the emperor i shall await your arrival in enbarr
 
the kingdom army having gathered new troops and significant strength commences its march towards the imperial capital of enbarr in response to their movements emperor edelgard orders her trusted retainer hubert to the front lines to meet the kingdom army head on the two forces clash in the city streets
with fort merceus conquered its time to approach enbarr the imperial capital imperial forces stand ready in the city streets intending to resist to the bitter end
the gates to the imperial capital have been broken all troops storm in the emperor is within reach
the imperial troops are dug in across the city lets cut through them and carve a route to the palace
heh the savior king arrives hands red with blood lets give him a royal welcome artillery once the enemy is in range fire at will reinforcements will fly in shortly keep your focus and hold steady until they arrive
reinforcements should be here soon lets draw them in  just like we planned
draw them toward the opera house reinforcements will be here any moment
has it really been so long since i was in that opera house couldnt have imagined any of this back then
the battle is nearing the opera house i hope everyone in the company is safe
that church  it looks familiar i believe that is where my parents first met
ah that church ive such memories of that place from a time before i was seteth 
war is for the wealthy we dont even have enough to eat  im sure the goddess wont punish us for a little bit of thievery here and there 
more reinforcements eh and this time it looks like a fair number  it would be best if we could take them down from a safe distance  is there any way we could neutralize the cannons or catapults
the battle is nearing the opera house i hope everyone in the company is safe
oh that face brings back some memories its a shame we dont have time to catch up
manuela its not like you to show up anywhere sober whats the occasion
i thought maybe we could talk i could help you see the error of your ways or we could just try to kill each other over what we believe in you ready to do this
no  but lets get to it
if its our destiny to kill each other then i cannot will not respect the goddess my only request is that if you win youll at least have the decency to kill me quickly
edelgard forgive me  i cant 
so dorothea has been defeated we will need to thin their numbers as well or else if house varleys troops arrive in time we may be able to flank the kingdoms army 
so theyve stopped our reinforcements we will need to thin their numbers as well or else if house varleys troops arrive in time we may be able to flank the kingdoms army 
for adrestia and for brigid i will be defeating all of you
professor  i have been thinking about why i came to f√≥dlan to the empire i am here to be protecting edelgard and to be stopping you
i cannot bring myself to kill you  youre a princess of brigid a hostage of the empire
that was the truth in the past but it is a different truth now shamir  i am  the will of the emperor
in that case i wont hold back
edelgard  i will not be keeping my promise  give me forgiveness please 
its almost a shame to kill you not even death will make you consequential
i should have disposed of you a long time ago i will rectify that failure here
running into you in the capital like this i have to say its almost sentimental
hubert she must leave
you really think you can make her
it does not matter what i think those are my orders
hubert i would tell you to get out of my way but i highly doubt that you would abide
heh your silver tongue will do you no good here this is not your path to tread
that is not your decision to make nor is it mine all i can do is blaze ahead
we must place our faith in her majesty  her victory is everything 
its over  the way to the palace is clear lets move
send your platoons to capture enbarr there is to be no needless killing or pillaging understand
yes your highness
edelgard awaits us we will advance our main forces straight to the palace
weve finally made it here
we can win this
yes it has truly been a long war and we have only made it this far because of you  actually no i will save that sentiment for after we win this battle we will advance our troops and confront her we must strike down the emperor and end this war
my life is yours your highness
lets win this and go back home in victory ill do the very best i can
on my honor as a knight i will not lose
i know the goddess is watching over us lets be sure to return home safely all of us
as a citizen of faerghus i will fight with everything i have
heh heh heh is this what a do or die situation looks like you had best give it your all too general
the path to the emperor is open fulfill your duty as our king
go and win be the boar you are and dont you dare look back
lets go
yes i will  no we will win this together everyone move out
the time has nearly come
yes the anomaly should present itself shortly however 
theres no reason to fret besides its far too late to second guess now assume your position i cant promise your safety if you remain here
very well
ugh  this pain is nothing compared to what i have already suffered 
/***EOF***/
it is imperial year 1185 nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at garreg mach and war continues to plague the lands of f√≥dlan fhirdiad has been captured the holy kingdom of faerghus is in shambles the leicester alliance is on the verge of collapse fractured by two opposing factions those who support the adrestian empire and its ruler and those who seek her demise meanwhile under emperor edelgards rule of law the adrestian empire continues to expand its reach the path to a new f√≥dlan unified by imperial strength may yet be in sight
you  how long do you intend to sleep your body is awake your eyes must open now and you must find the strength to stand upon those legs of yours like so much rain a pool of blood has fallen to the ground  as spears and arrows pierce the earth it weeps and even now it weeps in order to survive they kill and so the people of this world are lost in an abyss of suffering they weep as well the only one who truly knows the nature of such things is i  or rather you
im still sleepy
you are a complete and utter fool have you not changed one bit
who
excuse me are you saying you have forgotten who i am how dare you
get on your feet right now ill coddle you no more you are just like a child always needing me to hold your hand 
hey a are you awake
where am i
were in a village at the base of the monastery what are you doing in a place like this
who are you
im just a villager here what are you doing in a place like this
i honestly didnt expect to find someone floating away down the river  garreg mach is upstream of here but that place was abandoned
what do you mean
huh you dont know the church of seiros isnt there anymore though there have been some folks still living there in the five years since  well you know anyway ive heard some thieves have been spotted around those parts these days
five years
what year is it
um are you feeling all right you didnt hit your head or anything did you its the ethereal moon of the year 1185 its been nearly five years since the monastery fell tomorrow was supposed to be the millennium festival but whos got time to think about things like that
the millennium festival 
uh yeah thats what i said but with the war and the archbishop still missing and all  i doubt theres a soul to be found who has enough blessings worth counting hey slow down will ya where do you think youre going
the monastery
are you crazy i told ya they say thieves are running amok up there and theres plenty of other dangers too i heard a rumor that imperial troops went up there to investigate and got slaughtered every last one come on i promise i wont say youre a coward just forget about going anywhere near the monastery
you just remember i tried to stop you got it its not on my conscience if you wind up dead
my students are waiting for me
students you really are crazy arent you there arent any kids anywhere near that place anymore unbelievable 
no need to worry about me
unbelievable 
i should have known that one day you would be haunting me as well
you  what must i do to be rid of you i will kill that woman i swear it do not look upon me with scorn in your eyes
what are you talking about
everything will be ok
  you  it cant be youre alive hmph if that is the case  that can only mean you are another imperial spy did you come here to kill me answer the question
of course not
ungh 
im glad youre safe
am i
 
what have you been doing the last five years
i have been dead more or less
why do you say that
what do you hope to gain asking me that there are more important matters at hand 
 
do you not smell them filthy rats everywhere and traces of those who were here long ago and thieves crawling from the woodwork attracted by the promise of treasure heh  since the monastery fell order in the area fell right along with it you must have seen the state of the town near garreg mach on your way here vile thieves run rampant they pillage and loot to their hearts content i must kill them every last one its time to hunt down their nest
what do you plan to do
i told you i will kill them all
even thieves are just trying to survive 
it doesnt matter what their reasons are
we dont have to kill them to stop them
they must die
someone must put a stop to this cycle of the strong trampling the weak or do you condone their actions do you believe that the pillaging and slaughtering those rats live for is justified it is reprehensible and they must be put down i intend to give them a taste of the pain they have inflicted on others even if it means becoming a rat myself i swore to at least do that much  i will not let them down 
how many thieves are there
can just the two of us hope to prevail
it doesnt matter all that matters is killing those who deserve to die
good work i should have known to check the monastery lets move quickly
yes sir
dimitri  im on my way
in the holy kingdom of faerghus imperialist loyalist cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of blaiddyd to prevent further revolt prince dimitri has been sentenced now the backbone of the former kingdom houses gautier and fraldarius struggle to continue the resistance cornelia operating out of the royal palace has accepted the support of the empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining kingdom forces
in the leicester alliance house riegan leads an anti imperial faction while house gloucester directs the empires supporters despite the undeniable threat of fracture the alliances adept new leader claude deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front
in enbarr the imperial capital of the adrestian empire emperor edelgard fights to strengthen her regime she has extended her reach to the kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western f√≥dlan
in the meantime the knights of seiros have been dispatched to find archbishop rhea who remains missing despite their searching left unattended the monastery at garreg mach has fallen to ruin and become a haven for thieves
it smells of blood and sewage seems ive found their nest
what the  intruders protect the goods
shall we go rat hunting dont let a single vermin escape
his highness and  professor we must speak later
i know its been five years but i never expected the monastery to end up like this
oh i havent seen any of you in such a long time im so glad to see youre alive
well help out from here its over thieves
why  why are you here
the monastery has become a nest of thieves
professor youre alive after all but first things first lets defeat these thieves
ill lend a hand well catch up later
listen up we must end this quickly
there are openings to the north and south well split into two and tear them apart
we promised five years ago wed meet here and now
getting to see you and everyone else again makes having to leave my family feel less difficult
long time no see professor i always knew in my heart that wed meet again
where have you been the last five years i was worried about you and then i was just sad
professor has it really been five years youre as pretty as ever and thats the only thing that matters
im glad we could meet again professor itll be nice to fight alongside each other just like old times
fancy meeting you here a welcome surprise
no im not the one you want gah i guess ive got no choice
ah you should yield me a tidy profit
i have no longer any reason to be here good bye and be well
damn it we failed to kill him 
i thought it would be easy money  maybe it wasnt meant to be 
 
it isnt looking good for us should we retreat
you didnt plan on letting him get away did you
your highness professor im so glad youre both safe 
why are you here
did you forget we all made a promise here on this very day five years ago
dimitri werent you the one who asked that we all meet up here
dont be silly of course you remember our promise thats why you and the professor are here right
your highness  i have been following news of your whereabouts for a while now i am relieved to have finally found you
do not call me that i am not a prince but a walking corpse
why would you say that
that is what we all believed but it is not so i can see with my own eyes that you are alive your highness but the jail cells in fhirdiad are as solid as they come how did you manage to 
dedue
what happened
hes dead he died in my place
i see we will be sure to honor his loyalty your highness as for the state of the kingdom the lords from the western regions have declared their fealty to the empire starting with house rowe cornelias band of traitors now refers to kingdom territory as the faerghus dukedom theyve made fhirdiad their stronghold as they continue to invade the eastern region
traitors
there is much to tell you i will explain everything in time
cornelia
she is a mage who has served in the royal family for more than 20 years there is much to tell you i will explain everything in time
well its not like all of the kingdoms lords have sided with the empire there are plenty of houses like mine and felixs that remain stubbornly opposed
your highness please allow us to take up arms at your side once more what we need more than anything isnt soldiers money or supplies we need the legitimate heir of faerghus to overthrow the empire and reclaim the kingdom such is your duty it is yours alone to bear and well worth fighting for only you can gather our troops and lead us back into the light
you are still needed dimitri
i see so you all agree that we must fight back and you see how that woman how the empire cannot be forgiven that we must wipe them all out until not a single one of them remains 
wipe them all out umm i dont think any of us here are suggesting anything that extreme 
  professor  there is something i would like to ask you please join me inside the monastery
to think you survived under all that rubble for the past five years  i suppose stranger things have happened odd as that is to admit there is still much i would like to ask you  but i think thats enough for now
is rhea safe
where are the knights of seiros
on that day five years ago during the battle with the imperial army lady rhea went missing since then the knights of seiros have continued searching for her and for you i hear they have yet to find any promising leads as the empire has yet to release a statement its hard to imagine that she has perished and yet  ah never mind once news of your survival gets out everyone will flock back to the monastery
what happened to the kingdom
after that battle a certain incident took place in fhirdiad rufus who was serving as king regent was murdered i was once a knight in service of the royal family  i resigned from the knights of seiros and returned to serve the kingdom however 
this is madness you truly claim that his highness is the one who killed rufus
oh but its true the only one who could slip past the bodyguards and kill so efficiently is the young prince you cant deny it
rufus is prince dimitris uncle his highness is incapable of such an atrocious crime as murdering his own blood
ah but they were never very close were they its a well known fact amongst former retainers there are even rumors that rufus was originally involved in the tragedy of duscur  perhaps his highness believed those rumors and murdered rufus in a fit of rage but im afraid none of that matters now
cornelia do not tell me that you 
the decision has been made his highness will pay for his crime with his head his sentence will be carried out the day after tomorrow on that day the royal bloodline will come to an end all you have left to do is sit back and watch you senile old fool watch as the kingdom you love falls to ashes
it was soon after announced that his sentence had been carried out with his highnesss death the royal bloodline of house blaiddyd was erased from this world true to her word all we could do was watch as she tore the kingdom apart before our eyes since the execution and the princes corpse were concealed from the public there have always been those who believed his highness was still alive  as for myself i only began to hope three years ago when i chanced upon some compelling rumors 
what rumors
an imperial platoon attacked without warning incident after incident of imperial generals being slaughtered in kingdom territory it is said that each died in such a brutal gruesome way that it is hard to imagine they were killed by human hands
i followed the rumors to location after location eventually i had seen enough i knew the rumors were true finally after a half decade of torment it happened i found him 
i fear his deep hatred and the weight of his solitude have consumed him for far too long  we must bring him back from the edge on which he stands
to that end i must speak with his highness i imagine it will not be a quick or easy conversation i pray that he is of a mind to speak of such things i am certain that my words will  never mind what must be done must be done i would wager that you are weary after the days events perhaps you should take this opportunity to get some rest
/***EOF***/
when claude steps down as its leader the leicester alliance disbands and its lords swear fealty to the holy kingdom of faerghus the chaos in the kingdom begins to dissipate as the people unite under dimitris rule riding this momentum the kingdom army prepares to march south for a decisive battle against imperial forces
we will finally have our decisive battle with the empire this month
the eastern lords are in the process of consolidating all of the troops within the entire kingdom
in addition ever since arianrhods liberation the western lords have been declaring their fealty one after another
affairs within the kingdom have calmed down considerably and we even managed to win over the alliance
although it was a rough go at first im starting to feel like we could actually win this
thats true thinking back on it now weve really come a long way
we even have a lead to where rhea is located it is as we predicted all along if we are to rescue rhea then we must defeat the emperor 
um if were going to march from the monastery to enbarr then well have to cross the great bridge of myrddin again right
yes i believe so as we have gained the alliances support we should not have any trouble this time after the bridge we can head across gronder field and head south and then well take merceus the so called impregnable fortress that towers on the other side
an impregnable fortress
fort merceus  i know of it they say it rivals even arianrhod
 fort merceus is praised as the strongest defense in the empire
count bergliez the empires minister of military affairs once had troops stationed there but according to our spies a large scale force has entered the stronghold perhaps they are gathering soldiers from various regions to compensate for their losses
should we try to avoid it
if we try to avoid it those troops will follow us and attack from the rear it is best for us to handle the situation head on
can we really prevail
it is unlike you to worry so but i feel we have no choice but to strip that place of its impregnable reputation
once we take fort merceus enbarr will be within reach this is the empires last chance to stop us from arriving at our goal
in other words if we take this fort then our blades will at the emperors throat in no time
if this is the last fort between us and them then the emperor will likely do everything she can to strengthen its defenses
i just received a report on that very subject the one commanding the troops stationed at fort merceus is someone we have crossed blades with many times it is the death knight who awaits us there
oh  so thats who well be battling  emile 
from this point onward were in all out war with the empire are you prepared professor
i am
i am glad to hear it that means we can approach the coming battles with peace of mind
are you
i have already steeled myself as best i can
first we capture fort merceus the fighting will be undoubtedly be brutal but  we must prevail as far as this army and i are concerned youre our last ray of hope we are relying on you
claude has stepped down from leadership and leicester is now a vassal state of faerghus the lords of the western kingdom are beginning to declare fealty to us in greater numbers also the empire is our only remaining enemy
we defeated lord arundel the emperor must have been surprised if we can keep up that fervor perhaps well capture fort merceus and move on to the imperial capital we must not be overconfident though
were going to win
youre optimistic
lets proceed with caution
yes i concur
human and beasts are ultimately the same when theyre cornered they lash out however they can they fight for their lives who knows how the emperor will lash out we have to be careful
i wonder where claude will go from the sound of it hes leaving f√≥dlan altogether he was strangely gallant about the whole thing even left his relic behind elusive and mysterious to the end isnt he
ya know professor laying a siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date first you get past her defenses then you make your move
thats not the best analogy
trust me i know what im talking about im a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing girls i mean ive never actually you know captured any keeps 
you might be right
see you get it our fearless leader on the other hand  hes never been good with the ladies
anyway i figure you go after the main gate you take that out and im sure we can win of course youre making the tactical calls im happier to follow than to lead
death knight  going to fight the death knight 
you seem concerned
hmm  to be perfectly honest i am 
youll be fine if you prepare yourself
youre right ill have to face him eventually
oh professor good timing you have to talk some sense into my father recently hes been doing nothing but work himself to the bone even when hes taking breaks from training and errands hes apparently listening to reports day in and day out hes getting on in years you know i just want him to take care of himself 
just as we suspected lady rhea was taken to the imperial capital we must get to the capital as quickly as possible so many people are worried sick about her  i do wonder when claude managed to learn lady rheas whereabouts hes pretty shrewd i cant help but admire him
the majority is with us this conflict will end soon i am so moved by the decision that claude and the alliance nobles have made that is true nobility acting in accordance with the peoples needs and wishes as war drags on those living near the front lines inevitably get the worse of it still edelgard will not give in she will push to complete her mission no matter how many people die not everyone with noble blood has noble ideals
attacking an impregnable fortress head on is rather impressive  or suicidal depends on the day really you know fort merceuss nickname i assume the stubborn old general it may be stubborn but its age means its got to be hiding a few weak spots makes sense to aim for those areas
fort merceus is next huh ah the memories its a huge stronghold in my fathers domain the towns completely surrounded by high walls i used to run around there when i was a kid  way back when the fortress was just a playground for me yeah those were the days
i love a good fortress   the perfect place to hide this ones impregnable too isnt it perfect as soon as we take it ill set up a special spot for bernie
if we can take it its not impregnable
i guess you have a point what would you call it then a little pregnable
its too big to make a good hiding place
now that you mention it i guess it is pretty huge
the leicester alliance is no more three hundred years of history gone and done they write operas about events like this you know
im sure theyll have a talented and beautiful songstress playing you and with dimitri at your side  well theyll probably contrive some kind of romance to keep things interesting
dimitri will be played by the most handsome actor of the time hearts will pound as he takes the stage what am i saying surely the most handsome man would play you
i have excitement in my heart for secret tactics i enjoy attacks that are surprising i thought we could be using attacks like that at this fortress but i am hearing a different thing a brute force attack with all of our power yes attacks that are surprising are also safer attacking from the front has  is dangerous but i will give you all of my fighting spirit professor
it appears that claude has dissolved the alliance hes thrown away the pride of all the leicester lords who have walked the path of independence from faerghus for generations i said from the start that he was not suitable to lead
uh huh 
but even you 
 
well times have changed havent they i suppose we can trust the kingdom now
wake up eat train eat train eat sleep we gotta prepare for the assault but that hasnt changed my routine
youre doing plenty
cant you do more
all the training and eating i do is for the sake of f√≥dlan gotta stay strong and fed to keep it safe
my family made it through the conflict unscathed thank the goddess it seems that derdriu was the only place to really get caught up in the fighting did claude intend to spare the alliance territories from harm if so hes a truly admirable leader speaking of claude i wonder where he is
something about lord arundel rubbed me the wrong way there was something off about him not that ive ever heard anything good about him have you ever heard of the hrym family
from the alliance
no theyre an imperial house their territory is south of ordelias
from the empire
correct their lands are due south of the ordelia territory
from the kingdom
no theyre an imperial house their territory is south of ordelias
since edelgards rule lord arundel has been governing the territory it seems like his reign was particularly cruel the people there suffered greatly under him he seemed to be a good and just person at one point it simply doesnt make sense
now that the alliance has been dissolved what will become of the nobility
im not sure
are you worried
no my adoptive father knows how to get by im sure hell do well for himself in the kingdom
all of f√≥dlan is going to change  i suppose ill have to change with it
the alliance dissolved so suddenly now theres widespread pandemonium the lords are warring mass confusion among the citizens or  thats what i expected to happen none of that seems to be taking place they had a roundtable meeting and talked it out everyones dealing very calmly with the situation i guess if dimitri turns out to be a crazed despot then there really will be chaos but hes not going to go crazy again hes ok now  right
the death knight is guarding fort merceus the same one who was linked to monica and to flayns abduction five years ago anyway hes one of the monsters responsible for captain jeralts death we have to defeat him
fort merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the imperial capital enbarr we cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort but once we have it the city should be almost entirely at our mercy now that we know rhea is there we must move with the utmost urgency
the death knight i shudder to think of him professor you remember my connection to him do you not
of course
uh what happened
what you have forgotten about when i was kidnapped five years ago
i am still working on the trauma from back then all these years later if we meet him i swear i will have my revenge
fort merceus is the empires single most fortified military installation utterly impregnable they say i wonder do you happen to know the nickname given to fort merceus
the silver maiden
no im afraid that name refers to the fortress city of arianrhod
f√≥dlans locket
that one is a fortress that stands at f√≥dlans throat
the stubborn old general
indeed a very good answer but of course youd know that
seems f√≥dlans give everyone and everything a nickname why you were called the ashen demon myself i have been called the father of crestology which is a nickname as well as a title i suppose 
each step closer to enbarr im reminded of another part of my past riches and poverty glory and failure that city has it all and if im honest  sometimes i miss it thats how the past works though isnt it its always a different story than what you really lived
even in the kingdom only a few people knew about his higness and edelgards relationship me i always knew those two to be like brother and sister to think that we would come to see this world where they are at war with one another  i live it and i can still barely imagine such a truth
so lady rhea was in the empire all this time wish id known that five years ago but theres nothing we can do about it now what we can do though is topple the empire will you seize victory with us professor for the sake of the late captain
we took quite the detour it was time consuming but finally we got the information we needed we crush the empire we get lady rhea back two birds one stone first we take fort merceus ill put my heart in it ill crack em like a rusty helmet
werent the kingdom and alliance once part of the same country if you think about it that way it makes sense for them to unite i suppose the kingdom was once part of the empire as well even if f√≥dlan came together i wouldnt be surprised if it fell apart again
is it true lady rhea was taken to the empire whyd they take lady rhea professor  they didnt take her to kill her did they
i dont think so
thats good we just gotta beat the imperial army and get her back right
they probably havent killed her
yeah good point if they did wed have heard about it by now
you gotta help her professor im begging ya
greetings professor nothing to report is it true that well be assaulting fort merceus next that doesnt sound like the brightest idea  ive heard that its built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies not to tell you how to do your job but dont do it im not ready to say my final good byes to everyone 
the kingdom army crosses the great bridge of myrddin a second time moving south through gronder field however in order to reach enbarr they must first seize the impregnable fort merceus
fort merceus  said to rival arianrhod the silver maiden perhaps a head on siege was a foolish plan after all
no youre right that its the only way i dont think the death knight would have fallen for any tricks even if they are denied supplies they could hold a fortress like this for months and we cannot discount the possibility that they will receive more reinforcements if our siege is delayed
yes my thoughts exactly then we have no option but to do the best we can say professor  in the past it seemed the death knight took some strange satisfaction from his fights with you hes an unpredictable opponent a dangerous one please proceed with caution
no need to worry
i have not come this far just to lose you here im serious do not be reckless out there
will you save me if im in trouble
of course you were the heart of the blue lions and the same holds true for the kingdom army
mercedes 
so the death knight really is inside that fortress dear emile 
i want you to know that no one is forcing you to battle with us at the front lines i support whatever you decide
please stop we cant have you saying that you and i are the same after all we both have to fight our family for the good of the world  and since thats the way it is i couldnt live with myself if i was the only running away from this battle i will bring emile back to his senses i must im his big sister after all
understood stay safe out there mercedes
 that man approaches 
report the main gate has been breached
 ugh  how did i get tangled up in all of this 
you are finally here  will deaths scythe claim you  or will i fall to that sword of yours  and mercedes  here you are as well 
after saving the embattled alliance you march south to empire territory fort merceus said to be impregnable stands between you and enbarr the imperial capital
they broke through the main gate  trample them all save  that man 
even though we smashed the main gate fort merceus is still an ironclad fortress and the enemy commander is the death knight we must not falter in our assault
i now see why they call this keep impregnable everywhere you turn is defensive weaponry we must capture all of those locations as we push forward if even one of them takes a shot at you we will be in trouble
fools push forward and surround them 
worrisome they have a leader capable of summoning reinforcements if we find and strike down that person we can prevent further interruptions
there will be no further reinforcements from this side however the other side is still in action
if they call in more reinforcements well be in great danger we must take down the other commander as well and fast
good now we should not have to worry about any more reinforcements crashing the party
did you have to kill a lot of your friends to get here cause im gonna give this fight everything ive got
its way over my head and i dont really get whats going on between you and edelgard i thought for sure you two would come to an understanding but i guess i was wrong
looks like we ended up on opposing sides linhardt
certainly seems that way i could almost weep over how things turned out do you realize caspar that this is the first time weve ever fought
yeah i think youre right the first and probably the last
dont worry about me  i always knew  losing meant death 
id rather not fight yet avoiding it is more frustrating and fruitless than engaging in the battle itself
ever since returning to the empire i knew this day would arrive i just hoped it might take a bit longer ugh 
i hope someday there will be no fighting and we can all just  nap the afternoon away 
i have no need of you
youre stronger now whether i kill you or you kill me im looking forward to this
you dare stand between me and my pleasure
yes i dare stand against you death knight
death is all that remains 
i came here to get you lets return together  emile
leave  the place of your death is not here 
no i wont i  i refuse to run from you anymore
so its you death knight remember me
you again here to lose more blood
never you will not lay a hand on me ever again
you will not escape death knight today you will be unmasked
my true identity has no value
i will be the judge of that once ive seen your face
to kill to die  to know one without the other would be maddening 
the enemy general has been vanquished everyonemove to gain control of the keep victory is ours raise the banner of the knights may it soar proudly over the impregnable fortress
 oh i have to meet  i have to meet emile
emile  im so sorry  this is all my fault for leaving you behind when i left house bartels i should have gone back for you sooner 
argh 
im sorry for not being a better sister to you
mer cedes 
please forgive me emile 
mercie we need to go now
 good bye 
your highness our capture of the fortress is complete
now the path to the imperial capital is finally opened to us once weve finished cleaning up after the battle lets have another meeting to discuss our next move
we should have a victory celebration
it would be one thing if we were at home or at the monastery but to waste our resources like that here would be most 
arent you overworking yourself
naturally but it matters not consider this  once this war is over the mountain of official business on my plate will be even taller if i cant handle at least this much how will i 
pardon the interruption weve just received a letter from margrave gautier
very well i will read it at once
i see  it seems the conflict within faerghus has at last come to an end
yes your highness the margrave and the other eastern lords are at the center of it and are gathering the kingdoms military forces even now they intend to join with the alliance army and send troops and supplies to the monastery
whaddaya know  my old man is really pulling his weight did he seem well
yes as well as can be expected he has taken it upon himself to bring order back to our troubled territory while his highness is away
i am truly in the margraves debt i will be sure to thank him properly at first opportunity thank you for the information now tell me did it seem to you that my presence was needed back at the monastery
well  i do have a verbal message from the margrave on the subject
a verbal message how strange 
the other day he arrested one of viscount kleimans men and well  the prisoner has claimed involvement in the tragedy of duscur he has implicated his lord as well
go on
i was told they would be transporting this man to the monastery along with the troops and supplies the margrave said that regardless of the credibility of the mans testimony how he should be dealt with was your decision alone your highness
very well all things considered i will return to the monastery at once will you come with me professor  thank you

after storming the streets of enbarr and bringing imperial forces to their knees the kingdom army surrounds the imperial palace but the enemy that awaits them is not the edelgard they once knew 
we have annihilated enbarrs army if we strike her down now this war will finally be over i imagine she intends to keep fighting until the bitter end if this is the end she has chosen it is my responsibility to see it through with her isnt that so emperor of adrestia we have no choice but to destroy each other such is the destiny we were born to that is why i will now rise up to answer her iron will with the bite of my lance
i will protect you at all costs we will both live to see tomorrow your majesty
hmph if the king falls here that would mean my fathers and brothers deaths were in vain
for lonato christophe everyone i will not lose
well if i were to die now id have a lot to explain to my brother
all will be ok i know we can win
i wont falter no matter who were facing
for all those who have lost their lives in this war we cannot lose
lets win this
it is time onward to our final battle
they are here but my progress cannot be stopped no matter how many people try the wars end will spell destruction for one of us there can only be one ruler of the world 
edelgard must be in the throne room i would love nothing more than charge in and settle this once and for all but we must be mindful of the surrounding forces
strange the mages dont seem to be wearing their usual imperial uniforms
look at the mages they are not wearing their standard imperial uniforms 
we cannot allow our grand ambition to be stopped by these beasts 
gah where did that attack come from if we do not find out we have no chance of avoiding it
were in danger advance with caution
everyone stay on your guard
i can hear voices from the lower levels could it be enemy reinforcements
maybe if we take control of those stairwells now we can prevent reinforcements
avoid losses by taking control of the stairwells block the enemy reinforcements
so that grotesque creature was edelgard if she is prepared to transform her very body to fight for this future of hers  then i have no choice but to defeat her even if it costs me my life we must defend the present  after all it is all that we truly have
reinforcements from the lower levels  will they ever stop coming
general calm down get control of the stairwells cut off the enemys entry point
we will return this world to mortal hands may that filthy race of beasts wither and die 
a curse upon those damned beasts 
myson everyone retreat we cannot sacrifice our goal
the mages are retreating so those werent imperial mages after all
stop yammering we must advance boar
these fools are caught up in the sacrifices at hand and cant see the future ramifications at stake we must bury them we must trample the past underfoot and move on to a brighter tomorrow
you shall be obliterated i will take you out so fast you will not have a chance to lament
ill take you down here and now for the sake of the new dawn 
facing you  i grow weak 
to be changed beyond all recognition that is what lies at the end of the ideals you served so diligently i have no pity for one such as you if that is the future you hoped for then you deserve no compassion
graghhhhh
edelgard it is over
el 
a rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for f√≥dlan the long reign of the adrestian empire finally met its end when the imperial capital the city of enbarr collapsed after five and a half years of war a new age was set to begin with f√≥dlan united as the holy kingdom of faerghus archbishop rhea still weak from her imprisonment stepped down from her position and the church of seiros began to take the needed steps to reorganize prince dimitri formally ascended the throne beginning his reign as the king of the holy kingdom of faerghus which now included former alliance and imperial territories texts from the time claimed that the one who guided the king as he sought to create a world free from oppression became the new archbishop of the church of seiros

having repelled the imperial vanguard the kingdom must now supplement its meager forces and so it requests reinforcements from rodrigue who is busy resisting cornelias army in fraldarius territory
you made it
we received a reply from my father you should read it too
gilbert has filled me in on the details he tells me you are in immediate need to additional troops i would like to say that i will gather reinforcements and send them to the monastery at once  however i cannot afford to leave the front lines for that long would you be willing to meet us south of fraldarius territory in ailell the valley of torment ailell is halfway between the monastery and our territory there i will deliver the soldiers you require
the valley of torment 
ailell lies on the border between kingdom territory and alliance territory humans dare not approach that place
hes right in ailell we can meet up with them without our enemy ever finding out
once my old man delivers his soldiers to us then our war against the empire can finally begin
the path ahead will be a difficult one your highness deadly in all likelihood 
true but whats the point in wavering now father stepmother glenn and even dedue  i am certain this will bring them great joy i know if i can just offer them edelgards head  i just know it 
ailell the valley of torment 
go away
hmph i am steeling myself to see my father again i cant stand that old man
but hes your father
thats just biological circumstance we may have the same blood but weve nothing else in common
you really hate him
yes i do above all i hate the crazed nonsense that comes out of his mouth
the kingdom capital or the imperial capital i dont know which is the right way if we tried to take on the empire like this would we really stand a chance with house fraldarius under attack they probably cant spare many soldiers on the other hand if we did manage to take the imperial capital the war would be over hmm  im no good at thinking through this kind of complicated stuff
ailell the valley of torment aw man  i really do not want to go there
pull yourself together
professor have you ever been to ailell if you had youd know
why not
that place is crazy hot for guys like me who grew up somewhere cold man  its gonna be rough though i guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay
i dont know about everyone else but heading to the empire seems like a good idea to me the search for lady rhea will be so much easier if we can just get the empire out of the way i suppose dimitri might still pose a problem though he seems so fixated on the imperial capital but  i get the feeling hes not even sure what he wants anymore
if we can take back the kingdom well recover our soldiers and some food and supplies too i bet most importantly of all there are people in the kingdom waiting for our help even his highness understands that im sure of it yet he wants to take on the empire despite all that  do you think he just doesnt care about anything other than fighting edelgard anymore
thats not true
but if not then why 
you may be right
he wasnt always like this what happened 
it is imperative that we regroup with those who continue to resist most importantly we must join up with the fraldarius family if we do our ability to reclaim the kingdom capital is ensured we should aim for this outcome rather than focusing our efforts on the imperial capital this seems to me the best strategy at present but i feel what his highness feels  his hatred his anger  so keenly as if it were my own so i find it difficult to oppose his wishes
some day we will take the imperial capital it is odd to think that i will be invading the very city that i once called home ah that is still a ways off i will prepare for our journey to ailell
i never do get used to the sight of blood it always makes me feel as if i might faint i suppose ive told you that though yes ive no idea how you cope with it i hope this war ends soon i dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain 
we werent related by blood but randolph was still my uncle  seeing him end up that way was  never mind its nothing
thats how it goes with war
this wasnt just about war it was a grudge or are you gonna tell me youre on dimitris side
im so sorry
its fine i dont need your sympathy its not like i had any real connection with him anyway but dimitris methods  i dont know 
im sure he never trusted me being born in the empire and all
ailell the valley of torment what kind of a name for a place is that it sounds scary do i really have to go with you hey um heres an idea  maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort
this is all a bit troubling isnt it the people from the kingdom seem to be of two minds as well can we really plan to fight when were this unsure of ourselves
maybe fighting will actually help 
you think once were face to face with the enemy it might help us band together i hope so
its hard to say
well professor i hope you can bring everyone together you might be the only person who can
since the past i have learned much of the language of f√≥dlan but speaking the f√≥dlan language still gives me difficulty i can understand read and write with nearly perfection now but understanding and speaking are fruits of a different color
thats part of your charm
i have gratitude for you professor i hope that i will have fluency one day
everyone has a weak spot
yes i will keep practicing more
ugh so hungry  i wont be able to train if i dont get some food in me i used to eat until i was full but nowadays i cant even get seconds arent reinforcements supposed to be joining us soon i hope they bring food along with them  i still want my little sis to live in the town here but theres no point if we cant even feed her
the valley of torment  id heard of it but i never expected to go there its exciting i wonder what the landscape is like
it sounds dangerous
it probably is dangerous but i still want to get there and see it as soon as i can
it sounds painful
hm that is an interesting point  the name does seem to suggest that
ailell the valley of torment lies on the border of three noble territories the kingdoms fraldarius and galatea families and the alliances daphnel family incidentally the galatea family was originally an offshoot from the daphnel family
valley of torment  valley of torment 
something wrong
i once read a book full of legends surrounding ailell but i cant seem to remember 
are you chanting some sort of curse
n no  im trying to remember the legends surrounding ailell 
i feel there is something dreadful im forgetting
i heard were headed to the valley of torment im not exactly thrilled that place is supposed to be really really hot just the thought of it makes me uncomfortable
you dont like hot climates
i hate them you get all sweaty and sticky and eugh
you want to stay here
ooh thats not a bad idea though if our enemies attacked while i was here that would be a pain too 
ugh who names a place valley of torment a more inviting name would have been nice valley of endless summer something like that
youre not a teacher anymore and were not your students but everyone still calls you professor is there something youd rather be called
professor is fine
guess thats what were used to huh all right
call me by my name
oh all right then ill call you  ugh nope sorry cant do it too weird
meeting reinforcements in the valley of torment seems an astute decision to me in that land of oppressive heat it is unlikely that we will be disturbed it also means we will need to contend with those harsh conditions ourselves however best ensure we are well prepared
it has been only five years yet so much has changed half of the kingdom has fallen to the empire skirmishes are rife throughout the alliance despite such tumult we look upon the same sky unchanged by the storm happening beneath it
do you wish you could return to those days
yes it would be nice i suppose things were simpler then or so they seemed to be at the time
its true  its just like it was all those years ago
indeed i gazed up at this same sky with mother and father it does not feel so long ago at all wait but how would you know professor
the monastery repairs have made solid progress most excellent news when we first returned here i was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place  but if we can get the cathedral rebuilt well have it looking just like old times soon enough
gilbert was a knight to the royal family of faergus what was a man like that doing in garreg mach i wonder who knows whenever i try to ask about it hed change the subject and avoid giving a proper answer
these past five years lord rodrigue worried for his highness more than any other but i wonder what he would say if he saw what has become of dimitri 
the kingdom doesnt seem to have clear goals holding them together different people have different priorities the situation right now is difficult but at times like this you have the opportunity to really shine eh professor youre in charge show them what youre made of ill do what i can to help
strategically speaking our best move is probably to head for the kingdom capital though i think its more likely that lady rhea is in the empire so i would not object to taking the fight directly to edelgard hm there are no right or wrong answers in war what do you think we should do i hope with the goddesss guidance we can make the right choice
there are enemy spies around remain vigilant capture anyone who seems suspicious
to kill them
what else would we do with them
all right i will
im glad you understand im counting on you
gotta clean out the storerooms tend the flowers do the washing dust the library 
that sounds like a lot of work
well its my job ya know gotta do your job
do you need any help
nah this is my job lady rhea herself gave it to me even if lady rheas not here right now i still gotta do my duty
like you you gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing yeah
greetings professor nothing to report is everyone setting out on a big campaign not exactly ah so youre meeting up with the reinforcements well you can leave guarding this place to me ill keep an eye out for anything suspicious
this valley isnt a place id care to return to   
after the chilliness of faerghus i cant seem to adjust to this extreme heat
historically there have been battles whose outcomes were determined in part by the climate you cant argue that this heat isnt a factor
in conditions like these who knows what will become of our morale   
professor be honest how are you holding up
im at my limit
dont overexert yourself perhaps it would be best to take breaks as we proceed
i never imagined it would be like this 
monks once used this area as an ascetic training ground because of the intense environment
they say ailell was born of the goddesss rage 
her rage
i hadnt heard that before
if you believe the legends this valley is evidence of the goddesss judgement passed on humanity for its corruption the forest that once covered the surrounding area was burnt to ash by a pillar of light that descended from the heavens that legend fueled belief in a place of torment between our world and the next where ones sins are purified in the cleansing flames
nonsense sins are not so easily washed away
indeed   and there are no accounts of such a place in scripture yet those who cannot face their own sins have no choice but to cling to the idea
 
ugh i just dont think i can take this heat anymore i think im starting to see things  near those mountains over there  is it just me or is there a group of people gathered there
no  it would seem you are not hallucinating after all
that is house rowes banner they curried favor with that witch and sold out faerghus
we messed up there must have been a spy among us  will you have us meet them in battle or wait for rodrigue to arrive
there is only one option how kind of them to save us the trouble of killing them later
arent they your former allies
never call those traitors our allies again
they sold out the kingdom right
i will not repeat myself
that banner belongs to the gray lion its a waste of breath to exchange words with one such as him
his highness is correct he is not an opponent whom we can expect to negotiate with everyone prepare for the attack
your party travels to ailell the valley of torment to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements it should have been a safe march 
the valley of torment    perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight only if that puny force of children is able to kill me of course   
that man who raises the lions flag lord gwendal he is an elder knight who serves house rowe gwendal would without thought fight any battle if ordered there is no chance of negotiating with him
ailell is a deadly place flames burst from the ground with no warning sane people usually avoid it
so the flames of torment burn your sins your life your everything if you wish to spare yourself the goddesss wrath tread lightly
here we go attack them from both sides
so cornelia has planted spies even inside garreg mach
the shield of faerghus has appeared we can expect more out of him than the young ones
to meet you in a place like this  no that wont do ill leave the talking until after the battle heres a small souvenir for you put it to good use
does a whelp like you really expect to kill me i am gwendal the gray lion a knight by the hand of count rowe do your worst
ah so i have found a place to die    young ones    i thank you   
the man praised as a lion is degraded to a mere traitors underling
a traitors underling thats upsetting your highness i am and always have been a knight of house rowe
how dare you you are nothing but a lowly beast scavenging for scraps you have forgotten the dignity of knighthood
i may be lowly but this beast is loyal to his master
ha then i had better kill a pet and deliver its head to that master   
its been too long your highness but try to temper your joy will you this is a war after all
to say such a thing at a time like this you have not changed one bit
dont let looks deceive you ive had a rough go of it ever since i crossed blades with those traitors in fhirdiad when i heard youd been executed i rushed there as fast as i could blind with fury when i got there i was fed some garbage about not being able to see your body the next thing i knew i was gripping my blade and  gilbert you have done well to locate his highness i am truly grateful
and you  i have you to thank as well
as his professor it was my duty
we were all fortunate
well we are in your debt i will repay you for this someday i swear it and you felix  you have also done well to bring his highness here
hmph
tell us all you know rodrigue
im afraid theres not much to tell you are aware that the western region of the kingdom was taken by the empire correct
yes so i have heard they are now calling it the faerghus dukedom or some nonsense
if you know that much then the rest wont take long enemy or not its undeniable that cornelias plan was nothing short of genius after seizing power she invited the imperial army to fhirdiad there she reorganized her troops and then sent soldiers to hunt me down because of that we were forced to act defensively and now were being forced into a difficult battle shes been controlling the situation all along
so thats been the witchs plan from the start i should have killed her ages ago
your highness  fhirdiad is in a terrible state right now the tyranny is unbearable and so the rebellions are endless refugees starve to death in the streets if i may speak freely your highness  we should change course for fhirdiad and take down those traitors before we embark to enbarr
theres no time for that we must annihilate enbarr before all else
think this through i understand wanting to destroy the empire and the emperor i want that so much it hurts but which is more important the dead or the living
 silence
no dimitri you will hear me out
are you asking me asking the dead to forgive that woman
no i would not ask that of you what i am asking is that you allow us to prioritize the kingdom capital over the imperial capital for now as lamberts close and trusted friend i am confident that he would have advised the same
do not dare to put words in the mouth of the dead they are your words alone even if you borrowed their lips until i offer up that womans head father will remain a slave to his lingering regret and hatred  even now he suffers it is ceaseless as we waste time with idle chatter his suffering continues
 you are my king our king wherever you lead we will follow but your highness  there are those who take up their sword in the name of revenge and yet along the way lose the strength and composure to follow through  you would do well to bear that in mind
 
ah i nearly forgot take this your highness the time has come for it to be wielded by its true master
areadbhar  the heros relic once wielded by my father
the very same i managed to steal it back from one of cornelias underlings in fhirdiad
understated as ever father it must have been a true struggle to get it back
i  i am grateful my friend
gilbert professor may i request something of you i wish to fight at your side
senile already old man who will protect our territory
i expected it would come to this so i left those matters to my younger brother he has my complete faith i must keep my promise to our fallen king to my dear friend
what promise
a very old one i swore it nearly 10 years ago now then your highness lets destroy the empire together my men and i will spare no effort i pray that you are right and that this will save the kingdom
our orders are to capture enbarr by striking the enemy stronghold directly  how familiar are you with the geography of f√≥dlan
very familiar
then you must be aware that the kingdom and the empire are separated by the impassable oghma mountains right
not very familiar
the kingdom and the empire are separated by the impassable oghma mountains
legend has it that saint seiros once crossed over those mountains to fight against the fell king nemesis  but dont fool yourself leading an army over such steep mountains would be near impossible
in order to infiltrate the empire we have no choice but to go around the mountains either to the east or to the west
lets go east
yes i agree
lets go west
hmm i believe that may be difficult after all the western region of the kingdom is already loyal to the empire perhaps we should consider going east using the route that passes through alliance territory
the alliance is currently split in two those who stand with the empire and those who are against it leading the imperial faction is house gloucester while house riegan leads those who oppose we should take advantage of their internal conflict and proceed east along the mountains until we reach the great bridge of myrddin in alliance territory
why there
the airmid river divides alliance and empire territory there are many large bridges that cross it however the great bridge of myrddin is by far the largest and it is also the closest to the monastery i believe you crossed that bridge five years ago on your journey to the battle of the eagle and lion
its risky 
im afraid we have no other option this is our only hope
what if the empire and the alliance both attack
im afraid its a possibility but its still more practical than passing through the west
perhaps our next move should be to contact house riegan and request their cooperation 
do you think theyll help us
claude of house riegan is the leader of the alliance and is firmly against the empire they are the enemy of our enemy  in other words hopefully a friend
are you suggesting that we ask house riegan to engage the gloucester soldiers
i am if we take the bridge then house gloucester will no longer be able to receive help from the empire theres no way a man as wise as claude would refuse our request
and once we manage to capture the great bridge and gain a foothold into the empire 
then we cross gronder field and head south toward enbarr
but if we get attacked from both sides well have to fight people from the alliance wont we
speaking of house gloucester i wonder how lorenz is holding up 
if we meet him again it will probably be as enemies to be honest id rather avoid seeing him altogether
if you do not wish to kill familiar faces do not tarry over the corpses of the dead
hmph good advice
prepare yourselves it is time to steel your souls for the task at hand
/***EOF***/
following the death of rodrigue dimitri begins to question his desire for revenge his troubled mind turns to the kingdom capital and how he might end the chaos plaguing faerghus once and for all
our victory at gronder was certainly a turning point for us however  rodrigues death has been difficult to bear weve lost considerable military strength and resources
are there no lords we can rely on
is there no way to secure more soldiers
unfortunately with things as they are now i dont think house gautier has any resources to spare
im sorry i really wish we could help if only house galatea had anything to give 
if we split up the soldiers currently defending the monastery we should have sufficient numbers to invade the empire but even then 
your highness you should be resting your wounds are still healing 
i am well i assure you more importantly  may i have a moment of your time
thank you i wish to apologize to all of you i have led you down this dark path with me and have cost so much suffering along the way  i cannot tell you how sorry i am for my behavior there is no apology i could offer that would be sufficient
hmph and how do you intend to make up for my fathers death
felix  i realize words alone are not enough to repent but i fear they are all i have
im not after more empty words i want you to speak through your actions
  i know that no amount of regret can ever bring back the lives we have lost i  i know that well it is like patching up a tear with a different material things can never be as they were the best i can hope for is to make things whole again i wish to do the right thing from now on
that is why i have made a decision  i intend to take back the kingdom capital i wish to save our people those who i turned my back on for far too long to follow my heart and do the right thing  thats the only way i can atone for my sins
your highness  if we can win back fhirdiad it will give us the advantage in our war against the empire as one who has served the royal family for ages know that your words bring me great joy and pride that said i must point out that if we make for fhirdiad the emperors head will slip further out of reach can you live with that
i still hold hatred in my heart for her and for the ones responsible for the tragedy  that i will carry with me until death
but  my life is my own it belongs to no one else and it is high time that i started living for what i believe in i will no longer allow the voices of the dead to bind me this is something that i must do  no something that i am choosing to do i will accomplish my aim even if it means risking my life to do so
understood your highness so any objections
none
count me in
you are correct we cannot afford to die in vain by recklessly challenging the empire
im worried about lady rhea  but if this is the choice youve made i support it
i am at your command your highness i will follow you anywhere
my sword is at your service your highness
ill help too the people in fhirdiad need us
fine ill help you in my fathers stead but in return you must win you know that dont you dimitri
i do and i swear on my fathers lance that we will prevail
then it is decided it seems this war council has much to discuss our next stop is fhirdiad the kingdom capital for the future of faerghus
i really caused trouble for you didnt i  i am so sorry truly i am also eternally grateful to you now its time to go to the kingdom capital i hope that you will lend me your strength once again
everyone is saying his highness is back to his old self but i do not think that is accurate what he was until recently is what he had been for as long as ive known him so tortured by his compassion for the fallen that it had driven him mad he has always been too kind to be king he has always felt too much for the weak and the dead that is exactly why i look up to him
hell need to excel as a leader if hes to make up for my old mans death though if my father could see dimitri now hed be glad to have made the sacrifice dont you dare tell anyone i said that
i was born and raised in faerghus but ive never actually been to fhirdiad do you think itll still be cold at this time of year i cant even imagine
we should prepare for the cold
youre right its an important battle so lets make sure were ready for anything
maybe we should ask someone
good point ill check with his highness
i dont feel like i can just forget all the awful stuff hes done  but if his highness is owning up to his past and trying to move forward  i figure i can give him that chance weve been friends since we were kids im gonna be there for him all the way to the end
i agree that we should head for fhirdiad but lets not forget our search for lady rhea the soldiers from the church are going to set up a base at the great bridge of myrddin theyll be able to keep up the search while we head for the kingdom capital
the kingdom capital  its been way too long since i was there last  oh professor i didnt mean ah its not that im looking forward to it or anything
you dont have to hide it
ah please dont tease me like that
this isnt a vacation
i know that were preparing for battle
its just  when i think of us finally saving everyone in fhirdiad it makes me a little happy ok maybe a lot happy the kingdom capital is under the tight control of cornelia who was ennobled by the empire judging by what we heard from lord rodrigue it sounds like shes a tyrant but all of that ends soon lets get there quickly
we buried lord rodrigues body ourselves there wasnt a time to do things properly it pains me that i was unable to take him home to his territory once this war is over id like to hold a proper funeral for him for now we need to focus on taking back fhirdiad all will be well eventually i know we can win
dimitri hated the empire with a fiery passion at gronder driven by fury he sent many good knights to their doom  now he appears to be freed from that hatred if he can make thoughtful decisions unswayed by his emotions he may make a fine king someday
kings are only human
no they are not a king must strive to be a king first and a human second
kings cant have feelings
no they cannot kingly judgment has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual
there are stories of heroes relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today so many in fact that im led to wonder if those relics are nothing more than legends especially since we know of relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 f√≥dlan elites
can you believe it professor dimitri actually apologized to me remember that awful business between him and my uncle randoph he just came by and said he was sorry for all of that that was behind us so far as i was concerned but even so  it seem like hes changed for the better
its always so peaceful coming back here but its hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon and now were headed to the kingdom that sounds hard oh really hard dont you think
its going to be tough
i knew youd think so i knew you  ow oh ow cant believe i tried to hug you through the door 
well be fine
of course youd say that whyd i even ask
so many people died in the battle at gronder  and here we are preparing for the next battle as if nothing happened the day before its almost easier to think of war as theater with the stage an entire continent
though the actors die the show goes on
something like that if an accident happens on stage the next days performance must unaffected
it really doesnt seem like theater
even if an accident happens on stage the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened
everyone just pretends like everything is fine  focusing on their role in the play
taking back the land of home has the most importance that is why i am fighting all for my land of home actually there is more  i am also fighting for you and for everyone here
it seems we will soon set food in fhirdiad i used to live there you know though that was before my time in the officers academy
were you a hostage
no of course not there is a school of magic there which i was enrolled in for a time
were you a traveler
thats right i was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time
trouble within the kingdom forced me to return to alliance lands there was much i had yet to learn
you know when you work your muscles and they start screaming that means you gotta be nice to them if your muscles are hungry you gotta feed them and let them rest when theyre tired
i dont see how youd do that
whaddya mean how you just gotta eat and sleep its pretty obvious 
you can tell how your muscles are feeling
of course if my muscles hurt then i hurt if theyre hungry well then im hungry too
whats with the confused face professor you look like you dont get a word im saying
the battle at gronder field was gruesome wasnt it but perhaps its irresponsible to look away to close our eyes to the horrors of war
i agree
as survivors we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain we must see the tragic foundations upon which well build our future
you dont have to force yourself
thank you but i think i do actually as survivors we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain we must see the tragic foundations upon which well build our future
may an age of peace rise from the ashes so that all this sacrifice means something
im relieved the the prince seems to have finally come to his senses though its a really shame that lord rodrigue passed away it really is but now i think were starting to see a sliver of hope for the future of f√≥dlan
i never used to care whether i lived or died  but after seeing so much death firsthand i now realize how precious life truly is im ashamed of how arrogant i was to think that death could mean so little 
fhirdiad huh ive always wanted to go there but i rather be visiting for fun and during a warmer season and going into battle not exactly an appealing prospect heh im just teasing ill do what i can to help im just so relieved that dimitri is his old self again
dimitris completely changed or maybe i should say hes finally back to normal either way im glad hes come around to the idea of retaking fhirdiad with our current troops theres no way we could handle the imperial capital we wouldnt even get past fort merceus
it seems we are headed for the kingdom capital this month the church of seiros stands ready to lend its aid to you and dimitri it may be a roundabout route but i believe this path will still eventually take us to rhea besides saving the people of faerghus is just what she would want us to do
standing face to face with those whom i went to school with on the field of battle  how inhuman is how horrifying my heart feels shattered it is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behaviors
theres a school of sorcery in fhirdiad which is staffed by the top minds of magical research the study of crests and sorcery should not be separate ive always thought i should pay them a visit someday i never imagined i might end up invading the place with an army though not how i imagined it at all
fighting with three different groups in the mix was as confusing as it was difficult to survive enemies and allies dying one of top of the other  what an absolute mess huh if only i had my infirmary out in gronder maybe i could have saved a few more lives
i am very grateful to you i could never have achieved this on my own this is all thanks to you and lord rodrigue this month we will invade fhirdiad by way of the fraldarius domain leave the negotiations with house fraldarius to me you make ready for the actual battle it is a tricky business but we are taking our first steps forward
the emperor was wounded at gronder field what do you think is going on in the empire now the leicester alliance has really suffered a blow as well who knows what will become of them from now on we have to pay close attention to how the rest of f√≥dlan is doing
if were headed to the kingdom capital that means were further away from rescuing lady rhea but it cant be helped can it perhaps some people will question this decision but i trust your judgement lady rhea would want us to help in fhirdiad shed scold us if we rescued her and left innocent people suffering
so were turning around and heading for the kingdom capital ridiculous tell him to cease this nonsense isnt there a saying in f√≥dlan something those with power knowing how to use it if hes not careful the goddess will send her saints to smite him not that i believe that 
guess what i noticed i can see further than most other people can see but i cant see figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly since i cant shoot what i see
you could detect enemy movements in advance
i suppose i could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away thats kinda useful at least
you could find our targets quicker than anyone
yeah i suppose it could be real useful for finding lady rhea too
thanks professor i think i get it now im gonna put my eyes to real good use
a class reunion on the battlefield thats bleak that must have been so hard on everyone you gotta keep looking after them all i mean they still look to you for guidance you know
greetings professor nothing to report fhirdiad is a city with a long history that goes back to before faerghus gained its independence id like to visit that place at least once before i die but im afraid i have my own work to attend to its hard being so dedicated ah well ill go there for some leisurely sightseeing once f√≥dlan knows peace
despite their victory at the battle of gronder the kingdom army turns around and marches for fhirdiad instead of heading southto hail the arrival of the kingdom army the people of fhirdiad begin to rebel no move is made to suppress them instead cornelia directs her borrowed imperial troops to prevent dimitri from reaching the kingdom capital
after rodrigues death dimitri reassesses his plan of attack for the sake of the kingdom he chooses to forestall an invasion of the empire in favor of securing his own capital city of fhirdiad
fhirdiad  it has been a lifetime since i was last here five years ago in fact on the day before my execution when dedue helped me escape from prison i killed soldiers from my homeland stole weapons from their corpses and made my escape soaked in their blood to think this is how i would return to the city of my birth after all that has happened 
you have rodrigue to thank
yes rodrigue gave his life to show me the way back to this path you have risked much as well
im proud of you
i do not deserve that if not for you or rodrigue i would still be lost 
i am glad to have you at my side from the bottom of my heart i am forever grateful lets win this professor lets all make it out alive and celebrate our victory
your highness the path to the castle has been cleared we are making preparations to advance say the word and we march
give the order
its time
yes  let us begin everyone listen well this battle is for all that the empire stole from us it is a fight to reclaim the days of peace we once enjoyed i give you but two commands stay alive and follow your heart that is all i ask the gates to the kingdom capital are open join me it is time to take back our home
i thought i would see you again little princeling heh so stubborn it must run in your family
cornelia the city is overrun with insurrection it seems to be in response to our enemys arrival if we do nothing our army may suffer damages we should suppress the citizens immediately
the people are rebelling ha let them do as they please or are you saying you have enough soldiers to divide our forces quite bold of you with our enemys most elite soldiers at our doorstep
but  what are you suggesting
the city is going to be a battlefield anyway kill all who oppose us even if they are members of the general populace go on now you are needed out there
as you wish may we find fortune in the battle to come
hmph what an inconvenience the little princeling has turned out to be and bringing that troublesome person along with him  it would have been much better if he and his sweet little stepsister had been good little children and just killed each other
the preparations are all in place time to meet my old master ready the titanus in the streets lets give them a welcome to remember
advance smash that traitor cornelia and reclaim the capital i will not lose  i swear it by the blood in my veins 
bah these things are surprisingly tough are they being reinforced by magic
if there is magic in use we should find the source and eliminate it
werent the titanus enough for you well then we had better active the viskam
that should stop the supply of magic now we should be able to land attacks on those things
these strange devices and weapons  they are the empires unbelievable
my what a charming little guest let me take care of you
hm i cant quite say that im pleased to meet you though i do know quite a lot about you it would be nice if we could catch up a little    but im afraid its time for you to die
my its been a long time hasnt it your highness youve grown awfully strong
how shameless i bet it was you who killed my uncle and set me up am i right
hah too true id already forgotten all about that loveliness
ill kill you you monster you will pay for all that you have done
ah your face brings back memories  still alive are we gustave
prattle on cornelia faerghus will not be cowed by the likes of you
how very dull 
well so be it still ill give you a little gift  
its over cornelia if you have any last words now is the time
right you are very well   i have an old tale that i would like you to hear if i may about something that happened ten years ago   something patricia said about how she wished to see her real daughter again no matter who or what she had to sacrifice to do so   and about how i made her wish come true at the cost of the kings head  
the kings head you mean duscur   you monster you mean to say that my father   everyone   was killed by my stepmother
thats right her family meant everything to her  you certainly know that feeling do you not ah poor little prince unloved by the only mother he ever knew  how pitiful
how dare you
theres nothing left for you now  nothing but despair
 
try as that woman might to spout nonsense to her very last nothing could change the fact that she was an enemy of the kingdom she sold out faerghus to the empire forcing our people to suffer their tyranny  but all that ends today no more blood will be needlessly spilled now the cornelia has fallen we will exert pressure on the nobles who were aligned with her perhaps we may yet find a connection to the tragic incident in duscur once we do that we will finally be able to prove the innocence of its people
your highness  i am certain that would make those of duscur who lost their lives that day very happy i am grateful and i am proud to serve a man such as you
come your highness you still have some responsibilities that must be carried out your people have been patiently awaiting your return
do you mean  no i cant bear to face them after all that i  
were going
you must face them
professor  right you are as ever i am their king after all 
what  what is this
as you can see the people are rejoicing at the return of their king
even though i turned my back on them and fled the kingdom in disgrace 
even so  the spectacle before you does not lie we are a kingdom in need of a king a hero to save the people from their long oppression your highness  it is truly a blessing that you have returned
do i really have the right to stand here will they accept me as their king bloodstained as i am  am i fit to be king
if you atone all will be forgiven
yes  you are right again my friend
dont cry dimitri this is a happy time
these are happy tears my friend
i am finally home again  faerghus  how i missed you 
it may be spring but the nights are quite chilly here in fhirdiad  still our celebratory feast shows no sign of stopping have you grown weary of the festivities
i have
 if memory serves you were much the same at the ball all those years ago
i was going to ask you the same
its not that i have grown weary  more that i find it difficult to be around everyone at the moment
i have just returned from visiting the graves of my loved ones it had been a long while since i left flowers i was always terribly afraid of going near there  but i could not stay away forever you have taught me something important professor
studiousness
that too of course but what i am referring to is far more valuable
swordsmanship
that too of course but what i am referring to is far more valuable
humor
 you never let up do you no what i am referring to is far more valuable
how should i put this  perhaps it is most accurate to say that you taught me how to live if you and i had not reunited on that fateful day i am certain i would have died a fruitless death on the battlefield i would have foolishly challenged a horde of foes and in doing so needlessly sacrificed the lives of my friends and myself but now i have returned to my rightful place i stuffle with what to say when i know well that words are not enough to express my gratitude you save me from the darkness and guided me back to the light thank you professor with all that i am i thank you
are you happy
that is a hard question to answer i still do not believe i deserve happiness these hands of mine have taken so many lives  nobles and commoners adults and children perhaps a day will come when i have finally atoned for my sins but such a day is not possible until after the war is over
do you still wish for revenge
revenge was never something i wished for  it was an obligation i felt i had inherited from those who died i believed my life belonged to those who lost their own in duscur but what i now seek is something else entirely  i can say that with confidence
but i digress  for tonight our only focus should be to bask in our victory after that we must prepare for our battle with the empire to start we must absorb the kingdom knights taken by the dukedom into our own forces and reshuffle our troops the lords will need help purge our territory of imperial forces and i will use my authority as king to gather forces from various regions  and well have to ask the merchants to lend us the fund we require  oh and we must request delivery of supplies at once 
that sounds like a lot of work
heh  just thinking about it makes my head spin
good luck with that
i cannot handle all of this work myself you know i will be counting on you professor
there is much to do but it is all critical work if we hope to stand a chance against the empire
is there no way to coexist with the empire
knowing edelgard i doubt there is a path that leads to our coexistence
you will soon face edelgard 
yes  i am well aware
i believe we have spoken of this before  everyone has something they simply cannot accept as for edelgard i am certain she will never be able to accept the church of seiros i believe that is why she seeks to destroy it she is looking to revolutionize the world in her mind for the better but even if she manages to birth a new world  it would be at the cost of  i wish to end this war through acceptance not annihilation just as my people accepted me i wish dearly to accept her but i fear  
your highness i finally found you
ah i am sorry for slipping away has something happened
an express messenger just arrived from the leader of the alliance please return to the castle at once
an express messengers what in the world could claude be after i am on my way professor please join me
/***EOF***/
now in control of the great bridge of myrddin the kingdom army begins to invade imperial territory in response the imperial army garrisons soldiers at fort merceus
we have received a report from our spy it would seem the empire is gathering troops at fort merceus this is undoubtedly in response to us taking the great bridge of myrddin their numbers are more than double ours we believe that the emperor herself may be leading them 
 
if house riegan can reconcile with house gloucester sooner than later  then claude can proceed with his plan to rally the alliance lords gather troops and invade empire territory
at this rate three military forces will be clashing at gronder field
just like five years ago 
just like the battle of the eagle and lion 
if you wish to indulge in nostalgia do it elsewhere
im afraid the difference in military strength is far from negligible while we are elite soldiers i am still uneasy about this 
if possible id like to request reinforcements right away if we can rely on any of the major kingdom houses for military support it would be house charon id wager
why them
house charon has yet to declare fealty to the empire
it is also my home i will make the request to my father with things as they are i dont think he can refuse the church has long protected me i am certain that any request from the church will be answered to the utmost of their ability
very well were counting on you catherine
i suppose that is all we can do for now
so it would seem though if there are any other avenues worth exploring i would suggest 
allying with the alliance
ah good point we have no reason to engage the alliance directly
even if we do receive count charons aid we still wont have the troops we need to face the empire
but if we join forces with the alliance then our numbers will rival the empires
lets join forces
agreed its about the only thing we can do
lets wait and see
if we wait too long well lose the advantage 
for now lets send a messenger and try to figure out what the alliance hopes to achieve
its hard to believe this decisive battle will take place at gronder field  i image that place is full of memories for all of you
we won the battle of the eagle and lion back in the day it seems like a lifetime ago 
i cant help but remember even though i wish i didnt
our feast after the battle  i remember it well we all had so much fun together
no please stop it i had finally put all of that out of my mind  this isnt right theyre our friends we used to study together we shouldnt be fighting them
why not march up to her majesty and remind her of that oh thats right because you want to live to see tomorrow
no matter who the enemy is i will fight for his highness
tell me boar prince do we stand a chance
who knows 
if we lose well have died for you i hope you know that
 
thats enough felix we must focus on the battle ahead
make your peace before we depart its kill or be killed out there we will cross blades with the empire but its possible we will also have to strike down the alliance
your highness  do you feel no hesitation about killing your former friends
if they must die i will kill them nothing could be simpler
i can finally kill her  finally  i can avenge them 
you have my sincerest gratitude circumstances and my wounds have prevented me from being by his highnesss side these five years i am grateful that you have found him for me i am once again in your debt
as powerful as our knights are were outnumbered by a long shot this wont be easy its crazy to attempt this i guess im crazy to go along with it
if we defeat the imperial army at gronder field what will our next objective be i guess we wont have much choice but to try to take fort merceus on the far side of gronder field its probably too soon for us to be thinking about that isnt it the battle just ahead of us is far from certain
say we do manage to take down edelgard here  what do you think his highness will do next as long as theres a plan i wont complain i just you know wanna know there is a plan
continue on to the imperial capital
yeah i suppose thats the most likely plan since were traveling with the church and everything
head to the kingdom capital first
heh well id be happy if that were the case but i dont figure thatll actually happen all this isnt just going to magically end the moment we kill edelgard its gone too far
i dont know 
heh well if even you cant say i guess its not surprising the rest of us dont know either
i suppose we should focus on the battle right in front of us instead of what happens later
so were finally going to set foot in the empire  im starting to get a little nervous i guess theres a good chance well be fighting more old friends from here on out
the thought of fighting people who were once our friends it makes my heart heavy if it was gonna come to this maybe i should have avoided making friends with people from the empire and the alliance to begin with 
you might be right
you think so too professor im glad its not just me
i dont think thats the right attitude
i just dont know professor im having a hard time with it
it did often seem strange to me at the academy that we were studying with all these people from all over the world but i feel like ive finally started to understand the real reason behind it the more you get to know people from other places the harder youll try to avoid fighting wars with them 
yet another grand battle awaits many will lose their lives
theres no way around it
i am well aware this is war after all
lets fight our hardest to stay alive
yes lets we must both make it home in one piece
even considering those we are up against  friends from a time now past  i wont hold back
we captured the great bridge of myrddin but the fight has only just begun enbarr the imperial capital lies far to the south beyond gronder field and waiting for us on the way there is the entire imperial army with twice as many troops as us we had better brace ourselves
i seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead if someone has passed even someone dear to me i could stand about and wail or get on with my life while im at it that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead i dont understand that either if i didnt like them when they were alive then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here
after we cross the great bridge of myrddin well be in my fathers territory we actually crossed it five years ago for the battle of the eagle and lion remember ugh this is terrifying what am i gonna do i gotta get a grip 
dont worry ill arrange for your funeral
you think well meet him on the battlefield and hell kill me the front lines cover a long stretch of land you know we might not even run into him
ill pray for your safety
oh no no no you should pray we dont run into him at all the front lines cover a long stretch of land you know
so the campaign continues does it well allow me as a professional recluse with ten years of experience to volunteer for um staying behind oh who am i kidding the fighting wont stop until weve defeated edelgard will it or until we lose i guess but theres not much use in thinking about that
the great bridge of myrddin was considerably better fortified that it was five years ago  the bridge was full of soldiers and they all died  and ferdie was there we killed ferdie professor he used to be our friend do you remember those days
nobles who are changing allegiance again and again i do not have understanding for that how can you trust if treason comes with ease how can you be calling yourself a noble i do not have understanding of the reasoning 
theyre struggling for survival too
surviving is more difficult without trust there must be some other goal
for personal gain
survival has more importance than that are they not knowing this
so claude and my father have made peace that is to be expected they both prioritize their own interests above all else so long as those interests are in alignment they will continue to cooperate and based on that reasoning one might infer that the alliance should be also willing to work with the kingdoms military i highly doubt claude would refuse to assist us if we were to ask
i gotta say its tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield
everyone gets that feeling
so you cant avoid it huh how did everything get so messed up
you can run away if you want
hey come on even i know we cant do that
just because were fighting someone doesnt mean we gotta hate em thats probably the worst thing about war win or lose i still get a bad taste in my mouth
thanks to our victory ive been able to study the great bridge of myrddin at my leisure and you know what its an astounding structure so much history there imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big over water no less i hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of f√≥dlan  a historical site rather than a military checkpoint
im glad youre the one giving orders on the battlefield professor i dont think we should trust dimitri with that task  although its thanks to his obsession that were wasting no time taking the shortest route to defeating the empire i just cant see a bright future for this army fighting as we are under the banner of a prince possessed even if we do succeed in defeating the empire i wonder what will become of f√≥dlan i apologize whenever im with you i speak more openly than i should please keep this between us
the situation in the alliance has changed so much but i havent heard a word from my adoptive father  do you think hes forgotten about me
im sure hes just busy
if thats the case i hope he gets even busier
im sure thats not the case
im not overly concerned about him 
id actually be happier if he really did forget about me everything would be so much easier 
i heard the next battle might take us to gronder field is that right reminds me of the battle of the eagle and lion but of course that was a very different time when it was over all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery and then we had a party but we can never go back to that can we
i heard edelgard is going to be leading her forces personally in the next battle seems pretty reckless to charge right into this one im not sure i like our chances what do you think
dont worry i can handle it
i dont know why youre so confident but it does somehow make me feel better
as long as youre here ill be fine
hey how come you only ever flatter me in times like these what am i supposed to make of that
anyway weve come this far lets just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get
each time we press forward our search for rhea broadens to a wider area i certainly hope we will find at least some clue but i do suspect i already know where she is if i am right and she is in the imperial capital then we cannot save her until we topple the empire
the battle of the eagle and lion has it truly been five years since then can you recall whether it was before or after i joined your class professor
before
that is not at all the case professor your memory serves you poorly
after
i am glad you have not forgotten
it was shortly after i joined your class  i remember it like it was yesterday
when undertaking research the usual method is to form a hypothesis then test it with experiments those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods yet sometimes they also unveil an exception you seem to be that exception when it comes to my crest research
sorry about that
i dont understand
worry not professor exceptions are what make my work interesting why dont the rules apply to you i will find out eventually i feel it is my destiny as a crest scholar
i hear the next battle could be a big one is that true i miss the old days when if someone got hurt wed rush them to the infirmary and make them well  but on the battlefield theres not enough time to help people die professor dont be one of those
catherine will surely be able to convince count charon all that remains is to wait for a response from the alliance side  for now there are preparations to be made for the coming battle
catherine has successfully convinced count charon however  the knights we sent to the alliance have yet to return
word just reached me that the empire has stationed soldiers in fort merceus if they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort well be in a difficult situation i hear its an impregnable keep surrounded by high ramparts taking it would not be easy
hey professor its been a while  well actually not that long if youre here about the reinforcements no need to worry ive sorted everything out with my father if the alliance agrees to chip in as well we might have a real chance at victory
reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory if i dont come back assume im dead
i know you wont get caught
im glad you think so highly of me but we have to be realistic
understood
good we have to be realistic
dont waste your energy worrying about me
i gotta keep this place clean and i mean properly clean every day dust it sweep it everything you never can tell when lady rhea might be back
hm oh its you professor sorry i was a little lost in thought there about all that has happened and all that is to come  im sure the battles ahead will not be easy but please take good care of his highness
greetings professor nothing to report i hear were sending troops to gronder field next is that whats what that whole area is in the territory of house bergliez its famous as the main granary of f√≥dlan if we could capture it we probably wouldnt have to worry about food anymore bread for all
theres quite a bit of fog settling in we wont be able to advance our troops very far in this
we wont be able to move at all until the fog lifts no matter which path we take well have to be patient and wait it out   gilbert no  gustave i would like to take this opportunity to speak with you about something its about the tragedy of duscur theres something about it i just cant wrap my head around
im listening
i lost a son in duscur that day i exhausted every last resource i had to investigate what took place there i was startled to find that there wasnt a single shred of evidence to suggest that lady patricias carriage had been attacked
go on 
apart from his highness whose injuries left him on the verge of death everyone else present at the time was slaughtered of all the victims only the corpse of lady patricia his majestys second wife was never found isnt that right
hmm  surely that means she was abducted there was no evidence of an attack suggesting they threatened her but did not kill her 
but what reason would they have to take her would it not have been better to kill her
perhaps she had some value as a diplomatic pawn
nonsense in the many years since that day has lady patricia ever been used thus
no  not as far as i know then perhaps she was used for some political gain within the empire
now that her daughter is the emperor what reason would she have to keep hiding her existence
it is possible she passed away after returning to the empire 
gustave i know this is hard for you to hear but just consider what it would mean if lady patricia was involved with that incident 
silence rodrigue i will not allow you to tarnish her memory like that
i do not mean to imply that she arranged his majestys murder or anything of the like but gustave  i cannot shake the feeling that the tragedy was part of a much larger conspiracy there is more to it than we know that much is certain 
rodrigue gilbert please hurry
to kill like this is inhuman
this is one of the knights who was dispatched to the leader of the alliance tell me everything you know
sir a soldier on patrol came across this knight a short while ago in a rocky area not far from here someone from the alliance must have disposed of the body there 
is this how the alliance chose to inform us that they have no intention of joining our cause
could claude really have done this
the alliance lords each have their own motives its difficult to say for sure who was behind this
maybe it was the empire 
yes i would not hesitate to believe them capable of this
whatever the truth is the other knights we dispatched are in serious danger its best to assume that joining with the alliance is out of the question now
even with count charons support this makes our situation grim 
i never expected the alliance to help us anyone who stands in my way will be crushed beneath my feet 
it is time dear brother 
the kingdom army departs from the great bridge of myrddin and marches south toward enbarr the imperial capital meanwhile the alliance army follows from behind to invade imperial territory and the empire has dispatched forces from fort merceus to intercept them the curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies which will come to be known as the battle at gronder held on the same plains that witnessed the battle of the eagle and lion
at gronder field where the battle of the eagle and lion was once held the house leaders of five years ago have a fateful reunion but this time the contest between the empire the kingdom and the alliance is no mock battle
know that i will tear your heads from your shoulders the dead must have their tribute
as big class reunions go this ones gotta be the worst in history
years ago we fought here as classmates but not today
kill every last one of them
and so we fight on
you have finally appeared edelgard now you are mine
the kingdom army doesnt look interested in joining forces lets take a moment and see how this unfolds 
it would not be advantageous to take on both at once we must stop the kingdom and the alliance from joining forces i will create such chaotic warfare that will not be able to tell who is friend and who is foe
mounted units advance
the center is in danger of being taken we must be running to protect it
there are enemies in the central area  we need to head there immediately to protect it
hmph the empire and kingdom are mixed up in this battle its a struggle to target the right one such are the rules of melee well just have to crush anyone who isnt an ally
they wanna crush us before the imperial army then well show them what well made of

calm down dimitri what does it achieve us killing each other here
move claude i have no time to exchange words with you
it doesnt matter what im saying does it you arent even listening but im not gonna budge
arrgh  i thought we had a chance but there was no way to predict the movements of the kingdom army i cant afford to die here i have to retreat
stay back stay back or ill shoot
professor is that you youre with the enemy that means i  ill have to kill you
wish i couldve at least died at home  not in this big stupid field 
bernadetta thank you ill make sure your life was not lost in vain
for adrestia and for brigid  i will be defeating all of you
i cant be fighting anymore  i must be retreating now 
dont worry you must live on to lead your people those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives  in the crimson flames
youre interfering with the plan looks like ill just have to get rid of you
fighting on will endanger my life your majesty i must withdraw
no need to worry we still have some troops left so long as i stand we wont give up
i will destroy both the kingdom and the alliance now with one fell swoop
i knew when next we met one of our paths would have to come to an end your journey ends here professor forever 
stab your chest break your neck smash your head  i will allow you to choose your own death
im not interested in methods of dying all that matters is when death takes place not how and i have no intention of dying today
im sure all of the people youve slaughtered so far thought the same
i lost just as expected you arent making my path an easy one i must retreat for now well meet again on the battlefield
so you think you can escape edelgard
your highness youre alive we have to retreat to the great bridge of myrddin 
that woman we failed to capture her ill keep pursuing the rest of you keep fighting
im so sorry but we cant do that i understand how you feel but the imperial army is closing in
ill kill all of them no matter how many hundreds or thousands of them they are
 
you  what are you doing here its too dangerous fall back now
heh
your highness
you are 
have i caught you off guard your highness aww does it hurt i bet it hurts reaaaal bad doesnt it but its nothing compared to what my brother felt you will never be forgiven you know i will never forgive you
you  you must be 
you filthy monster its time to diiiie
dimitri
gah  p professor  do it now
agahhhh b brother  help  me 
rodrigue
your highness  are you safe please tell me  it wasnt in vain 
this punishment  it was mine to bear
there are no sins or punishments  on the battlefield 
no dont die  please dont die father stepmother glenn  they all died and left me behind rodrigue  are you to join the ghosts who shadow my every move this is my fault  i  im the one who killed you as surely as though i had wielded the blade
heh your highness you have one thing  terribly wrong none of them  none of us  died for you im dying for what i believe in  just as they did your life is your own it belongs to no other living or dead live for what you believe in dimitri  my boy  you really do look just like his majesty 
what are you saying lambert
i am heading to duscur and before you start nothing you could say would change my mind you worry too much my friend so far relations with duscur have been going smoothly wouldnt you say you of all people should appreciate how critical these negotiations are
of course i do but  for the king himself to make the journey  you must admit that its dangerous and his highness is still so young if the worst should happen 
even if the worst should happen he would be ok hes a smart boy rodrigue even if he should lose his father i have no doubt that he will grow to be a good and respectable man
lambert 
however  if he ever starts down the wrong path and i am not here to set him straight i am trusting you to do so in my stead old friend promise me
lambert  my promise  i 
what do you want
where are you going
it doesnt concern you
it does
get out of my way now
youre going to enbarr arent you
 
do you really think that will appease the dead
silence you have no idea what youre talking about death is the end no matter how much lingering regret a person has after death they are powerless they cannot even wish for revenge much less seek it out hatred regret those burdens fall on the shoulders of those who are left behind and so i must continue down this path i already told you as much it is far too late to stop
youre wrong
there must be another way
do not waste your breath with some nonsense about how i should move on with my life for their sake that is merely the logic of the living its meaningless those who died with lingering regret  they will not loose their hold on me so easily
but you seem to have all the answers  so tell me professor please tell me  how do i silence their desperate pleas how do i  how do i save them
ever since that day nine years ago  i have lived only to avenge the fallen even my time at the officers academy was all so that i could secure my revenge and clear away the regret of the dead it was the only thing that kept me alive  my only reason to keep moving forward 
you must forgive yourself
youve suffered enough
hmph
but then who  or what  should i live for
live for what you believe in
what i believe in  rodrigue said the same thing but is it possible  i am a murderous monster my hands are stained red could one such as i truly hope for such a life as the sole survivor of that day do i  do i have the right to live for myself
 
your hands are so warm  have they always been
/***EOF***/
prince dimitri and the remnants of the royal family join with the remaining knights of seiros to form a revitalized kingdom army using garreg mach as their base of operations they rise to action against the empire
you so you were alive after all
professor it is so good to see you again my brother and i were worried about you
ah thank the goddess  i couldnt bear the thought of letting jeralt down by not finding you
guess you lucked out
weve been looking everywhere for you but i see lady rhea isnt with you damn
everyone was real worried about you professor
gilbert has told us everything from here on our strength is yours as well
gilbert told us everything well help you out however we can of course
gilbert told us everything we are at your disposal
it does my heart well to see that all of you are safe now that we have all gathered lets discuss our next course of action
we have two objectives to overthrow the empire and to rescue rhea i have no objections to joining forces with you after all our interests are aligned
nothing could be more reassuring than securing the cooperation of the knights of seiros
thank you
lets fight together
the archbishop entrusted all of her affairs to you from now on i shall comply with your wishes
well make garreg mach our base and prepare to make our stand against the empire there is a fair amount of damage but we will at least have shelter from the wind and rain
surely those imperial jerks have this place staked out right its a highly strategic location
while it may be a strategic location its too far from the front lines to be worthy of notice at the moment this area is inconvenient as far as transport time is concerned so its of little importance to their war effort
even so nothing slips past the emperor it is safe to assume she at least has this place under surveillance
professor  what do you think about making this place our base
i have no objections
gathering resources would be difficult
yes that is a valid concern 
fortunately there are still villages and hamlets nearby and though i wouldnt call them abundant we have war funds as well what do you think your highness
do as you please
hey dont act like this doesnt concern you we finally reunited after all this time  weve got to work together
shes right in fact why dont we all join forces and clean this place up a bit
ooh yeah thats a great idea and itll give us time to reminisce about all the good old days at the academy i cant wait
how carefree of you
it may sound trivial but  well i think its a good idea 
i understand feeling impatient your highness but patience is key at a time like this if we fix up our base it will improve morale which will be sorely needed as we 
fools
lets all settle down
lets all get along
stay out of this
please calm yourself your highness we are not your enemies
my enemies say the same
what happened to him its like hes a completely different person
i feel so bad for him  would it help if i brewed him a nice pot of tea
i cannot claim to understand how he feels however  the way hes behaving its as though hes being haunted by some unseen force
im worried
as am i
he wasnt always like this
perhaps 
 
hello i have a request concerning that creature i can hardly look at the thing in the state its in do something about it
ill see what i can do
please do
i dont think i can
dont just give up like that
better to just leave him alone
dont just give up like that
we tracked the boar for five years i thought he was dead in the state hes in he might as well be hes gotten better at killing people and in exchange surrendered what little humanity he had
is is dedue really gone theres so much more i wanted to say to him he was always so tender with the flowers in the greenhouse i wonder how theyre doing 
hey professor its been a while its really good to see you again gorgeous as ever might i add an awful lot has happened in these past five years there were so many times i wished you were around im glad youre back your skills are worth more than a whole army
i finally managed to meet up with everyone again but theyre all so gloomy hey professor care to join me for a cup of tea we could invite the others and the soldiers
that sounds nice
doesnt it there probably isnt enough time to bake any treats though 
um i dont know 
dont be like that professor when things are tough thats exactly when we need to keep our spirits up and smile
oh i should invite dimitri to come along as well though i dont suppose hell want to join in 
now that i think about it his highness was right we probably dont have time to waste on cleaning  maybe i wasnt taking the situation seriously enough after all the imperial army could be showing up at any time i was just so happy to see you again and everyone else too maybe i got carried away
im happy to see you too
oh really thats so nice to hear
cleaning is important
well i suppose lady rhea would be pretty shocked if she came back to find the place filthy
these past five years many kingdom houses have become vassals of the empire the major houses of fraldarius gautier charon and my own family galatea remain loyal  but the lords of the minor domains in the west have almost entirely defected after all the royal family has done for them they respond with betrayal and to think they have the gall to call themselves nobles but we still have his highness and you professor im sure we can take back the kingdoms lands
i have lost my dominion my nobility may seem like nothing more than a title but i will never lose my noble heart i will stop edelgard even if it costs me my life i have turned my blade against her now i cannot go back on that decision professor  do you think i chose the wrong path
not at all
well find out soon enough
you are right 
the promise was made five years ago but i must say im rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it personally i only showed up because i hoped to see you again professor ive been with my family in the empire until recently i admit to feeling a little guilty betraying her majesty but only a little now that were all together again i suppose the fighting will begin soon
hey professor you wont believe what happened i figured i couldnt go back to the empire after garreg mach fell so i started drifting across the kingdom and the alliance then i just happened to run into our old class so we came back to the monastery together
ah at last i return to my domain my lonely paradise my realm of exquisite solitude huh professor is that um is that you you um you didnt hear that just now did you
sorry
oh forget you heard anything
hear what
right you didnt well um good
laaa la laaa la laaa  professor oh my its so good to see you these days so many old friends seem to be disappearing but you  youre here its incredible to see you again after five years i have a feeling your name will go down in history
edelgard is controlling the empire she is putting the pressure on the kingdom and alliance empire and religion are at open war it will be difficult for us at first but corrupt nobles are many that means that common people will rebel and be joining our side with you professor the battle tides will ah will turn i have certainty
the alliance is such a mess how are we supposed to know wheres safe and wheres not i should probably just move my little sis and grandpa to garreg mach at least i could keep working on becoming a proper knight without having to worry about them i gotta find them a house once things calm down a bit
oh professor seeing everyone together again its like im in a dream i feel like its time for me to forge my own path and find my own place in this world
what about your family are they ok
yes theyre in the alliance but theyre merchants so they have the means to escape if need be
how does your father feel about all this
i sent him a letter im still waiting on a reply but i dont think hed object to my being here itll be valuable for him having someone outside the alliance to keep him abreast of new information
i should probably keep things to myself but in all honesty  what matters to me more than anything is ensuring a peaceful quiet future for my parents i dont care about the kingdom i simply want to remove the threat of the empire because of this dimitris fixation on edelgard is convenient to me i fight for my own reasons and no others
professor  is there any reason for me to remain here i want to be useful of course but im not sure anyone needs me
then why did you stay
that was my adoptive fathers decision he has decided there is no future in the alliance 
i need you here
if you really mean that i will stay and do my best to help
garreg mach is a mess so is dimitri honestly if not for you arriving professor id be heading home about now though staying here is still more appealing than living with my big brother
im so glad i found you here professor now i dont have to worry about what to do with myself captain jeralt told me to look out for you after all so now my purpose is clear ill do everything i can to protect you
five long years ive searched for you and the archbishop it is a pleasure to see you again the church of seiros will follow you from now on but please do not abandon the search for lady rhea
well do whatever it takes to find her
thank you i know the battles ahead will be dire but we will support you with all our strength
we dont know what the future will bring
wherever she is rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you please do not let her down
professor i am so glad you are unharmed no matter the path you walk i will be with you every step of the way anything you ask of me i shall see it through you saved my life and i am in your debt
thankfully it appears the records and equipment i need for my research have not been damaged i am most curious though you say you were asleep for five whole years incredible perhaps this is another effect of your crest i do look forward to investigating you in greater detail
we can talk about that
wonderful news i am most excited to begin we must find the time of course
uh maybe later 
ill have to be content with observing you wherever you go then i cannot waste any opportunity
my professor you havent changed a bit at your age id expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years  though i suppose i havent changed either right thank you for noticing by the way ah just the two of us forever young  oh let me have my fun
we have given a proper burial to the imperial soldiers kills in the monastery the ones who were sent to investigate the thieves already rumors spread that they were utterly annihilated so regardless of whether there are spies observing us the imperial army will know of this soon enough your highness dimitri  how could you be so reckless
id given up on seeing you again where have you been hiding anyway now that were reunited in the land of the living i must fulfill my promise
what promise
the promise i made to the captain to keep you safe i cant believe youve forgotten how cold 
right the promise
thats right i promised the captain id protect you in his stead and now ill make good on my word
in lady rheas absence i will follow you thats what she would want me to do know that wherever you might lead us ill continue searching for lady rhea
thats fine
good because i will not budge on that point welcome back professor
sounds like a lot of trouble
i dont care how much trouble it is i will rescue lady rhea at all costs
im more of a mercenary than a knight these days i work to get paid i never was too attached to f√≥dlan i was considering leaving soon  but i might change my mind if youre around
i dont know anything about rebuilding but i can sure do my best to clean up the mess im gonna keep lady rheas room spotless so she can use it right away whenever she gets back
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report you know its such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again i almost died as well in the battle five years ago but i wont allow any enemies to get into this place again i promise you that even if the death knight shows up ill be sure to  well for now ill keep training so i can eventually feel confident that i can stop him
youre wrong
 
its not like that glenn i swear it any love i once had for my stepsister has been tossed aside only hatred remains if i could tear that woman to shreds right this very moment i would i dont care if shes the emperor its no different than killing anyone else so i beg you all of you  do not worry about my resolve please father  and you too stepmother  do not gaze at me with that look in your eyes  i will bring you her head soon and when i do you may finally rest in peace i know it  yes i know it 
snap out of it dimitri
what is troubling you
what do you want
i came to check on you
everyone is worried about you
i see we should make haste and prepare to move out at once i must kill her as soon as possible 
that would be rash
 i dont have time to leisurely set up camp like the rest of you fools
we must first prepare
 we have no time to leisurely set up camp if i must i will go by myself
pardon the interruption we must prepare a counterattack at once the imperial army has caught wind of our position it would seem they were patrolling this place after all
the imperial army is it well well hehehe 
your highness  i ask that you please refrain from reckless behavior in battle
it would seem the report that the knights of seiros have returned was accurate this is going to take some effort
brother  i heard a rumor that there is a vicious murderer among our enemies
who knows if theres any truth to it thought i admit we have lost some soldiers recently whether hes among them or not taking on the knights of seiros is extremely dangerous youre not ready for the front lines fleche stay in the back and support us from there understood
no i want to stay with you i have to 
i need you to understand fleche i will come back i promise
fine i trust you brother please be safe
all units prepare to attack
at the monastery at garreg mach the kingdom army proceeds to bolster its forces but the empire is already one step ahead an imperial vanguard led by general randolph has deduced the location of the kingdom army and now advances with the aim of toppling garreg mach for a second time
fulfilling a promise made five years ago your former students gather once more at the monastery as do the knights however your joyful reunion is cut short 
the knights of seiros are a powerful enemy but we have more soldiers well take them down all at once
there are more enemies than expected attacking with fire would prove most useful here
report the enemy has entered the periphery of garreg mach
if they reach the interior we wont be able to protect the monastery drive them back
it is our duty to give these soldiers to their destination stay alert an attack may come at any time
damn we couldnt protect the monastery we must accept defeat
a total loss  but we cant just return home like this 
professor get down
the fire attack unit has been destroyed our plan has failed
it looks like they were planning something but it failed
fire attack is ready now to draw the enemys attention so many units and you still cant defeat us  the empires generals are not as formidable as id heard
quiet dont think youll get away with mocking me attack make sure they never speak again
now
fire gyaaaaaah
argh a fire attack  the damage is too great we cant fight anymore all units retreat ill take on our pursuers carry away the injured soldiers
chase them down leave none standing eliminate them before they can regroup
for my house for justice i will not be defeated
no  this cant end here 
capture him
a one eyed demon  so its you youre the one whos been going around killing the imperial troops
what is it to you
you bastard life is worthless to you isnt it
ha you took the words from my mouth general
you must be randolph  my uncle
caspar yes indeed  so i see you have chosen to oppose the empire if so be warned that i wont hesitate ill strike you down even if were of the same house
you took the words right outta my mouth graaagh
a terrible battle yet garreg mach still stands your highness
i have family waiting for me  please i cant die here 
a beast of your depravity prattling on about family how amusing
as though you could understand such a thing as love  you heartless monster
you are a monster too general you have just yet to realize it a monster who thinks hes a man despicable as a general you must have killed countless souls without a shred of mercy do you still remember the sound of them begging just as youre begging now or now that your life is at its end will you hold to the lie that your hands are not stained red with blood
this this is war i did what i had to for the empire for the people for my family
so you are piling up corpses for the people and for your family and i am doing the same for the salvation of the dead  after all is said and done we are both murderers both stained both monsters
youre wrong
am i i can smell the rotting flesh upon your hands even now general
enough thats enough
i wont kill you right away my fellow monster unless you object to watching your friends die one by one if so i will do you the service of removing your eyes first so that 
gaaah fleche  please forgive me 
  what is the meaning of this
i couldnt bear to watch
hah hahahaha a grievous error professor
i miss the dimitri i once knew
the dimitri you once knew is dead all that remains is the repulsive blood stained monster you see before you
if you do not approve of what i have become then kill me if you insist that you cannot then i will continue to use you and your friends until the flesh falls from your bones
we managed to repel the imperial army but we remain divided on our next course of action i anticipate a second and third wave of attack  with our current forces well have our hands full just defending
its a miracle we managed to repel the imperial army with the few units and resources we do have
we should probably contact rodrigue right away to request backup
rodrigue is in a difficult position as he has suffered invasions by the dukedom but there are troops who share in our cause gathering the heart of fraldarius territory if we can arrange for them to join us our forces will grow considerably
fraldarius  so rodrigue is still alive is he
we met five years ago
so you did
that name sounds familiar
you met rodrigue when he visited the monastery during miklans rebellion
i wonder what my old man will say when he sees you now that spectacle alone will be worth the trip
hmph
ive already sent word with our fastest messenger informing rodrigue that his highness is alive but wed do well to send another in case anything happens to the first with the current state of things well be completely helpless without his support your highness may i ask what your next plan of attack is should we dispatch our troops to the kingdom capital or to the imperial capital
we will take the imperial capital there i will kill her we end the war and chase away the lingering regrets of the dead nothing could be more to the point
uh that may be true but dont forget that your people need our help right now 
your highness  i hate them too but the citizens of fhirdiad have long awaited your return
just give it up already wasting time thinking about stuff like that will only dull your blade
defeating edelgard would put an end to the war that would benefit the kingdom as well 
we still need to look for lady rhea so i agree that we should get to enbarr as fast as possible
professor  whatever you decide we shall follow
lets take back fhirdiad the kingdom capital
you were entrusted with leading the church one would think the logical step is to march to enbarr if lady rhea is being held prisoner in the empire we dont have time to waste taking back fhirdiad can you deny it
 
lets take down enbarr the imperial capital
yes  it is the only way
either way we are in need of numbers it is essential that we secure backup
/***EOF***/
the kingdom army has reclaimed the kingdom capital and plans to immediately begin restoring the country and its forces but an unexpected request arrives from claude leader of the leicester alliance dimitri promptly responds to the request for aid and he rushes to prepare the kingdoms forces
having allowed the imperial army to invade the alliance army makes their last stand at the center of house riegan territory in derdriu the kingdom army rushes to their aid after amassing more troops
we have received a request for aid from the alliance they are being invaded by the empire we have only just taken back fhirdiad and yet i am already asking all of you to move out once more please accept my apologies for that
thats no problem at all more importantly how is the alliance faring
house riegan has rallied the alliance lords they are facing the enemy with all the strength they can muster but we do not know how far that will get them it seems the enemys relentless attacks have forced them into a tough situation their defeat at gronder severely weakened the alliance i imagine the empire now intends to destroy them before they can recover
to think theyd watch us chase their soldiers out of the kingdom capital then immediately go invade the alliance  their general is lord volkhard von arundel he serves as regent to the emperor he has presumably taken command after the emperor was wounded in gronder
he is known for his shrewdness and excels not only in domestic affairs but tactics as well he is not an opponent we should take lightly lord arundel 
are you concerned
i always suspected that lord arundel was behind the tragedy nine years ago the timing of his departure from the kingdom the fact that he abruptly stopped making donations  too many factors made him suspect if lord arundel conspired with cornelia  then what kronya and the others said five years ago 
hmm 
well nevermind that for now the alliance needs our help what are your thoughts
if we turn our back on the alliance and then derdriu falls it will undoubtedly make our situation difficult further down the road we would have enemies in two directions  in the alliance to the northeast and in the empire to the south
that is true in that scenario we would not be able to safely march our soldiers to enbarr
im terribly worried about lady rhea  but i believe we must save the alliance first
oh maybe if we do this the alliance will help us out in return we could ask them to help us attack the empire you know a sneak attack or something
annie when did you become so devious
heh what would your mother think
what it wasnt that devious
what do you think professor
lets march for derdriu
yes i agree
i support whatever dimitri decides
we must go to derdriu
i will admit that there is something to be gained for us as well for when we eventually march south  but far more importantly  they need us we cannot turn our backs on them
we will arrange to head out at once prepare yourselves everyone
it was over 20 years ago  there was an illness raging across fhirdiad while people were dying left and right it was cornelia who saved the kingdom from that dreadful illness
i cant imagine it 
neither can i by the time i was old enough to understand that time had already passed
cornelia was a doctor
no i her she was originally an imperial scholar she was in the kingdom by my fathers invitation
people praised cornelia as a saint for ending the epidemic but there came a day when she completely changed her behavior mannerisms likes dislikes everything despite all that father still appointed her to a high post after all she had saved the kingdom from ruin by that disease  but above all my stepmother trusted her thats why what that woman said is  never mind
lord rodrigue fraldarius has passed on margrave gautier has assumed his position and is now gathering the lords of the eastern territories house gautier is equal in prestige to house fraldarius sylvain is a gautier these lords are reorganizing the faerghus army and eradicating any remaining factions that claim allegiance to the empire of course his highness is being kept appraised with regular reports but it falls to me to monitor him and ensure he does not try to take on too much i would ask you to do the same if you take your eyes off that man even for a moment he is liable to do something rash
the very same night we liberated the capital a messenger arrived from derdriu claude must have predicted that wed retake it
definitely
could have been a coincidence
no i dont think so it takes too long to travel to fhirdiad from derdriu for it to be chance
claudes a hard person to read its obvious not much escapes his eye though kind of unsettling honestly
derdriu the aquatic capital  ive heard its a magnificent city you know if were going i wish it wasnt to wage war itd be more fun to visit with a cute girl on my arm
maybe once the war is over 
youre right thats something to look forward to
yeah maybe you and me thatd be a good reason to survive the war heh heh 
forget it
aw come on let a guy dream
i went to visit my adoptive father at his home in the capital he used to grovel at cornelias feet when the city was under her control but after it was liberated he started courting the kingdom instead
whatever it takes to get ahead
i suppose he was just doing what he needed to survive 
thats despicable
absolutely hes hopeless i suppose when youre a merchant thats all you know
no matter what becomes of the world itll always be plagued by people like him
derdriu huh ive always wanted to go there in faerghus most of the towns are pretty much glorified fortresses so to hear about a place called the aquatic capital  it just sounds so elegant when the wars over i hope i can visit with everyone there
so house riegan has regained its influence in the alliance and is gathering forces claude always was somewhat inscrutable its strange somehow to hear talk of his brilliance as the leader of the alliance
i have been wondering something  if i had not been your student where would i be right now who would i be do you ever think about that sort of thing professor
like what if i had led a different class
ah so you do think about such questions you can never find answers though right we cannot turn back time so there is no way to back and try a different path
like what if i had allied with the empire
ah so you do think about such questions you can never find answers though right we cannot turn back time so there is no way to back and try a different path
no i dont
i see  you are so focused and coolheaded i wish i could be more like you
traveling to the empire to the kingdom and then off to alliance territory  everyone certainly is busy perhaps its not a bad thing now that i think about it
its all in the pursuit of peace
peace will be lovely peace will one assumes be considerably less perilous
yes very busy
if only we were only busy then i think i would be fine id be able to take a nap for one but if i napped now i suspect that i soon enough id find myself busy dying 
didnt they used to call claude the master tactician i want a nickname too maybe ill get one if i can rescue him at derdriu  ill come up with a plan thats even better than his and earn a nickname for sure
claude  claude  which one was he again oh right yeah of course i remember him its just  i cant picture his face dont remember what he looks like im not sure if i ever knew
dimitri is going to claudes aid how great is that its like weve gone back to how things were five years ago its so nice just imagine if edie was there too i suppose you cant ever really go back to the way things were in the past 
i am being told you can see the sea from derdriu not just see that it is right there in front of you in brigid the sea has great closeness i would be looking at it every day but in garreg mach we cannot look at the sea so i am feeling drawn to derdriu
the ocean is frightening
that is true the ghosts of the sea have vengeance in their hearts if they are wanting to take you you cannot be saved
the sea is beautiful
yes i think the sea has much beauty but can also be frightening
it seems dimitri has become downright charitable but i believe he is operating under a serious misapprehension it may appear as if claude is appealing to dimitri for aid but that is not what is happening here
another one of claudes tricks
thats not it either i see it got by you as well
did he not actually ask for help
thats not it either i see it got by you as well
is there another interpretation
yes a fine example of how snap decisions based on mere appearances can lead to gross misunderstandings
claude has asked for reinforcements from here because he knows i am here simply put he is not throwing himself on dimitris mercy he is throwing himself on mine i suppose there is nothing else for it is there we cannot turn our backs on those in need let us grant him the aid he requires
were going to go help claude i havent seen him in forever wonder how hes been  i chose this side because i believe in you professor but its not like i got anything against claude
what was he like
hmm  well he loved parties and he was full of some pretty good jokes
were you close
of course claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone
i got no clue whatll happen to the alliance but i sure hope claude doesnt die 
so war finally comes to the alliance territories i dont mean that theres never been fighting on alliance soil of course there have been countless skirmishes between neighboring lords as well as conflicts with almyra but this is an invasion by an army of the empire its a whole different animal i dont want to see my family get dragged into this  i hope we can drive back the empire
the pro imperialist lords whove let the empire in have their hands tied houses ordelia and gloucester are exposed and likely caught off guard that must mean that claudes allies are 
duke goneril
geographically it would be hard for him to commit his forces and logically it wouldnt make sense for him to offer support
margrave edmund
margrave edmund does not commit troops as easily as he commits funds so thats doubtful
count daphnel
without a doubt she is providing reinforcements she has always supported claude
whatever the situation claudes military strength is lacking and whats more they suffered casualties at gronder field i dont know how long the alliance forces will be able to hold out against the empire weve got to move quickly or we may be too late
im glad dimitri and claude dont have to fight one another  i am the daughter of an alliance lord though so i suppose that goes without saying having to fight with your former classmates is just so terribly sad 
we took fhirdiad back but i never found the time to go shopping there when the wars over and the city is revitalized id like to visit again will you come with me professor
all right
really oh im so glad although i suppose we have bigger things on our plate like 
shouldnt we be more worried about 
claude hes in big trouble i bet my family is too we have to help them professor i know we cant lose with you on our side
guess this doesnt end with liberating the kingdom capital derdriu is next that prince really works his people hard doesnt he or should i be calling him a king now whatever the title is hell always be dimitri to me
i thought there was a chance that cornelia had captured lady rhea but it seems that is not the case our next foe lord arundel was once a pious adherent to the seiros creed his contributions to the church stopped quite abruptly some time ago i think it is likely the man knows something
you plan to aid claude do you not i think that is absolutely marvelous being opposing forces at the battle of gronder was ill fated it hurts to side against him i am happy that things have taken a brighter turn now
cornelia arnim  thats a familiar name yes she once studied in the empire my understanding is shortly after i left the empire she did as well unlike myself cornelia traveled to the kingdom apparently she halted a plague and was rewarded with a quite powerful appointment that such a an outstanding researcher should fall to such depravity  sickening professor and quite sad
remember the death knight who stabbed me five years ago of course you do how could you forget well it turns out hes a general in the imperial army claiming victory on dozens of battlefields but it looks like hes not at derdriu like every man in my life hes run away from me  and he better run one day im gonna find that guy and pay him back for what he did to me
with the capital recaptured i desire to call him your majesty rather than your highness he would refuse my desire rightfully pointing out that he has not as yet been crowned however the day this war has ended and the church has placed the crown upon his head  then he will truly be our king and i will call him your majesty at last i must go hear the reports from our spies there is something worrying me and no i can wait i shall tell you more when our information is more concrete
i was getting excited for our big empire showdown i spent so much time mentally preparing then we shifted focus to derdriu i hadnt been expecting that but as a knight whos sworn to serve the goddess i cannot turn a blind ear to those who seek my aid
were still searching for lady rhea no news on that im afraid lord arundel the emperors uncle is the regent of the empire if we crush them at derdriu maybe well capture him and wring some clues out of him
claude eh he always was sharp among his peers never let himself get caught up in conventions he wasnt typical in f√≥dlan id like to save him if we can
well make it in time
i know and im sure hes already calculated exactly when that will be
hes too determined to die
heh you may be right
ugh even if we do enter alliance territory were not gonna find lady rhea there i wish we could leave claude be and go attack the empire i suppose if we cant beat the empire forces here then we cant get into the empire lands can we i guess that means its just hard work time huh professor
greetings professor nothing to report derdriu is known as the aquatic capital  its a beautiful town with streets that seem to float on the water and an impressive harbor in times of peace it would be a wonderful place for a holiday  anyway best of luck in the next battle
the citizens of derdriu have all been evacuated and are now at sea are you sure about this if derdriu were to fall those ships dont have enough resources for   
derdriu wont fall have some faith in me will you
oh yes sir
our line of defense has been broken the imperial army will be here any moment
understood you two join up with the troops in the city
yes sir
judith are you ready
as ready as ill ever be its been years since i last battled in the city streets
dont go messing up because your vision has weakened with age take the defensive for now
yeah yeah i get it you hang in there too boy your wounds from gronder field havent fully healed yet have they
no but its not like i can sit this one out i have to make my daring escape after all and for the last time stop calling me boy thats an official order from the leader of the alliance
understood leader man i wonder if our little ray of hope will show up  we fought on opposite sides at gronder didnt we
theyll come you can count on it if anyone can bring him back its teach teach will talk and hell listen but more than anything ive their skill and abilities  i believe in them
claude reinforcements are coming from the west their banner is that of the kingdom 
what did i tell you theyre here and just in time
it appears the imperial army has already marched into derdriu and engaged the alliance it seems the imperial advance has been stalled by guerrilla skirmishes the alliance forces are holding out but they wont last much longer 
that must be judith of house daphnel who joined up with claudes troops to think judith a true hero would find herself backed into a corner like this 
it is not so the alliance has only drawn the enemy so deeply into the city to allow us to attack them from behind brilliant
theyre planning a pincer attack
i believe so he put his soldiers into position purely on the belief that wed come  i cant believe claude would risk everything on that behalf he has placed all of his hopes on us lets make sure we live up to his expectations professor
here we go lets move
shortly after reclaiming the kingdom capital a request for aid arrives from claude to save the alliance from ruin you head to derdriu the aquatic capital
the leader of the alliance has managed to escape to the harbor has he those rats resist in vain 
your excellency theres an army closing in on us from outside the banners are those of house blaiddyd
blaiddyd i see  that idiot failed it seems hurry up and kill the leader of the alliance with him gone derdriu will fall
i will not let claude die  lets hurry to his rescue
hey youre late hurry up and help
look the imperial armys supply corps attacking them now would be a fine plan
the subjugation of derdriu is complete we will be joining the main army now
ugh  theyre showing up one after another  nothing for it but to blockade the gate leading to the town i dont want the enemys numbers to increase any more
claudes nuts asking me to protect the bridge thats so much responsibility but the guys so helpless i feel sorry for him so ill do what i can to protect him
professor its been too long i was hoping youd show up seeing you puts a spring in my step come on time to em the hilda treatment
its been fun claude  sorry to go so soon 
hilda why didnt you retreat i counted on you retreating 
its no good were surrounded but i need to hurry up and rescue the boy  to get to the harbor first we have to get rid of the enemy mercenaries theres no other way
thank you that was a big help ill go and cover our leader
i guess my vision really is going i slipped up  dont you get yourself killed out there boy
judith stop calling me boy im your leader  and i told you not to die 
now hidden soldiers attack
i missed that face and youre just in time thanks for that
youre ok  can you still fight claude
you barely snatch me from the jaws of death and now youre recruiting me you sure know how to inspire loyalty your majesty sadly im not free to move here for many reasons youll have to repel the empire without me 
professor if you had chosen me instead of dimitri  no i shouldnt dwell on it im grateful you came im glad to have your strength if only for today
my plan failed  teach dimitri thats enough time to retreat ive crossed one too many bridges  its a shame but  its over now 
clever i cant believe they pushed through to here nothing is more foolish than dying in vain lets get to the harbor and finish off the leader of the alliance
nothing bites so hard as a cornered rat eh
you would raise a weapon against your uncle youve grown into a savage of a man just like your father
you are rather calm for one in your position or did you forget that this is a battlefield perhaps this is no time for words uncle there will be time for that after we have settled things here
uncle i need to know the incident nine years ago   you were involved werent you you know something what did cornelia  no what did my stepmother do
you are not qualified to look into the darkness  you and edelgard  do your best to kill each other  you are family after all there it is  the light 
hes dead there goes our chance to gain more information then again even if we had managed to capture him alive judging by the way he was acting 
for now lets rejoice in our victory
we can think about that later
teach is absolutely right we should take this rare opportunity to let off some tension
its been a long time claude i am glad to see that youre safe
same i havent seen you since the nightmare that was gronder you really did come to help us  you must be a bunch of soft hearted suckers eh
if you really felt that way you would not have set up a defensive battle in the hopes that we would come it worked out only because we made it in time  were you really so confident that we would answer the call
of course i knew you wouldnt hesitate to put yourself second and come running to our aid
you know him well
how insightful
you and i are cut from different cloth i wouldnt make a move unless i could gain something from it youve always been just the opposite and of course ive always been fond of taking dangerous risks after all i sent that express messenger before you had even recaptured the kingdom capital if all went to plan i knew youd recapture it soon and then respond to our request for aid it was riskier than usual ill give you that but it was the only card i had to play so i took the gamble
you cross too many dangerous bridges for my liking
i know i know but  that ends today
what do you mean
here take this use it however you see fit
the legendary bow failnaught  isnt this the heros relic of house riegan hold claude this must be one of your jokes you cannot truly intend to part with this 
its not a joke as of today the leicester alliance is no more
just what are you planning claude
if youre going to lead f√≥dlan then the alliance lords will follow you back in the day the alliance split off from the kingdom im just putting us back together again oh and ive already gained the support of the other lords at the roundtable conference so you can stop looking at me like im crazy all thats left for me is to officially step down as the leader of the alliance
what will you do now
will you join our army
hold your horses there teach
im leaving f√≥dlan there are things i have to do dreams i need to see to fruition thats why i became the alliance leader to begin with actually but it left me no time for what i was really after youd better not take on too many responsibilities yourselves or else youll end up in the same boat and remember  both the living and the dead cling to us without any regard for our own lives its up to us to break free of that weight and follow the path that we believe in
claude 
oops i almost forgot the most important thing if youre looking for rhea apparently shes being held captive in the imperial capital it doesnt sound like they intend to kill her but theres no telling what theyre planning
you have my gratitude claude
gratitude thanks but no thanks as far as im concerned were even now i dont know how many years will pass until then but lets promise to meet again and when we do  dont be too hard on me your kingliness
well dimitri are you finally going to tell us the damned truth
what are you talking about
didnt lord arundel say something about you and edelgard being family
to claim that the king and the emperor are related  could it be
ah i suppose i never told you though i do recall mentioning it briefly to the professor  lord arundel spoke the truth my stepmother was edelgards birth mother political turmoil drove my stepmother out of the empire father fell in love with her at first sight and they married i lost my birth mother before i was old enough to remember her my stepmother filled that role for me but she lost her life in duscur nine years ago along with father
hang on i didnt even know she was your stepmother did my father know about this
yes all those who were close to my father knew including rodrigue but to speak openly about it would have caused a scandal and so she was our secret no one in the general public knew about her naturally the fact that edelgard and i are stepsiblings was kept a secret as well
im finally beginning to understand what you went through five years ago i mean edelgard is the only family you have left isnt she to find out someone so precious to you is actually your most hated enemy  how heartbreaking
but wait you two were born and raised in two different territories right so you probably never met until you were both at the academy i mean dont get me wrong i think the idea of fighting family is just about the worst thing ever but hopefully the fact that shes a stepsister you never really knew helps with the pain  i dont know it was just a thought
i am afraid thats not the case though it was only for a short time edelgard once called fhirdiad home it was a long time ago but she was a cherished friend of mine
wait i remember now she was that girl wasnt she the one you gave a dagger to heh so your little girlfriend was edelgard
sylvain if you have any more foolish things to say please hold them for later
i do have a few more up my sleeve but they can wait go on your highness this is important for us to hear
she may be a hated enemy now but the emperor is your old friend and stepsister can you bring yourself to kill her
i will kill her  if i must but if there is any chance that the world she seeks to create could be a just one  then i  i would love to see a future in which i may reach out my hand for her and have her reach back that said i have no intention of letting my personal feelings cloud my judgment too much is at stake
your highness  i think you should meet with the emperor and at least try to talk to her if theres any hope of ending this war without more bloodshed we have to try besides killing your own family  im sorry but its not right
i i think so too and you are right that we should at least try
i see so my uncles defeat is beyond doubt
yes your majesty i have confirmed it via countless channels i advise that we accept this as a drop of joy amid a pool of sorrow
pretty words but im afraid we cant rest until the joy outweighs the sorrow and for that to happen it now seems we must confront them all at once dimitri who took back fhirdiad  claude who managed to protect the alliance and that professor who is successfully mobilizing the knights of seiros 
what will you do your majesty
pull back our forces in the west to arianrhod in the east to 
fort merceus i presume there is no better place for such a confrontation after all
indeed and dispatch the death knight to guard it he can buy us some time in the meantime i will 
forgive me but i must speak bluntly i do not agree with what you intend to do though slight there is a chance that once done it cannot be undone
even i cannot choose the direction my path leads me there is no other way and so i must walk on
/***EOF***/
after defeating the kingdom army and king dimitri on the tailtean plains imperial forces set their sights on fhirdiad the kingdom capital the final battle against rhea draws near
so we have finally arrived it has been a very very long road
why are you here uncle we havent prevailed just yet
even better i decided i wanted to see the end with my own eyes the very moment that humans will finally be free from the control of that false beast of a goddess
understood behold to your hearts content just dont get in our way
of course i could not stand to be dragged into the fighting when this fight is over a world completely controlled by the empire will be upon us
not completely  i will only do what i must but until our reign becomes stable  uncle  no all of you i believe that your power and knowledge may be essential during that time of transition
perhaps so we also will do what we must for that short while we will lend your our strength
yes  were counting on you for now
professor may i speak with you
whats on your mind
i know the timing is less than ideal but theres something i need to tell you i imagine youve already sensed it but even still  i must tell you the truth of the power you wield and of what you are
i have sensed it too
i expected as much
what are you talking about
have you still yet to realize it if so then its absolutely vital that i tell you
you like rhea share a bloodline with the so called goddess your mother likely had some connection to the goddess whose power has always been sleeping within you five years ago when your power awakened i was afraid you would choose to join with rhea
you thought i would join her
i did
five years ago 
yes in the sealed forest when you returned from the eternal darkness 
as you know my goal is to free our world from the control of rhea and the other children of the goddess i seek to obliterate her as well as those around her who use the churchs power to control f√≥dlan i swore to free the people from rhea by striking her down whether or not it meant making an enemy of you and yet you came to my aid and chose to walk with me on the path against rhea i was overjoyed of course but i was also confused i thought that perhaps it wasnt the path you were meant to take but i chose to trust in you to rely on you and your strength and now here we are
i understand 
thank you for listening my teacher im glad i finally had the chance to talk to you about it
please explain it once more
of course 
after rhea is gone from this world i dont know what will become of you but whatever happens i hope you know that youre very special to me i hope that i hold a special place in your heart as well but regardless 
you are the one person in this world who can share the heavy burden i must carry someone without equal who i can always speak my mind to 
its time lets go professor
the imperial army arrives in fhirdiad the kingdom capital only to be confronted by rhea  who has transformed into the immaculate one the black eagle strike force steels itself for an epic final battle hoping to soon return f√≥dlan to its people
rhea members of the church of seiros surely theres no reason to continue this fight what could possibly be gained by shutting yourselves inside the capital of a kingdom without a king i will give you this one chance and no other throw down your weapons and surrender unlike you i have no desire to unleash wicked atrocities upon this world
their silence speaks volumes shall we commence our attack
ill wait just a moment longer there are still many residents within the city unlike my attack at garreg mach five years ago the church will not allow the inhabitants to evacuate what the hell are they planning 
lady rhea or rather lady seiros the imperial army is calling for our surrender is it wise to ignore them perhaps we could leave f√≥dlan and devise another plan 
we shall not surrender we must not lose even if it must split the heavens we shall not yield to the wicked ones
understood  i will do as you command you have my fealty no matter what until my last moment of life
ill stay by your side too forever
now catherine set fire to the city the imperial army will burn in the flames of eternal torment
what no you cant do that
catherine now
as as you wish but is there truly no other way
i have no patience for foolish questions i shall sacrifice as many lives as it takes that apostate who insists on taking everything from me will by crushed by my own hands
graaaargh
that ghastly voice 
your majesty theres smoke coming from every corner of the capital it seems theyve set fire to the city
what damn it rhea there really is no depth you wouldnt sink into everyone we must commence our attack at once are you ready
preparations are complete just say the word
then we attack well head straight for the castle and strike down their leader  rhea that vile creature called the immaculate one this is the end of our long war after this victory f√≥dlan will finally be united and truly free the capital were about to invade is engulfed in flames do not rush to your deaths survive prevail do that and well witness the birth of a new world i want to see it with all of you at my side understood
of course i will not fall and leave you without your protector that you may live to see your dream to fruition  for that i shall survive and prevail
i am carrying the future of brigid i will not be dying here i will be winning for myself and everyone i will be surviving
weve been cutting our own path this whole way theres no stopping until we reach the end i cant die or all my great work so far will have been wasted
dont worry about me edie i wont fall before ive found my happily ever after maybe when this war is over i can finally snag a good catch and settle down
somehow were already here  i wonder if the peace we secure will allow me to research as much as id like if so lets end this quickly
edelgard professor ill do my best for both of you if i die here it would be with shame and regret  oh i cant let that happen
once the world is united i will lend my strength to both edelgard and the professor to that end i will lead us all safely to victory my pride and duty as a noble demand no less as do my own principles
lets win this together
imperial army black eagle strike force move out
at last we made it to fhirdiad but its in a pitiful state
its so awful to see the kingdom capital go up in flames but at least we made it this far
we finally stand before the palace though these flames will our friends and foes alike
those who stand in our way will perish with the flames immaculate one your reign ends here and now
with fire raging all over the city our enemies wont be able to advance in large numbers instead they may try to defeat us with small squads of elite warriors
indeed i suspect as much and at their head is the one who stole my mother from me and likely that mutinous whelp edelgard
the whole citys burning oh this isnt good im flammable you know
if possible we must be avoiding the flame and be careful of strong enemies
if we want to minimize our losses we will need to be flexible in our approach
open your hearts and accept your fate  the immaculate roar saves only the righteous grwoaaaaaarrrr
what her howl as unadulterated magic i didnt know such a display of power was possible
that roar seems to have affected the dolls movements
whenever the immaculate one howls those dolls become stronger
such power resides in the immaculate ones roar  we must destroy those golems and quickly
i was trusted to protect the future of this nation the royal bloodline itself i cannot yield i will fulfill my duty even if i must forfeit my life
i can only lament that you chose to side with the empire i am a royal knight and i will destroy all of his majestys foes
annette i knew this day would come
yes  and so did i father be warned that i will push you aside even if i must use force to do it
i understand goddess this is surely a chastisement from you
majesty  i beg forgiveness  my promise to you  i could not 
dont worry father  i will protect the capital and the whole kingdom
our pride our people our king youve torn them all apart havent you had enough what else is there for you to take
dont look at me that way youll throw off my aim
i tried to do the right thing lonato 
i wont let you take fhirdiad ill defend this place with my very life
why professor why must we fight like this surely there was another path you could have taken that wouldnt have led to this 
urgh it hurts  help me father 
annette i will avenge you my daughter
i will pour everything into this blade  my body my soul thunderbrand rumbles urging me on i am the goddesss servant you will taste my blade
i wish youd never shown your face at garreg mach i always knew you were trouble yet i did nothing time for me to correct that mistake prepare to meet your end
hello catherine i always knew this day would come
what a coincidence so did i it seems that we now have no choice we have nothing in common not our backgrounds not our beliefs
not the way we lived or the way we die
lady rhea  my service ends here its been an honor
get away from lady rhea
you made lady rhea hurt ill never forgive you
lady rhea thank you for everything 
i see the years have not cured humanity of its folly  you still wish to hurt and betray my mother and myself
give her back  give back my mother gaaaaaah
so its true you dont value human life at all isnt that right immaculate one
nonsense fools who do not accept their own sins are undeserving of salvation you humans are the ones who betrayed you betrayed me and you betrayed my mother
i did not betray you or her i never believed in you from the beginning
give it back
when humanity stands strong and people reach out for each other theres no need for gods rhea your reign of tyranny is over
the time has come
im ending this once and for all
is it is it over
a rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for f√≥dlan with the fall of fhirdiad the holy kingdom of faerghus and the church of seiros both vanished into the peoples memories f√≥dlan was finally one unified nation under the rule of emperor edelgard and the adrestian empire embracing her newfound power edelgard could at last set about destroying f√≥dlans entrenched system of nobility and rebuild a world free from the tyranny of crests and status yet beneath the surface an unseen and silent struggle began to take shape from her seat of power edelgard could at last wage war on those who slither in the dark
/***EOF***/
after a narrow victory over the knights of seiros at garreg mach the black eagle strike force hopes to secure a route to fhirdiad the kingdom capital
the time has come to invade the kingdom capital or so i declared in truth well be advancing to a different location only you and the rest of the black eagle strike force can know please bear that in mind
of course
seems youve already anticipated our intentions professor well done before fhirdiad we must take arianrhod which lies near the border between the empire and the kingdom as a city on the boundary of the two territories it must be taken at once
whats the plan
there is another location we must take before moving on to fhirdiad south of the capital there is a fortress city on the border of the empire and the kingdom it is called arianrhod and we must take control of it at once
there are many mages within arianrhod we will also face cornelia a general of the kingdom we must also contend with rodrigue the head of house fraldarius as well as his troops once we defeat them arianrhod will be ours
i hear cornelia has a suspicious magic weapon at her disposal we must attack before the enemy can respond with defensive measures that is why we are preparing an assault before even our allies are aware even within our ranks there is no way to know with certainty that there is not a rat among us who would leak such information
when arianrhod falls well focus on striking fhirdiad from both the south and the east the deeper we carve our way into kingdom and church territory the more favorable our position as ever im counting on you my teacher
professor halt dont come in here
hasnt this happened before
ugh i thought i told you to forget about that theres something i dont want you to see
is it a portrait
so you know about it yes its a portrait of you i painted it myself its uh quite disgraceful i did a terrible job with it and it looks nothing like you
thank you for that edelgard
im happy that you appreciate my efforts but please dont touch that door
this was a trying month but we did manage to hold garreg mach if only just the power of seteth and flayn was certainly a sight to behold the archbishops supporters were strong but with this victory we have all but cornered the church of seiros and its knights the goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below 
this was a trying month but we did manage to hold garreg mach if only just honestly i did not expect such strident supporters of the archbishop as seteth and flayn to flee but with this victory we have all but cornered the church of seiros and its knights the goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below 
dimitri the king of faerghus he despises edelgard and everything she stands for i am of the opinion that a man seized by such strong feelings is not fit to be king it is a sad situation really
kings are people too
if he cannot suppress his emotions to make reasoned decisions he should abdicate
kings cant be emotional
no they cannot kingly judgement has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual
at any rate i find it hard to believe that dimitri could defeat edelgard
there are stories of heroes relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today so many in fact that im led to wonder if those relics are nothing more than legends  especially since we know of relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 f√≥dlan elites
all right off to the kingdoms capital we go whats the matter should i not be excited i cant help it everyones gotta have something to look forward to
ive got a dream you know not that i think itll come true but its nice to hope id like to get out of f√≥dlan and travel across the sea maybe to dagda maybe even past that i want to see all the wild jungles out there the huge flowers and  oh  the carnivorous plants i know its not realistic and i know its probably impossible but thats what id like
ive got a dream you know i dont know if itll come true but its nice to hope remember when i went to brigid with petra i drew a picture of some of the flowers i saw there next time i wanna go even farther maybe dagda maybe even past that i wanna fill a whole book with the drawings of the biggest plants i see and the carnivorous ones especially oh i hope i get the chance 
i heard that randolph died in battle guarding garreg mach we knew each other for wow more than five years  my chest feels tight think about it theres no end in sight to the fighting i might be next any of us could be
well make it through together relationship with dorothea goes up
together eh that sounds like one of sylvains old pick up lines but yes lets get through this war together
i dont see an end to it either
when the days are filled with fighting or preparing to fight it really does feel like this could last forever
i have excitement in my heart for secret tactics i enjoy attacks that are surprising
whys that
because its like hunting
yes hunting is like doing surprise attacks on prey
surprise attacks are safe with friends fewer injuries that is a wonderful thing i have no liking for the thought of losing someone
since i allied with you and the emperor my resolve has never wavered i abandoned my country i am prepared to kill my father and kill a man i once called my friend resolute as i am my sword feels heavy
in faerghus theres an amazing knight of house rowe they call the gray lion i heard about him from lonato who was an acquaintance of his apparently hes getting old but with each year that passes he only hones his skills even more
some people are so in awe of king dimitri they call him the tempest king after he wins there wont be anything left hell be a storm leaving nothing behind he hates the empire so much hes willing to do anything to bring it down
he hates the empire
yeah because of the role the empire played in the tragedy of duscur you know even back at the officers academy he never had much to do with anyone from the empire
he wasnt like that before
no then again maybe we just didnt actually know him at all
well be fighting dimitri and his troops soon we all oughta train a little harder if we want to stay alive
well that was certainly frightening
what was
the church
youre very perceptive professor
having to fight against the church of seiros was unnerving to push back against something ive hinged so much of my life upon  i was terrified but now we must fight lady rhea and i wont back down
i used to live in the kingdom capital with my parents i know weve got no choice but to fight the kingdom but i really dont want fhirdiad to become a battlefield  lots of my old friends still live in the city and many people there were kind to me if fighting breaks out there all of those people might get caught up in it 
i never thought this day would come  that id fight my homeland my betrothed was a knight who served the king he died bravely to protect the future of our country now im betraying the place he fought to protect im betraying him but i must do this professor i believe in the path you have chosen for us
it seems we will soon set foot in fhirdiad i used to live there you know though that was before my time in the officers academy
were you a hostage
no of course not there is a school of magic there which i was enrolled in for a time
were you an exchange student
thats right i was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time
trouble within the kingdom forced me to return to alliance lands there was much i had yet to learn
hyah next up is the kingdoms capital were coming for you whats wrong was that too much maybe it was too dramatic or i didnt yell it loud enough
soon well assault fhirdiad the kingdoms capital thisll be one for the history books our enemy wont hold anything back im quivering with excitement at the very thought of it
bravo you put on a good show
heh i appreciate the compliment i worried i was laying it on too thick 
your performance is a bit stilted
is it i thought i sounded quite sincere
in any case lets do our best were coming for you fhirdiad and so on heh
ive been informed of the surprise attack that information could be devastating were the enemy to find out it moves me to know ive been trusted with it edelgard and those within the army  they really do trust me initially i had my own motives for joining the black eagle strike force but now all i want is to support edelgard
even though were denying the doctrine and fighting the knights i keep praying to the goddess  when i think about those who have fallen in battle  i i have no choice but to pray the goddess of the church may be a fallacy but im sure she still exists in some form im weak i would be nothing without her
dont you think this plan to use the entire army for a surprise attack is a bit  i dont know  cowardly sorry the word just kind of slipped out maybe dont tell edelgard or hubert i said that no matter the target or strategy ill do my job
its hard to feel cheery when youve just gone to battle against old friends mraaaugh no i will not let myself be gloomy
go easy on yourself
youre trying to take care of me but its supposed to be the other way around forgive me jeralt
how about you go fishing
fishing huh that may brighten my mood a bit now that you mention it
im sure it must be even harder for you to fight against your students when times are tough just remember you can always rely on your old pal alois
last months fight with the knights of seiros was a disaster
are you all right
are you asking me if im ok with killing my former colleagues
you seem fine
i am i never believed in seiros and my old colleagues are now just enemies
sometimes its easier to get by without any personal attachment or religious beliefs
theres a school of sorcery in fhirdiad which is staffed by the top minds of magical research the study of crests and sorcery should not be separate ive often thought i should pay them a visit someday i never imagined i might end up invading the place with an army though not how i imagined it at all
how have we come to this fighting the archbishop and her knights  id never imagined  i hate this so much professor i tried i gave treatment to everyone i could but but lives were still lost the infirmary is as much a morgue right now as it is a place of care and healing 
the knights of seiros  they certainly know how to inflict pain however the demon within me will be satiated only by fighting you
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
my brother fought proudly to the end and died an honorable death he said something to me before the battle that he was entrusting his dream to me  im gonna see this battle through to the end im gonna fight for my brother
greetings professor nothing to report between garreg mach and fhirdiad stretch the plains of tailtean thats the sight of the ancient battle where nemesis the king of liberation fought the prophet seiros if our forces end up fighting our enemies there  itll be a clash passed down through the ages
cornelia i have a report from our scouts the imperial army that departed from garreg mach en route to the capital now appears to be marching here
what did you just say
the speed of the armys movement quickens  they will be here to invade within days i just sent some of my troops to support the capital it is likely to be a fierce fight 
how could this be i have not heard a thing about  ah  i understand now i am the target
you are you sure they do not mean to take arianrhod for strategic reasons
it would appear so from the outside however the circumstances are not that simple and will you calm yourself it will not be a fierce fight whatsoever the sweet children i have prepared will protect arianrhod well 
cornelia 
arianhrod is a fortress city that was built about 400 years ago originally a base on the front lines of the battle against the kingdom it was built using imperial money and technology
however the head of house rowe secretly planned to betray the empire as the fortress neared completion it was rebuilt as a base to defend against the empire when the fortress was completed house rowe declared its vassalage to the kingdom
since then arianrhod has never fallen not once the beautiful white walls that protect it against its enemies have earned it the nickname the silver maiden in the end that is all it is to the empire  the silver maiden stands as a bitter memory
we will now be destroying that memory the past is the past now is now
a fortress that has never fallen ooh i cant wait to make it fall
how savage of you and yet i must say i agree with the sentiment let us take the sturdy arianrhod and continue our march against the kingdom
an invincible fortress sounds perfect
unfortunately it will soon no longer be invincible the silver maidens iron skin is about to be damaged its sad really
is it silver or iron use your language with clarity please
really lin there must be a better way to say that since we are attacking a heavily guarded place we must take extra care to prevent allies from getting injured
thank you everyone im counting on all of you now lets resume our advance
this battle is for the future of f√≥dlan 
in order to secure a successful invasion of fhirdiad edelgard launches a raid on the fortress city of arianrhod which occupies a key position on the border at arianrhod a mage serving house blaiddyd named cornelia and the head of house fraldarius rodrigue strengthen their defenses
with razor sharp focus on the unification of f√≥dlan edelgard feigns a premature assault on fhirdiad while the black eagle strike force instead descends on the southern stronghold of arianrhod
how could they deceive me and close in on arianrhod but its not like im just going to just stand by and watch  i will slaughter them all
so this is the silver maiden  seeing it with my own eyes i finally understand its strength especially the fact that its strength is distributed across its frontal defenses well attack the front and keep our enemy occupied while the others by the east gate
titanus my lovely dolls  seek out the enemy and destroy them and if the chance presents itself i wouldnt mind being rid of those unsightly kingdom forces too
are those cornelias magical weapons impressive
want to die step forward ill take you all
we all chose our paths and ive chosen mine i fight for my lord to the death
traps awaiting us inside the castle  what a nuisance but with such large scale traps there must be some sort of mechanism to control them
the traps are still functional there must be more of these devices
the traps are disabled
i will protect arianrhod to the bitter end this i have promised to my ancestors to his majesty and to myself
you have chosen to assist the empire even while knowing of their deeds i am truly disappointed in you professor prepare yourself heel of the empire a wretch like you will never be qualified to rule over f√≥dlan
felix why
urrgh 
youve betrayed his majesty glenn and lord rodrigue youve betrayed just about everyone
you couldnt possibly understand if youre going to stand in my way ill have to kill you
sylvain this isnt funny what are you doing
im sorry ingrid i believe in what the professor is trying to do more than i do in my own country
perhaps my blade will cut away the scales from your eyes
maybe ive become like him 
there you are standing before me ready for death i will administer the finishing blow
part of me has been waiting for this since i met you no need for chitchat come at me
hey felix remember when we were kids and we made a promise about dying together
i remember
well seems were about to kill each other
sorry sylvain youll die first
all that talk about chivalry and loyalty only to turn against your homeland
maybe im not a knight after all not in the traditional sense anyway ive betrayed lord and family alike and ive done so because i believe in the professor i fight for that which i believe in
so you wont step aside then ill have to kill you
i failed 
felix im so sorry  i swear to avenge you
i am the kings shield devoted to protecting the kingdom as well as the kings lance who kills his foes in the name of house fraldarius i will defeat you all
so my foolish son  you took it upon yourself to leave your family behind
im not coming back i wont serve the boar
its a fathers duty to settle his childs failures felix  you must die here and now
so this is it  your majesty  please bring us victory
father  i will fight in your stead
does a whelp like you really expect to kill me i am gwendal the gray lion a knight by the hand of count rowe do your worst
so this is where i meet my end 
oh my what a charming guest let me take care of you 
gah so this is as far as i could get 
ah such a shame  i always thought wed end up being good friends but here you are as my enemy  the only thing left to do is to kill you right
ah  all is in accordance with this carefully crafted script of ours  what a masterpiece what a delightful dance 
victory is ours arianrhod has fallen another army will take control of arianrhod as for us we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the kingdom capital of fhirdiad it wont be long before all of f√≥dlan is unified everyone this is our last push our goal is within reach
what turn of events has brought you so suddenly to garreg mach uncle
well my business in the old alliance territory had roughly finished i wanted to see the face of my niece who so bravely took arianrhod i have heard that it was done with truly magnificent tact and that you even deceived some of your allies
im happy to have earned your praise however to say that i deceived my allies is a bit misleading i despise leaks of information and there may have been a church rat hiding amongst our ranks
ah i see however there are some unfortunate consequences cornelia surely planned to betray them but she has been struck down truly wasteful meddling unless  was it your intention to kill her
it was
professor dont joke about that the only ones we came to kill were our enemies
it was not
i didnt care either way
indeed we came only to kill our enemies
she used a terrible magic weapon  dolls that she could move and fight with did you know about them
well now  if that were the case would it not have been better to keep her as an ally if you are only capable of such imprudence this dark cloud might hang over the empires future as well
thank you for your concern however i will sweep aside any darkness that comes our way
i will be praying praying that the empire will not become another arianrhod
another arianrhod just what do you mean 
hmph i must take my leave now farewell
lady edelgard there you are we just received some truly shocking news it is said that pillars of light have rained from the heavens and disintegrated arianrhod
disintegrated
how is that possible 
it was likely some type of magic  perhaps a forbidden art
was it lord arundel 
why would he do that
was lord arundel just here so that would mean 
hubert give me the full report
ah my apologies i of all people should be able to control my discomposure the pillars of light descended and exploded resulting in the complete destruction of the main building and the north wall it is believed that all key people within house rowe including its leader were killed of the imperial officers and men we kept at arianrhod about a third are unaccounted for 
it cant be true  so this is my uncles trump card in exchange for striking down cornelia he has destroyed arianrhod
perhaps we acted too soon in our disposal of cornelia 
no if well be fighting them soon theres no disadvantage to weakening their forces its also extremely valuable that we forced them to show their hand hubert the investigation you made into the legend of ailell the valley of torment  this is likely what took place back then as well
yes  the probability is high
valley of torment
the same thing happened in the past
yes it is quite likely
north of garreg mach there is a valley where the earth is always aflame once javelins of light fell from the sky there  they pierced the earth and set the forest ablaze creating a land of torment we believed it may have been the work of the goddess but  it was actually an attack by those who slither in the dark that sums up all that we know
by giving us that knowledge those who died at arianrhod will not have died in vain
indeed it would be good to control the flow of this information
true well conceal this from everyone as best as we can i trust you my teacher
im sure everyone has heard about what transpired at arianrhod the church has displayed their cowardice by indiscriminately using forbidden practices to kill the residents there their victims also include members of house rowe the imperial army and many many more
according to our investigation the forbidden attack that destroyed arianrhod cannot be used again so quickly even so we cannot delay our efforts we must put a stop to all of this by the end of next month the leader of one of the imperial factions has already initiated an attack on the fraldarius territory lost by rodrigue  soon all obstacles blocking our path to fhirdiad will have vanished
a cornered animal is at its most deadly we must move quickly next we march through the tailtean plains after that we destroy fhirdiad at that time complete imperial control over f√≥dlan will finally be a reality
ah im shaking with excitement bring on the battle
i understand that a confrontation is inevitable still  i wonder if theres some path we could take that would cause less suffering 
this is the only path for the goal we are reaching for and so we must keep walking on it we are walking down the path to a better tomorrow
a cornered church  hmm well count me out from any forbidden sorcery that can destroy whole cities if only there was an easier way to get more information on crests and relics 
you are as negative as usual linhardt we have but one order to emerge victorious
were going to win this we really are after all if we lose everything will be terrible forever oh no way we cant let that happen
theres a lot to worry about but im sure it will all work out well win no matter what
/***EOF***/
having crushed the alliances army and captured the great bridge of myrddin the imperial army prepares to attack derdriu  the alliances base of operations
professor what is your opinion of claude i cant help but wonder what sort of impression he made on you
hes a schemer
that is inarguable and his schemes are still going strong with them hes managed to keep the leicester alliance from the empires grasp
hes a jokester
that much is obvious he acts like a fool but still manages to make the impossible happen thats as true now as ever hes managed to protect the leicester alliance with his cunning alone
he would be a good king
interesting  ive never thought of him like that however i know you have a keen eye for potential after all as leader of the leicester alliance he has managed to protect his entire territory all this time
how has he done that
since the beginning territories within the alliance have been split between those who support the empire and those who oppose it claude has been acting as an intermediary between the two essentially keeping the alliance pacified as both sides are of equal strength hes created a situation in which theyve all agreed to avoid fighting each other and causing undue bloodshed by carrying on as though the alliance is united hes minimized the empires influence there
heh its quite impressive how well his bold scheme has worked out however he is walking on thin ice one wrong move and the alliance will shatter  speaking of claude  your majesty we should not delay in our invasion of the alliance it would seem that claude has some fresh scheme up his sleeve to no ones surprise
is that so
yes the people of derdriu have suddenly found it difficult to leave or enter the city we can safely assume he is preparing for battle but i am certain his plans extend beyond that as well do you not think we should take derdriu at once
derdriu the aquatic capital  a city floating on the ocean certainly poses a challenge since its deep within riegan territory we havent had the opportunity to attack it directly however now that we have control of the great bridge of myrddin our situation has changed drastically they can no longer expand their supply line into the empire and so we can finally attack riegan territory
house riegan is not only claudes house but also the flagship of those who oppose the empire within the alliance if house riegan falls the other alliance lords will be tripping over themselves to join us that is why we cannot fail to take derdriu
lets go
confidence is one thing professor but see to it that you do not underestimate claude
that seems difficult
fair enough claude will certainly be a difficult opponent
the leader of the alliance has had many things said about him  they say he is unbeatable in a battle of intellect i hear they call him the master tactician
i wish we could settle all of this before the fighting begins dont you i wish it dearly but few others feel that way they fight in a bloody battle take countless lives and then finally come to understand defeat they refuse to admit when theyre beaten and they keep it up until theyve been utterly defeated of course i understand that sacrifice is inevitable  but if theyre going to surrender after being defeated anyway why raise a weapon in the first place
so weve somehow managed to take the great bridge of myrddin that means house gloucester should now be ready to join the fold more formally weve blown a major hole in claudes plans to preserve the alliance we should press on to derdriu before he has the opportunity to adjust his strategy
i have been wondering something  if i had not been your student where would i be right now who would i be do you ever think that sort of thing professor
like what if i had led a different class
ah so you do think about such questions you can never find answers though right we cannot turn back time so there is no way to go back and try a different path
like what if i had turned against the empire
ah so you do think about such questions you can never find answers though right we cannot turn back time so there is no way to go back and try a different path
no i dont
i see  you are so focused and coolheaded i wish i could be more like you
i never do get used to the sight of blood it always makes me feel as if i might faint i suppose ive told you that though yes ive no idea how you cope with it i hope this war ends soon i dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere its all a great deal of a bother but i will do my part of course
didnt they used to call claude the master tactician i want a nickname too maybe ill get one if i can defeat him at derdriu  ill come up with a plan thatll beat his and earn me a nickname for sure
claude  claude  which was he again oh right yeah of course i remember him its just  i cant picture his face dont remember what he looks like im not sure if i ever knew oh well hes just another enemy now isnt he what am i not supposed to say that
im happy when we win battles and im always relieved when our friends make it back safe on the other hand its hard to watch the enemy die even worse when its someone you know perhaps it would have been better if id just stayed with the opera 
i dont think so
youre right professor ill never regret the choices i made
perhaps 
no professor i refuse to regret my past decisions
now you just have to lead us to victory so everyone else can let go of their regrets too
since the past i have learned much of the language of f√≥dlan but speaking the f√≥dlan language still gives me difficulty i can understand read and white with nearly perfection now but understanding and speaking are fruits of a different color
thats part of your charm
i have gratitude for you professor i hope that i will have fluency one day
everyone has a weak spot
yes i will keep practicing more
i hear claudes earned himself a rather colorful nickname he does whatever it takes to win i like that it will be especially satisfying to defeat him i cant wait to see what his next move is
food has gotten scarce since the war started lately the prices have really been going up normally that would mean reducing our own take but we just cant afford to do that if we lose this war we lose everything still the townspeople are the ones who will suffer from this the most the longer this goes on the more people will starve
derdriu the aquatic capital  ive heard its a magnificent city you know if were going i wish it wasnt to wage war itd be more fun to visit with a cute girl on my arm
maybe once the war is over 
 youre right thats something to look forward to
 yeah maybe you and me thatd be a good reason to survive the war heh heh 
forget it
aw come on let a guy dream
flowers are so resilient arent they despite the war going on outside the monastery here they are blooming beautifully i hope we get to see more kinds of flowers when the weather warms up 
derdriu huh ive always wanted to go there in faerghus most of the towns are pretty much glorified fortresses so to hear about a place called the aquatic capital it just sounds so elegant lets go for a leisurely visit someday promise you know after the war is over
judith of daphnel you were a force to be reckoned with you will not be forgotten in another life i might have fought by her side
whats done is done
as harsh as that is its the truth of it its over now
i understand the sentiment
its a harsh truth but its the truth nonetheless we cant change the past
now that weve seized the great bridge of myrddin house gloucester is comfortable aligning itself with the empire the path to riegan lands lies straight before us our clash with claude draws nearer by the moment
having second thoughts
not at all on the contrary i look forward to it my old rival will be a worthy test for me
will he put up a hard fight
i certainly hope so i would be quite disappointed if my greatest rival were to simply roll over
i know claude better than anyone he is a schemer no doubt he has some trap for us in mind let us be vigilant professor
were gonna go up against claude next i havent seen him in forever wonder how hes been  i chose this side because i believe in you professor but its not like i got anything against claude
what was he like
hmm  well he loved parties and he was full of some pretty good jokes
were you close
of course claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone
i dont mind so much that we gotta fight him i just hope he doesnt get killed 
i thought i was ready for this but its not easy to fight against my old schoolmates  i was in the golden deer house so i have a lot of memories with them
are you feeling conflicted
no im not i decided to fight alongside you and i will not waver
its hard for me too
really it is i wish that we could resolve this without violence
then again precisely because theyre old friends i wouldnt leave this to someone else i have to assume responsibility
without the support of the pro imperialist lords the alliance is greatly weakened even so i dont feel great about all this were gonna be fighting claude 
we must not let our guard down
we cant  youre right claude has such unusual strategies for toying with his enemies
we can definitely win
even so we should stay alert claude wont be caught off guard neither should we
even with you here this battle will be very challenging
the tide of war is clearly favoring us but claude refuses to surrender i wonder why that could be 
its against his principles
frankly it seems to me that his ideals are not that far removed from edelgards 
the way he sees it we cant both exist
i think youre probably right 
i suppose even the very powerful can be irrational at times 
im from alliance lands but im only a commoner the idea of fighting alliance nobles isnt exactly losing me any sleep fighting old friends though thats something else ugh id better clear my head captain jeralt used to say a mercenary has to be thoughtless guess i finally get what he meant
do you ever regret taking the path you did
yes
hm i guess doubts and regrets just come with being human
no
hah the very model of a leader i should take a page out of your book
all the time
hm i guess doubts and regrets just come with being human
whatever path you choose going forward ill follow you without question
claude eh he always was sharp among his peers never let himself get caught up in conventions he wasnt typical in f√≥dlan then theres rhea and king dimitri  id stay on their good sides for different reasons
you dont have a choice
i have no desire to kill them but 
yeah well  if thats the only way forward it cant be helped
professor i think you should be made aware of a certain group working with the imperial army they are the same lot that invented a technique to turn monsters into war assets its quite obvious their trick draws on the power of the crest stones but  there is something more to it than that some secret i have yet to decipher i suppose i need to better understand what kind of people they are who are they what do they want for her part miss edelgard is cooperating yet does not hide her hostility towards them i suspect we should prepare in case the day should come when we must combat these strange people
remember the death knight who stabbed me five years ago of course you do how could you forget well it turns out hes a general in the imperial army he leads the western front against the kingdom once i knew he was at garreg mach i stormed right up to him told him who i was and what he did  and he offered me an apology im talking about a sincere heartfelt solemn apology what a letdown whats going on with that guy anyway who is he under that mask
oh hello there professor did you need something from me it doesnt look like youre wounded or anything you just looking for someone to talk to
yes
i thought so well im here for you making you feel better is my top priority
no
come on now you dont have to be shy helping you feel better is important to me
whether its physical pain or worries of the heart you can come to me for anything professor
what is it
i just want to chat a bit
i have no words for you i have blades and if you wish to cross them ill be more than happy to although you may not be
nothing
lately the kingdom and the knights of seiros havent made any significant moves i dont suppose theyre going to stand by and watch while we attack derdriu though thats why ive doubled our guard and instructed them to be extra vigilant i will keep garreg mach safe it is my duty and responsibility
big brother always gets me so fired up  better keep an eye on him oh sorry i was just talking to myself i hear youre heading out to derdriu good luck with the battle
five years ago during the attack on this place you allowed me to join your side since then ive risen through the ranks and now im a general leading my own army in this invasion of the alliance ive been entrusted with maintaining the supply lines and keeping the goneril territories under control thats why i wont be accompanying to derdriu please look after lady edelgard
greetings professor nothing to report derdriu is known as the aquatic capital  its a beautiful town with streets that seem to float on the water and an impressive harbor in times of peace it would be a wonderful place for a holiday  anyway best of luck in the next battle
its almost time to depart are you ready
leave it to me
a promising answer whatever happens never allow your foe to see any weakness
i dont think we can win
i agree that claude will prove a difficult foe still do not speak such words right before a battle
we must pay attention not only to claudes schemes but to the man himself hes a master archer who wields the legendary bow failnaught he wont fall easily
failnaught 
its the relic of house riegan that bow once belonged to one of the 10 elites professor  do you know the true story behind the legend the relics were created by the hands of mankind seiros collected them after killing the 10 elites seiros manipulated the people of the world and defeated the all powerful king nemesis
i thought he was corrupted by his power
thats the history the church of seiros maintains however it was little more than a simple dispute
why would she do that
the church maintains the false history that he was corrupted and turned evil however it was little more than a simple dispute
should the one leading the people of the world be someone with humanity or a creature that can merely masquerade as a human at will in the end seiros was victorious the immaculate one and her family then took control of f√≥dlan i know this because that knowledge is passed down from emperor to emperor and that is the because the first emperor is the human who cooperated with seiros allowing humanity to be controlled in secret
 
perhaps its fate that you can wield the sword of the creator just like nemesis the king of liberation and that very fate will lead you to use that sword to stand against those who would distort history
it seems theyve set out from garreg mach  thats sooner than expected losing the great bridge of myrddin was a serious blow so is the fact that teach is still alive on top of all that judith i told her to run if things looked grim damn it so many people will die and by my call
and what of it would you rather turn tail and run back home
nader  youre really getting on my nerves do you have any idea how much of the alliance adores me and believes in me
well i suppose its quite a lot does that mean that 
yes the plan is a go im counting on you nader well make a good show taking down those who would assault derdriu
people say our kind may not always win but we never lose lets teach them the real meaning of those words
now then  lets see what youre made of teach 
north of the great bridge of myrddin the imperial army passes through the allied territory of house gloucester and invades the land of house riegan which leads the opposition they move to attack claude in the capital derdriu where the leader of the alliance awaits their arrival
after seizing the great bridge of myrddin the black eagle strike force makes its way to derdriu the aquatic capital where claude awaits
here she comes at long last  ive done all i can to prepare let the cards fall where they may itll be a true test of strength
it seems claude has blockaded the city and occupied the naval port
heh if that is the case he will have no choice but to engage us from there
yes though putting myself in claudes place leaves me with an unpleasant feeling  if we take over the port and close the entry to the city derdriu will be under our control each soldier should bear that in mind as they advance
there are three gates which connect derdriu to its naval port taking the city will be easy once we secure all three
now its our turn almyras elite strike the flanks of the imperial army
those fangs and claws the alliance fears so much will now be their salvation
leave it to us kiddo my undefeated streak will live on another chapter in my heroic saga
that flag and banner  is that the almyran army ugh you really did it claude
this is no ruse that is nader an almyran general
take care of them quickly especially those almyran wyverns
the almyran reinforcements keep coming we should try to eliminate nader 
we dont have the guts to resist anymore here you can have this just please dont attack the city
i never planned to touch the city our target is the alliance and their leader claude
you didnt forget about me did you maybe you should just let me go
professor its been too long but now were on opposite sides huh what a shame im not going to hold back i cant let down my dear old claude
i im so sorry hilda i 
its ok marianne these things happen in war
its been fun claude  sorry to go so soon 
hilda why didnt you retreat i counted on you retreating 
dont expect me to go easy on you because i wont
you are here as well professor that is a shame 
lysithea how unfortunate that a talented woman like you should throw her life away on a pointless battle
ha do not underestimate me the fight is far from over edelgard
thats the last of my energy if youre gonna kill me make it quick fair warning though ill likely come back to haunt you its not like ive had an easy time of it after all 
you want me to join you the alliance is over no matter what the only thing left is to place faith in you and edelgard theres still so much i have to accomplish thank you for the second chance professor
father mother  im sorry i didnt listen to you 
its been 30 odd years since i set foot on a field of battle heres a taste of my undefeated strength
the emperor continues fighting at the front line is the empire short on troops
unfortunately i cant deny it but then ive heard the almyran king does the very same you have traveled far i do hope its for a king who would not only lead his army but fight at their side
touch√©  yes he is that sort of king
sorry kiddo it seems well have to withdraw 
youve done enough nader just stay alive well meet again one day
we have forced the almyran forces to flee i doubt theyre expecting more reinforcements
heh  so sad that our reunion should take place on the battlefield
teach  you should have chosen me instead of edelgard no point in whining about it now i suppose sorry but ill be taking the win today
we havent seen each other since garreg mach youve grown lovelier than ever edelgard
youre not so unfortunate yourself and as usual youre here at a most inopportune moment
well im sure we have much more to talk about  but how about we settle things first
no objections here prepare yourself claude
hey how longs it been five years whod have thought youd end up as an imperial general 
enough youve bested me if i die here the alliance becomes part of the empire
do you yield then youve never known when to give up
well i cant just surrender so easily im responsible for the others if youre as smart as you seem i bet youve figured out why i was able to summon almyran reinforcements wouldnt it be better to let me go and have me in your debt
thank you professor and you edelgard im truly grateful for your courageous decision i will return your kindness one day  i promise
i see right until the very end ive read this whole thing terribly wrong  all my hopes have fallen to ash  its all up to you now edelgard  i really hope you do make the world better 
everybody raise your voices in a victory cheer derdriu is ours
hey teach
claude
settle down will you youre the victor after all i could have escaped but i decided to say hi to teach nothing to worry about derdriu has fallen and the alliance has collapsed theres nothing i could do to turn things around at this point
you want me to drop my guard around someone who evaded detection by my soldiers impossible did you really risk coming here just to say hello
i did but mostly i wanted to say good bye im leaving f√≥dlan
why are you leaving
lend us your strength
lend you my  i knew i liked you teach
i daresay f√≥dlan would be a lot more peaceful without me around right your majesty
its as you say so long as you remain here the faction of the alliance that is against the empire will continue to support you
too true its best if i leave this place altogether ill just have to find some other way to pay back my debt to you all i ask is that you go easy on the alliance after all no one there would dare defy you and please treat my former classmates well ive asked them to cooperate with you if i lost
wait  did your scheming include a plan for if the alliance lost
heh you think too highly of me it just seems that way now outside of derdriu most of the alliance is unscathed and ready to join your superior strength in all honesty i was hoping to become a supreme ruler and lead f√≥dlan to peace myself but that wont be happening now
claude 
good luck to you edelgard
we crushed him in battle and yet  he really is difficult to understand
derdriu is ours the alliance has collapsed and their leader has fallen
did we really have to kill him
if claude had lived the faction of the alliance that is against the empire would have never stopped fighting us to keep the bloodshed to a minimum he had to be taken out of the equation however now that its over i cant help but wonder if he was in complete control of that entire situation what will become of the alliance without him  he must have taken that into account without the rule of house riegan and with most of the territory left unscathed the alliance will undoubtedly ally itself with the empire the citizens lives will be saved from ruin and no more blood will be shed perhaps thats what he wanted from the start 
that sounds like claude
of course if his plan here in derdriu had worked and i had lost my life the opposite would have come to pass the empire would have rushed to the alliance without further conflict no matter how the battle unfolded claude secured the shortest most peaceful possible outcome
lady edelgard derdriu is now completely under our control as planned the alliances affairs will now be overseen by count bergliez
my father is coming here first west than east  you sure keep him busy
should the others return to the monastery and prepare to face the kingdom
yes thank you hubert thanks to all of your efforts our battle with the alliance has reached its conclusion however we still cant afford to be careless we must now join the battle against the kingdom with the strength of the church on their side they will prove to be a formidable enemy more than ever your support is invaluable well need it in the days to come but for now lets enjoy our triumphant return
lets get to it
im so happy that the end of the fighting is near too bad theres still more violence to come 
the kingdom and the church of seiros are worthy for fighting i will crush them into very small pieces
crushing wouldnt yield a lot of pieces but i guess it would get the job done with the professor we cant lose probably
oh no are we fighting lady rhea but shes scary and shell be really angry but no way she can stay in her spooky beast form all the time right
if she could she would have come and attacked the monastery as many times as she wanted
it may be wishful thinking but perhaps it is a power that she can only access when the situation is dire but whether she is the archbishop or the immaculate one we cannot be stopped half remains but half is finished  we are certainly moving forward
no one can stop us from pushing forward no one
/***EOF***/
with derdriu now under imperial control the leicester alliance ceases to exist and its remaining lords ally with the empire the black eagle strike force now having conquered all of eastern f√≥dlan confidently moves to invade the kingdom
 and that concludes count bergliezs report
just as claude said the old alliance has willingly fallen under imperial rule however knowing him there is no telling what manner of poison could be waiting within
just as your majesty predicted the old alliance has willingly fallen under imperial rule however even with claude dead there is no telling what manner of poison he left in his wake
we must be careful not to expose any weakness
of course though it seems we can now attack the kingdom without issue
true however you should know that lord arundel has entered derdriu it would seem he has already started collecting the relics of the old alliance 
let him do as he pleases for now its not yet the time to chide him
understood as for the kingdom  as we theorized it is not entirely united if we defeat the royal family of house blaiddyd and a handful of other notable houses it should fall under our control quite readily those we must target include the houses fraldarius galatea gautier and charon
we have allies who are close to some of those lords perhaps that can be used to our advantage persuasion by tears or threats perhaps one would consent to act as an hostage we must make good use of the tools given to us
what about house rowe in arianrhod the fortress city will they not side with us
the head of house fraldarius lord rodrigue has entered the city it is possible that he has seized it
i see then it might prove too difficult to strike fhirdiad right away
either way when preparations are complete we can begin our deployment into the kingdom
that part of the plan remains unchanged professor is something wrong
no its nothing
many of those names are new to me
yes i dont imagine you have much interest in a running list of noble names but it matters not the nobility and the weight of it all those names will be gone once the war is over
this month we must put all of our effort into preparing for battle im counting on you my teacher
aaah
 
professor you didnt hear anything just now did you
are you ok
of course i am its nothing nothing at all
that was a cute shriek
cute huh well be that as it may it is not your concern it was nothing
are you sure about that
i told you it was nothing and i meant it
really very cute 
you seem to be trying your hardest to infuriate me dont you dare say that again
cute huh well be that as it may it is not your concern it was nothing
its just  well there was a rat i dont enjoy the company of rats i believe ive told you about this before about when i was held captive beneath the palace there were a lot of rats there to this day i just 
whats that
what oh professor leave here at once i recall now that hubert needs to speak with me i must change my clothes now whatever you do dont look this way
i already saw it 
aah then forget what you saw thats an order
 
if the alliance falls then the kingdom will  theres no time to waste if we hesitate we risk losing the initiative i do think we should let the troops rest though  we must maintain morale professor and lets make sure this matter stays between us if it gets out ill struggle to forgive even you
what matter
hmm  it seems you dont comprehend the consequences of angering the emperor
understood
thank you
claude von riegan what an interesting character underneath that compassionate exterior he was always cold and calculating ordinary fools run headlong into combat without even considering the possibility of defeat but to consider ones chances and to prepare for plans to go awry  that takes real intelligence i have to say i am impressed beyond words
the majority is with us this conflict will end soon i am so moved by the alliance nobles decision that is true nobility acting in accordance with the peoples needs and wishes as war drags on those living near the front lines inevitably get the worst of it we will not see such a peaceful resolution in faerghus i am afraid as it is ruled by the royal family not a council of nobles
ive been exploring the holy mausoleum its quite interesting in there there is a mechanism i believe would allow us passage into the holy tomb but im unclear on how to activate it my research hasnt turned up much it may come down to asking the archbishop for details
your research will find something
thats a puzzler
indeed well see if its worth the trouble
did you meet my father in derdriu i guess hell be responsible for controlling the riegan territory and maintaining popular support not really sure what all that means though 
you should study more
youre probably right ill do my best
it doesnt matter
are you sure i figured youd say something about me having to study more oh i get it this is a test im definitely gonna have to brush up
war isnt kind to you if youre a recluse by the time you realize whats going on youre already under attack and if youre off by yourself you can get killed with no one ever even finding out
sounds like youre learning
isnt that a little pessimistic
got me out of my room at least thats good right
the leicester alliance is no more three hundred years of history gone and done they write operas about events like this you know im sure theyll have a talent and beautiful songstress playing you probably for edie as well i wonder if therell be romantic tension between your two characters even if its not historically accurate
the leicester alliance is no more three hundred years of history gone and done they write operas about events like this you know im sure youll be played by the most handsome actor of the time hearts will pound as he takes the stage a diva will play edie youll fall madly in love even if it isnt historically accurate
the kingdom always is cold i have hatred for the cold brigid is not cold we have no cold spirit does the goddess of f√≥dlan give protection from the cold i am wishing i knew how to ask her 
hmph my father is holding arianrhod secure our next battle will be there against him or in fhirdiad which the king is protecting
can you fight them
ha dont underestimate me ive been preparing for this for a long time
im counting on you
hah you just worry about yourself
derdrius fallen the alliance nobles have surrendered to the empire we made it through with as few losses as possible not bad all things considered  but i doubt itll be so easy to deal with faerghus
first leicester and next faerghus ah thatll be really tough look professor  fighting faerghus isnt there some way we can come to an understanding
maybe there is
yeah but edelgard and her idiot sidekick havent shown much desire to compromise have they
no
harsh but true i dont see how we can avoid whats coming
truthfully i hate the idea of planning to kill people i used to be so close with i guess everybody feels that way though
oh claude im so relieved that he managed to make it out alive youll be fighting the kingdom next right then the church isnt there some way we can do this without fighting dimitri and lady rhea i suppose not 
oh claude its too late now but its such a shame  youll be fighting the kingdom next right then the church i guess edelgard wont hesitate to cut dimitri and lady rhea down 
we may be witnessing a key moment in history hundreds of years from now your name and edelgards will be written in the history books professor
perhaps
thats a little embarrassing
what how i think its just amazing
i wonder who will decide whether we did the right thing or not  well it wont be us anyway probably the people of a future era
while the battle with the alliance is over we still need to stay vigilant both the church and the kingdom are not to be taken lightly i have the feeling well draw their attention soon weapon prep and training are of the utmost importance now more than ever
it seems all that praise of claudes ingenuity was largely unfounded a truly clever man would have realized defeat was inevitable and surrendered or failing that he could have rallied the alliance nobles to secure a real fighting chance
im no noble so it wont make much difference to me  but it hasnt really hit me yet that the alliance is finished
to think i saw the end of the leicester alliance with my own eyes i witnessed a turning point in the history of my homeland im not sure how to express my feelings right now
why not write about it
no i dont have a gift for words but perhaps ill tell my children someday if i have any
why not paint a picture
thats right ill paint it the fall of derdriu
so that posterity can remember our triumph
the battle ended without house ordelia getting involved although ive no desire to continue on with my family so from here on out its up to edelgard i have claude to thank ultimately this ended without the alliance being entirely consumed by war its all thanks to claude
i have claude to thank before the battle he considered my precarious position and told me it wouldnt matter if we fell to the empire so when you invited me i accepted without hesitation ultimately this ended without the alliance being entirely consumed by war its all thanks to claude
i wonder  was there really no way to end it without fighting claude
it couldnt be helped
youre probably right 
its better this way
i hope youre right 
i suppose the only thing i can do for him now is pray 
that he may live the rest of his life in happiness
that he may rest in peace
the worst part about going to battle is knowing you might have a friend fighting for the other side you were a mercenary professor were you always prepared for that
absolutely
guess i need to learn wont make a very good mercenary otherwise will i
i still hesitate
thats reassuring i dont think ill ever get used to it
fighting old friends  theres nothing worse my hands shake just thinking about it
im glad claude didnt die does that make me soft
i didnt want claude to die does that make me soft
ive lived at garreg mach monastery for a few decades now still the other day i got myself all turned around there are so many secret rooms and hidden passages maybe ill take the time to properly search the place care to join me i expect itd take a whole day
youre too soft im talking about claude our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way  but perhaps she is more tolerant of those who know their place
our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way  even the master tactician
it seems claude has disappeared 
claude lost in battle my goodness
do you suppose this means the end of house riegan while the crest of von riegan is not terribly rare  the long linage of the von riegan family will be broken
 its just another consequence of war
 we should mourn his death
agreed the poor boy 
does this pose an obstacle to your research
no  at the very least i think not there are other lesser crests to research yet i am a human first and a scholar second for now i grieve the fallen and pray for those still living
you know as well as i do the days coming that well have to fight the archbishop and her knights weve got some strong fighters here sure but even with all our training i dont know if we can win i just dont see how any of us can compete with the archbishop say turning into a monster
if we must fight we will
yeah what if that fights to the death  yours and mine in particular
sometimes it can be better to retreat
thats exactly what i was saying ive always appreciated how you listen to me
neither the emperor nor the empire have my allegiance it is all simply part of the agreement there is no other reason for me to be here
the alliance is just gone its hard to believe the merchants of derdriu all have nerves of steel im sure theyll be up and running again in no time
finally the kingdom  after that well battle the church i volunteered for monastery guard duty it was more for my family than anything but now from the bottom of my heart i want to see her majesty ruling this land even if it costs me my life i will protect garreg mach
i just wanted to help out my brother randolph so i aspired to be a soldier my brother puts his life on the line to fight so ill put everything i have into it too eventually the enemy will attack and when they do well defend this place to the bitter end
your next opponents will be the kingdoms army and the knights of seiros both fearsome foes put the mobility of my troops to good use and let us protect the kngdoms western battle front when this month has ended ill depart i pray that you have good luck in battle
greetings professor nothing to report you may already know this but the kingdom and the alliance were once a single entity the leaders of the alliance house riegan are actually a branch of the blaiddyd royal family in a way its just a battle of the part of blaiddyd family tree that rose in rebellion against the empire 
following the alliances defeat the black eagle strike force prepares to invade the kingdom but the kingdoms new allies  the knights of seiros  begin to make an advance of their own after appearing in ailell the valley of torment and following the border south the knights of seiros openly march to recapture the monastery at garreg mach
absorbing the alliance brings the empire one step closer to a unified f√≥dlan the black eagle strike force returns to garreg mach to plan its invasion of the kingdom unaware of the enemy lurking in the shadows
raid from the north their flag bears the symbol of the knights of seiros one of our troops has already intercepted them your majesty please give us your orders
from the north interesting  could it be they journeyed through ailell the valley of torment is the archbishop among the enemy ranks if so focus our attacks on her first
understood
our enemy knows garreg mach from inside and out they can come and go as they please it would have been best if we had detected them sooner but that cant be helped professor we must hurry and intercept them ourselves ill leave the preparations to you
heh the battle looks to be rather cumbersome we are still guarding all of garreg mach but there are undoubtedly numerous secret passages and magic traps  there is still much about this place that we do not know it is quite possible that they will attack from a location we cannot anticipate
i must head out first to give my orders ill meet up with you soon call for general randolph and general ladislava hurry
it feels like only yesterday we called this place our home  we must show these fools the error of their ways they shall pay for the sin of invading garreg mach 
oh but the professor is fighting alongside our foe the same one who saved my life 
that is true  though i find forgiveness difficult we do owe that wayward soul a debt however the fact remains that because of the professor rhea has long been tormented to think that the vessel of the goddess entrusted with the sword of the creator could go on to  ah it angers me to even think of it all that has happened has changed rhea i imagine it has changed the professor as well even if we prevail i doubt the church can ever fully return to the way it once was 
umm  brother
dear flayn i only brought you with me because you were so insistent still no matter what happens you must not go near the front lines if something were to happen to you it would utterly destroy me you are my reason for breathing do you understand
i i understand if something were to happen to you it would break my heart i could not go on either i cannot help but wonder if there is a way to end this without fighting the professor 
our surprise attack on garreg mach was a success now we just need to break through past this point
we were successful sneaking up on garreg mach all thats left is to break through past this point
lady rhea and catherine are holding back most of the empires army thereby leaving us the expeditionary force free to recapture the monastery
the archbishop and catherine are handling the bulk of the imperial army that gives us the chance to infiltrate the monastery
our enemies have followed us even here how unfortunate
your majesty the enemys movement is suspicious they may have some tactic in mind
if so then lets face them without delay form defensive lines and hold them to the death strike down all who approach
their troop composition is also strange i would bet that they are concealing additional soldiers
the enemy is transporting large quantities of flammable material into the woods they clearly intend to attack us with fire we should do all we can to prevent it
troops waiting in the woods to ambush we must avoid any suspicious areas as we advance
now
come at me so that i may put you out of your misery flayn and several church soldiers appear on the right side of the map
the time is now as long as we stand here you shall not pass
now light it up like the goddesss fiery wrath these flames will engulf our enemies
start the fire
great a path has opened for us
all right a second route is open well done on this one too
if they break through here the monastery will be    if that happens all will be lost
how much of this can you take it doesnt matter we will be reclaiming garreg mach
i knew it  shouldnt have let emotion get in the way 
shamir no i will avenge you
you fiend bearing ill will against the goddess this place will be your grave
jeralt i did it  i protected the monastery 
alois how dare you die before me
our enemys plans is in ruins still we must tread carefully
you still align yourself with the emperor what a shame lets make this quick i dont want the loser to suffer
why if it isnt shamir youre still with the knights what a surprise
youre the surprise alois i never thought id see the day youd choose anyone over rhea dont worry i wont hold back i owe an old ally the courtesy
i wont either i hope youre ready
i cannot bring myself to kill you  youre a princess of brigid a hostage of the empire
that was the truth in the past but it is a different truth now shamir  i am the will of the emperor
in that case i wont hold back
i cant believe you would try to kill lady rhea jeralt must be turning in his grave i cant protect you like i promised i have to kill you and bury you with my own hands
so youre the leader of the knights of seiros now good for you alois
indeed you seem to be doing well for yourself too the other knights are always cursing you
dont worry i wont hold back i owe an old ally the courtesy
i wont either i hope youre ready
this makes me terribly sad but this is my duty to which i must be true
farewell professor i do not imagine we shall ever meet again
father please forgive me  i am returning to mother now before you do 
flayn please no no
when i heard you were alive professor i was so happy but now  now this how can it be that you fight on that side i cannot take your life for i owe you mine even now and yet i cannot back away from this fight when this is over my brother and i will go into hiding it is the only way
trespassing on holy ground is a grave sin indeed you must atone for it with your life
im sorry rhea  for flayns sake i must take my leave to retreat 
im sorry flayn  i couldnt protect you 
father father why why
it saddens me to face you on the field of battle after all youve done for flayn i cannot approve of your actions but i also cannot follow rhea on her current course it may not change anything but allow me to make a promise to you if flayn and i survive this battle we will withdraw from the world and leave you to do as you please
we fought them off good work everyone weve repelled the principle force of the knights and defended garreg mach hubert i require a damage report at once
yes your majesty we will have to make inquiries about the status of the main army
indeed after all it seems they had rhea and catherine fighting on their side
lady rhea the unit that invaded the monastery has been completely driven away we were able to make a clean sweep of those who came to attack us however i fear we can do nothing but retreat for now
what of seteth and flayn
seteth and flayn were able to escape in another direction i have a message from them
i am sorry rhea i fear we must return to a life in hiding i detest that person with all my heart however flayns life is more important to me than all else i pray that you will one day be free from the burden of your work 
i see as expected i am the only one left mother please wait for me i promise that i will save you the filthy thief who stole you from the holy tomb i will crush them with my bare hands
lady rhea i am afraid i must report we lost seteth and flayn we were able to make a clean sweep of those who came to attack us the unit that invaded the monastery has been completely driven away a bitter disappointment i fear we can do nothing but retreat for you
seteth  flayn  first my mother and now those two have been stolen away as well must you take everything from me
lady rhea 
no amount of repentance will bring your wretched soul salvation you will be chained to the valley of torment eternally walk the desert until the skin rots from your bones  i will ensure that you pay for your sins professor in the name of the nabateans i swear it
edelgard  your majesty  i am so sorry 
silence we must tend to your wounds
it will do no good i cant be saved  you must know that ladislava has also passed  the enemy has withdrawn  you are safe now 
understood good work another loss on my watch  as more blood wets my feet they grow heavier with each step remorse resentment despair  i have dispensed with all such things to come this far
and we must keep moving forward 
hubert tell me the status of the enemy
the battle has ended in a draw with severe injuries on both sides some known commanders have been slain
the most worthy of mention among the dead was the second in command to rhea herself seteth
with the death of alois the knights of seiros have taken a huge blow as well
garreg mach has not taken much damage and so it would not be out of line to claim it as a victory for us
yes  well call that a victory although im sure they will say the same
yes your majesty
ugh what a terrible opponent that was why is the church always like this how am i supposed to train for that it was way too scary
when i saw the enemy enter garreg mach i prepared myself mentally for death i thought it would be a fine time to die but i suppose it wasnt quite the time after all 
our luck was good to have grabbed victory the church has great strength we must not have grief but must keep fighting can we be fighting now
this was certainly a momentous victory we lost a lot but we also gained a lot certain lords in the kingdom have examined the situation again and decided to join our cause changing their fealty based on just one battle  they are all a disgrace to the nobility
today our enemy held many faces i knew well  if we must fight to the death with that kind of opponent what will become of this world
theres no stopping me im ready go strike the kingdom here and now everyone must see that we can easily unite f√≥dlan dont you think
excellent job everyone the battle is over now
professor the battle is over now
while we have sustained heavy losses our foe has suffered far more
although not exactly as planned a win is a win it may be safe to say that there will be no more obstacles on our way to the next battle
we will break through the tailtean plains and then set course for fhirdiad the kingdom capital the final chapter of our fight with the kingdom and the church is close at hand
/***EOF***/
it is imperial year 1185 half a decade has passed since emperor edelgard ascended the imperial throne yet the continent of f√≥dlan still remains lost in a tempest of turmoil and bloodshed in the holy kingdom of faerghus king dimitri has welcomed archbishop rhea and her knights who were driven out of garreg mach to the kingdom capital as they work to build a unified front the war with the empire rages on to the west meanwhile claude leader of the alliance staves off imperial intervention by strategically stirring up conflicts between leicester lords in an effort to feign neutrality as events unfold edelgard and her black eagle strike force begin to take action in an attempt to break the wars current state of deadlock
you  how long do you intend to sleep your body is awake your eyes must open now and you must find the strength to stand upon those legs of yours like so much rain a pool of blood has fallen to the ground  as spears and arrows pierce the earth it weeps and even now it weeps in order to survive they kill and so the people of this world are lost in an abyss of suffering they weep as well the only one who truly knows the nature of such things is i  or rather you
im still sleepy
you are a complete and utter fool have you not changed one bit
who
excuse me are you saying you have forgotten who i am how dare you
get on your feet right now ill coddle you no more you are just like a child always needing me to hold your hand 
hey a are you awake
where am i
were in a village at the base of the monastery what are you doing in a place like this
who are you
im just a villager here what are you doing in a place like this
i honestly didnt expect to find someone floating away down the river  garreg mach is upstream of here but that place was abandoned
what do you mean
huh you dont know the church of seiros isnt there anymore though there have been some folks still living there in the five years since  well you know regardless the imperial army has taken over now
five years
what year is it
um are you feeling all right you didnt hit your head or anything did you its the ethereal moon of the year 1185 its been nearly five years since the monastery fell tomorrow was supposed to be the millennium festival but whos got time to think about things like that
the millennium festival 
uh yeah thats what i said but with the war and the archbishop still missing and all i doubt theres a soul to be found who has enough blessings worth counting
hey slow down will ya where do you think youre going
the monastery
are you crazy the imperial army is there come on i promise i wont say youre a coward just forget about going anywhere near the monastery
you just remember i tried to stop you got it its not on my conscience if you wind up dead
my students are waiting for me
students you really are crazy arent you there arent any kids anywhere near that place anymore
no need to worry about me
unbelievable 
five years ago to the day  if things had continued on as they were today would have been the millennium festival
halt whos there
it cant be professor is it really you but i searched everywhere and never found a trace my teacher  what have you been doing all this time where have you been
i was sleeping
i was dead
joking at a time like this you do realize its been five years since you disappeared  do you have any idea how guilty i felt how broken my heart was i searched high and low after you vanished although there was no proof i somehow knew you were still alive all this time i led everyone as best i could and fought with all my heart its been a difficult path to walk alone
 welcome back my teacher im so happy that youre safe five years  such a short time but it fells like an eternity ago do you  still feel the way you did all those years ago you said that you would fight at my side no matter how many enemies we should amass as for me my resolve has not faltered im determined as ever to see this through to the end i will defeat the false goddess i will save this world from those creatures and give humanity its freedom back
so my teacher are you prepared to stand with me
i am
i i thank you truly now then i assume you understand the situation at hand yes
i really was asleep all this time 
another joke or are you telling the truth i suppose you must be in that case ill tell you all that has transpired as you slumbered these past five years
 and that is where we are now the war is at a stalemate dimitri is the new king of faerghus its clear that his territory will continue to support the church meanwhile claudes leadership has thrown the alliance into chaos he maintains neutrality in their internal conflict the situation has created a deadlock weve been awaiting an opportunity for our squadron to return to the monastery with you in the fray i believe the state of the war will shift immediately the church as well as the kingdom and the alliance  the time has come to eliminate them all
the kingdom and the alliance 
although we were of different houses we were companions who lived and learned together some of our ranks are hesitant to battle against them however knowing that youre alive is sure to raise their spirits
the church of seiros 
rhea seteth the knights and the others are in prime condition theyve set up their base within the kingdom capital the immaculate one and her family have yet to fight on the front lines however we must eventually face and defeat them it would mean a great deal to have you with us when the time comes
good well then i believe its time for a little reunion the black eagle strike force never lost faith they knew you were alive and have been awaiting your return lets not keep them waiting any longer
well now that face is certainly familiar i am glad to see you alive and well professor
professor its me bernie do you remember me i cant believe youre here
i cant believe it is this a dream can we really be this lucky
this is not dreaming our professor is with us again  welcome to the back i mean welcome back
our group isnt the same without you i am overjoyed to see you again
its been so long seeing you again fills my heart with hope
great now everything will be easy  um thats great youre safe professor im deeply deeply moved
quite the reunion isnt it professor everyones happy to see you
come on edelgard you must be happier than all of us combined
she took it really hard when you disappeared professor
of course we did our very best in your absence and there was never a day that we doubted you would return to us
edelgard has been leading us as emperor but after you disappeared it became apparent that you were her anchor
it gives me regret to be admitting this but our power is not enough the only one who can be meeting edelgards expectations is you professor
most impressive of all is your uncanny ability to bring a smile to everyones face
in the years since you vanished we have not lost anyone from our ranks
we all longed for your presence and your leadership myself included
it seems fitting to view this as a new beginning for the black eagle strike force we already have our target
yes we must eliminate the alliance before moving on to fight the kingdom and the church however that doesnt necessarily mean we must occupy the entirety of the alliance house riegan stands against the empire  therefore our target is derdriu the aquatic capital
we must cross the airmid river which separates the empire and the alliance to do that we must take the largest bridge across it the great bridge of myrddin myrddin connects the monastery and the imperial capital to the east it is the shortest route there
an alliance stronghold has been built at the great bridge well take that and then head north at the same time we must defeat the one who defends it judith von daphnel if we can also take control of daphnel territory it would be greatly beneficial to us prepare yourselves the next battle will be a momentous one join me my friends as we begin our journey to bring peace and solace to this war ravaged world
professor  im sorry to have dragged you into the fight again so soon after our reunion but you appeared at a most opportune time im truly humbled by your support my teacher thank you
you can count on me
and so i will im hoping your ability from five years prior are still intact
i hope im not rusty 
you may be worried but you shouldnt be you always manage to pull through
make sure youre ready to head out ok
allow me to brief you on the details of our situation the empire firmly controls the western portion of faerghus however the central and eastern regions continue to put up heavy resistance the strongholds in these regions are arianrhod the fortress city and fhirdiad the kingdom capital we cannot control faerghus until we have taken both of these cities as for the alliance houses gloucester and ordelia seem predisposed to to capitulate to us however due to interference from houses riegan and goneril we have yet to secure their cooperation claude obviously hopes to keep the alliance whole through diplomacy but because we have had to focus our efforts against the church until now our forces have yet to meet his we have only recently begun to take the fight to alliance territory
the last five years have been difficult at times my relationship with edelgard is rather contentious due to the incident with my father nevertheless i cannot abandon my familys duties as duke aegir i must play my part in the imperial army edelgard intends to abolish the nobility but i know i can dissuade her from doing so
professor do you know how happy i was to hear you were still alive ill tell you how happy  for the past two days i havent had my morning or my afternoon naps
morning nap
yes
you were taking those naps every day
well as long as we werent marching cant sleep much then but its not for want of trying 
by the way with professor hanneman not around  ive occupied his room so i am well equipped to perform research on you isnt that exciting
all right im ready to fight lets do this
whoa slow down
youre right i gotta keep it under control or im gonna wear myself out too quickly maybe ill just get rid of a few monsters or is that too risky right before a mission
im counting on you
leave it to me i can take on the whole most of the enemys army
i know my limits now professor
are we leaving for battle i heard its a long march but its fine ive had plenty of time to stay inside lately so i think its time i went out yeah i can do this no more bernie bear
bernie bear
oh yeah people call me bernie bear since i hole up in my den all the time not anymore though
thats the spirit
yes but um please dont put me up front ok
laaa la laaa la laaa  professor oh my its so good to see you these days so many old friends seem to be disappearing but you  youre here its incredible to see you again after five years i have a feeling your name will go down in history
edelgard is controlling the empire she is putting the pressure on the kingdom and alliance empire and religion are at open war it will be difficult for us at first but corrupt nobles are many that means the common people will rebel and be joining our side with you professor the battle tides will ah will turn i have certainty
for five years ive fought for the empire ive cut down hordes of enemies now i have the same look in my eyes that the boar used to have in his the look of a savage beast who loves nothing but destruction and violence
i dont see that look in your eyes
i hope not
youre right
hmph i can hardly hold it against him anymore
you and edelgard must not disappoint me mark my words the future youre building had better be worth all this bloodshed
since you came back everyones been smiling just you being here makes an incredible difference i cant express how reassuring it is to see you
hey professor its been a really long time hasnt it the last five years have been full of heartbreak not from girls but friends and family becoming enemies one of the things that kept me going was the hope youd return and now here you are a lot has changed but youre back and its the first time i can remember being happy in a while
i have good friends in both the alliance and faerghus so this fighting weighs heavily on me  i cant bear the thought of battling the knights of seiros to the death i have to keep my chin up though right lets press on together professor
my father used to be a knight in service of the royal family of faerghus for a time he was at the monastery but apparently hes back in faerghus serving as a knight again which means if i fight with this family ill eventually have to face my own father 
if you want to leave now is the time
dont say that i know what im doing and im ready for anything
does that frighten you
terribly but ive accepted my fate im ready for anything
of course if at all possible i would prefer not to fight my father this is the path i chose i have no regrets
his highness the new king is in process of unifying the kingdom under his command his powerful army has joined forces with the knights of seiros who moved their seat to faerghus and now theyre presenting a unified front against the imperial army theyre our greatest enemy absolutely
i wonder if we can win
presently its doubtful thats why im in favor of first capturing alliance lands
can you fight against your homeland
i dont relish the idea but theres no turning back now for now we should focus our efforts on the alliance the kingdom and church can come afterwards
judith who defends the great bridge of myrddin is a formidable opponent we cant afford to drop our guard
house gloucester will remain staunchly neutral in this war even if we press into alliance territory my father is no threat to the empire lady edelgard surely understands that the great bridge of myrddin however is another story i hear it is held by judith of house daphnel she is renowned for her military prowess we would do well not to underestimate her
hey professor what have you been up to for five years hope you havent gone soft i got myself into perfect shape took all five years of pushing my muscles to the limit but look
you look very strong
you bet i do you gotta get training if you want to catch up
i dont really see a difference 
what cant you see my muscles do i gotta undress so you can get a better look
i thought you might be at the monastery thats why i made my way here i decided to follow your path because i believed in you but then you vanished now that youve returned i have my guiding light once again welcome back professor
im relieved youre here professor it seems weve reached a stalemate on the war front i admit im feeling apprehensive about fighting the alliance 
you have to cast aside your doubts
i agree its time to shelve my personal feelings and focus on the bigger picture
you dont have to do anything if you dont want to
no i have to shelve my personal feelings there are bigger things at play here
ill fight at full force im counting on you to lead us to victory professor
my adoptive father sent me here so our family name would be known he doesnt care which side wins the empire or the alliance however even if he tells me to come home i intend to stay i want to see this new world edelgard dreams of
im so glad to see youre all right i really regretted not being able to keep the promise i made to my mentor
mentor
captain jeralt obviously im still his first and greatest apprentice you know
promise
captain jeralt told me that if anything should happen to him then i should stick by you
im going to do just what he asked ill be right here to support you from now on
ah
ah
at long last we meet again i knew you were alive i knew you could survive and five years on you arrive were reunited im glad i kept watch for you in the downstream villages all that time i was so devoted to finding you that i left the knights of seiros now i serve no one  other than you ill protect you just as i promised captain jeralt i would all those years ago
whats that look on your face surprised to see me im a mercenary always have been even when i was with the knights of seiros i never was too attached to f√≥dlan i was considering leaving soon but i might change my mind if youre around
youve finally joined us havent you i attached myself to the imperial army as well seemed the thing to do i feel i owe it to edelgard to set my past feelings about the empire aside i am happy to help her its strange isnt it after five years the three professors are together once more i am most curious though you say you were asleep for five whole years incredible perhaps this is another effect of your crest i do look forward to investigating you in greater detail
we can talk about that
wonderful news i am most excited to begin we must find the time of course
uh maybe later 
ill have to be content with observing you wherever you go then i cannot waste any opportunity
after the battle five years ago the imperial army occupied garreg mach the cathedral and several other buildings were destroyed but  weve done some repair work here and there and were using the buildings as a base of operations as for me well the church moved its headquarters to faerghus and ive seen no reason to follow when i returned to enbarr i received a summons from her majesty and i chose to answer
you survived how very fortunate  were you dead i wouldnt be able to fight you but you are very much alive now ive a chance to kill you
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
ah a new face i am randolph von bergliez im the guardian of this place wait a moment  im sure ive seen you somewhere before
five years ago 
im a professor
ah yes youre her majestys professor youre alive um  oh this is my little sister fleche shes just a rookie but shes helping me as my assistant
h hello im fleche von bergliez its nice to meet you i know im inexperienced but im going to do my best you can count on me to look after my big brother
i heard youre planning to march into alliance territory ill be here to guard the fort
greetings professor nothing to report whats that do i have brothers in the church you really are well informed my older twin works for the knights of seiros but i think hes just a grunt not a noble gate keeper like yours truly unlike me hes very devout he left the empire a long time ago
the newly crowned king of the holy kingdom of faerghus dimitri has declared fealty to the church of seiros and is raising an army in preparation for all out war with the empire as the leader of the alliance claude maintains a facade of neutrality amidst infighting between those who support and those who oppose the empire meanwhile the black eagle strike force plans to capture alliance territory before edelgard takes the war to the kingdom and church of seiros with sights set on capturing derdriu at the center of house riegans territory she leads a march across the great bridge of myrddin to establish a bridgehead
the black eagle strike force has an unexpected encounter with someone thought to have died years prior amidst the joy your forces prepare to invade alliance territory
we are about to commence the attack on the great bridge of myrddin but first allow me a moment of your time
what do you need
it is something i can only ask of you listen well  it concerns lady edelgards uncle the regent of the empire lord arundel although he is currently cooperating with her majesty he maintains his own sizable military troops it seems to me that his plans differ from our own i assume you recall a certain groups scheming from five years ago solon and kronya  they both served lord arundel
why must we cooperate
he must be dealt with
professor i understand how you must be feeling considering what they did to your father i know it must be foul to even consider cooperating with their kind however their power is essential for us at present edelgard also strongly opposed the idea at first our enemy is the church of seiros itself it cannot be toppled with the empires might alone those working under lord arundel are extremely hostile toward the church and the enemy of our enemy is  well i think you sufficiently understand by now
are you sure thats a good idea
until all of f√≥dlan is united it is a necessary evil as for how we deal with them afterward time will tell regardless her majesty and i wish to join our power with yours
you should know that in her heart her majesty regards that group as enemies of herself and her family they used her father the former emperor as a puppet and murdered her siblings with their vile experimentation i believe her majesty may have told you some of this herself that is why this was a very painful decision for her to make
i will do all i can to ensure her suffering is not in vain and i hope i can count on you to do the same as for all i have told you please keep it in mind as we march forward more importantly i implore you to fight as best you can for edelgard  from the bottom of my heart i beg this of you
well be capturing the great bridge of myrddin a key strategic location of the leicester alliance claude will surely be sending reinforcements so we must prevail before they arrive
our opponent is judith the so called hero of daphnel we can handle her so long as we dont get careless
the boy said to run if i was in danger but  i could never do that ill hold out until reinforcements arrive
judith im so glad youre safe claude sent me here with reinforcements
sorry to keep you waiting judith were the reinforcements
why do i have to put up with orders from that false leader 
because youre from the smallest noble house in all the alliance you whiner
enemy reinforcements  we didnt finish in time dont let them secure the ballista
i am helping claude build the future of f√≥dlan
ungh  i should have known this would happen 
ignatz damn it  such a good kid he died too young 
judith im sorry  i leave the rest to you 
leonie you had such a full life ahead of you  i wish i could take your place 
doesnt matter who you are i wont hold back and i wont fall to the empire
youre all captain jeralts enemies and i will avenge him here
this is it  claude im sorry i couldnt defend the bridge all who are able retreat
dont let her escape if we take her out now the daphnel territory will be ours that will allow us to march safely through the alliance
avoided death yet again huh ill join claude and prepare for a counter attack
judiths escape will widen the battlefront our strategys failed 
guh it looks like im done for claude  im sorry 
judith no
the knights on the other side of this bridge are mine i cant just let you cross
guh  if only i had joined the empire sooner 
we cant place the future of f√≥dlan in edelgards hands if youre allied with the empire i have no choice but to fight you
outta my way ignatz i dont wanna have to fight you
stop deluding yourself you joined the empire didnt you consider the consequences i dont want to fight you either raphael but this is war
ignatz 
professor you know captain jeralts killer was connected to the empire why did you side with them answer me traitor
acheron what a pleasant surprise i was concerned i might have to kill someone decent
ha house gloucester is already finished ive already taken control of your land
thats quite enough of your spinning weathervane time for you to die
alliance soldiers judith has fallen further conflict is futile if you surrender your lives will be spared lay down your weapons immediately
you have all fought well with this victory we now have a foothold in the alliance the imperial army will cross the airmid river and push the front lines forward the fight will continue but do not allow that to stop you from taking pride in our hard won victory
ah this should put a stop to one of edelgards choice phrases well done professor i believe it was if only the professor were here we could forge ahead and change the tides of this war
ferdinand it is not necessary to tell the professor such things
were not the only ones benefiting the whole imperial army is stronger now
yes it seems the empire finally has both of its legs to stand on dont you agree
you make it sound as though i cant run the empire on my own perhaps its more apt to say that the pegasus has recovered its horn
judith of daphnel  what a magnificent warrior im happy to have the professor back just like old times but i dont think ill ever get used to this cruel exchange of lives 
when there is something you must not be conceding you must keep fighting the fighting has been continuing for five years but now i am again witnessing the professors power
i hate fighting but with the professor here maybe its slightly less terrible oh but everyone is working so hard stop it bernie you cant be the only one complaining
im glad to see everyone so inspired it seems the reappearance of the professor has done much to raise your morale
do you not feel the same hubert come now be honest with yourself now we must take advantage of the situation and blaze ahead our path is still a long one
/***EOF***/
together the people of f√≥dlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends they recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike but each person must still walk their chosen path alone with each day the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky a silent reminder perhaps of some inescapable truth 
we somehow managed to escape
this is one of the imperial armys provisional camps here we can organize our forces
before we go any further i want all of you to really ask yourselves if youre certain you wish to join us as expected flayn has chosen to leave our ranks
when i saw our professor running off i ran about as fast as i could to catch up
caspar death finds those who run without thinking you gave no thought to the war fog  my grandfather was the leader of brigid and i hope for us to be allies with the empire i will be staying
w was this a good idea did i make the right choice oh but my family is part of the empire and our professor is here 
youre fine here with us bernie though its true that certain houses were against the imperial princess 
i assume you are referring to my family i must believe that the conclusion i came to was the correct one  you are the emperor now  i am the only one left who is qualified to guide you at this point
im only here because i know it would be troublesome to stand against you
im not just here for you edie im here to follow our dear professor of course i dont have any territory to offer  so hubie may not even want me here
the greater our numbers the better your reasons for being here are of no consequence
i think i understand where you are coming from but now i wish to hear of your resolve like you i have risen to meet my destiny i cut this path and i will see it through to the end following me is akin to pointing a sword to the goddess herself one misstep and we fall to ruin you have now witnessed the archbishops true self she is a cruel beast those who rule this world use that beasts power to fabricate miracles all to control those who blindly believe in the goddess they conceal the truth and force their lies on the nobility they mercilessly annihilate anyone who defies them i know this because i have lived it after what you have seen is there any room for doubt the church of seiros has great influence and power their control over the lords of the kingdom and the alliance is nearly absolute we are the only ones who can stop this indomitable enemy that has plagued our world for ages we fight for humanity for all of f√≥dlan if you dare walk this path with me take your first step its now or never
thank you my friends we are the true face of the empire and we will triumph
that was incredible lady edelgard
thank you honestly im relieved they really chose to follow me  i was resolved to move forward alone if i had to but in my heart i hoped it wouldnt come to that
so long as i am here you will never be alone please do not forget that and it would seem that the professor also has a key role to play in this
youre right now i must speak with our teacher please make preparations the messenger should be here shortly
consider it done
professor may i speak with you
of course
i appreciate it i 
whats wrong
im just anxious it feels like the weight of this burden is crushing me at this very moment on my orders im starting a war an army far larger than the one that attacked the holy tomb last month will soon be locked in battle long devised strategies are unfolding across f√≥dlan leaders are deciding their loyalties and preparing to fight  so many generals and soldiers will die its inevitable that civilians will get caught up in the chaos as well there will be countless casualties with a single command the flames of war will rage across all corners of this realm and i am the one who is giving the order
this is the path you chose isnt it
yes it is there is no turning back
do you wish to stop
no there is no turning back now
no matter how much blood flows at my feet i will not relent we must break the bonds that the depraved church has placed on f√≥dlan these sacrifices will allow us to create a future where we never need sacrifice again it may seem contradictory but its the only way heh listen to me i made up my mind long ago yet here i am seeking your approval tell me the truth my teacher are you happy with your decision to stand by my side unlike me you can still walk away from all of this this path leads to the death of the archbishop and the servants of the church can you live with that
i chose this path too
i never thought  im sorry it was a foolish question i believe in you professor and you believed in me with that knowledge i have the strength to keep fighting lets go  theres something i need to say to hubert
your majesty the latest report indicates that our main army is advancing as planned also the preparations for your manifesto are almost complete
manifesto
we will distributing our manifesto to every lord within f√≥dlan we will expose the dark side of the church of seiros and the foul practices of the nobles from the kingdom and the alliance we will force the people of f√≥dlan to open their eyes to the truth and relinquish any remaining conviction to unite against the empire certain nobles have already offered their support
there are other nobles who oppose the church we will condemn those who deserve condemnation and forgive those who deserve forgiveness we have already purged some of the imperial nobles who are morally rotten my father among them how unfortunate
and soon we will invade and conquer garreg mach our main army has already departed the imperial capital they will arrive at the monastery in two weeks time there we will join forces with them as for us id like your opinion on how we should be positioned within the army
we are the imperial shield
we are the imperial sword
your majesty wishes to fight alongside the professor correct in that case you will not be incorporated into the empires main army your squad can move freely about the battlefield under supervision of the imperial forces  that would be most prudent
now that im the emperor we cant let it slip that im following your command in battle professor
i fully object to the notion of you fighting on the front lines
hubert weve already discussed this
my apologies  i overstepped
now that the details are settled all thats left is come up with a name for ourselves in honor at our time at the academy how about we call ourselves the black eagle strike force
i love it
im so happy you feel that way i must confess that i spent all night thinking about it
i hope we can live up to that name
with you as our leader im confident we will to me that name represents us soaring toward a new dawn freely as an eagle
isnt that a bit much
it seems we have differing tastes i suppose well have to agree to disagree
ill leave it to you to prepare the black eagle strike force for departure
we will join forces with the main army and attack garreg mach its a fortress built on steep ground but its never seen battle that means we dont know much about it from a military perspective but if we use all of the power at our disposal we will capture it
i wonder if we can win
we have to try
from a purely mathematical standpoint we most certainly have the power to win if the battle becomes a clash of beasts with inhuman strength  you will be our only hope i believe in you im relying on you to lead the black eagle strike force to victory
it is not up to her majesty to bring the students to our cause that task falls to you those who have forsaken their homelands to join the empire will be feeling vulnerable you are uniquely able to provide emotional support please use that gift to guide others down the path that lady edelgard has laid before us i ask you to do this from the bottom of my heart
i asked edelgard what happened to my father he was dismissed as prime minister and is under arrest in the imperial capital he always was a greedy arrogant man some would say that this is the fate he deserves and yet i cannot help but feel indignant after all his hard work for the empire to be disgraced like this i am conflicted professor i do not know what to do as the next duke aegir should i follow edelgard into battle
the most important nobles in the empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor my father included i didnt think it possible that the imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily however it seems that both my father and caspars are supporting edelgard  having both the minister of domestic affairs and minister of military affairs on your side gives you total control over the empires military and finances they must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing 
that could have gotten dangerous fast if i stayed at the monastery i wouldve had to fight my father we arent especially close but hes not an opponent id want to face id almost rather fight a monster anyway it looks like hes going to be leading the western units i wonder if well wind up fighting the kingdoms army and who decided to fight for the church 
i dont even get my own room here at least i had that at home but speaking of home hubert told me something he said my father was stripped of his title i guess he did as he pleased and opposed edelgard wait does that mean my fathers going to be home all the time now on second thought i think im fine right here
edelgard became emperor and raised an army huh who knew the kid had it in her i mean yeah of course i knew shed be emperor eventually but  the more i think about it the more surprised i am i wonder whos going to win
its worrisome
it is we might have to fight against others from the academy and thats  i cant think about it
we will not lose
thinking about it makes me scared were fighting the knights of seiros still i know youll figure something out
the empire and brigid were once warring with each other but now i have made the decision to be fighting with the empire it is a choice of irony i feel but i am having no regret my belief is with you and with edelgard
ive been preparing to take this path my own path  not my old mans and not the boars
i cant bring myself to trust the church of seiros not after they killed lonato and my brother i need to know the truth even if it means turning my weapon on faerghus i guess lonato would be happy to hear me say that if he were still around
ive gone and done it now huh what would my old man say if he knew id sided with the empire his highness must be angry dimitri gets super scary when hes like that i wonder how im going to die  ugh my knees turn to jelly just thinking about it no i cant think that way i promised to fight alongside you im here until the end heh listen to me im terrified but i feel so calm
surely this is what the goddess willed isnt it i feel she would not have wanted the church of seiros to become what it has 
um professor  im ok with fighting whoever we need to but i really dont want to battle my father  oh but i know that something is wrong with the church  and more than that i believe in you and i trust your word you lead and ill follow
i may return to galatea territory and try to convince my father to join our cause its possible that  no in my heart i know that my father wont never listen still i must get him to see reason that this is the only way to ensure our familys future
ive decided to ally myself with lady edelgard father will doubtless understand my reasoning house gloucester has always had good intentions in its dealings with the empire of course this does mean that i will no longer be able to avoid a confrontation with claude it is unfortunate we were classmates after all
no need to worry about me i got no complaints as long as my little sis is safe sure i lived on alliance land but that doesnt mean i served their lords im sure this is the right path seeing as youre the one who picked it professor
to think that things would come to this even a few months ago i never couldve imagined it i believe in you professor so im steeling myself i cant promise that ill be useful in battle but im not running away from the fight
if the church is behind the current state of things  this society in which only crests are valued  then i have no need of it edelgard is taking the shortest path to change no matter how drastic her measures i agree that this is the only way that said if edelgard strays from her noble path i trust you will set her straight again wont you i am counting on you professor
imagine making half the world your enemy for the sake of realizing your own ideals  edelgard is so radiant and strong compared to someone like me  what if i have the power to change the world too even just a little bit 
so youve turned against the church to ally with the empire too huh i never pressed him for details but captain jeralt was always suspicious of lady rhea wasnt he im on your side no matter what i promised him id support you and thats what i plan to do
i believe this is the first time we have met my name is ladislava i have the great honor of leading lady edelgards personal guard her majesty is hard on others as she is on herself she may seem composed but that is only because she conceals her more passionate emotions for that reason she is often misunderstood but now she has you by her side  i find that most reassuring i look forward to working with you
im randolph von bergliez im not very high in the ranks yet but im more or less a general just like caspar i am from house bergliez my mother married into house bergliez after i was born so my position within the family is rather lowly  but im determined to make something of myself in this battle to bring glory to my part of the family for the sake of my mother and sister
we will soon arrive at garreg mach monastery forcing a surrender here is extremely significant both strategically and symbolically of course this is personal as well this is where we all came together to learn and grow i have no intention of yielding to our former classmates so i ask that you prepare yourselves for anything
im not thinking about friends right now and im certainly not prepared
damn it dont go around saying things that lower morale before we even get started im ready lets go lets fight
i have nothing to lose aside from my friends who are here with me does that answer satisfy you
i have been ready for this since leaving my land of home i will fight and win
how can you prepare to fight maybe i can prepare to prepare 
there is no reason i cannot be prepared it is my duty to stand up and battle
thank you all now lets talk strategy
as the raiding force we will attack the area nearest to the monastery the knights of seiros certainly wont stand down after they catch sight of her majesty and the professor at the same time the remaining areas will be surrounded and annihilated by the main army in other words we are the decoy that must suppress the enemys most elite soldiers
we know more about the area near the monastery than anyone else in the imperial army still we must prepare for the worst its possible we will have to face the archbishops true form  the immaculate one fight with all you have but dont be reckless as promised i will leave the command to the professor
we will not lose
naturally with both her majesty and yourself on our side defeat is impossible
i will protect you all
not only will we all survive this but we will undoubtedly emerge victorious
this will be our first battle as the black eagle strike force all the more reason to prevail
garreg mach
friends our opportunity for victory will come but first we must see to our defenses
the citys defenders are trying to stall for time we must crush them swiftly we should be wary of ambushes as well
ladislava is being pushed on the left flank we must push back with equal force
just what we need i knew her majestys allies would help us out
apologies for the trouble your majesty
we will lend the empire strength 

dont worry were allies now  i understand you must have many questions but theyll have to wait until after the battle
seteth flayn gilbert  you put your lives on the line to protect us i would have preferred to have more time to prepare but we cannot delay any longer come forth protect garreg mach monastery from these despicable rebels
ill crush them all
her enemies are my enemies
you shall not pass i will protect garreg mach
must protect garreg mach  i must protect everyone 
retreat while you still can flayn i beg you
understood  stay safe fa  brother
unfortunately you must die here you should never have defied the goddess
in my masters name i cannot allow myself to fall here  i must withdraw
you will survive this hardship just hold on
i will show no mercy to anyone who attacks rhea
i cannot yield 
seteth please do not overextend yourself i am still in this fight
im sorry flayn  withdraw if you must 
professor why do you not see the cruelty of this
if you side with the empire  if you turn your sword on the church and the kingdom  i care not who you are i will end you just the same
annette throw down your arms
im sorry father but i have made my choice im not going back to the monastery to the kingdom or to you father
forgive me goddess annette if you side with the empire i will have no choice but to kill you
traitor i will not forgive you for turning on rhea
i am thunder catherine and i will slay all of lady rheas enemies including you
lady rhea im sorry please stay safe
all is well catherine you must not die here
i gotta kill you
lady rhea i couldnt fight hard enough im sorry 
cyril  your sacrifice will not be in vain
so you have sullied yourself by joining with the rebels i hope you came prepared to breathe your last
raaaargh
i trusted you lady rhea trusted you i wont let you live after what youve done
ill protect lady rhea against anyone even if its you ill fight ya as hard as i can
you  how dare you betray me  you worthless piece of garbage  i will punish you myself
no matter your reasons i cannot permit you to go on living any longer
the feeling is mutual i must put a stop to your reign of tyranny
you must know what a fool you are the greatest of sins is to make an enemy of the goddess herself
i have only made an enemy of the church not of the faith
you will not be forgiven
professor look out
the castle is crumbling we must escape
professor take cover
professor
in imperial year 1181 the new adrestian emperor edelgard von hresvelg led a strategic assault against the monastery at garreg mach though her own losses were great her foes had no choice but to surrender archbishop rhea commanded the knights of seiros leading from the front lines against the imperial army after a hard fought battle she was forced to retreat to fhirdiad the capital of faerghus where she must now plan her next move with this single attack the adrestian empire officially launched its offensive against the holy kingdom of faerghus and the leicester alliance the unification of f√≥dlan has begun
/***EOF***/
with the capture of arianrhod complete the imperial army moves to invade the kingdom capital they plot to send troops toward now vulnerable fraldarius territory and plan to attack fhirdiad from two sides
so  arianrhod has fallen rodrigue  i swear that i will not allow your death to be in vain 
so  arianrhod has fallen rodrigue felix ingrid  i swear that i will not allow your deaths to be in vain 
the scouts have just now returned it seems the imperial army is marching toward the kingdom capital are you certain about this dimitri as king do you think it wise to intercept them yourself
no need to worry yourself even if i am defeated the blaiddyd bloodline will live on and the kingdoms territory has never been rich in resources if the castle falls under siege our loss is inevitable i will deploy my army onto the plains and wait for the enemy please position your forces so that they can flank the imperial army
yes given the present situation making the plains our battlefield is a logical choice i have no objection however 
there is only one person i am after i have no interest in any other prey
i will take you at your word erasing the other childs existence is my task and mine alone i will get you back mother  i promise 
what do you think lady edelgard will they shut themselves inside of fhirdiad
they will try to intercept us of course fhirdiad will not fall so easily even so  if were to cut off their supply with a large army it would eventually fall it makes much more sense for them to wager everything on a victory at the tailtean plains
the tailtean plains 
the same plains where the so called divine seiros defeated nemesis the king of liberation in a comeback victory over 1000 years ago and about 400 years ago the hero loog created the kingdom by defeating the emperor of the time on those very plains their goal must be to recreate that scene
yes i suppose so although the imperial army is powerful if we were to compare the strength of our best to the best of the knights of seiros we would likely come up short the kingdoms army and house blaiddyd are also renowned for their unmatched persistence on the battlefield it can be assumed that their one and only goal will be to strike you down
are you telling me to stay off the battlefield
naturally you are their aim your majesty you must know it only makes sense to keep you out of their reach
and you must know that at a time like this i absolutely cannot withdraw
of course i know that that is why i will refrain from asking you again to stay away from the battlefield
the immaculate one descendants of the 10 elites and other extremely fearsome foes await us but with the help of our friends we have a chance of defeating them were the only ones who can within our group i am included among those with the king of strength we need to win i absolutely will not remove myself from the front lines professor you have that same strength as well whether or not you realize it yet
of course
as emperor i must not die in this war and it would be unacceptable to lose you as well
i will protect you
please dont get yourself killed trying to protect me
until the very end well survive this trial together understood
this month we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the kingdom capital of fhirdiad i have no intention of retreating to garreg mach after weve come this far we will only return after weve conquered fhirdiad and put an end to this war be sure to steel your heart and ready yourself for the battle ahead
im ready for anything
are you certain if so please help me raise the morale of our allies
ill do what i can
im sorry to burden you but please look after our allies as well
im not sure ill be ready in time 
we have no choice i have every faith that you are capable of this
tch lord arundel as long as he exists lady edelgard will 
just who is that man
i believe i have explained before that he is the one who commanded the likes of solon and kronya cornelia whom we defeated arianrhod was also one of his an irksome sort we must not fail to be rid of him he is a maggot crawling in the filth of the world feeding off the empire like a parasite
fhirdiad the kingdom capital  from the empires perspective it seems like the northernmost edge of the world i have come a long way following you and edelgard to think what if i had succeeded duke aegir as prime minister i would never have had all these experiences
youve really grown up
i hope that is true i used to be so naive 
youll always be a noble through and through
please do not tease professor i think all of this has changed me a little bit
for now let us join together and walk the path that her majesty lays out
when you think of it as one approaches the end of a war the sacrifices only grow larger dont they the winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow  while those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor neither side will give i only wish wed consider those who lose their lives in that struggle
were far from safe ourselves
yes exactly my point lets be careful to ensure we dont lose our own lives professor
its a necessary sacrifice
perhaps but that doesnt make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice
its better than dragging the war out
i can appreciate that but just because a choice is better does not mean that its good
all right off to the kingdoms capital we go huh i feel like ive said that before
youre imagining things
my imagination eh you usually know what youre talking about still this is gonna bug me 
its not your imagination
yeah you usually know what youre talking about i just cant remember when i woulda said it
lets head for the kingdom capital
all right im fired up and ready to go
professor what should i do everyones acting like this is leading up to the final chapter in a book or something is the battle ahead really going to be that climatic am i not taking it seriously enough
youre doing just fine
you think so all right i believe you im ready for this i am yeah were going to win
you could be showing more resolve
i know i know but i dont wanna die
what you really need to do is relax
yeah youre probably right i should take a breath and try to calm down
were almost to the kingdom capital of fhirdiad just imagine the war might almost be over but is it true that arianrhod was annihilated what in the world happened what is the seiros church really
well find out if we conquer the kingdom capital
fair enough lets just focus on this battle right now
its impossible to say right now
of course professor i trust you ok
for now just trust in me
i always have and i always will
i have worries what have i been achieving when the war is ended i will be returning to brigid with many much new potential but have i had enough growth to become the ruler
yes you should be proud
i have gratitude i will take your words into my heart
only you can answer that
this is the truth i will fight with all of my strength so that i will know with certainty
brigid pride technique and culture  i will be showing all of the world who we are
they used to call my father the shield of faerghus now hes gone and arianrhod has fallen yet the knights of seiros remain as does the boar what terrifies me most is his stubbornness hell keep on fighting to the last man hes a monster ive seen it firsthand
i hear that house blaiddyd commands some strong and well trained troops people say theyre fiercely devoted and will gladly die for their king reminds me of lonatos men the ones we faced back in magdred unlike those civilian soldiers though here were up against the best that the faerghus army has to offer its going to be a hard battle but if theres a peaceful tomorrow waiting on the other side itll be worth it
ive been thinking about how weve got our own ideas about justice and so does the kingdom and whats coming its not just a battle between us and them its our ideals that are fighting whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong thats how it goes  but nobodys willing to talk or compromise so well fight to the death to prove the other guys wrong it wont be an easy battle but lets make sure we come back alive right professor
when i first enrolled in the officers academy i never thought it would come to this i cant believe were waging war against the church no less
do you regret it
there are some things that i regret but i dont think i made the wrong decision
are you ready to face this
yes of course
even if our enemy is lady rhea herself i am prepared to fight
im sure my father will be waiting in fhirdiad if i can avoid it id rather not fight him  but i dont think my father is capable of betraying the royal family of betraying dimitri i must be prepared to do what i have to
im counting on you
right
dont push yourself too hard
im alright i still stand by my decision to trust in you
professor  lets make sure we win
claude was known as the master tactician there wasnt a situation he couldnt strategize his way out of whereas king dimitri is known as the tempest king he is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield we still havent ever faced him head on can we do this
we can
yes of course we can im sorry i let my uncertainty get the better of me
ill see this through
ah professor ever the reliable one
we have you and we have edelgard not to mention many other allies we can rely upon together we can overcome even the most formidable foe
personally i take no issue with attacking lady rhea but the eagerness of my fellow nobles does vex me despite so many grand displays of piety from them in the past it gives me the impression that faith is little more than a tool they use to maintain their positions of power
disappointed in the nobility
i suppose i am in no position to judge them being among their number myself still it irritates me
is religion obsolete then
if it is no longer useful as a tool then i expect the nobles will cease to give it any credence
what is a nobles duty truly i hope we will discover an answer in the conflict ahead
hyah next ups the kingdom capital were coming for you whoa that sounds familiar have i said that before
youre imagining things
really youre probably right its not like weve invaded the kingdom capital before
its not your imagination
really does that mean weve invaded the kingdom capital before
lets head for the kingdom capital
yeah lets do it professor i just gotta get my muscles prepped and ready first
once the kingdom capital falls all of f√≥dlan will be united under the banner of the empire isnt it thrilling were going to make history
only if we win
well yes i suppose thats true
unless we lose
hah i dont think that will happen
lets stay calm and focus on the battle
yes of course ill do my best
our opponents may be strong but with you on our side we cant lose
if we win this battle it will be an end to the kingdom and to the church under the empire an era of peace would begin  many people are cleaving to this notion but i wonder if it would really end up as such
it will
such resolve its convincing to say the least
it wont
i worry as much myself
its hard to say
its true its nothing but hypotheticals at this point
i wonder  was the collapse of arianrhod really the churchs doing or could it be that  hm never mind me just thinking aloud
dear goddess 
praying again
yes i was praying for your safety
what are you praying for
um for your safety
ill do all i can to survive but please please dont die out there professor
looks like were finally getting to the end of this thing dont go dying on us now all right
not a chance
ha i like your confidence
same to you
not planning on it
if youre still alive when this is all over then ill have kept my word to captain jeralt lets both live to see the dawn of a bright new age
i wonder would the captain would say if he knew we were planning to take down lady rhea lady rhea and captain jeralt went back pretty far but hey its your decision im sure he would have understood in the end now onward to fhirdiad im ready
the idea of defeating rhea is beginning to feel more like a reality some may say that im returning her goodwill with betrayal but i believe ive worked off my debt the real problem is a certain someone else
catherine
thats right she was my partner after all i havent seen her since leaving the knights 
cyril
i taught him some archery but we are of different birth and hold different values i was speaking of catherine
gilbert
i have no particular interest in him i was speaking of catherine
i can see her coming to slaughter me driven by her mixed emotions of love and hate
when edelgard first invited me to join this army i to be frank thought her dream utterly ridiculous but at my advanced age i was tempted by the notion of chasing a seemingly impossible dream through blood sweat and tears five years on the unification of f√≥dlan is slowly becoming a reality now i feel  it may soon be possible to abolish the nobility and create a world where none need suffer due to crests
 
you need not say anything i will stay by your side and hers to the very end
professor do you mind if i complain about something well personal of course you dont this army is almost all single men if that marital status came before or during the war im not to say  the point is im in charge of the infirmary i wind up treating hundreds of men every week i get to talk to all sorts of men from all walks of life all of the time and yet 
you dont have a boyfriend
no not one of those men is infatuated with their caregiver isnt that supposed to happen in wartime
you arent married yet
forget that i cant even find a boyfriend marriage is just pffftt a joke just a sick joke
maybe you should give up on love
yeah  im starting to figure thats the most realistic option
at this point im just hoping you stay single too then at least we can share each others misery
the war is at its end has the time finally come that i might kill you
the battle will continue even beyond the war
it is true  those petulant fleas must be picked off one by one there are nothing if not persistent
theres no guarantee that well win next time
and if we do not win then we die either has its charms
seems like the war is gonna end soon once the dust settles itll be back to rolling in fat stacks of gold for me
ah did you want something sorry i was a bit lost in thought  or rather i was thinking about work my brother had sorted out all his personal affairs but apparently hed forgotten about his work duties so now ive got a ton more work on my plate  oh brother why must you be so careless  once this war is over im gonna take a vacation and get some well earned rest back home with my mother
greetings professor nothing to report the time has finally come to set out for the kingdom capital fhirdiad i thought the same thing last month but i still cant believe the plan was to ambush arianrhod i know it couldnt helped but even i wasnt let in on the secret me not gonna lie that hurt a little ah well lets forget about that im praying for your victory and your safe return
sorry  it looks like im going to have to leave you now groans one day i hope youll give this ring to someone you love as well as i love her
someone i love 
with arianrhod now behind them the black eagle strike force marches north to fhirdiad they plan for the imperial army stationed in former alliance territory to take over fraldarius land so they are able to attack fhirdiad from two directions king dimitri anticipates the imperial armys strategy leading the kingdom army and rheas knights of seiros out of fhirdiad and prepares to intercept the imperial army at the tailtean plains
mother  oddly the rain has come to fall yet again at this place once again  i will fight to take you back  the one who keeps me from seeing you again  i will be sure to return them to the earth from whence they came the foolish descendant of hresvelg who bares her fangs at me will suffer the same fate 
lady rhea 
call me seiros now i am no longer the archbishop but rather a warrior
yes lady seiros because of the rain we have not yet confirmed the position of our enemy or of the kingdom army 
search the route to fhirdiad it is unlikely that they have strayed far from it when you discover the imperial armys main force commence the attack if the kingdoms army has already engaged flank the enemy as planned
as you wish
wait for me dear child  i will be paying you a visit soon  when this sword has been plunged into your chest  yes that is the very moment i have long for 
i was hoping they would strike the church first  we must have miscalculated the rate of their advance reorganize the formation we have no choice but to buy time until the church arrives it will be a long battle  are you afraid dedue
no so long as i am at your side there is nothing to fear
i can always rely on you just watch my friend  we will prevail i will not fail to get revenge for all who have fallen
i would follow you anywhere your majesty good luck out there
you as well dedue you as well
your majesty  for you i will 
a flag of blue is flapping in the rain  it must be the kingdom army
yes it seems that king dimitri is leading the troops himself however the knights of seiros have yet to be seen perhaps they have split up
i cant imagine that dimitri would leave the capital to the church and face us with the kingdom army alone he must be planning to use the church to gain the upper hand in battle with the rain that must be difficult to coordinate  still the knights of seiros must be around here somewhere
then we should be on alert for attacks from the side and rear as well inform the entire army
yes sir
now that i think about it the kingdoms army is quite different than it once was they have taken a position of interception in the past the king would have introduced himself before beginning a fair fight
a fair fight  the words alone remind me of how he once was dont you agree professor
who might that be
oh have you forgotten already dimitri often spoke of such things back at the monastery
dimitri
yes he often spoke of such things back at the monastery
claude
of all the people in the world why would talk of a fair fight remind you of claude im talking about dimitri have you forgotten he often spoke of such things back at the monastery
well at the present the words fair fight do not seem to suit dimitri anymore he dislikes making victims of his friends but other than that he will do most anything these days  if he stops at nothing to continue the onslaught i cannot imagine what will become of the battlefield
true as soon as we can take our battle formation we must advance dimitri that past you cling to  i will soon free you from it
the black eagle strike force in its continued pursuit of f√≥dlans unification marches on fhirdiad kingdom and church forces prepare to meet you at tailtean plains a place laden with history
ah here you are edelgard at your eternal resting place you have trampled and stolen and blinded yourself to the truth today i will have vengeance for all you have done
with this battle the main force of the kingdom will be annihilated leave no enemy general alive least of all king dimitri
we are uncertain of the enemys plans so let us advance our troops with caution the knights of seiros have yet to show themselves they will join the battle at some point be ready
were first in line charge
dont let this chance for vengeance go to waste
time to join the front lines we should all show a little loyalty from time to time yeah
glory to the flag of the knights good fortune to his majesty fortune to faerghus  graaaaargh
what the  that kingdom soldier just changed into a demonic beast did thales  no this is something simpler
this is the work of a crest stone  but why 
i gave them crest stones from the castle vaults
you fool why did you do that
if we lose here the kingdom falls its our only hope
you call this hope well we must now claim victory so their deaths were not in vain
yes your majesty i am with you
gautier reinforcements have arrived we shall crush the empire weaklings
dont worry everyone the reinforcements have arrived
reinforcements  were in danger we must defeat the enemys generals before were overwhelmed
this battle may turn against us if we allow any more of them to transform we dont know which soldiers have crest stones we must do away with all of them and quickly
how could i be late when i finally have the opportunity to destroy the fallen one this rain it is the lamentation of my mother  observe i shall not fail in restoring balance
so what are you waiting for lets finish this today
professor has it really been five years we ought to raise a glass for the occasion celebrate your return nah id rather commemorate it with your death
professor theres something i should admit ive got some regrets about how our lives have gone i should have made a proper attempt to woo you before now instead i have to kill you
stand down ingrid i know you dont want to die here
i will not ill never ally myself with the likes of you
stubborn as ever i always did like that about you
and you never cease to amaze me with your false flattery dont waste your breath
i was such a fool so this is how it ends forgive me your majesty im going on ahead
thank you sylvain until we meet again on the other side 
it makes me so sad to fight against you but i suppose thats how things go when youre at war why follow an emperor who would start such a war
im sorry professor i cant join you  there are important things i must stay and protect
mercie 
now now annie theres no need for that this is a battlefield after all
im so sorry  you know that dont you and also know that you dont have to forgive me 
i was going to say the same thing im so sorry if i cause you any pain
step back mercedes
i wont this is the path i have chosen its the same for you too emile is it not someday we may meet again in another life whenever that happens i hope that well remain side by side always 
my dear sister  i am sorry
im im sorry dimitri  i cant seem to stay on my feet
forgive me mercedes were it not for me you wouldnt have gotten caught up in all this and you might still be alive 
you will never understand the burden his majesty carries on his shoulders
it is a shame i really believed you would come to believe his majestys perspective
it is time your majesty  i will avenge your father you are the one true king dimitri grr  grrrr
dedue i will fight by your side until the bitter end  as long as i am with you this lance of mine will know nothing of defeat
your majesty you must survive 
dedue  you fought well my friend
urghh 
dedue  you fool 
you will not kill one more soul you will not steal one more thing i will not allow it here and now i stand against you
why did you choose edelgard professor why did you choose to walk this savage bloody path i cannot shake this feeling of regret  regret that i must kill you now
must you continue to conquer continue to kill
must you continue to reconquer continue to kill in retaliation i will not stop there is nothing i would not sacrifice to cut a path to f√≥dlans new dawn
enough of this madness this future of yours is built on a foundation of corpses and tears
not only have you become the emperors lap dog but you have turned against your own people from the depths of hell you will regret tainting the land of faerghus
you killed rodrigue  your own father felix
i said id cut down anyone who stood in my way even my father even my friends
i see that was all i needed to hear to finally work up the resolve to kill you
no not yet  i cant die just yet 
dimitri you idiot retreat wait your injury  no
fall back your majesty we cannot lose you
king dimitri there is no retreat for the knights of seiros fight until none are left standing slaughter them all and send them straight to hell  no  it cant be  there is no retreat for the knights of seiros fight until none are left standing slaughter them all and send them straight to hell
you are all damned with no hope of salvation for the sin of insurgency you shall be consigned to hell
i once walked this world as seiros the warrior  and defeated the fell king nemesis now here i stand facing one who wields the same sword as he  the fate you have chosen is also the same as his  to die in torment upon my sword as the very lifeblood you have forsaken spills onto the earth
an ancestor of the hresvelgs who became adrestias first emperor  he saved me supported me gave his all to the cause of defeating nemesis that i should find myself here at tailtean striking down his scion 
i dont advise presumptions rhea i will not die by your hand
how can this be i lost to that thief unacceptable
watch out lady rhea please retreat
gyhh
the church of seiros has fallen back but we have no such luxury everyone fight for your lives victory to faerghus
edelgard you  i will kill you you will know the regret of my father who was killed for you of my stepmother who was slain by her own daughter you will bow your head before all the lives you trampled for your ideals before you die in misery
your obsession with me is appalling if you were a normal human you would most certainly have died already farewell king of delusion if only we were born in a time of peace you might have lived a joyful life as a benevolent ruler
to the fires of eternity with you el 
your majesty  your majesty
stop calling me that
ah thank the  no 
dedue  it seems i will die before i can get revenge for everyone 
 
my family my friends my home  everything that truly mattered to me  i couldnt 
youre wrong because of you i was able to live on until today you saved me these past nine years  i am proud to have been at your side it was a joy i never could have hoped for despite all i count myself a lucky man
is that so i see  i am glad 
you must be weary your majesty please rest in peace
lady rhea king dimitri has fallen in battle the kingdoms army has retreated it is impossible to preserve the front line
gah  everyone withdraw immediately fall back to fhirdiad the goddess is watching over us if we hold strong we will surely be saved
understood retreat
why do you insist on being such a loathsome obstacle  you stole my mothers heart and wield the sword of the creator just like that savage king nemesis  i swear with these very hands  i will take her back  until then wait for me dear mother 
rhea  she is our enemy but i must admit that she plays her cards magnificently
you mean using the goddesss name in order to boost morale
thats true but she also shows great skill in devising her tactics using the bewildered kingdom army as a shield while she and the knights retreated  if they ran all the way back to fhirdiad it will be very difficult to pursue them
can we defeat them
if youre low on confidence professor ill put an end to this myself actually thats what id like to say but in truth i hope to confront them with you at my side
next time we will end this
yes together well end this once and for all
for all of the lives lost in battle by our allies and foes alike  and for dimitri as well 
for dimitri
yes the thirst for revenge that imprisoned him was the result of my uncles strategy he believed that i was the cause of everything and he lost sight of his path as king there was nothing i could do to save him and so the very least i could do was  
are you crying
no the edelgard who shed tears died many years ago everything thats happened its all just part of the ebb and flow of history the tragedy of duscur our days at the academy fathers death and the five years you were gone  after all of that at long last were here at this point in time i hope youll stay by my side until the very end its time for humanity to take this world back
/***EOF***/
arianrhod the fortress city lies on what was once the border between the kingdom and the empire and is a valuable strategic asset dimitri intends to reclaim it
thank you you may leave now
did something happen
was the report worrying
not really  there is just a problem i must now clean up do you know of arianrhod it is a fortress that also goes by the name of the silver maiden
ive heard of it
yes i had thought i might have mentioned it before it is a fortress city that is lauded as the strongest in the kingdom
this is the first im hearing of it
is that so arianrhod is a fortress city lauded as the strongest in the kingdom
the land around arianrhod was once entrusted to count rowe  when he turned to the empire the silver maiden went with him now one after another the lords of each region are leaving the empire at the call of the eastern lords  but i am sure the empire has no plans to relinquish the fortress city given its strategic position on the front lines of their war with the kingdom unless we can take back arianrhod the kingdom will continually be attacked at its weakest points i was thinking that we need to deal with it soon and that we need to investigate the status of the enemys force but 
is there a problem
i am afraid so we confirmed that troops departed the imperial capital headed for arianrhod if they are followed by a second and third batch of reinforcements then the difficulty of taking back arianrhod will increase exponentially but that does not mean we are entirely without recourse i am just at a loss as to when the soldiers will arrive
lets go
right away you never cease to amaze your answers always bring me joy ok lets gather everyone immediately well begin the war council for the departing troops
not yet
indeed i realized that was out of the blue you have your own worries please accept my apologies though i do hope to deal with this sooner than later  if possible i would like to ask you to take the lead speak with me again if you change your mind
it seems we are just in time any later and arianrhod may have been lost her majesty was right to send me here
hubert so you have come here in command of extra troops from the imperial capital  i had hoped to take the fort while it was poorly defended but now  well there is nothing to be done we must defeat him and then take arianrhod
if i remember correctly there should be devices somewhere that let you deactivate the traps however  arianrhod has been in imperial hands for a while now they may have changed how things work but theres no point in dawdling lets just make a point to disable any devices we come across
so what if they disable some old contraptions its no loss to us the citys defenses are under my exclusive control
no luck buddy all the citys defenses are under my control
so the system has been modified the person operating the traps must be elsewhere 
surprise reinforcements  we must defeat them
that should take care of the traps
good weve cut them off from their reinforcements
i suppose you thought defeating the troops outside the castle first would demoralize the ones within not such a bad idea honestly but you failed to account for me
for the sake of edelgard i shall take the liberty of helping
in the end i may not have gleaned your secret yet even if i die someone will follow my work and another after that such is the way of scholarship
if i die for this new empire then i have no regrets
professor hanneman  that should take care of the traps
id hate to kill someone i know but i have no choice
oh dear professor fate can be so cruel spilling the blood of your students with your own hands  how can you carry on after that
youve grown into a fine handsome man dimitri bit of a shame youve also become a violent beast men like you make the silver maiden cry
oh i suppose it is a shame professor manuela perhaps i should have appeared before you holding a bouquet of flowers rather than the weapon that will end your life
so the silver maiden will be my last stage heh  you know thats thats not too bad
professor manuela  at least we have stopped the reinforcements
arianrhod is a crucial asset to the empire you will not pry it from our grasp
thats as far as i go  ill withdraw  for now
first gronder field and now here you certainly have a talent for getting in our way
the empire troops are withdrawing  this is it we failed to get hubert but at least we recaptured arianrhod lets clean up the wreckage and return to garreg mach well done everyone the day is ours
oh  its you
are you tired
a rare sight 
i think all of this work is just catching up with me just pretend that yawn never happened by the way i wanted to thank you for your help with the arianrhod campaign the other day you were exceptional your leadership was key in taking back arianrhod safely
we all contributed
indeed everyone gave their all for victory i am always being saved by those around me it seems
we got lucky
do not be so modest
it seems that after taking back arianrhod many things are changing within the kingdom specifically the lesser lords of the land surrounding arianrhod have pledged vassalage to the kingdom the knights they possess may now be added to the kingdoms army and if that happens i would like to leave them in your capable hands also  ah my apologies here i am simply throwing one report after another at you
arent you overdoing it
perhaps it is certainly true that i have been stuck in my quarters lately dealing with more official business and other such tasks than ever before but that is something i have been putting off for far too long though it is exhausting filling in the blanks of five years and several months must be done i am going to tackle them all one at a time that is one small part of my atonement so professor  i have been doing all of the talking but i assume you came here for a reason
i thought we could all celebrate our victory
a victory celebration you say
i intend to steal you away to the victory celebration
steal me away that seems rather unnecessary  hmm  a victory celebration you say
you know this reminds me of that time i dragged you to the dining hall do you recall
i do
when was that
if memory serves that was after the mock battle between the houses  it was a wonderful time we had just finished our mission and we were invited to join in the celebration  you know every once in a while i do long to be part of the group as well but do you think that it is really acceptable for someone like me to quietly join in the merriment
everyones waiting for you
youre thinking about it too much
you really think so well if you insist  thank you professor now then lets go together
/***EOF***/
the alliance has requested aid from the monastery but the knights of seiros are low on personnel alois and shamir decide that the students will have to suffice 
 and that is our situation
but with so few knights well surely  
ah professor excellent timing
whats going on
alois youre not going to suggest we send students are you
i am actually do you have a problem with that
i do we cant send them out on a knights mission without rheas blessing
im sure i can get the go ahead ill just say the students have a new field training opportunity or something like that besides well be there were not going to let them get killed by pirates
whats this about pirates
what are you talking about
there are pirates causing havoc in the port of derdriu at the center of house riegans territory
the merchants association sent a request via the eastern church asking for protection
the eastern church
you havent heard of the eastern church i suppose thats because they dont have much of a presence
the eastern church controls eastern f√≥dlan they dont have a standing army like we do so for incidents like this they customarily ask for help from the central church
i imagine they want to contribute to make their presence known in the alliance
be that as it may we knights are quite busy we dont have personnel to spare therefore were enlisting your help
you should have some experience dealing with pirates from your mercenary days right
i may
i dont remember
the students have dealt with pirates so this shouldnt be a problem for them
come with us wont you think of it as a training exercise the merchants association will reward us handsomely
lets go
we dont have time to lose lets take care of this quickly
i dont know if i should
were not leaving right away think on it
if you wish to join us let me know
tremble before us we are the great navy of almyra resist and well burn this town to the ground
the almyran navy  this is going to be tougher than i expected
if claude is deployed
huh sure those look like almyran ships but i guarantee you theyre just common pirates
theyre obviously bluffing but it seems to be working on the merchants shall we
its the knights please save us well reward you handsomely
it would be a disaster if they attacked our shops please dont let them into town
weve got you leave it to the knights of seiros
hahaha smash up the houses and trash the shops swipe anything thats not nailed down
aah if they attack the town we wont even be able to pay the knights their reward 
thats not good the pirates have got into town we have to beat them quick
the town is under attack we have to move quickly
if the town gets damaged any further we wont have much to offer as a reward 
who cares about the reward were trying to protect the people
we are the ruthless barbarians of almyra resist and pay the price
oh dear  my wares ill be ruined please do something quickly
we are the knights of seiros and we will not tolerate your violent villainy
how could you commit such crimes in the name of almyra its because of two bit miscreants like you that almyrans suffer so much hate
sh shut up say what you will were the real navy of almyra
youre in charge of this sorry band huh well punish you in the name of the goddess
quiet you time for a counter attack
hate us all you want were just doing our job
idle prattle you think you can beat us
ugh what a pain that guy was if youre going to pose as an almyran at least fight like one
well thats over with they were a lot more trouble than i expected
thank you so much heres your reward please take it
well we got rid of them but the towns not looking too pretty
thank you its not much but please take this as a reward
good gracious i didnt expect it to become such a large scale battle
it seems they caused the merchants unnecessary confusion by disguising themselves as almyrans
we taught the pirates a lesson though that should calm them down a bit i know this was more than you signed up for but you really saved us
it was an interesting experience
it was good training
thanks for your help this cant be how you were expecting your day to go
patient and understanding just like captain jeralt we owe you a token of our appreciation i think take the reward from the merchants association share it with your students if you like
really
i cant accept this
take it well collect our reward from the eastern church besides alois could never keep it for himself
of course not we knights serve as the sword and shield of saint seiros herself we pride ourselves on our integrity we reject all rewards that are not perfectly legitimate
in other words hes a coward who would feel guilty and lose sleep over it
hmph
thats also one of his many merits
shamir you dont mince words though it does seem like youve learned how to show a little respect
mustve learned that from you
i dont remember teaching you that anyway professor keep the compensation id say youve earned it those merchants really needed your help for all the buying and selling they do theyre not so good at trading blows
 
get it trading blows they  and merchants they  oh forget it

annette and gilbert hope to acquire the heros relic of house dominic from annettes uncle baron dominic
professor do you have a moment
of course
i would hear your opinion on our situation given our current fighting power what sort of challenge do you expect we pose to the empire do we have any hope of victory
our preparations are lacking
the probability of victory is low
so we agree however in order to strengthen our forces we  
aaaargh ugh why would anyone put a barrel here
ow that really smarts  oh hello father
father
  another stupendous fall
as though you care about my well being anyway  professor im heading out for a bit
where are you going
i was thinking of going to visit my uncle
to see my brother why is that annette
i wanna ask him to entrust me with the heros relic of house dominic the fight from here on out is gonna be tough i need to do whatever i can to get stronger the best thing we can do as far as i can tell is to have another heros relic at our disposal
you are not wrong yet it will not be easy
whys that
under pressure from cornelia house dominic is maintaining a pro imperial stance that makes us his enemy brother or no he will not hand over a heros relic to us
but hes not a bad person  and well never know unless we ask right and mother might be there too 
the dominic region is at present enemy territory there is no guarantee you can see them safely
fine be that way its not like i was planning to ask for your help anyway professor dont worry about me ill be back soon and with a relic no less
annette wait she never listens so frustrating however if she were able to retrieve the heros relic it would prove a great boon to our forces perhaps i should prepare myself for the worst i shall travel with annette to see my brother professor might i ask you to take on a task for me it is entirely possible that we shall be captured in the dominic region in anticipation of that  i would ask that you wait outside the region with an army at your command
of course
i cannot say with confidence that we will be able to bring back the heros relic without issue while it pains me to ask this favor of you i must also thank you for accepting
i need some time 
i should be able to slow annettes departure for a short while at the least please join us when you can
uncle i beg you please give me the heros relic
even in this land the empires eye shines bright to hand over such a weapon to you our enemy is unthinkable 
we are well aware brother i beg you for the sake of the kingdoms revival 
i cannot if it becomes known that i gave you aid my lands will be annexed in a bitter instant
then we must relent annette there is nothing for us here we should go
no letting you simply leave will invite accusations of collusion i must take you as my hostages
so  it has come to pass after all
annette live here with me you neednt return to that helpless band of rebels without a glimmer of hope for victory
youre wrong that will never happen uncle
your mother is also here in this land do not dismiss my proposition so readily 
we cant afford to stay here father we have to run
be calm annette i assumed something like this would happen if we do not come back the professor will come to get us we need but wait and keep faith 
our allies are being held in that stronghold in the southeast please rescue them quickly
ha right to the last you hope to strike me down in that case i will also lay my cards on the table and commit all my resources to this fight
reinforcements that will make life more difficult
oh thank goodness lets run father
annette go i will acquire the heros relic even if it means crossing blades with my brother
i couldnt possibly leave you to do it alone father please let me go with you
even if you must do it by force bring me annette
gah  leave me be
its for your own good you must understand annette
i am soldier enough to admit i have lost this battle brother i will lay down arms 
i have my own reason for not giving up and the less i speak of it the better 
my brother i beg you the relic
i do not wish to repeat myself if you want it that badly slay me and claim it for your own
i have no wish to enact violence on you annette listen to me and do as i say
i will not listen i cant and i wont there is somewhere i must return to
so this is it i fought well in the end i doubt cornelia will think i cooperated with you take the heros relic and go and in return promise to restore the kingdom
brother  i thank you
and dont worry about your wife whatever happens i swear i will protect her when all of this is over you had better return to her make sure victory is yours gustave
you have my word
i cannot tell you how grateful we are for your assistance
i dont know what would have happened if not for you  and thanks to you i got this
the magic hammer crusher  the heros relic of house dominic my brother would not surrender such a relic without a fight  i hope you understand
i understand
of course
house dominic is one of the ten great bloodlines yet within the kingdom we are mere feudal lords with the empire growing in strength dominic must kneel to do otherwise would be suicide the western lords and other rulers are in the same situation they all comply albeit reluctantly if we defeat the empire i hope the kingdom will rise once more under the banner of a legitimate king
i hope so too thats why we cant give up
to that end professor we will require your help i hope we can continue depending on you
ill do what i can
you can count on me
dont worry we wont make you do all the hard work by yourself ill give it my all too speaking of  im gonna get straight to training
gaaaaaah why would someone put a dumb wooden box here
and please look after my daughter as well

something is attacking people in the forests of margrave edmunds territory and a crest scholar blames marianne
theres no reason to feign ignorance i know all about you
wh what are you talking about
just come here
professor help
dont interfere just hand the girl over to me
never
im telling you this for your own good youre putting yourself in danger by associating with her
 
do you know of the wandering beast stalking in the wood in the edmund territory it is said that it attacks people every night and drags them off to feast the true identity of the wandering beast  is that girl right there
no i would never 
get out of here
no matter ill get the evidence i need 
my apologies for you getting involved in that 
what happened
in truth that man has been following me ever since my father disappeared  hes a crest scholar
why is he following you
the crest that my father bore and was passed down to me  it was  maurices crest
maurices crest
yes its also known as the crest of the beast  its said there were once 12 heroes who saved f√≥dlan there was the king of liberation nemesis the 10 elites and finally maurice one day maurice suddenly transformed into a hideous beast and slaughtered innocent people it was like when miklan of house gautier turned into a black beast the negative energy dwelling within his crest turned maurice into a monster the people of f√≥dlan grew to despise him and he was stripped of his honor his whole clan was conquered and it was believed that his bloodline had vanished  but even now there exist a few descendants who have inherited maurices crest and his curse my family line is one of them maurices crest is a symbol of disaster anyone who comes in contact with it is met with great misfortune those who carry the crest became beasts at night and slaughter innocent people
what that man mentioned earlier 
yes the rumor about the wandering beast in the woods  people are saying the creature is similar in appearance to maurices bestial form
if its defeated wouldnt the rumor be dispelled
that may be true but i doubt i could do it on my own if you and some of the other students came with me though 
lets go
thank you but um  promise you wont tell anyone about my crest
im sorry to have to ask but thank you
ill think about it
it is my personal matter so i cant expect you to get involved but if you change your mind ill be waiting
a are you really the wandering beast that people talk about
you  do you bear our crest for what purpose did you come here
our crest does that mean 
it appears that your presence has been detected by bloodthirsty demonic beasts 
demonic beasts everyone  please move carefully
this forest is the den of demonic beasts you will be lucky to make it out alive
you saved me professor  thank you the wandering beasts true form  could it be  oh sorry i need to focus on the fight
argh im not strong enough 
dear goddess  my soul is yours to take 
my beastly blood is roused  you will not be able to stop me
nothing will stop me from feasting upon your flesh and blood
that sword  its the sword of the king are you the one who can liberate me
nothing will stop me from feasting upon your flesh and blood
no i wont let you
that looks just like miklans black beast  could a heros relic be at fault
hero  that is a word that takes me back
takes you back you  are you 
after so long i cannot speak of it
well done  finally this nightmare of a thousand years is at its end oh inheritor of my crest if this body is to decay then the sword  i leave it to you 
 
i still cant believe what we saw in that forest  the wandering beasts eviscerated body  only human bones and this sword remaining
surely the creatures true identity was 
im sorry 
you again
i heard rumor that the wandering beast was slain but do you really believe that frees you of suspicion without proof that it was slain the argument that you are not a beast does not stand furthermore i  huh oh that sword
when the wandering beast was defeated this sword 
its unmistakable carved into that swords crest stone is maurices crest but how would the lost magic blade end up with the wandering beast according to what i know of maurices story he didnt let go of the sword until the very end that must mean  i see so thats what happened  my apologies it seems i was mistaken i must be going
so the wandering beast was 
maurice himself
he was roaming the dark woods for over a thousand years suffering for his murderous past
someone who bears the crest of the beast
no im sure that was maurice himself he was roaming the dark woods for over a thousand years suffering for his murderous past
good thing you were able to put an end to it
its true  and because of that i feel as though my curse has been lifted the blood of a beast no longer flows through me i feel human for once
thank you professor i couldnt have done it on my own without your help i would never have found peace ill do anything i can to repay my debt to you

western church extremists have taken over land sacred to cichol one of the four saints seteth heads out the rid the area of them and flayn insists on going along
brother please wait
for the last time flayn the answer is no
you are departing for the rhodos coast are you not i must come
you will do no such thing i am not going there to pay respects at the cemetery but to do battle with you there i will be beside myself with worry it will be easier for me to fight if i know you are safe
but i must
professor you have come at just the right time
whats going on
surely it must be fate that you have appeared at a time of my greatest need
i dont like the sound of that 
i only wish to make a small request
my dear brother is about to set forth on a most dangerous mission
a mission
indeed the western church is attempting to seize sacred ground by force though they now have a new bishop it seems that a radical faction has emerged to resist the new order we cannot allow the holy artifacts enshrined there to fall into their hands
i too wish to be of use to the church and i do admit i am terribly worried about my brother no matter my protests he will not allow me to come professor this is where you can help will you accompany us both on this expedition
why me
if you are there to protect me my brothers fears will be allayed isnt that right brother
i suppose your aid would indeed be useful yes
i knew it please professor will you join us
very well
wonderful let us depart at once
not right now
please tend to your errands promptly then you will come along with us yes
there is still time before we must depart if you are able to accompany us let me know
you heretics who defile our goddess the sacred coast belongs to us the western church
you are the heretics begone from here at once
silence dog of the apostate prepare to receive our righteous blades
i will recapture the monument everyone else should focus on removing the surrounding enemies
wait brother i shall accompany you
leave let mother rest in peace
it is our duty to worship saint cichol we will not allow heretics to come near
its like the goddess herself commanded me to live  i must offer her my thanks
the goddess doesnt want your thanks
but it was for the sake of the goddess 
the goddess protects us we will never yield to the likes of you
i got away thanks to the protection of the goddess
insufferable arrogance well have to send someone after them 
goddess  have you abandoned us
heretics prepare to taste the power of the true servants of the goddess
were no match for them  brothers  retreat 
do you dare compound your crimes further there will be no escape for you
that is the last of them flayn will you place some flowers at the monument
of course brother that is what i came here to do
this place  is very precious to me  please  protected it  for me 
i must pull back  i leave the rest to you do not let them take this position
your assistance is most appreciated i can only hope that the western church will now see reason and abandon this place but just to be safe i have retrieved the holy artifacts we cannot risk them falling into their hands i will entrust them to you i must confess despite the situation it was a pleasure to return here this coast has a certain sentimental significance to my sister and me
sentimental significance
yes this stone monument is not merely here to commemorate saint cichol it is also the grave of my wife
you are safe now mother finally you may find peace
your mother is also buried here
i suppose you have earned the right to know but this must remain between us flayn is actually my daughter my late wife and her mother are the same person
i had no idea
due to certain circumstances it is more convenient for us to masquerade as siblings for the time being
i suspected as much
and here i thought we had hidden it skillfully
there are many who would seek to harm flayn due to the unique blood she bears falsifying her identity is necessary to conceal her from such individuals mercifully i happen to look quite young for my age we make rather convincing siblings do we not
thats true enough
if you say so
hm i was certain our cover was adequate
mother loved the coast so much she and i came here together often fishing was her favorite pastime i used to sit and watch while she cast her line
i remember it fondly you did so love to eat the fish she caught as well
fish is my favorite food it is true due in no small part to mother
i still come here to fish from time to time using the skills my wife taught me it reminds me how deeply i appreciate those years  and how i wish i could return to them
we cannot turn back the clock father we must live our lives fully in the present moment
youre right that is what she always said isnt it dwell too much on the past and you may be unable to move forward come then let us return home
good bye mother i love you i shall bring flowers again for you next time

dedue receives a concerning missive about his people who continue to bear the burden of oppression based on blame for the tragedy of duscur
 
has something happened
whats on your mind
oh its you professor since you are here i have a favor to ask
your highness youve returned
sorry to keep you waiting dedue im glad youre here as well professor i want you both to hear this dedue is already aware but you should know theres been an uprising in the duscur region in the western part of the kingdom
an uprising in duscur why
dedue  would you like me to explain
no it should be me  i am from duscur it lies just beyond the mountains on the northwestern border of faerghus but the people of duscur no longer live there the land was burned to ashes by the army of faerghus all of the people were slaughtered  this was our punishment for the crime of regicide
dimitri
the barren expanse that was once duscur is now controlled by a kingdom noble but duscur survivors such as myself still exist outside the region this uprising is most likely the work of such survivors seeking to reclaim their homeland
a request for aid was sent from viscount kleiman to the kingdom capital and the church he is the one who rules over that region at present for now the lords surrounding the duscur region have sent their armies to help suppress the uprising however 
is there a problem
are they short on troops
they have sufficient troops and strong ones at that my worry is that there will be more unwarranted death there have always been many in the kingdoms army who believe the people of duscur our foes and hate them because of it you would think theyd refrain from squashing the rebels out of political expediency but i doubt that will be the case if the kingdoms army and the rebel forces of duscur collide there is no doubt that the rebel forces will be annihilated im afraid thats the best case scenario it could also turn into complete and bloody chaos for both sides
 indeed
which brings me to my news i have just now received the permission i requested from the church
permission for what
i asked the church to deploy our class to help handle the situation
so we may go
not so fast we still have a responsibility as students of the academy after all the only one who can truly make the decision as to whether or not we go is our professor so  what do you say
very well
you have my most sincere gratitude
and mine as well but we must move fast i will go and alert the others
let me think about it
i know this was sudden but given the situation im afraid there isnt much time to ponder when youve decided please speak with me right away
please decide quickly
the kingdoms vanguard has already arrived just as wed feared they far outclass the duscur forces we cannot stand by and allow another massacre but we cannot obstruct the faerghus army either our best hope is to force the troops of duscur to withdraw before the kingdom soldiers get to them
the main body of the kingdoms army is bound to arrive soon until then lets aim to quell this uprising ourselves once the main force arrives well be out of options we must move fast
it seems the church and the kingdom troops are not working together my head hurts just thinking about it but we may be able to use that first lets push duscur to retreat the kingdom might then also withdraw without a fight
let us be quick about it
our grudge will not be settled until all of you are dead and buried
split up between the east and the west and advance thatll put the squeeze on those duscur animals in a hurry
they are moving out time is of the essence now
seems this areas done already all right men fall back
ok looks like theyre already under control lets head back now
were here to quell this rebellion starting now hunt down those filthy beasts and give no quarter
the main army has arrived we stand no chance against those numbers we took too long it is all over 
i give my all for our goal you will die here
go now if you value your life
but arent you with faerghus in any case  thank you
you can still get out of here run
youre not going to kill us well i wont wait here to find out im leaving
safely away
i wont allow it  if only you dastards werent here 
ill have your life for atonement king slayer
heretics  what is it you think we have done
filthy duscur demons 
revenge for my brothers even at the cost of death 
not content with slaying his majesty you thought to revolt pathetic
you are a man of duscur how can you make friends with our hated foes is it possible that youve lost your duscur spirit
are you finished
now this is a windfall  who knew wed meet our sworn enemy here
sworn enemy well i cannot disagree
we will slay you and topple faerghus that way for the first time in ages duscur can be reborn
hmph
is this how our dream ends 
i will check the status of the kingdom troops dedue i leave the duscur army to you
yes your highness please be careful
why save us
i will not abide the needless death of my own people
you must know that as long as there is breath in me i will fight
then fight and be defeated but so long as you pose no threat to his highness i will not end your life
idealistic fool we will not relent not until weve taken back the homeland you monsters stole from us
i share the same sentiment
you who sold his soul for faerghus
his highness has promised the people of duscur a home his will be a kingdom that is proud to harbor the blood of both faerghus and duscur
thats impossible dont be naive
believe what you will but faerghus will change under his reign that is my firm belief
 
the kingdom army has retreated to the fortress there should be no further danger
prince of faerghus you monster
can you still run then i suggest you do so now
 
may our paths cross again
 i certainly hope not but remember this one thing the people of duscur never forget their grudges nor do they fail to honor favors
thank you your highness for accommodating my selfish request
think nothing of it this was something i wished for as well if you must give thanks direct it at the church for allowing us to join the battle and to our professor for leading the charge its about time we headed back the professor and the others are waiting
i am right behind you

almyran forces are attacking f√≥dlans locket with her brother suddenly fallen ill it is up to hilda to take over the defense cyril volunteers to accompany her
hey professor i might have to go back home for a little while
is someone in your family sick
oh no nothing like that
is there some kind of emergency
well thats one way of putting it 
the almyran forces are causing trouble at f√≥dlans locket oh do you know where that is well the mountain range that separates the alliance from almyra is called f√≥dlans throat theres a fortress right on top of the throat and they call that f√≥dlans locket
so youre going to help defend it
well yeah you could say that im sure my brother would be able to handle them on his own but he said he really wants me to help out i guess hes a bit tired out from all his hard work anyway our dads not as sprightly as he used to be hes not up for a fight apparently it would look bad if we left it to the retainers i really really dont want to go but i guess i have to
heya hilda i well i wasnt trying to eavesdrop but i heard ya talking 
hm oh whats up cyril
youre gonna fight the almyrans yeah
yes but its nothing you need to worry about cyril
its not that i was just wondering if if maybe i could maybe go along with ya
but  youd be fighting people from your homeland do you really want to do that
none of em would remember me anyway  its just that i got captured in the battle at the locket and thats how i ended up here so im kinda worried that other kids who lose their folks might not be so lucky
what do you mean
before lady rhea took me in i had a real hard time as a servant of house goneril
im sorry to hear that but its not like ill go around snapping up almyran children
thats good but i just  i want to see things for myself so i know that everythings ok
hm well then lets go together oh would you want to join us professor my brother will be there but im a little scared about fighting all those fierce almyrans 
if you could come too it would be really great wed all feel way safer if you did
ill come with you
great i know well be ok if youre there lets head out right away
ill go and get ready too
ill think it over
youre a real tease professor i know youre going to come along in the end but we cant wait long so hurry up on deciding
most of our allies have fallen my big brother and i can probably handle this though 
hilda glad you made it lord holst has been afflicted with a sudden illness and couldnt come 
hes not here oh  im sorry you must have been absolutely terrified its ok though i brought along someone who can definitely help us thats you professor please help us save our allies and protect f√≥dlans locket
good thing i knew about this back road huh we oughta be able to help our friends from here
support were saved
argh  no help came 
oh no they got one but we can still rescue the others
we must defend here or else  our house  the alliance 
all our allied troops were wiped out we wont be able to defend this place
ah things are looking up lets keep going and save the others
we did it somehow cyril professor  thank you
you bet
im gonna drop by my familys estate and complain to my brother a bit you two should head back
they arent really trying to cross f√≥dlans throat im not saying theyre not serious but fights like this one arent really invasions
then what are they doing
they just start fights like this sometimes its so they can show off how strong they are i think its pretty dumb i mean people are getting killed and why so some guy can think hes tough after every fight they do a big feast and everybody eats and dances and theres music  its supposed to honor the dead but i figure they just like to make noise i think theyre all idiots but if im real honest it wasnt the worst way to live life
feeling homesick
nah im where i belong now and i dont really like almyra if they wanna show how tough they are then they oughta look after kids whove lost their parents
whew im tired professor cyril thanks for all your help
you get a chance to see your brother
i did though i think id be better off otherwise he was horribly ill for one thing he looked so pale and haggard apparently hed eaten a bad mushroom before the battle and it made him horribly sick what an idiot anyway when i told him wed handled the almyran situation he was just gushing with praise i tried telling him that it wasnt all me but he didnt even listen
werent you glad to get praise from your brother
that did feel pretty good ill admit but then things got awkward he started trying to pawn off his whole inheritance i told him i wanted none of it eventually he settled for foisting this thing on me do you know what it is
one heck of an axe he gave it to ya
yes its a magic axe called freikugel its the heros relic of house goneril he said that i should have it since the crest i bear will allow me to wield it he was so insistent i eventually relented but i dont think i can be responsible for something so precious hey professor  why dont you take it instead
you should keep it
why me
heroes relics contain terrifying power theyre beyond the capabilities of a novice like me youre the only person i trust to take care of it please help me out here
if youre sure 
if you really think its necessary 
thank you so much i honestly didnt know what i was going to do with this thing a big scary axe is not my style plus look closely  parts of the axe are pulsating like its alive how gross is that but ill use it if you tell me to professor or you can get somebody else to wield it if you like its all up to you now
 
that hilda  she really is something

when catherine and the knights of seiros ride out to seek retribution against the western church for their attack on the archbishop ashe is eager to accompany them
there you are i have a request for you
a request
it has to do with that plot to assassinate lady rhea the bishop leading the western church was somehow involved
and speaking of the western church there was also that incident in which one of the more extreme factions tried to occupy sacred land
enough is enough so now the knights of seiros have been tasked with putting the bishop down i thought you and your students could come with us
why would you want us to help
why for such an important mission
because you wield the sword of the creator lady rhea is going to personally execute the bishop i have been appointed as her guard i want your help protecting her so what do you say will you come
um excuse me id like to come along
ashe you were listening in its not up to you whether you can ‚Äúcome along‚Äù
please this is important to me
your adoptive father lord lonato had connections to the western church i understand that you want answers but our objective is to punish not to investigate we cant let you jeopardize the mission
i wont get in the way i promise
hm  what do you say professor keep in mind we would be bringing the whole class not just ashe
well go
thank you so much
ok i guess its fine get ready then
im not sure
hm well cant hurt to wait a bit i suppose do let me know when you finish your preparations this is an important mission
there she is    the sneaky little witch trying to pass herself off as the goddesss envoy  archbishop rhea ill bring judgment upon you in the goddesss stead
theyre using the fog as cover to ambush us what a cheap ploy
it wont do any good to get annoyed catherine that voice  were up against a faction of bishops
theyve shown themselves at least so we wont have to go to the trouble of finding them all right you got a death wish come at me you really want to fight against thunder catherine
please professor dont let lady rhea get hurt our mission isnt just to wipe out all the enemies but also to protect lady rhea ready
lady rhea
hold the line dont let them attack lady rhea again
they have received reinforcements and it seems the priests are calling them over
then well just have to take them out
it seems that taking out the priest has stopped the reinforcements coming over here we should be able to stop the reinforcements coming from the other side by taking care of the other priest
they will not be able to send any more troops now let us sweep up the stragglers
good work lady rhea lets round em up and cut em down
apostates will suffer the punishment of the goddess
lonatos blood is on your hands 
were you lord lonatos page or something indeed he was a devout believer all we did was provide lord lonato salvation from his misery
salvation you used him and threw him away
apostates you sully the name of the goddess
you are the apostates the goddess is with me
goddess have mercy forgive them their sins and save their souls 
it would have been better if wed captured the bishop but they didnt make it easy for us what now lady rhea
we must go to the headquarters of the western church perhaps there is still someone there who knows what has transpired
let us help too it may not be much but well do whatever we can
i am sure you will be a great help i am glad to have you by my side
thanks professor i really appreciated your help with the investigation thats it for today head back to garreg mach the church will have to choose a new bishop and do whatever else is necessary to rebuild the western church lady rhea is grateful to all of you she said she would send along a reward you should feel very proud receiving a gift directly from lady rhea is exceedingly rare still that was a real mess huh for them to come out and charge us so boldly 
im glad we made it out
as am i we kept lady rhea safe thanks to you
i thought we were doomed
i did too but we made it out somehow thanks to you
hey where did ashe go i havent seen him for a while
no idea
could he still be back there im glad hes so dedicated to his work but 
he couldnt still be back there could he
that may be it i hope hes not getting in the way 
there you are ashe we were just talking about 
 
why the brooding expression hey whats that bundle of papers in your hand
this was given to me it has to do with my family
given to you
is this about lord lonato
i havent finished reading it all yet but i think it might offer some clues about something i need to know professor catherine thank you for letting me come with you on this mission id better get ready to go
its a little painful to watch  i do hope that those papers whatever they are will help him get over his past i suppose its time for us to start heading back to the monastery

manuela and hanneman have predictably opposite reactions to a disturbing rumor going around the monastery
its raining professor on rainy days the wound i got from the death knight hurts like fire every time it aches i get angry you understand yeah im sure they had their reasons to kidnap flayn but still  did they really need to stab me whatd i have to do with it they ruined my beautiful porcelain skin worse they took off before i could stab them back so rude
thats rather enough manuela cease your moaning and give the professor a break
oh stuff it hanneman unlike you the professor has a big heart and listens to me talk about any problem i have
more likely your incessant ramblings offer no chance to interrupt
is that true professor
manuela isnt bothering me
i knew it you listen to me because you care about me dont you
professor hanneman is right
you heard that didnt you manuela you are bothering the professor
go away hanneman leave us alone and stop making me shout it causes the old wound to hurt again
then perhaps youd best stay quiet keep your emotions in check id say
lets stop this now
lets all get along
dont worry professor we do this all the time
indeed manuela and i do not mix well been true for years that said if it were up to me i would prefer speaking to her in a calmer manner
its not like i enjoy bickering with you so maybe keep your mouth shut more often
i state that which needs to be heard for example  
lets stop this now
lets all get along
im sorry i couldnt help it 
same same apologies i am here because i have new information on the death knights hiding place
what really you could have started with that
several students have reported possible sightings on the western edge of the sealed forest while the authenticity of these reports has yet to be verified it is still a very real possibility i was thinking i would report this to seteth as a precaution
what why we cant be slow hes going to get away
protocol on this matter requires reporting to seteth then lady rhea then 
professor lets leave this old geezer behind and get going
old geezer i am barely 15 years your senior i will not hear such  
stop talking lets gather a team and get going
i agree
ill go scout ahead im coming for you death knight

well im going ahead anyway you cant stop me
manuela take a moment you must prepare before heading out professor please let me know as soon as you can if you could join us
manuelas in a tough spot professor even if shes only got herself to blame we cannot abandon her
heh  we have plenty of visitors today lets stop their annoying rescue attempt
now that is a woman 
uh oh theyve noticed me here they come
just when i decide to disguise myself as a mountain bandit and sneak in we get attacked just my luck
we are the death god gang were all unstoppable
hey youre not the death knight what gives
death knight what nonsense are you talking now do we look like knights to you lady
youre just lousy hill bandits well ill teach you to waste my time
why there is no death knight here that students testimony was well it was utter bunk
hey you the weird old dude with the beard what kinda crap are you mumbling to yourself there
i beg your pardon do not image you can insult me without some form of retribution
manuela are you uninjured
a few scrapes and bruises but yes im well enough
how could anyone think that was the death knight it was obviously just an ordinary bandit oh well i may not have found my revenge but at least we got to retrieve stolen goods
manuela you unthinking fool
hanneman ive heard enough already
how bloody stupid are you if that were the real death knight youd have new  likely fatal  wounds to match your first do you know how much you worried all of us you should be ashamed
oh no 
relax shes ok
this is a matter of life and death it should not and must not be taken lightly
hannemans right
exactly you are supposed to set an example for our students yet you let emotion get the better of you
youre right  so there i said that its true but ugh im sorry ill apologize to everyone later
i should say im sorry as well i lost my temper just now i see you act so irrationally and i lose my wits i care about you a great deal and wish to see you safe will you believe me
yes of course im the same way after all i let my emotions get the best of me were both too old to be shouting all the time
so everyone is friends again
youre awfully quick to but a bow on this are you sick of us already professor
youre part of this professor we are the only teachers this academy has no need for bickering
well said hanneman would you care to join me for a celebratory drink

sothis has a request for you byleth  at her insistence you travel alone to the red canyon followed by curious students
hmmm  what was that name again
whats on your mind
oh this is frustrating me to no end i simply cant recall oh i have it zanado
zanado the red canyon
thats it it was not long ago that we were there  and still i somehow managed to forget
where we defeated the thieves 
thats it it was not long ago that we were there  and still i somehow managed to forget
what is that
oh my your memory is even worse than mine it was not long ago that we were there
what about it
well  that place brought back some fragments of my memory i cannot help but wonder why i feel we must return to find some answers there
lets go
yes you are right for as the saying goes there is no time like the present
now isnt the time
no you must delight in spoiling my mood  well if you refuse to go theres little i can do  please tell me if you change your mind
hmm  our professor is sneaking off alone where to i wonder 
i dont recall hearing of any such plans for our class perhaps we should follow
intrigued are we yes lets do just that we will consider it extra training
it is most unlike our professor to go wandering alone like that 
curious your highness
yes i have an uneasy feeling about this lets gather the others and find out what is going on
huh wheres our professor going all alone like that
i hate not knowing whats going on  ok thats it lets gather the others and get to the bottom of this
you want to follow our teacher what a pain  ugh but i guess im dying of curiosity too
yes  it is all coming back to me this structure  oh but its as though my memories are clouded the most important pieces are obscured but i once called this home i have no doubt i seem to recall something on the other side of that wall i cannot see it but i can still feel it  it is not my imagination i know this to be true we are already deep within this valley 
grrrraargh
oh what was that awful sound
you heard something
this is not time to joke around do not pretend you didnt hear
it was a terrible scream
yes and that was not a normal beast but a huge and terrifying one
look there at the entrance of the valley a giant shadow
what is it now
those hungry wolves  that howl must have riled them up we have no choice but to fight our way out give it your all
its good weve caught up with the professor but this situation is  hard to put into words actually
wolves to the front hawks to the rear and what appears to be a demonic beast at the canyons mouth 
a wild beast at that or perhaps its more fitting to call it a stray
if we cant prevail over that demonic beast we wont make it out of the red canyon alive
the first thing we need to do is reunite with our professor the wolves are closing in 
more hawks  this is bad well be caught from both sides
the hawks are still coming perhaps we should see to those before we deal with the beast
this is bad  its a good thing we managed to catch up with our professor
wolves at the front hawks at the rear and at the canyon mouth a demonic beast
or perhaps to call it a stray beast would be most fitting  if we cannot take out the beast i doubt we will ever see the monastery again
we must help our professor first and foremost this is a tough situation for anyone
they must hope to catch us from both sides
blast more hawks we should probably take those out before we approach that beast 
it was the right move for us to follow teach but however you look at it were in a tough spot now 
wolves hawks not to mention a demonic beast guarding the canyons entrance we should never have come here
dont say that but whats a demonic beast doing here is it a stray even teach would have trouble out here all alone lets help out before were down one professor
first things first we need to reunite with teach hurry up everyone
great more hawks those feathery jerks are trying to take us out from both sides
more hawks the airs swarming with those feathered freaks lets get them before we fight the beast
graaargh
this thing  it has no will or mind to call its own you must now strike it down that is the best you can hope to offer this poor lost soul
 
do you think it was once a human like miklan no  its not possible 
let us put an end to its suffering i think that is the most honorable thing we can do at this point
our work is done my my  things did not go as planned let us return before any more hawks or wolves join us but what was that demonic beast doing within the red canyon 
im glad you are safe professor it was rather reckless of you to venture out alone like that
i suppose we came out here without permission too if we all wish to avoid punishment  perhaps we can all agree that we came out here for an extra curricular activity lets leave it at that
still i would like to know what brought you to this valley in the first place 
professor i am so glad that you are unharmed what if something had happened to you
your highness our instructor is safe we should return to the monastery at once
yes i suppose you are right if we stay here much longer we are sure to be reprimanded
it is not untrue to assert that our professor led us here for battle experience 
dedue you surprise me and you professor i hope you will tell us what brought you here 
listen teach no one likes aimless wandering more than me but its not worth dying over
well were all ok now so lets just focus on the positive ooh maybe we can tell folks back at the monastery that we came here for battle training with our dear professors permission
hilda you scamp no one has a knack for getting out of trouble quite like you do it is a gift milady
oh is that right well no one can get into trouble quite like you so it works out
oh dear  i put us in a bit of danger there we are most fortunate that those delinquents followed us  you very nearly met your end what a marvelous professor you must be for all your students to be so concerned
im proud of us
hmm you seem more confident in your ability to teach but that makes sense as you have me to help you out
im not used to it yet
you are not used to it hm you must start thinking of yourself as a professor here be confident as you have me to help you out
how disappointing to have dived so deep into danger and yet to have nothing to show huh what is this strange feeling  my memories  do you feel them stirring how curious you seem to have grown stronger and all thanks to our journey to zanado it really was worth all that effort
i found something 
huh you found this i daresay you may find a use for that you should decide how best to use that thing but wow we got a lot out of this trip it was a bother for a spell but in the end i feel we should think fondly of our little trip we actually had a delightful time wouldnt you say

interested in learning more about the legend of macuil one of the four saints claude ventures out across the territory of margrave edmund to the sreng region
hm 
very interesting 
whats interesting
what are you reading
oh teach how long have you been there dont sneak up on me like that you almost gave me a heart attack anyway im reading the official biography of the four saints as sanctioned by the church i know youre not very familiar with the teachings of seiros but even you must have read it at least once
maybe 
huh im amazed you managed to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church
i dont think so 
tell me again  how exactly did you manage to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church
well whether youve read the biography or not the four saints must at least ring a bell right
well then ive got a little quiz for you name the four saints companions of the great saint seiros ill give you a hint there was cichol cethleann indech and  who was the fourth one again
macile
ooh tough luck that would be incorrect the name you were looking for is macuil
macuil
correct i was hoping youd know that much at least
maicul
ooh tough luck that would be incorrect the name you were looking for is macuil
in any case you can learn some interesting things reading about the life and times of saint macuil for instance he was more skilled with his hands than his fellow saints and even became an accomplished blacksmith he used his skills to forge countless sacred weapons for the army of seiros of course he didnt just forge weapons he also used them in battle himself legends say his strength was second only to seiros its even said that he played a big role in the battle of tailtean where seiros fought nemesis the king of liberation who became the king of evil macuil lost his life in that battle and now his body rests in a coffin within the holy mausoleum or so one story goes another legend says he set off on a journey to find a new land that he left f√≥dlan from the east crossed the sea and vanished he must have left alliance territory but where exactly would he have set sail from i wonder thinking about it reminds me of another interesting story concerning the sreng region the peninsula is attached to the mainland of f√≥dlan and extends from the northeastern part of kingdom territory if you would set sail from margrave edmunds territory you could cut cross a stretch of sea and land there and it just so happens that in the sreng region there are ruins built to worship a sacred beast that appeared from across the sea if the ruins have something to do with saint macuil there could be sacred weapons there  so have i piqued your interest or what
maybe a little
not really
you always have to play it cool dont you just think of how useful it would be to have weapons like that not to mention that the peninsula would be pretty easy to get to about now seeing as how alliance territory has settled down a bit wed be there and back in no time no one would even notice we were gone come on teach lets go to the sreng region
lets go
i always see it through once i set my mind on something lets make the necessary preparations before i die of curiosity
let me think about it
i guess i can wait just a while but make sure you decide before i die of curiosity ok
there are the ruins  it looks like were not gonna have the luxury of an excavation look i bet those are the watchmen of the ruins and that theyve been ordered to keep out intruders and that big beast  i hear they call it the wind caller
thieves  only by defeating me can you claim the secret treasure
argh it speaks what is it
huh who are you im just here for a bit of treasure dont attack me
someone got here first  must be a band of looters we cant let them get the treasure guess their lucks about to run out
youre not trying to take this treasure from me are you
the treasure  i thought it would make me rich 
if i dont get this treasure back the boss is gonna be really angry with me
i should never have become a thief 
after all the trouble we went through to get this treasure im not gonna let you get your hands on it
gah  those thieves 
huh are you looting too well im not letting you have this treasure
no thats my treasure 
you have had your fun if you are going to flee now is your chance if you are not going to flee  i shall take your life as payment
hmmm  those who stand before me  how long has it been hundreds of years thousands you have the stink of sothis upon you  let us find out whether you share her power
i smell those detestable 10 elites  who are you
im the grandson of the grandson of the grandson of the elite riegan now tell me who you are
i am your familys enemy if you carry the blood of the 10 elites you cannot be permitted to live
what do you mean by that and whats that crest on your forehead
no more talk if you wish to survive you must destroy me
ah that face takes me back in time  you have not changed one bit ceth 
i ask that you keep quiet uncle
why the rush ceth 
shh please keep quiet uncle
are these your companions
they are indeed i should tell you that seiros is in a precarious state right now
i will not assist you i have lived apart from the world of man which disgusts me so this war disgusts me also
i thought you might say as much this is regrettable
 
it stopped moving  it is dead
zzz 
no  it seems its just sleeping  i thought we were supposed to be given the treasure but  forget it ill just have a look around there what about this thing huh ill think about it later
thanks for all your hard work teach sorry for dragging you along with me i had no idea it would turn into a fight but hey at least we got some treasure out of it ill leave this in your capable hands do with it as you will
why me
you know our friends even better than i do
why dont we share it
how would we do that
give it to whoever you think itll suit best more importantly i didnt go there looking for treasure not really legends about the saints abound its hard to tell fact from fiction i like to confirm whatever i can with my own eyes to find the truth in those legends
what did you find out
not a thing we didnt find anything concrete to prove that saint macuil had been there we cant say for certain that the treasure we found was macuils either i do wish we could have spoken to that wind caller a bit more
could it have been saint macuil
ha unlikely macuil lived thousands of years ago and ive never heard anything about the saints being monsters like that wait a minute  could the wind caller have anything to do with the immaculate one the immaculate one is a monster sent by the goddess  could the wind caller be  where was it that i heard that stuff about them having been sent by the goddess  ugh maybe im too tired my head is heavy and i cant think straight anymore lets call it a day for now ive got plenty of time to think this over

hubert reveals some of his thoughts about the mysterious power aiding the empire with strange technology as fate would have it a visitor chooses that moment to arrive 
professor youre here
did you send for me
no but while you are here you may as well listen i am sure you recall hearing about kronya solon and lord arundel i am investigating their true identities i want to know their origins their numbers their base of operations their plans i want to know where they acquired their dark powers how they disguise themselves many intriguing mysteries surround these people wouldnt you agree
yes
i have a name for them
not really
no i suppose someone of your statue has more immediately pressing concerns well i have a name for them
those who slither in the dark 
lord hubert pardon me but lord arundel is at the monastery he says he wants to discuss something with you and is waiting in the reception hall
speaking of  professor would you come along
hubert i have something i must request of you
request that is an unusual word choice a request by definition can be refused but if you have orders regent i will follow them
heh such a reaction before you even hear me out very well one of my subordinates was conducting experiments in the sealed forest the demonic beast he was using ran wild and has created something of a situation take care of it
experiments you say heh very well i will set out at once  professor will you assist
yes
thank you for your support it is a great help
now is not a good time
i understand i will call upon those who are able to move immediately let me know if you change your mind it will take some time to prepare
my my looks like this forest became infested with demonic beasts while we werent looking i suppose weve not a moment to lose not that im concerned for any of these people but since there may be a reward in it for us we may as well do what we can to rescue them
now then lets split up and move in to assist it may be worth focusing your attention on those being targeted by multiple demonic beasts
what a disgrace to be saved by those fools 
enough these certainly proved useful go ahead and take them
your tools i gather yes i suppose we will take them off your hands since you asked so nicely
im surprised at you hubert saving all of my poor subordinates 
hmph casualties you were not as helpful as i had thought you would be
im sorry
we did the best we could
i am not criticizing you this failure is my own for thinking you were capable of more
it seems gratitude is in order let us meet again soon
good riddance what a nuisance that man is he and his ilk must be aware of my investigation no doubt this was all an attempt to make us believe we are powerless against them it has only achieved the opposite effect
how so
they are looking down on us they think we cannot touch them but the closer we get to them the less true that becomes just look at this weaponry we received as a token of their appreciation it would be impossible for us to manufacture such a piece with our current tools and knowledge it is not as powerful as a relic but it is nearly so we will keep them close for now while we still need their strength to rule f√≥dlan once f√≥dlan is united however the focus of this war will shift rather than swords clashing on the battlefield it will be knives cutting in the darkness lady edelgards war will be over and house vestras will begin we who rule the shadows will eradicate those who slither in the dark when that time comes professor you will be quite useful to us

amid riots in hrym territory ferdinand learns that his missing father duke aegir has been found lysithea who knows the area well goes with him to investigate
cant stop running 
wha  
we got you youre the prime minister arent you
not anymore he lost his power and his fancy title now hes just a man
i 
shut up
yeah do you know what youve done to regular folks like us since you villains took over the hrym territory our lives have been nothing but pain and misery heavy taxes forced labor its brutal
now were gonna make you pay
agh argh aaaaaaaargh
hm such a nice selection of tea leaves in the pantry here
tea is nice and all but its not much good when you dont have sweets to go with it
sweet treats are less common yes but perhaps that makes sense war is not sugar coated
if youve got time to be cheeky youve got time to find me some sweets
but lysithea your smile is so sweet  
lord ferdinand excuse the interruption our scouts happened upon the information you were looking for i thought it would be best to let you know as soon as possible
they know where my father is
yes sir
tell me now
after losing his position as prime minister your father was held in enbarr for a very long time he escaped for a while no one knew where he was the other day however he was sighted alone in the hrym territory seemed he was heading for an allied region
hrym 
alone you say was he safe
im afraid not  there is a major insurrection happening in the hrym territory its been five years since duke aegir lost his control of the area  the military seems to have finally lost control and the peoples violence is unleashed
i do not understand why are they rioting
its obvious isnt it ferdinand do you really know nothing about hrym your own father was ruling it    you dont know what became of the area once he fell from power
if it was truly a house aegir territory i would have been trained in governing the area but my father insisted that i have nothing to do with hrym but now is not the time to talk about this we have to help him before he gets caught up in the violence
youre right now isnt the time for chitchat lets get over there quickly professor will you be coming
ill go with you
wed better depart as soon as possible i know a bit about the situation ill fill you in later
i want you to wait
i understand if you cannot help us the knights of seiros will so it is not a problem
professor time is of the essence if youre going to come with us prepare as quickly as you can
this is where my father was sighted the citizens are rioting everywhere
over there quick    we need to help them
there seem to be some people inciting the violence if we take them out perhaps the violence will subside
it might be best to spread out 
the north side of the town is in chaos i do not think we can advance
it seems better to simply hold the line against the enemies to the north and focus our efforts on saving the citizens in the east and south
th thank you looks like i wont be robbed this time
thank you ever so much for helping us i dont know what would have happened if it werent for you 
we owe you our lives were saved saved i say
i get to live another day and its all because you came to the rescue
i think thats all of them im so glad we were able to help everyone
all right lets ransack this place
ugh we werent fast enough but theres still time to save the others hurry
oh yeah keep going hahaha
they got past us again we have to save the next one
ill take whatever i want and there aint nothing you can do to stop me
ugh they ransacked another house but there may be others yet who need our help
all right boys smash and grab whatevers left
we could not save anyone it infuriates me to feel so helpless 
oh looky there some houses are still untouched lets give em a good plundering boys
professor lets make haste and go help them their lives may be forfeit if we dont get to them quickly
 hyaah go on boys riot to your hearts content
 argh im not the only bad guy here 
what w we give up have mercy that guy made us do it
 hahaha if we cause enough chaos we can do whatever we want
 my ambition unfulfilled 
we yield yield we were just following orders its not like we love a good riot really
 what do you want youd better not stand in our way
 and after i went to all the trouble of killing that noble and stealing his treasure 
father no so we were too late after all 
ferdinand  hey
yes
i  i dont know what to say about your father i mean
no it is all right some part of me was expecting this i do not know what happened in hrym territory but im sure he got what he deserved you knew more about it you said maybe you can tell me everything later
i can tell you what i know
please do
you know about the hrym rebellion right
of course the rebellion started when emperor ionius ix tried to consolidate power the hrym family tried to split off from the empire and join the alliance working with house ordelia they raised an insurrection the empire suppressed it and then a puppet leader was installed in the hrym territory house aegir was tasked with handling the actual governance of the region seeing this the nobles feared that the empire would assume total control thats when the six great noble families chose to wrest power from ionius ix
thats right the insurrection of the seven ive always wondered why it was called seven when there were only six noble families
it was the six great noble families plus hrym
how vexing either way events unfolded shortly thereafter are you aware of how duke aegir was ruling the hrym territory he imposed harsh taxes upon the people    much harsher than on his own    making their lives very challenging people fled their homes in droves to the neighboring ordelia territory but they were sent back from where they came the empire was occupying ordelia territory as well as it turned out issues were further complicated when duke aegir fell from power aegir was dismissed from his position only to be replaced by lord arundel
edelgards uncle the regent of the empire 
correct and he imposed even heavier taxes on the people squeezing them painfully dry the people were conscripted for duty any who opposed were killed on the spot lord arundel did this in the name of duke aegir
what
your father was by no means a great ruler but it was lord arundel who stoked the fury of the people and directed that fury at your father duke aegir is not perfect but hes not the villain in this
lysithea thank you for telling me all this i am embarrassed to say i had no idea i see now that it was not his fault but he did go along the wrong path and place a burden on his people he can no longer atone for what he did so i will have to i need to go think about what i will do after the war how i will make up for my fathers mistakes
nothing helps deep thought like sweets
hm
sweets they help you think perhaps you should find some for us
i see if i find some i will be sure to let you know

sylvain is unable to stand idly by when he learns that the band of thieves once led by his brother miklan are again causing trouble in margrave gautiers territory
hey professor youre looking lovely as ever
are you working today you gotta take a day sometime get out in the world and have some fun
thats not a bad idea
right sometimes you gotta forget all the things you oughta do and focus on what youd rather do hey we should go get something to eat my treat
i could never 
aw come on professor let me buy you something to eat relax for a couple hours at least
no thank you
ah fine youre missing out though
what are you after
what i cant invite my professor to dinner without it being a scam heh i ah ok fine you got me
i need to ask a favor and i wanted a way to work up the courage to ask you
ask me what
is this about a girl
no for once its not about a girl
there are thieves in my fathers territory i was wondering if youd go with me to drive em off you remember the thief leader you fought at conand tower yeah
your brother
yes miklan he was the oldest son of house gautier
miklan
thats right although hes dead now 
yes thats crazy
the way my father is he probably has some other motive that ill never know
why just you
because he thinks hed lose face asking the church for help i dont know he could have asked another trusted house to send troops but he only asked me and the way my father is he probably has some other motive that ill never know
maybe he just wants me to get some more experience in battle crazy way to suggest it though anyway im not going alone no matter what he asks im going to ask some of the others in our class to help too but none of us have your expertise if youd come with us id be grateful
of course
great ill talk to the others and see whos in thanks professor
i cant right now
ok i understand i did kind of just drop that question on you huh if you change your mind though let me know ill be around for a bit
ok weve got the thieves covered on both sides some of the thieves are still carrying what they stole so we have a chance to get it back gotta be careful though theyll run off faster than a noblemans daughter if we just rush in target the strongholds to cut off their escape routes
my fathers offering a reward for every thief and rogue we take out the more you beat the more you get just remember you gotta take them down fast theyll bolt as soon as theyre hurt take the strongholds and we cut off their escape route
ok thatll do it this exit route is blocked off very good now lets keep cool and take out the other strongholds
thats one more stronghold taken and one more escape route blocked there are still some strongholds left professor which should we go for first
another escape route blocked were nearly done take out those thieves and capture that last stronghold
weve been rattled  lets get out of here for now
ugh theyre getting away if only wed taken the stronghold out in time
i guess weve pinched enough stuff here thatll keep our bellies stuffed for a while
professor are you letting them get away come on we gotta block off their escape routes
gah  im not sticking round here to get slaughtered by a bunch of stuck up jerks like you
hey i know that face youre the bosss little bro right
im sorry to say it but yeah im his brother and hes led you into a bad spot anyway your boss is dead so this is your chance to disband this little thief gang of yours
quiet fool you think i have any other choice but to be a thief
well its probably on me for making such a stupid request
professor thank you for your help we drove off the thieves and got a reward from my father job well done eh although i dont know how to feel about this particular reward
i guess thats why my father tasked me with this particular mission he wanted me to prove myself worthy of this relic this weapon the lance of ruin  it killed my brother and now its mine
isnt that dangerous
not remotely i bear the crest of gautier the same crest my brother wished for his whole life but never came to possess
youre still thinking about your brother arent you
i suppose i am  miklan hated me from the moment he found out i had a crest and he didnt he was selfish and egotistical i know its not right to say bad things about the dead but he earned it even now im still cleaning up his messes i have to wonder though  what if it was the other way around if he had the crest and i didnt  would i be the one my father thought was worth forgetting or would my fate have been wholly unlike his
thinking like that wont get you anywhere
youre probably right professor its not like me is it i dont pray much but i think im going to pray for those who lost their lives to the thieves tonight and for all of us im afraid there are more days like this coming our way
why do you say that
faerghus has always been a cold place never very well to do until about 10 years ago our region was a battlefield for the people of the sreng region to the north and after the late king fell the whole kingdom became unstable so its no real surprise that more and more people are resorting to thievery just to survive and there are those rumors of the current regent being too busy chasing the ladies to bother with governing dont worry i get the irony the whole damn kingdom is in decline because of nonsense like that im hoping once we get dimitri on the throne everything will get better anyway ill leave it up to you to decide how you want to use our reward including the lance of ruin i know i can trust you with it until you think im ready and professor if i could id still like to buy you a meal sometime
theres no need
or do you really just hate the idea of having dinner with me just kidding i know youre busy
you have another favor to ask
no im just asking a friend to hang out thats all
again though thank you for everything professor i couldnt have done it alone

as edelgard works to reorganize the army after merging with alliance troops she receives an urgent message from duke goneril whose forces guard f√≥dlans locket
there  we must rethink the supply route now that the battle lines have moved this one will be hubert and count bergliez will oversee this force here 
ah professor  is something wrong sorry i thought i had a bit more time before the council meeting
you never stop working
true though ideally id like to hand off anything i can to my subordinates but while were on the front lines i cant help but worry about every little thing
sorry to bother you
no bother at all but im afraid im not quite finished here still im happy to see you your presence lightens my mood a great deal
now lets see 
pardon your majesty an urgent matter
whats happened
there is an army from almyra at f√≥dlans throat reports indicate it is of appreciable size
f√≥dlans throat
a steep mountain range runs along the border between f√≥dlan and almyra that mountain range is called f√≥dlans throat the sturdy fortress built within those mountains is called f√≥dlans locket it occupies the sole path through the church and the alliance nobles built the locket to safeguard against almyran invasion
normally house goneril watches over the fortress in times of trouble the lords join together to protect it but i assume it would be too difficult to defend against this incursion with only the troops of goneril 
the situation has been precarious for house goneril since holst fell ill
holst
the heir to house goneril renowned for his bravery he is hildas elder brother
i see
holst is a formidable commander it is only logical that house goneril would struggle in his absence the alliance has shattered they cant request soldiers from the surrounding lords and the imperial troops stationed there cant be relocated so easily the best course of action is for us to go out there and deal with this ourselves its critical for us to protect that location this is our chance to prove that we wont allow it to fall
yes it is to the benefit of our future governance not to abandon it it seems this must be done will you assist us
i will
well depart after you finish making preparations move swiftly we must move before the almyran army crosses the throat
let me think
yes  preparations must still be made well wait a bit longer if youre not going to join us well take those who are able and willing dont worry about it
it seems we made it in time lets help the soldiers of house goneril withdraw the black eagle strike force will protect f√≥dlans locket
support were saved
reinforcements and that flag belongs to the imperial army  ha a fine enemy indeed break through the locket and make a name for yourself no need to by shy  strike all at once
we fight to protect f√≥dlan if the defensive line is broken we fail our enemies are many but we can use the terrain to our advantage and stop them where they stand
i must commend you for your courage seeing as how you dare stand against me
your sword is fit to cleave a mountain in two care to try it out against the undefeated nader
they call you undefeated  oh but youve already suffered one defeat have you not and on this day victory will again be ours
the once defeated isnt quite as exciting is it ill just have to claim this victory here to wipe away the shame of defeat
so this is how far i go  unbelievable  what a scary woman 
no matter how many times you attack we will never allow you to capture the throat
the almyran troops are difficult opponents  for now i would much rather focus on f√≥dlans internal territories i hope they dont mount another attack anytime soon
the almyran army retreated their casualties were numerous as i understand it they wont be attempting another invasion anytime soon still we must prepare the local troops before their enemy returns
they are an irritating neighbor
indeed but if possible i would like to foster amicable relations with them
maybe we can befriend them
that is my hope i would even consider a treaty
unlike f√≥dlan almyra is not a land ruled by a blind fealty to the goddess i believe we need only to communicate openly with them and respect the differences between our cultures if we do that we should be able to have an meaningful dialogue with them one more promising than what we can expect from followers of the goddess
ah hubert what did duke goneril say
he expresses his sincere gratitude to lady edelgard in addition he would like to leave the protection of the throat to imperial troops from now on
is that so how reasonable of him by the way what was it that ailed holst
i did not hear all the details but apparently he ate some bad mushrooms it is said he is now emaciated and pale and his skin exudes a mysterious vapor
huh i cant help but imagine what that must look like but its probably better not to think about it
agreed do not worry yourself with such thoughts
 
im too curious
indeed  well then maybe you should pay a visit and then you could tell me what it looked like
its best left unseen
theres only one option then i must pay a visit on my own and see this ailment with my own eyes
heh 
actually  on second thought id better not as emperor i cant risk it

the war in f√≥dlan has put brigid in a precarious position with bernadetta in tow petra returns to her homeland in hopes of avoiding a confrontation with her grandfather
ah nothing like a moment of perfect stillness 
why is it preferable to have stillness
ah petra please dont sneak up on me like that oh  youre here too professor whats going on
i was asking my question first what are you enjoying about air that is still
um still air makes me feel better thats all it means youre in a nice closed off space where you can hide
but spaces that are wide and open are wonderful places like forests and oceans
guess well have to agree to disagree about that
i am not understanding your answer but i am appreciating your explanation i am reminded i was wanting to ask if you wish to go to the forest or ocean with me
um what what part of anything i said would make you think i wanted that
so your grandfather is in trouble hes trying to lend us soldiers from brigid but  edelgard is sending messengers there to convince brigid shes not their enemy
you are saying messengers but the truth is they are a threat brigid is having no power to refuse
i get it but what does this have to do with me
professor was asking this of me i was told if i am going to a far away place to be taking bernie with me since she is hiding away
what professor what did i do to deserve this i know im a recluse but i do go out on missions once in a while
you cant refuse
tyranny abuse of power i have rights
lend me your strength
you say that but i dont think im ready for this
bernie i am wanting this as well please join me
since you put it that way petra ill think about it do you really want me to go professor
i do
all right ill lend a hand for everyones sake
what is the point of lending a hand are you not needing both of them to battle
what no its a figure of speech oh dont make me imagine that
im not sure
maybe we are not needing you then i will try borrowing the power of the church
um ok  i dont mind shutting myself in like usual but i cant say i feel good about all this
 if your mind is changing please tell me i will be waiting as long as i can
professor this is bad the enemys already here
in strength the enemies may be winning but i am having an idea  i have been hearing that my friends are being imprisoned in the western stronghold  we will be taking the stronghold and releasing our allies do not let loose your hope
wh what that sides crawling with enemies we should go east way fewer of them over there 
whats this you there identify yourselves
ah theyre here im not the one you want im innocent
the capturing of the stronghold has been completed our friends from the stronghold will soon be aiding us in battle 
well well well this little diplomatic errand to brigid just got interesting it seems we have some special guests capture the road ahead before they reach it
if they are blocking the road i will not have the ability to be seeing my grandfather i must be moving quickly
i came here to tell the people of brigid not to join forces with our enemies looks like the empire had the same idea lets block the road and cut them off
brigid is a vassal of the empire you will not turn them against us
brigid will not become a puppet of the empire the knights of seiros wont let it happen
i cant achieve anything more here keep fighting stop them
so princess of brigid now we see where your loyalties truly lie this after we spared your life in return for naught but your fealty how ungrateful
ten years have been passed the empire has been changed just as brigid has
ah theyre here help me
heheheh go on and scream if it makes you feel better but if you could die swiftly and without a struggle i would greatly appreciate it
ah its thunder catherine were done for
hey i was going to say that you didnt let me introduce myself how rude thunderbrand and i will have to teach you some manners
heh no more i can do here troops remember your orders i must withdraw
it is done now i can be meeting my grandfather we must be moving with haste
finally over phew all right lets get out of here this isnt exactly um the ideal environment for a recluse you know
i will be speaking with my grandfather once he is convinced i will be returning professor everyone please be waiting here enemies may still be nearby
got it well wait right here and if anyone comes um the professor will handle it right professor
my life is endangered i must keep alive
reinforcements are ready let us attack with each other
professor  please convey to my grandfather  that  i am without regret 
petra petra no dont leave us
grandfather i cannot be meeting you  my objective was failed
it is done now i can be meeting my grandfather we must be moving with haste
finally over phew all right lets get out of here this isnt exactly um the ideal environment for a recluse you know
i will be speaking with my grandfather once he is convinced i will be returning professor everyone please be waiting here enemies may still be nearby
got it well wait right here and if anyone comes um the professor will handle it right professor
the vegetation around heres pretty different from the kinds we usually see it may be no good for a recluse but the forest does have its own charms doesnt it
im surprised to hear you say that
didnt you know i love greenery especially carnivorous plants theyre my favorite
you like plants
sure do especially the carnivorous ones
carnivorous plants 
yes they just sit there nice and still and wait for their dinner to come to them how great is that and they all look so unique too
 
what dont you think so oh look petras back
sorry to be making you wait i have spoken with him
its been a long time since youve seen your grandfather huh howd it go
as is usual my grandfather is well and strong he was saying that he will be supporting us and giving us troops
thats great so we did it
we did you have my thanks ever since we were losing the war to the empire brigid has been viewed as a vassal state but with f√≥dlan at war it is a chance for brigid to be changing our situation our cooperation today is part of that chance brigid is wanting equality with f√≥dlan we will be working hard to make this happen
ah 
bernie what is it you are feeling
youre amazing petra you went all by yourself to a foreign country  you worked hard for your homeland and you achieved your goal im always focused on my own problems and i barely ever get anywhere 
that is not the truth you were fighting hard for me you came here to be helping everyone you were not thinking only of yourself i am never doubting you were working hard we will be working together to keep moving forward to the future
you really mean it thats so nice
and you were telling me about your interest in foreign vegetation that is one reason i wanted to be bringing you here did it make you happy
it did it was really exciting ive got so many drawings i need to do before we head back i might even have enough to make it into a book yeah i should do that want to help professor

lorenz receives a letter from his father count gloucester who wishes for his son to resolve a territorial dispute that is about to escalate to violence
ah perfection these tea leaves are just divine quite the impressive selection if i do say so myself
lorenz so this is where ya are
hello cyril lured here by the exquisite aroma were you
uh no ive got a thing for ya its a letter alright well dont say i didnt deliver it
a letter for me is it curious lets see what we have here
 
so whos it from
hello professor it is a rare correspondence from my father as it happens
is that a love letter
alas professor nothing so whimsical as that this correspondence comes from my father
some difficulty with acheron apparently my father wishes me to return home and settle it
acheron
a young lord whose domain borders my fathers do you know of the great bridge of myrddin it is an old bridge across the airmid river a key crossing between alliance and empire territory acheron controls the land on the northern side controlling such an essential location gives him quite a bit of clout which he is ever so eager to deploy toward the purpose of stirring up trouble this time he is dredging up an old border dispute that was supposed to be settled some time ago he has even begun to dispatch military force it is best we rout his troops before they cause any damage to the surrounding villages
why does this fall to you lorenz
to my father acheron is insignificant in the face of far more pressing political matters other houses wield far greater power and influence goneril ordelia edmund and of course riegan to make his voice heard at the roundtable conferences my father must keep up relations with them that is simply the way the leicester alliance works it was after all founded with the goal of freedom from faerghus we prize that independence highly even if it occasionally hinders cooperation there is often talk of mutual aid but the truth is that each noble acts to maximize personal benefit at the moment the riegan dukedom is in no state to keep those conflicting motivations in check so while the alliance may appear to be at peace the reality is that internal conflict is a routine matter of course this leaves me precious little time to sit back and enjoy a cup of tea alas i must be off
good luck
sounds tough
since you are here perhaps you would care to accompany me on this little errand i have no fear of acheron but it could be valuable to experience these political nuances firsthand
the fate of the alliance will someday rest upon my shoulders so it is important to me that those i deal with understand its workings what say you to broadening your horizons
it is important to me that those i deal with understand its workings what say you to broadening your horizons
lets go
excellent let us be away at once i shall leave the finer details of preparation in your capable hands
another time
of course i understand you are quite busy yourself i cannot linger here forever but please do come and speak with me again if you change your mind
far more enemies than i expected i am glad you decided to come with us professor
oh and here i thought count gloucester would be too busy to send his soldiers here  ah well it doesnt matter ill just have to deal with you little meddlers swiftly and decisively
that is acheron if we can deal with him that ought to scare the rest of these rats off we need not actually kill him so long as we cut his escape off convincingly enough that should suffice incidentally take note of those drawbridges they can only be operated from one of the banks we may be able to use that to our advantage
ooh have you found something nice go ahead and hand it over
thieves do not allow them to escape
a thief has escaped
looks like our boys gave them an artful slip
i cannot believe we missed both of those dastards
the enemy is on the move do not let them through
well now so you couldnt stop us after all
me outmaneuvered by a rat ugh what a disgrace
who are you id appreciate it if you could just not get in my way
give it up acheron we are in the right if you try to remain here any longer 
what youll kill me a tiny kid like you kill someone like me oh thats too funny
an animal like you cannot be allowed to run amok we will settle this here and now
if you think youre up to the task then by all means but its not my fault if it ends badly for you
i did hear that some good for nothing inherited this territory i guess thats you then
who do you think you are im not a good for nothing you are
if you were actually good for anything at all id at least expect you to recognize who i am 
argh wait i lose i give up i surrender please dont kill meeee
  you have my thanks professor please go on ahead i will clean up here and then report to my father see you back at the monastery
now thats a stubborn defense  we should probably give up lets retreat
so theyve withdrawn what a pointless battle
you have my thanks professor please go on ahead i will clean up here and then report to my father see you back at the monastery
your assistance in this incident with acheron has proved most essential consider me in your debt thanks to you the alliance was able to nip this internal conflict in the bud
what will become of acheron
he has written a pledge to my father swearing never to cause trouble about the border again of course he is hardly the type to bind himself in good faith to anything written on paper but acheron has many connections both in the alliance and in the empire to remove him entirely would cause more conflict we will just have to watch him closely for now
that sounds like a cautious approach
that is a prudent decision
indeed i do plan to eliminate him eventually however he is nothing but trouble incidentally there was one other benefit to embarking upon this errand have a look at this
the magic staff thyrsus a relic passed down through house gloucester for generations it seems my father has finally recognized my ability apparently he had been considering entrusting this relic to me for some time he has had precious few opportunities to take to the field of battle personally of late doubtless by giving this to me he intends to send the message that i must work even harder i will certainly continue to do my utmost but i am by no means completely subservient to his will
is all not well between you two
you disagree with your fathers opinions
i would not go so far as that but my father seldom thinks beyond the immediate benefit of our house while that is important i prefer to consider the greater good when i make decisions i believe that is a nobles duty now for the time being may i trust you to decide how we may best make use of thyrsus for the moment i think you are in the best position to apply it to the betterment of all of f√≥dlan
are you sure
to be quite honest i am not certain i feel ready to decide the fate of a relic on my own just yet do me this favor professor and i will be grateful now to celebrate allow me to treat you to tea

ignatz and raphael two sons of merchant families set out to put an end to a series of monster attacks on merchants in alliance territory
 so basically we just gotta defeat their leader right then why dont we approach from ugh that wont work at all horses wont fit through there i cant figure this out i give up
try to calm down and think it through
shall we go over it one more time
but enemies never move how you want them to in a real battle do they i reckon i learn better on the battlefield
professor i need to speak with you
ignatz you all right
i received a letter from my brother back home theres some disturbing news
whats going on
monsters have been attacking merchants within the alliance territories
that happens all the time i mean thats how my parents died so 
ah raphael i didnt mean to bring up such a sensitive topic in your presence
hey dont worry about that cmon lets hear the rest of it
very well these attacks seem to be focused on specific merchants
like who
those who are traveling from the territory of house gloucester to the riegan dukedom merchants traveling in the opposite direction from riegan to gloucester dont suffer nearly as many attacks
that doesnt make any sense someones gotta deal with those monsters though
agreed at this rate my father and brother cant conduct business without risking their lives professor could you assist me i need your help exterminating these creatures
now youre talking im going too im not learning anything in a classroom youre gonna go right professor dont you wanna help these folks
we depart at once
yeah i knew you couldnt resist
thank you so much professor and raphael i cant begin to express my gratitude
not right now
seriously cant you see how important this is to ignatz
ah no thats perfectly understandable im sure the professor has much to do but let me know if you change your mind would you if you cant come ill try asking some of the knights
aah monsters begone
look the monsters are attacking those merchants again
looks like there are some humans mixed in there maybe theyre controlling the monsters if they are do you think we just have to take out the leader
lets get started before its too late
the merchants can probably escape but we gotta get rid of those enemies who are blocking the path
look a drawbridge we can use that to cross but well need to lower it first
oh no looks like we just lost one of the merchants
come on  lets try to save the rest of them
no  why
no we couldnt save any of them
aaargh they cant get away with hurting those merchants im gonna make them pay
what do you think youre doing dont get in the way of our duty
your duty youre letting monsters wreak havoc on innocent people
shut it its got nothing to do with you
im not looking forward to telling the count 
looks like we took care of em
that man mentioned the count what could count gloucester have to do with all this
thank you so much were safe now and its all due to your efforts i cant bear to think what might have happened if you hadnt shown up
yay a happy ending for everyone
thank you so much were safe now but its a shame we werent all lucky enough to escape  we mightve all met the same fate if you hadnt shown up
im real sorry we couldnt save everyone 
if you dont mind me asking were you headed to the riegan dukedom
we were we traveled around the alliance selling our wares i heard this route was dangerous but 
dangerous you say are you referring to the recent cases of merchants being attacked on that route
thats right we cant turn a profit without going to derdriu i dont know what count gloucester is thinking
this is the counts doing
i had a feeling it might be youre certain
looks that way i think hes unhappy with merchants contributing to house riegans wealth it seems like hes been at odds with them forever they say even the previous duke riegans death 
was that the counts fault too
its only a rumor but it was count gloucester himself who lured the late duke riegan out if i recall correctly he invited the duke to his estate to strike a deal on some valuable art pieces i believe the duke brought a pair of merchants with him to assess the pieces in question but 
 
alas it seems those merchants lost their lives alongside him a terrible misfortune i wish these nobles wouldnt get us common folk mixed up in their feuds you came from garreg mach right ill send a token of our thanks over later
 
those merchants who lost their lives 
yeah that was my ma and pa
my parents received the request initially but they had other business they recommended raphaels parents as substitutes we could never have imagined 
and count gloucester isnt he 
yes hes lorenzs fath  
ok ok thats enough of that its just a rumor right so who cares even if its true thats our parents business its got nothing to do with us
but you  
you got no idea what really happened right ignatz and i bet lorenz doesnt know either the way i see it it was monsters that killed my parents they died in an accident i got no reason to hate anyone or blame somebody else for their deaths i dont have time for that i got my little sis to worry about instead
raphael 
now that thats settled lets head back what do you think that merchants gonna send us i hope its food
raphael is a nice guy
raphael is a good man
yes he really is

ingrid receives an unexpected proposal of marriage from a noble of rising status as soon as dorothea hears the name she is adamantly against any engagement between them 
 
whats the matter ingrid i never hear you sigh like that
oh hi dorothea and hello professor nothings the matter well nothing major
you dont look like its nothing major then again i suppose you always have a furrowed brow dont you
truth be told theres rather a lot going on it seems that theres always something to worry about 
what do you worry about
a childhood friend whos always causing trouble my family  things like that
whats worrying you right now
now oh i really did not wish to bother you with such trivialities 
you see i received a letter from my father recently
from count galatea what a kind gentleman to have for a father
i thank you but the content within the letter is what i find troubling
let me see oh its a marriage proposal  for you
do you know the suitor
have you ever met the suitor
ive not met him though ive heard his name here and there he began life as a merchant but has somehow achieved rank in court an enterprising noble from an allied territory its most likely that he wants the crest of daphnel that i bear to adorn his family name
hmm yes that sounds about right the jerk
you sound as though you know him do you
yes i must admit that i know him he tried to court me when i was a singer best advice i can give you ingrid stay far far away from this guy
hes offered a sizeable dowry so i must at least consider it for the sake of my family
dowry ha blood money thats all it is
dorothea i 
this jerks entire fortune is soaked in blood do you want to rebuild your own house using that kind of money i mean its all just rumors but i think it still might be worth investigating what do you think professor should we go check this guy out
lets go
great lets tell the others
uh really ok 
we dont have time
thats right dorothea no point bothering all of us including the professor are far too busy
are you sure if you change your mind professor just let me know
pft  the more we look into this guy the more i see hes a monster and no good for my ingrid
no kidding theres no denying it wed better get back to the monastery
 hold on a minute you brats
hand over the girl
surely you cant mean me wait  did he send them
this jerk figures he can grab ingrid before things get too messy for him of course we know the truth about him now and hell want to kill us and get rid of the evidence  but well never let him take ingrid come on lets hurry
protect ingrid dont let anyone get near her
youll never escape
ill increase the reward now hurry up and capture that girl
that merchant is giving order to the bandits i bet if we take him out reinforcements will cease
its an ambush ingrids in trouble
enemies in hiding here they are really getting on my last nerve
ha gotcha your future husband is eagerly awaiting his bride you know
oh no no ingrid
finally its over im sorry for causing such a mess
oh hush for you id go through twice as much trouble but are you all right did they hurt you
im ok really thank you dorothea my father will need to hear of this
ingrid welcome back did you speak with your father
i did i just returned to the monastery
what happened with the proposal
as soon as i informed him of the suitors unsavory tendencies he rejected the proposal outright were we to form ties with such an individual it would bode poorly for our family regardless of the weighty dowry offered
oh thank goodness im so glad it all worked out
you and me both my father also insisted i take this
a heros relic
indeed this is the magic lance l√∫in which has been passed down for generations within my family my father and siblings have no way of using it since they bear no crest father told me i should take it and use it to protect myself with he said its far better used protecting his daughter than gathering dust
aw thats so sweet your father really does mean well ingrid
hes unendingly stubborn but i am proud of who he is dorothea professor  i want to thank you
of course
we couldnt just do nothing while you were facing a life of being married to a monster
it was important that we help you
it really was quite exciting too so you know dont worry about it
i could never hand over my lovely ingrid to some jerk who only wants her for her crest
oh do i belong to you now rather than to myself hey  dorothea this is probably more than a little awkward considering where it came from but here
a ring is this  no is it
a proposal
oh ingrid  i accept your offer well be together forever
a bribe
i mean sure i suppose  clumsy bribe though giving me a ring and not telling me why
stop teasing me dorothea im trying to be sincere i wanted to find a way to emphasize how grateful i am to you so i looked for something from among my things that i thought you would like i mean you may already have one like it but i thought on the off chance you didnt 
ingrid you are just adorable and i love it but perhaps we should lend this ring to our teacher for now our dear teacher can best decide how to use it you found hard enough youve earned the right to have a little fun
as you wish dorothea i gave the ring to you so you can do whatever you please with it
haha

safety for the people of the kingdom has been a growing concern and fraldarius territory is no exception felix has been called upon to help restore order back home
there you are i was looking for you i need a favor
its unusual for you to ask for help
yes its an unusual favor
you want to spar right
no this is more serious
my father sent a messenger he wants me to return to fraldarius territory
your father
rodrigue achille fraldarius the highest ranking member of the faerghus nobility i believe youve met him so i heard but about the favor youre familiar with the tragedy of duscur i presume
i am
i cant recall
warriors from duscur killed king lambert of faerghus
after the kings death public order disintegrated bandits continue to raid villages across the kingdom including those within fraldarius territory my father says he needs my help driving the bandits away
and you want me to join you
precisely good guess perhaps i shouldnt pull you into this  it stems from my familys failure to secure the region but honestly i want to see you in action i never tire of watching you fight and itll be much more interesting for you than the training ground or maybe this task    driving off bandits    seems dull to a former mercenary
ill join you
excellent while im at it i have a second favor to ask of you could you recruit more fighters i bet there will be willing volunteers if youre the one inviting them ill set off on my own and meet up with you there
let me think about it
ok i can handle a few bandits if you change your mind about it tell me soon
hmph struggling to defeat some bandits what a pathetic old man my father is some villagers are trapped lets help them escape
felix my son youve finally brought reinforcements
everything will be fine good people of this hamlet escape while you can
the stronghold is ours no more bandits should come crawling out of here
weakling that should put a stop to their reinforcements
so its you from the officers academy thank you for taking such good care of my son it pains me to trouble you but i humbly request your assistance in helping secure the villagers safe escape
pathetic struggling to defeat some ragtag bandits
felix  you may know this already but no matter how many you kill more always appear anywhere in the kingdom these days you can see the same kind of scenes his majesty the late king would despair to see it
a dead man doesnt despair besides lets focus on the living
oh prince dimitri is here to help i am humbled your highness and so sorry to trouble you
no it is fine as a man of royal birth this is the obvious course however it does not exactly seem like they are remnants of miklans faction
indeed nothing but common bandits and yet  ruffians like that have recently surged in number
i am aware for now let us focus on saving the villagers
outmatched by a damn bandit 
come now stop living in denial old man
i cannot die in this place  his majesty would want me to keep going 
my foolish father  hes in trouble
everyone im sorry its over for me 
thank you so much please help my neighbors too
that should do it weve chased those ruffians away for good
thank you so much for your assistance please accept this small gift as thanks
 we are grateful for your help i doubt those bandits will stop anytime soon but at least this village is safe this village was important to the late king if we hadnt saved it i wouldnt have been able to face his majesty
how foolish
pardon
we were protecting your subjects not your ego i dont give a damn as to whether you can bring yourself to face a dead king
i will not tolerate such language from you
i came here to hone my blade and to save innocent people i suppose if i had died you would say the same thing you did after glenns death ‚Äúhe died like a true knight‚Äù
 
i have nothing more to say im going back
im sorry you had to see that hes been that way for four years now of course i understand his sentiment to some extent it all comes down to  well a difference of opinion

five years after rheas disappearance a letter that she wrote prior to that battle has surfaced the mysterious message raises more questions than it answers 
here you are there is something we need to discuss i found this letter in rheas quarters i believe it is intended for you
how do you know that
simple your name appears at the top once i saw that i decided not to read any further i will admit however that i am quite curious will you permit me to read it along with you
dear child  i have little time and so i will keep this brief i asked you to take care of things should something happen but i wished to make myself useful as well i left a treasure at the holy tomb please take it however note that i set a bit of a trap to prevent thieves from stealing it please take ample precautions so that you are not harmed when you retrieve it may sothis protect you   rhea
judging by the rushed handwriting she must have written this just prior to the battle five years ago i know nothing of this treasure but it must be quite valuable if you intend to recover it then i will accompany you shall we go
lets go
the letter does indicate that rhea laid some sort of trap in the holy tomb we should bring some allies along just to be safe
not now
this was clearly important to rhea it certainly warrants a closer look in my opinion let me know if you change your mind
professor so this is where you were i have something i would like to show you
i found this in lady rheas room it seems to be a letter addressed to you
did you enter the room on your own
did you check out the room on your own
i admit some guilt to the action however i hoped lady rhea had left something behind i have not read the contents of the letter if you do not object could we read it together
her handwriting is a mess it is likely she wrote this letter five years ago just before the battle if lady rhea says its a treasure then ive no doubt it would be useful to us if you plan to retrieve it i will accompany you what is your plan professor
lets go
however it says lady rhea laid some manner of trap in the holy tomb just to be safe id like to request somebody to accompany us we dont know what dangers await
not now
i defer to your judgment professor but are you sure please let me know if you change your mind
here you are teach take a look at this
i found it in rheas room its addressed to you
did you enter her room on your own
did you look through her room on your own
well i know its not necessarily fair to rhea but theres no way i wasnt going to take a look i thought i might find some valuable information or even some treasures that could be useful for the coming war in the end all i found was that letter i obviously couldnt read it before you did go ahead im sick with curiosity
her handwriting is messy she must have written it right before that battle five years ago that treasure  if it belongs to rhea theres no doubt that it has great value it would be bad if some thief managed to sneak off with it lets go and get it teach
lets go
great but theres a trap there that might injure us huh just to be safe theres a friend id like to invite as well after all who knows what lies ahead
not now
wow even though rhea left that special treasure behind just for you  let me know if you change your mind ok ill be around
these are the guardians of the holy tomb they will attack any intruders we had better take care
rather excessive merely to deter thieves isnt it we should target those commanding phantoms
these phantoms are strengthening the golems we must defeat the phantoms first
thats one but there are others we need to handle all of these commanders
thats reduced the golems strength nows our chance to take them out
we have subdued the holy tombs guardians let us get what rhea left behind so we can leave this place
got it ah  this seems important
something is wrong do not let your guard down
phantoms and some are giving commands remove them from the battlefield immediately
mechanical beasts  locate their puppet masters and eliminate them
one down target the remaining commanders
the puppets still move but they appear weaker destroying them should be easier now
it seems all is safe lets find lady rheas treasure quickly
here so this is lady rheas treasure 
theres something there are those the devices that rhea warned us about
those are the phantoms  and some of them are giving orders lets target those first
giant monsters  it would be best to take care of whoevers controlling them straight away
they may be phantoms but they can still be harmed lets take out the other commanders
those giant monsters can still move but they seem much weaker now we should be able to finish them
looks like we made it through the madhouse so wheres this treasure that rhea mentioned
we finally found it this must be the treasure lets get out of here and take a look
allow me to apologize on rheas behalf for putting you so squarely in harms way that much force should not have been necessary to deter mere thieves perhaps in her haste rhea made a miscalculation
what kind of trap was that
did rhea really build all that
it is a little known legend that the holy tomb was constructed by the goddess herself that mirage those guardians  i believe that trap was there from the beginning it must have been disabled for the sake of the ceremony the last time you were there now as to this treasure weve uncovered  this is an ancient relic blessed by the goddess and kept sacred by the church it is both a priceless piece of history and a holy artifact of extraordinary power rhea has entrusted it to you and you may do with it as you wish but please treat it with the utmost care
well i suppose that concludes this bit of business i shall take my leave
i never thought a holy tomb would have a trap such as that had we not been prepared  yet if lady rhea set that trap then what kind of person is she
a goddess maybe
a genius maybe
perhaps you could go save lady rhea and ask her directly whatever the truth still this treasure has been recovered i do not know how much history is attached to this item but it is an amazing artifact it is possible this weapon once engraved its name in the history of the church of seiros this is your responsibility emparted to you by lady rhea you must decide how best to make use of it
i will be going now i must prepare for our next battle
good grief rheas trap was more extensive than i expected could something like that really be a result of sorcery alone i dont understand the structure at all  it certainly wasnt made quickly
was it made earlier
what it there from the beginning
i think so that trap may have been built into the holy tomb when it was first constructed in which case there might have been another purpose for building it other than just as a saints tomb  now i have even more questions for rhea i hope we reunite with her soon however we now have a salvaged treasure  it might be something incredible  the church kept some of the legendary weapons that were blessed by the goddess this isnt something one just stumbles across anyway it was entrusted to you teach do what you will with it
my curiosity has been satisfied for the time being so maybe ill return to my responsibilities

without a crest or a family fortune leonie has a difficult time getting her hands on quality gear linhardt offers her a hint about a sacred weapon anyone can wield
not bad at all if i do say so myself
i see needles and thread what has you engaging in the textile arts leonie
patching up a hole in my equipment bag take a look what do you think
if your objective is merely to block up the hole then i believe youve performed quite adequate work
you might need a new one
im not going to throw away something i can still use i cant afford to be wasteful
maybe you should ask for help next time
blocking the hole was all i cared about so this suits me just fine
yes but your bag is less bag and more a collection of dirty smelly patches
smelly huh i dont smell anything
that aside dont you have an allowance from your house to make purchases
no nothing worse than that actually im in debt i could only afford the officers academy because everyone in my village donated
the tuition is that expensive
its not just that in the alliance you have to pay the nobles as well in order to secure recommendations commoners can only get an education by borrowing money its pretty stupid not sure what makes the nobles think theyve got the right to  oh sorry linhardt forgot youre a noble
if one is in a family that bears a crest then youre going to stand atop the social pecking order id raise the topic with the goddess she handed out crests to the nobles after all
just handed them out huh you make it sound pretty casual
by the way i have a weapon to recommend it should suit a commoner such as yourself
that so i just told you i dont have a lot of money
youre not going to buy it from a merchant if you find it you can keep it for free
now youve got my attention
theres a legend i read recently about saint indech one of the four saints of the church of seiros
uh huh keep talking
sorry  suddenly very sleepy nap time calls
hey come on you cant just doze off in the middle of a story
long story short theres a holy weapon hidden in lake teutates that you can use even without a crest 
lake teutates right lets go professor
me
whats with that look dont you want to help your lovely students
lovely
yeah me and linhardt arent we just the cutest
leave me be im off to nap
well never find it unless youre there if youre really that tired well just have to carry you
im not sure i want to carry him
well bring more people well take turns come on professor youre coming right
i will
if were going now i do suggest leaving edelgard and hubert innocent of our quest lake teutates is a place that concerns the saints of the church of seiros it may become bothersome should the two of them find out 
im not fond of keeping secrets from friends but i guess we can tell them when we get back
all right lets go find this thing
maybe later
ah well guess its just you and me linhardt
zzz 
let me know if you change your mind professor looks like i might be waiting here a bit
linhardt wake up weve reached lake teutates
huh what oh um yes so we have
a temple on a lake huh looks fancy and thats a cute uh guard dog
guard dog is it i to whom you are referring
whoa a magic beast and it talks
nuisance  you weaklings should turn tail and run
uh hi were actually um looking for something 
i know well what it is that you desire if you want it you must first complete my trial
of course we do this is as awful as i expected perhaps we could go home now
are you kidding its just a little fog come on lets go talk to mr magic beast
i suspect our opponent is an illusion if we cut off the source of this magic they should stop attacking
fine defeat me and show me what you are capable of
could you be the incarnation of sothis interesting  lets test your mettle
well fight but your form and mannerisms suggest that you might be 
if you want your wish to be granted it is better that you fight me in ignorance
hey mr magic beast if we defeat you will you grant our wish
indeed i will
great i may not have a crest but ill give it my all
you are an interesting young girl  i accept your challenge
you seem to be holding back thank you for that
hmph do not flatter me my power is not what it once was the best i can do nowadays is to have fun meddling with humans who wander in here
i see we were hoping you might help us but is seems that may be too difficult
oh youre here too ive always wanted to meet you ceth 
i ask that you keep quiet uncle
whats that ceth 
shh please keep quiet uncle
you did well the trial ends here  what sublime children of men  go ahead name your desire
so uh we heard youre giving away free weapons
do be quiet leonie somewhere in this temple is said to rest the holy bow of saint indech it is called the inexhaustible could you find it in your heart to let my friend here have it
you have shown might deserving of my sacred bow i will grant your wish
yes thanks mr magic beast
arent you happy leonie thats quite a bow and it was completely free
ill say ive never seen anything like it but is it really ok for me to take this
i would say so wouldnt you after all you went through an awful lot to get it
i know but  professor maybe you should hold on to it for me at least for a while
why me
its yours leonie
its not a weapon just anyone can use i can see that i want to be more confident in my strength before i really call it my own even holding it right now makes me feel unworthy id really appreciate you looking after it for me
i understand
thanks professor and everyone else who helped me too im really grateful linhardt im sorry i forced you to come along but seeing such a kind hearted person like you  well lets just say my opinion of the nobilitys shifted a bit
im not sure i completely understand leonie but it sounds like praise so i will take it as such
now lets get back to work i need all the training i can get
she already possessed the strength to use that bow  she went through the trouble of fighting a saint so she could claim that weapon as her own
a saint
or maybe youd call it a saintly beast in any case 
when the time is right can you fill in edelgard about what happened
oh and please do let me use that bow its not exactly a heros relic but it is still rather fascinating isnt it i would love to learn to what extent the bows connection to the crest influences the weapon and perhaps even  oh its been too much of a day hasnt it im feeling tired so lets talk about this later good night

whispers of death knight sightings in garreg mach excite caspar but mercedes has a much more pensive reaction something must be on her mind 
professor mercedes what are you two doing here
um we were just talking why do you look so flustered
havent you heard an imperial army was spotted near garreg mach
oh do you think they came to scout
maybe we could probably take care of em if thats the case  but i heard the death knight is out there
the death knight 
is that a problem
who was that again
dont you remember hes the guy who abducted flayn we fought him a bunch of times after that right mercedes oh is something the matter
n no its nothing really  nows probably not the time but i was just thinking of my brother
you have a brother
yes but we have different fathers he was a year younger than me
whyd he suddenly come to mind
you see  
quickly you must prepare for battle the death knight has been spotted in the sealed forest he only has a few troops with him so we planned on taking him out with just the knights but  we cant guarantee that reinforcements wont arrive we would appreciate your backup just in case
the death knight  i have to go 
mercedes wait i dont know whats going on with you but 
no i have to go see him
lets go with her
yeah we cant let him get away ill help mercedes find the death knight you go gather the others and meet up with us professor
im not so sure 
we dont really have time to sit around and think but a little prep cant hurt against the death knight
yes  you two are right 
let me know when youre ready try not to take too long though all right its not like the death knight is just gonna wander around the forest waiting for us to find him
emile wait dont go take your helmet of please let me see your face it really is you under there isnt it ive been searching for so long 
i finally caught up with you mercedes youre faster than you look  but im here now so you can give up death knight
 
flee and i will not chase you  challenge me and i will have no choice but to fight 
enemy reinforcements are approaching what should we do
lets take em out reinforcements just means we get to fight even more
i told you that if you fled i would not chase you but it seems you wish to die 
you try to hide yourself with that mask and helmet but i know who you really are
i have nothing to say to you
the infamous death knight champion of the empire taking you down is gonna be satisfying
heh simpleton 
fate is unkind there will be no resolution today  flee and i will not give chase
simple but effective 
youre not getting away that easy
i must go 
phew we did it are you all right mercedes
i am thanks to you but still 
theres something you wanted to ask him right come on he ran off into the forest
thank you caspar
you came 
how many years has it been since we last spoke im so sorry  i should have come for you sooner  im sure it wasnt pleasant living in house bartels
im not sure i follow do you know this guy mercedes
my younger brother  emile  is it really you
im sorry what your brother is the death knight but you two look nothing alike
mercedes  leave the monastery
hold on just a minute is that all youve got to say for yourself
this doesnt concern you 
thats not true youre her brother right but youve got nothing nice to say to her after all this time
you will die 
even if i die ive made my choice please emile fight on our side instead
i cannot my soul has long departed  and yet  here take this and go
is this a heros relic you and i must share the same crest
when next we meet i will kill you without hesitation
you wont kill me i have this now
hmph do not die until i can kill you 
hmph
what is it you got a problem with me
take  this 
this is 
i will kill her until then she must live 
emile i cant believe hes gone again 
i cant tell whether or not he actually cares that youre his sister 
hmm  somewhere hiding underneath that helmet theres a very sweet boy
is that a joke would a sweet boy threaten to kill someone i dont get you mercedes
living at house bartels changed him but thats beside the point thank you caspar i couldnt have confronted him without you
dont worry about it i may not understand you half the time but were still pals
come on then pal lets get back to everyone else

the ambitions of those who slither in the dark are forever shattered with shambhalas destruction but in the process rhea is grievously injured what fate awaits her and who will bear the weigh of f√≥dlan on their shoulders
ugh 
hang in there lady rhea
she needs help hurry
thats a serious injury  its a miracle that shes even alive right now ill do what i can but 
five years ago when this place fell an enormous white creature appeared on the battlefield it was the immaculate one  rhea
she tried to save me 
what you already knew rheas true identity
thinking back i suppose so
i see in the past the children of the goddess were all able to change their appearance just like the immaculate one i lost that power long ago but it seems rhea has not
youre one of the children of the goddess
is it not obvious flayn and i both are we have protected garreg mach and all of f√≥dlan for a very long time but now  the light of rheas life is on the verge of disappearing from this world it is flickering  i do not know if she can be saved even if she is i wonder if she will remain unchanged 
professor are you able to carry on rheas work as the protector of f√≥dlan and as leader of the people who live here  you must defend the people guide them and teach them join their hearts and spread peace across the whole of the land
it is not as though you must become the archbishop but f√≥dlan needs leadership it is up to you to govern this war torn land
i 
you need not reply right this moment we will strive to heal rhea as best we can
perhaps it would help to seek counsel from our friends at the monastery about this matter
i agree when your mind is made up please speak with me i would ask that you give me your decision in the presence of rhea herself
well done professor we have brought the war to a magnificent conclusion the empire alliance and kingdom are no more nor are there any factions that could blindside us and cause conflict now it falls to us to rule f√≥dlan and bring about an era of peace and prosperity you would be a fine choice for the first ruler of this new era i sincerely believe that
thank you
so your heart is already set on it excellent in that case congratulations are in order
im not sure
well if you are unsure what does that say about everybody elses chances
i will follow you professor i aim to be a great and respectable noble
congratulations on a job well done professor i do hope lady rhea is well is it true what i heard you will be taking over her post would that make you archbishop or higher still am i in the company of the future ruler of f√≥dlan
either would be a hassle
i agree imagine all that responsibility until now youve always fought with all of us by your side bring ruler would be a much lonelier job though i am certain you would excel
the latter i will rule over f√≥dlan
so youve already decided  such proactive thinking is the hallmark of a good ruler
me i have no interest in a leadership role im happy to spend the rest of my days studying and napping
all  right we did it professor we really gave it to em out there with all the fighting and hardships i dont know how we did it  but im glad we made it through together
me too
now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler thats gonna be a fun coronation
it was a lot to push through
sorry if i made your life more difficult none of that matters anymore though right now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler thats gonna be a fun coronation
phew  its all over professor though i am worried about lady rhea  but still f√≥dlan is united and those terrible people lurking in the dark have finally been destroyed looks like its the dawn of a wonderful new era of blissful seclusion for bernie
that wont do
wh what why not hey that better not be your first official decree youre going to ask for my help again arent you oh why
suit yourself
woo hoo you finally did it bernie now take your reward of eternal peace and quiet
finally an end to the fighting have you ever felt happier ive worried that i might not live to see this day but here we are and everything is going to be ok isnt it huh my heart feels like its ready to burst im so full of happiness yet i feel a sense of loss too 
we did lose a lot
yes we certainly did but we managed to keep a great many things safe as well
we protected more than we lost
i agree i suppose if i think of those who are gone as the people who ensured our freedom it hurts less
please do what you can to keep the peace so we never have to face such awful times again
war has been ended i will now be returning to brigid i hope in the new f√≥dlan brigid can be accepted with friendship when my professor becomes the leader i think that will have a possibility please choose well
same to you
yes now i must be packing
im not sure yet 
is that the truth i will be waiting for your decision i will be packing while you are thinking
its over what will you do i heard you intend to lead
im not sure
you shouldnt need that long to decide make up your mind
im more interested in what youll do
well if you do choose to lead i might like to work for you but first ill go back to the old faerghus territory where my father and my old friends once lived i need to pay respects put flowers on their graves
well it took a long while for us to get here but we did it the war is finally over weve been through a lot together havent we let me just say its truly been an honor
the same to you
im flattered to hear you say do
oh cut it out
hey come on i mean it theres nothing to be embarrassed about
for whatever its worth i think youd make a great monarch and id support you every step of the way
ah yow she didnt have to slap me that hard oh professor its you whats up need something
lovers quarrel again
i dunno if id call us lovers exactly not yet anyway its was just a dinner invite
dont need anything but 
heh you worried i might cause trouble again nah i just invited a girl out to dinner
all fighting and no loving makes sylvain a rusty boy well i can get back in practice now peacetime is the best for love  nobody dying nobody getting hurt except me apparently if youre gonna be the ruler you need to keep the peace going so i can catch up on my love life
i heard a rumor that youre going to take over for lady rhea
it hasnt been decided
oh so the rumor was really true i hope you accept i dont think theres anyone else who could do it
thats the plan
so its already been decided thats very admirable of you professor
you have nothing to worry about were here to help you if you need anything at all well support you no matter what path you choose to follow
is lady rhea ok she was quite weakened to start and then she took all those heavy injuries  i dont want to imagine it but what will happen if lady rhea passes away like this
well cross that bridge if we come to it
i suppose youre right
im sure shell be fine
yes im praying every day that shell get well as soon as possible
anyhow  youre going to be the ruler professor its so strange to think of for some reason
can it really be are we truly at peace to think that my days will not be spent debating war tactics and preparing for battles it doesnt quite feel real now that we are finally at peace im not quite sure what to do with myself
just take it easy
that sounds challenging for how easy it must actually be
maybe you should think about the future now
thinking of the future has never been my forte
as long as i have a routine in place for myself i can find contentment
the day is ours professor and this victory will ensure our names are immortalized in history or perhaps this is but the opening chapter in the tale they will write of our glory after all if you are to rule this reunited land surely there is bound to be a place for me at your side
absolutely
i read your mind didnt i fear not i will not fail to rise to the occasion
nothings decided yet
is that so it seems to me that everyone has already assumed you would take the position
regardless your decision will have an impact on my future so be sure to make it a good one
hey professor i was just thinking i might go train i know the wars over but that doesnt mean i can stop working my muscles
that makes sense
im glad you see it my way i always knew you were a smart one
you should work on other things too
really i wouldnt know where to start but 
theres no harm in keeping up with my training
after all thats happened to lady rhea all of the stuff with solon and the others and everything thats happened with you professor  theres still a lot i dont understand please teach me professor  everything you know everything youve learned
ok
thank you oh thank you
if i get the chance 
if its at all possible i hope youll speak about it not just to me but to everyone else as well i think everyone should know what happened here if were going to build a new united f√≥dlan thats absolutely crucial
those who slither in the dark will never harm anyone again theyre finally done for thank you professor finally i feel some vindication for what ive gone through
no thank you lysithea
ah professor ever the modest one i do like that aspect of you
keep up the good work
uh sure thing
as long as im of use here im happy to stick around professor
and with that we can finally enjoy a time of peace im honored to have fought by your side even if you havent made plans yet i know youll do your best whatever your future may hold
youve grown much stronger
if true thats all thanks to you and our allies
youve become quite the optimist
i never wouldve dreamed my heart could have grown this way
please let me know if theres anything more i can do
hey professor the war is finally really definitely over now right were not gonna find out there was some evil shadowy figure hiding behind the subterranean guys are we
who knows
well whatever no matter what comes i know we can triumph in the end
i dont think so
ah thats good though to be honest theres not much that would surprise me at this point 
i feel invincible a nice perk of being your student dont you think
well we both made it and we avenged jeralt too cant say it gets any better than that youve got a lot of work ahead of you i hear people want you to govern dont they
its a hassle
yeah sadly this isnt the kind of burden i can take off your hands
its a dilemma
well at the end of the day its your decision just take your time think it through
youve got to consider it carefully so you dont have any regrets whatever you choose though just know that im here for you
we did it captain
make sure youve got no regrets
at last the day is upon us the captain would be pleased dont you think leonie
definitely and hed be proud of the professor too
it seems like our efforts have been rewarded it was certainly a long difficult struggle to get here
it was oh jeralt  we worked so hard for this
uh hello
whaaaaaah
aaah how long have you been standing there
er ahem whether or not you choose to succeed lady rhea we will forever be by your side
yeah well be here no matter what you decide but make sure you think it through you dont want to have any regrets
well is your mind made up
no
i understand just know that we are applying all our power right now toward healing rhea you should take this opportunity to speak with everyone i am certain it will do you good
yes
i have faith in lady rheas convalescence but even so what she needs now is rest and while she is recovering somebody must watch over f√≥dlan there is no one more fit to wear such a mantle than you professor that is what i believe i do not doubt the others feel the same
shambhala  an underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess strange phenomena driven by a source totally alien to the crests that we understand most unsettling could it be magic some manner of technology i would like to know the truth of it all very much so i want to know their history their knowledge why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy
well i dont know
no i suppose you wouldnt  it seems we will have to excavate shambhala to know more although i heard you will be the ruler here should i ask your permission to proceed with the dig
life can be tough you know but if youve got your friends to help you through it can be a lot easier maybe you butt heads sometimes but thats ok thats how you build bonds right and ive got friends professor plenty of those its true love that seems to have passed me by
you should relax
relax im relaxed
theres still hope
but where is my true love to be found where is my ray of hope
time to give up
yeah  im starting to figure thats the most realistic option
at this point im just hoping you stay single too then at least we can share each others misery
jeralt  weve done it weve finally brought this creaky old ship ashore the fight was long and bitter but finally i can lay down my burden
uh hello
whaaaaah its you dont creep up like a ghost next time announce yourself er ahem whether or not you choose to succeed lady rhea i will forever be by your side you should live your life however you want thats what the captain would say i think
lady rhea stopped the forces that threatened to destroy f√≥dlan shes trying to realize her own dream of peace isnt that enough cant you let her rest if youre the only person whos fit to replace her you should just do it im sure lady rhea wishes for that too right i cant think of anyone whos more well suited to the job
the wars finally over  i have to admit even i got a little emotional rheas condition doesnt look good theres nothing to do now but wait more importantly are you serious about becoming f√≥dlans new ruler
im not sure
its pretty sudden either way do what you think is best
i am
you made up your mind pretty quickly either way do what you think is best
professor do you figure lady rhea will be ok she will wont she i dont care one bit wholl succeed lady rhea cause nobodys gonna need to shes gonna be happy and healthy again youll see
i can tell that things will settle down soon enough gotta get back to slinging wares and making moolah and hopefully no more messes to spoil it after this 
greetings professor nothing to report say how is the archbishop faring the soldiers and citizens are all concerned just when we thought peace had finally arrived  whats to become of f√≥dlan
sweet child  you have finally come  i am so happy it does my heart well to see you here safe and sound
have you made your decision professor thankfully rhea has survived her trying ordeal however  there is no telling how much longer her light will continue to shine
professor have you decided will you become the next ruler of f√≥dlan
 
before i hear your answer i shall fulfill the promise i made to you you will know the truth about your identity  i will hold nothing back i  created you and within you is the crest stone of the progenitor god  i hid the crest stone within your heart in order to revive her sweet child  i am sorry i wanted to see her  see my mother  even if it meant doing that which is forbidden
what does it all mean
i thought that i could regain all i had lost if only i could revive my mother  and so i tried to bring her back by creating a body and then burying a crest stone within it a young woman i created  my twelfth try after much heartache  was a failure she grew up lacking the conscience of the progenitor god and fell in love with the captain of the knights of seiros in time she became pregnant  but she and the child were not able to survive the birth the child she bore was not breathing and she herself was in grave danger the new mother pleaded with me to take the crest stone of the progenitor god from her own body and place it within the baby if i had done nothing both mother and child would have died and so i granted her final wish as she had hoped the baby started breathing again  the new life was saved your life sweet child
 
well before that i had saved jeralts life using the power of my blood that means you are the child of a mother born of the progenitor gods crest stone and a father who carried my own blood i knew deep in my heart that you would be capable of housing the conscience of the progenitor god i was right  and yet she merely gifted her power to you and then disappeared once more my dearest wish did not come true  but here you are you alone wield the power of the progenitor god and now i must ask you to use that power to save this world you must 
what  no  arrgh
rhea rhea
what is wrong please calm yourself rhea
graaargh
is the power of the crest taking over her body why is this happening
seteth its terrible white beasts have appeared all over garreg mach its hard to believe but there have been reports that the priests and knights have been changing form
white beasts  are they the ones rhea shared her blood and stones with
seteth demonic beasts are heading this way
they are after rhea  professor our situation is dire if we do nothing f√≥dlan will be destroyed by a rampaging immaculate one and these children of hers there is only one way to stop this we  we must  damn it we have no choice but to kill the immaculate one  to kill rhea
though showing brief signs of recovery even rheas strength has its limits having changed form to the immaculate one she is unable to control her power as if in response priests and knights who are directly related to rhea by blood change into white beasts themselves facing this unexpected threat the resistance army prepares for its final battle to save f√≥dlan
with shambhala in ruins the five year war is finally at an end and a new age of peace has arrived not long for this world rhea wishes to discuss f√≥dlans future with youyou but all is not well 
it is kept secret but there is a certain rite that all initiates to high office in the church must undergo in this rite one pledges to serve the goddess and in return receives a crest stone fragment and blood the ones who have transformed alongside rhea just now are the ones who have accepted those gifts they will shield rhea  the immaculate one i should say  with their very lives but if we do not strike her down f√≥dlan will have no future to arms
surrounded already it seems the white beasts are those in whom rheas blood flows strongest until we get rid of them we will not be able to so much as touch rhea
damn after all thats happened why do we have to kill lady rhea
isnt the fighting already over why do we have to do this to lady rhea
the immaculate one we cannot afford to lose here whoever our foe may be
stop any damage to the immaculate one will only be transferred to those beasts
it is seeming that my understanding of f√≥dlan tradition is insufficient what is happening
it is too dangerous to approach her now capture the southern stronghold first to seal the beasts away
theyre coming one by one from the southern stronghold if we do not capture it there will be more
let us turn our attention to the immaculate one
this is it the final battle
graaaargh
rhea not even i have seen this form
well thats something isnt it a shame we must kill her consider the research potential 
i will inherit the pride of nabatea rest in peace by sothiss side
rhea  how tragic but there is no time to waste she must be stopped
lady rhea  with my sword i will put an end to your suffering
this is me paying ya back no matter what ill stop lady rhea
rhea please
youre here mother 
a rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for f√≥dlan rheas wild rampage was put to an end averting what could have the greatest crisis in the history of f√≥dlan after five and a half years of war a new age was set to begin the empire kingdom and alliance all political structures that had once shaped the continent were gone a unified nation began to take shape under the watchful eye of the church of seiros the churchs new leader became a champion of the people working tirelessly to help them overcome the horrors of war and to carve a path towards reconstruction just as saint seiros tended to those who suffered in wars of the past f√≥dlans new ruler embraced their role as mother of all life and arbiter of every soul
/***EOF***/
the resistance army successfully takes fort merceus their victory celebrations are cut short however when javelins of light pierce the sky and destroy much of the fort with nowhere else to go the resistance army withdraws to garreg mach under the guise of surrender they secretly prepare for a surprise attack on the imperial capital
it seems the preparations for our invasion of enbarr are advancing smoothly all has been laid out so we can move swiftly to the necessary locations until the time comes please try to keep your spirits up
i understand
there is something else  i have heard that rhea is potentially being held captive in the capital the information could not be confirmed nor even properly sourced but even still  we cannot ignore the possibility please bear that in mind
if its true well find her
yes we must not let anything get in the way of rescuing her
i dont believe it
do not say that to receive any information at all is surely a boon if it is true we must not let anything let in the way of rescuing her
were finally heading to enbarr the capital city of the empire  so many memories there 
oh yeah so youve been there before
oh um yes though it was a very long time ago
a very long time you must have been really young im surprised you remember
the main stage of the mittelfrank opera company is in the capital  i hope no one from the opera gets swept up in the coming chaos 
there are many buildings straight out of the history books in enbarr i hope they remain unharmed 
youre worried about the buildings what about the people youre an odd one lin
i am also worried about the people im sure my father is in a palace in the capital
many people reside in enbarr so we must take care to avoid needless casualties
i dont think edelgard cares much for avoiding casualties so thats probably impossible i bet well be fighting until one side or the other is completely destroyed
bernie you should be staying away from thoughts like that we will be defeating her with our full power our enemy has great strength but we will not be losing
i could not agree more remember even if our surprise attack works a force even greater than all of our troops combined awaits us in the capital zero casualties is always the goal but we must not underestimate the situation at hand
still we must not hold ourselves to the same twisted morality that she does after all we are here to stop her not to follow her down her dark path we all choose to fight back we are all in this together
youre right flayn weve got to try our hardest
a different path from edelgard 
there is no stopping her the only way to end this is to kill her
our choice  flayn your words are wonderful and full of bravery
lets go we cant lose
the situation is dire and so i will do what must be done
i am certain that if we can join our strength we can win this battle without losing a single soul
professor at last the end is nigh i love the empire part of me wants it to survive but i know that is not reasonable the empires time has come what we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild f√≥dlan and rule it as a single nation nonetheless it saddens me that we will not have an adrestian emperor 
they used to call enbarr the city of seiros  to assault it together with the knights is surreal if seiros were alive today i wonder what she might make of our war  in enbarr there was once a southern church and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it a hundred years ago the southern church became entangled in an insurrection until five years ago the empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another
its such a relief that weve made it this far without having to fight my father
youll have to face him at some point
hey dont try and scare me
it sounds like youre scared
you bet im scared the imperial army hasnt lost a single battle with my father on the field
if he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault we might lose i better make peace with that
professor my um my mother might be in the city i dont have many good memories of her if im being honest but shes dearer to me than my father if you happen to see her please make sure shes not caught up in all the fighting shes only a civil servant so hopefully she takes a cue from her bernie and stays inside
the whole of the capital is going to be a battleground the city has such a long heritage  even so perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once but we cant let the commonfolk get hurt we should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town
five years ago edelgard said a thing to me brigid is a vassal of the empire but she also said i always have the freedom to be choosing whether i am with or not with her i will become the ruler of brigid so she said i must make my own path so now my path and her path will be colliding
the death knight is no ordinary knight i will prey upon him i will quench my blades thirst with his blood his focus is on fighting you im sure but mine will be the last face he sees
those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in fort merceus
so enbarr the capital of the empire its finally time i never thought id live this long its like any battle really  stay calm stay focused dont give in to the enemy or your own fear
you seem more serious than usual
hey im always serious when im chasing girls or preparing for battle always serious thats me 
well get through this together
striking down the empire is my offering to his highness heh i left the kingdom  what am i saying
its been so long since ive been to the imperial capital i used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother i never thought my return would be like this 
enbarr  never in my wildest dreams did i imagine id be returning like this of course most of the nobles in the empire make their home in the capital in the kingdom all nobles live in their own domains so if the capital is attacked it doesnt affect them directly what will happen to the imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield
once this battle is over what will become of faerghus and f√≥dlan
peace will reign
peace you say it sounds so foreign so unattainable but maybe just maybe
what would you like to see happen
my hope is for a world of peace a world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past  the stuff of legends i believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new better world so the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil the better we must win professor there is no alternative here i wont allow for anything else
i have been to the kingdom capital before but never to the imperial one they say it is the biggest city in all f√≥dlan so we will no doubt have many civilians to worry about i hope we can preserve the city if it is destroyed in the battle the people will face hardship i would say we should avoid the use of excessive force but i suppose that hinges upon the empires terms of engagement
were heading up to enbarr next i hope i make it back safe so i can tell my little sis about it i hear they got a neat opera house there where manuela used to perform what was it called again
mitreflanc opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
mittelfrank opera company
ah thats the one
nah that doesnt sound right
my little sis always goes on about how much shed like to see them perform i know we cant see a show but do you think we can at least see the building
were about to put the finishing touches on this war i wonder how f√≥dlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction i cant wait to see it on the other hand im terrified of what the future might hold who knows if ill survive the assault on the capital
invading the capital and smashing the empire i wonder if doing so could really end this war care to share your thoughts professor
i think itll end the war
you say that with such confidence i want to believe that its true
i dont know
perhaps you feel similarly to me the whole mess puts me on edge
although for now better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand
so if we win the war will you become the ruler of f√≥dlan
that might be the case
i dont really know
you seem unsure so i guess anything is possible for what its worth i think youd make a good ruler you could bring peace to the land 
fighting in the capital ugh and were fighting against edelgard double ugh but with you leading us professor i know well win yeah wahoo fighting im a little scared to be honest im just shouting to relieve the tension but ill be fine
were finally going to the capital this will be my chance to avenge captain jeralt once we smash the empire im sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace
i think youre right
who can say for sure
monica killed captain jeralt for the flame emperor and the flame emperor was edelgard i know that the future of all f√≥dlan rests on this battle nothing else is more important but for me this is personal for captain jeralts sake im going to give it all ive got and more
rhea will be somewhere in the city i wonder if she can sense us coming if we are able to save her then i expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you are you prepared for that
i am
excellent
i dont think im ready yet
that is unfortunate well you must become ready
the battle will soon be upon us let us both be at our best for what is to come
i was born in enbarr my mother and father met in a church there not too long after i was brought into the world i do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place it is most regrettable
enbarrs streets are paved with unhappy memories professor ive avoided the darned place ever since i abandoned my nobility swore never to return now here we are to return in this manner  well i cant say it is something i ever imagined
in the opera actors came and went all the time but the people behind the scenes would stay forever ill bet id know a few of them now even after all these years i wonder if theyve left the capital i certainly hope so 
here we are facing the final battle with the empire its been a long difficult struggle we have to get lady rhea back and we have to crush the empire in the name of captain jeralt i dont know what comes next but we can sort out those details later
looks like were nearing the end of this struggle im sure lady rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her
probably
i was just kidding pay me no mind
i doubt it
oof  you dont mince your words try being a bit more mindful of other peoples feelings
lady rheas not waiting for me i know no matter how much i might wish she were shes waiting for you
ten years ago dagda and brigid attacked the empire from the west their final target was the capital but they were countered at a port town long before they reached their destination i guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs all things considered
whenever i think about how well be seeing lady rhea real soon i get happy and really get cleaning well get there for sure right well see her again
well meet her for sure
we dont know for sure
i just gotta believe lady rhea is waiting for us in the capital  we just have to find her
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report momentums really picking up for this final battle huh even im starting to feel tense me enbarrs history goes back 1400 years that even predates the founding of the empire its one of the sacred sites of the seiros faith so its a pretty big deal but hey no need to worry about the monastery while youre fighting the final battle ive got it covered ill defend it to my last
the resistance army having finished preparations for their surprise attack on the imperial capital departs garreg mach along the way they join forces with ally soldiers who had already secretly entered empire territory together they storm the streets of enbarr giving the imperial army no time to counterattack
vastly outnumbered by imperial forces it becomes clear that a surprise attack followed by a short and decisive battle is the only path to victory with this in mind you stealthily approach enbarr the imperial capital
there it is the greatest city in all of f√≥dlan  enbarr the imperial capital deep within are the palace grounds where the emperor resides if rhea is being kept here she must be within the palace  we shall tear through the city streets capture the palace and kill edelgard at last
if the enemy spots us theyll call back any troops deployed in other areas we have no leeway here
lady rhea please be safe
now we must organize our reserve troops and invade enbarr
it appears that hubert and the death knight are in command of the empires forces in the city weve not the time to deal with them one by one split up and take both on at once
its here the crest of flames banner there on the other side of the canal
uninvited guests i see heh lets ensure they receive a warm welcome ready the artillery prepare to attack rocks arrows magic  rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave reinforcements will fly in shortly defend the heavy weapons until they arrive
our first wave of reinforcements is here it will not be long until the next
their reinforcements just keep on coming we need to secure the artillery that will make it easier to deal with them
we have reinforcements coming in from another direction deploy them as soon as they arrive
that church  it looks familiar i believe that is where my parents first met
ah  that church ive such memories of that place from a time before i was seteth
has it really been so long since i was in that opera house couldnt have imagined any of this back then
the battle is nearing the opera house i hope everyone in the company is safe
we have finally made it i am sure that edelgard is hiding in the palace awaiting our arrival 
who is that is that not dedue
i heard knights had arrived i came here to find you
how long have you been in enbarr
i arrived not long after the battle at gronder field i am here to kill edelgard
what are you doing in enbarr
im waiting for a chance to kill edelgard i have not yet been blessed with the opportunity
will you now fight alongside us
we fight for different objectives i swore to offer edelgards head to his highness but  should i fail i will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you this is the information i have gathered during my time in hiding here it includes details about the inside of the castle theres more the archbishop is being held in the palace i do not know the exact location
indeed just as we suspected
it seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the empire
ive done what i came here to do farewell
wait a moment
he is gone i believe we should make our way there as well
/***EOF***/
the resistance army having received reinforcements from house daphnel in ailell is finally ready to unleash its invasion on the imperial territories
the messenger we sent to claude has returned it seems he will be initiating the plan immediately we will advance when house riegans forces move out we will take the great bridge of myrddin with minimal casualties and in doing so initiate all out war with the empire we must prepare for battle professor
someday well take it back
thank you professor i will not give in not until i have restored my noble pride
taking it back would be difficult
yes i know it would be difficult but i will not give in
im sure theyre not 
if i were in charge its what i would do
probably
i knew it war makes people crazy huh
the airmid river separates the empire and alliance its the largest river in f√≥dlan sometimes itll flood when theres lots of rain but  at least the land gets some extra water
sounds like youre learning
isnt that a little pessimistic
no its not ok
makes sense a commander running away would be terrible for morale
i wouldnt blame you
really if something happens will you keep me safe
if we can suppress this myrddin we can invade into the empire right i was in the empire now i will be an enemy  i am having strange feelings it is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy 
we have the empire and alliance situations under control the problem is faerghus the eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the dukedom but ive heard nothing about that conflict as of late its strange i havent heard much from my father either i cant help but find this silence unsettling 
its thanks to you that im here now i owe you professor you saved my life i swear ill do all i can to repay that debt
i had an encounter with lord gwendal  how many years ago was it back before the academy i met this girl who i fell madly in love with and her dad tried to kill me i suppose he just tried to scare me but i was sure i was gonna die oh yeah her dad lord gwendal crazy right i never thought id seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle i kind of dont know how to make sense of it
lady rhea is in the empire isnt she we should hurry up and find her so many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried  i want to ease their minds as soon as possible professor lets work together to find her
next we face the great bridge of myrddin  we actually crossed it a long time ago do you remember it was five whole years ago
during the battle of the eagle and lion
it seems like so long ago doesnt it its odd how fast time flies 
when we went to remire village
what are you talking about professor it was on the way to the battle of the eagle and lion
everyone was still friends then after the fighting we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses i often wish we could go back to those peaceful days 
so that was judith just as id heard of her she was an upstanding person the same daphnel blood runs through my veins and yet i feel as though i am nothing like her i am but a phantom of what could be 
youre actually quite alike
you think so wow thank you
true you do differ
if only i could be even half of who she is
thanks to all that food from judith im full for once ive got so much energy let me at that great bridge of myrddin ill bust it down myself oh but then how do we cross
the great bridge of myrddin isnt just a bridge it has the features of a fortress i believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the adrestian empire in other words its even older than the monastery so if we occupy the great bridge well have to search it from top to bottom
im sure you know this already but house ordelia is aligned with the empire they face the empire from across the river similar to the gloucesters even so i refuse to yield to the empire a second time the empire did unthinkable things to my family and to me the only option here is winning professor you must promise we will overcome the empire
legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged ailell i was reminded of that when i saw it  up professor do you think those legends are true
its likely
i think so too i dont know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger but 
yes and itll likely happen again
oh i suppose you may be right theres no way to be sure it wont 
there are still so many things we dont understand in this world
it looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town i guess they feel safe now that you and the knights of seiros have returned peddlers have become more common too so therell be food and supplies available after being run down for all those years its really becoming livable again
things would have gotten a lot more interesting if judith had joined us i only spoke to her briefly but i really liked her i hope someday i can be as strong kind and levelheaded as her
if rhea really is in the empire then we must defeat the imperial army by any means necessary the people at large are just as concerned for rheas safety as we are the sooner we can settle all our unease the better
judith is a wonderful person so strong and confident as well looking upon her i was sharply reminded of my mother
did she look similar
not in the slightest rather it is her way of being  her demeanor brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
did she act similar
very much so both brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
i lost my mother long ago i miss her desperately
the battle at ailell was a tactical marvel you grow stronger with each passing day where does you talent end and your crests power begin are they one and the same i wonder most intriguing yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions given the situation it is quite unfortunate i did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out so much unknown now i fear i will not have those answers even by conflicts end so very frustrating
oh hello there professor did you need something from me it doesnt look like youre wounded or anything you just looking for someone to talk to
yes
i thought so well im here for you making you feel better is my top priority
no
come on now you dont have to be shy helping you feel better is important to me
whether its physical pain or worries of the heart you can come to me for anything professor
so lady rhea was in the empire all this time glad as i am that judith told us i wish we had known this five years ago we spent all that time spread out over f√≥dlan searching for the archbishop and you it was a mistake to abandon the monastery to leave it in ruins now were paying for that mistake
id heard of the hero of daphnel but that was the first time ive met her in person shes the head of a prestigious noble family just like claude the alliance nobility is so odd
you dont think she acts like a noble
is it different in the kingdom and empire
kind of but i dont mean that in a bad way you wont find such big hearted nobles elsewhere plus judith can drink with the best ofem a woman after my own heart
five years ago when the imperial army attacked garreg mach they moved with incredible speed but in the middle of all that chaos she still had operatives watching the hero of daphnels spy network is impressive she shouldnt be taken lightly
is it true lady rhea was dragged off by the imperial army i heard that was true whyd they take lady rhea professor they didnt take her to kill her did they
i dont think so
thats good we just gotta beat the imperial army and get her back right
they probably havent killed her
yeah good point if they did wed have heard about it by now
you gotta help her professor im begging ya
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report oh i heard what happened at ailell i cant believe imperial spies have been lurking in garreg mach under my watch but ill make sure no more of em get in trust me
this is the great bridge of myrddin one of the bridges that cuts across the airmid river between the empire and the alliance its defenses have been fortified since i last was here it seems the enemy is sufficiently prepared
lets end this quickly
thats the idea professor lets make this quick and painless so much that its over before they even know its started
steady now
if they are fully equipped we must prepare ourselves for anything we must be ready to change our approach in an instant
yes that is most sound i do not distrust claude but there is no guarantee that the other alliance lords will not move against us onward with caution
after we cross the great bridge the greatest plains in f√≥dlan will be before us you do remember do you not i speak of gronder field where we fought the battle of the eagle and lion
the ones defending the great bridge  it isnt my father or brother is it i really want to finish this battle without seeing them especially my father 
yes i hear your father can fell a bear without even a weapon in hand when we run into him ill be sure to let you take the lead family matters and all
thats not funny you jerk
should we be burning the signal of uprising
theres no need for that petra smoke or no smoke theyll get the idea losing the bridge should be a pretty big clue
oh no i cant believe were actually going to invade if edelgard gets angry  oh i get nervous just picturing it stop that imagination oh and if she destroys the monastery with her army were all gonna die
the hour of questioning has long since passed i assure you whatever happens this will not end as it did five years ago back then the empire was able to focus its entire army on garreg mach now their front lines are stretched thin along their borders with both the kingdom and the alliance their allies have grown in number but so have their enemies they should not have too many soldiers they can readily send our way now then let us set forth this shall be the first step in ending the chaos that has engulfed this realm
sights set on enbarr the resistance army avoids the oghma mountains choosing instead to move south along the eastern route that passes through the alliance to make it safely through the territory of house gloucester   supporters of the empire   the army seeks help from the head of house riegan claude claude vows to draw away house gloucesters troops so that the resistance army can advance to the airmid river   a dividing line between the alliance and the empire
after fending off the empire your forces decide its time to advance but first you must capture the great bridge of myrddin a strategic crossing point over the airmid river which borders the alliance and the empire
that symbol  its an enemy raid stay calm and face them head on send a messenger to acheron immediately if were quick we might be able to pull off a pincer attack
that is ladislava she has of late made quite a name for herself as a general be on your guard
we will control this fortress if we can eliminate all the enemies within it
enemies approaching get the soldiers standing by to join the fight we may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too protect the fortress
you think well let you take this bridge form us
it appears enemy soldiers are stationed in the fortress more will come stay on your guard
i lorenz hellman gloucester have arrived to join the battle in my fathers stead
well ally ourselves with the imperial soldiers too
thanks for making your way here annihilate the enemy with the rest of them
acheron nows the time to show your loyalty to the empire attack the enemy from behind
ive got to make her name known to her majesty through distinguished service
that is acheron a minor alliance noble if he has allied with the empire then we must destroy him
goddess please forgive the sins of the enemy leaders and the brave soldiers who followed their orders
somehow we managed to capture the great bridge of myrddin to see the imperial army hold its ground until every last soldier fell  that is true dedication it is clear that edelgard is not some cruel emperor who holds her people in a vice like grip there is something more driving our foes from here on out our journey will not be an easy one 
excuse me sir gilbert is here
gilbert what was he doing all this time we had better go and meet with him
so youve captured the great bridge of myrddin im impressed you were able to break through their defenses
save your praise gilbert lets get to the heart of the matter why are you here why now
i am once again in the service of dimitri he was in hiding in fraldarius territory where he was biding his time for a counteroffensive
dimitri is alive
yes he was to be executed in fhirdiad but dedue stepped forward to rescue him i am here today by command of dimitri himself we realize that our enemies are the same and that it may be advantageous to join forces
i see i shall hear you out
we are preparing to advance against the empire will you join us as we march toward the imperial capital if that is too much to ask then at least allow us to freely cross the great bridge of myrddin
we will join you
hold a moment we have just finished a fierce battle and our forces are few
you may cross freely
agreed we have just finished a fierce battle and our forces are few
to march straight for the main body of the imperial army and challenge them it is too soon i am happy yo allow you safe passage over the bridge but to lend our aid asks too much of us is that not so if you would be willing to wait a few months we might be able to offer something more
i am afraid his highness is not able to stop his advance 
if that is the case i am afraid we cannot join you please send our regards to dimitri
i understand its unfortunate that we were not able to secure the help of the knights of seiros still im grateful that we can cross the great bridge of myrddin safely thank you for that this will be a fight to the death it is highly likely that we will meet our end i wish you both the best of luck in the battles ahead
and may the goddess protect you as well

following edelgards defeat and rheas rescue the resistance army discovers the existence of another adversary a group operating behind the scenes within the empireto prevent disaster from befalling f√≥dlan the resistance army heads for shambhala the enemys stronghold
the empire has been defeated and we have rescued rhea but still the flames of war burn on we journey to shambhala where those who slither in the dark reside
we know nothing of the place or what we can expect to find there
what flayn says is true if we are to prevail we must be prepared for any eventuality before we advance
i will accompany you
what no that would be far too dangerous your long confinement weakened you greatly did it not
those people have opposed us since ancient times i wish to learn the truth about them for myself
i i understand i will not stop you but please take care not to overexert yourself
what but shes been hiding away so long she shouldnt just up and go somewhere scary trust me its a bad idea
bernadetta hiding away seems a poor description for someone who was imprisoned
we must be careful not to put undue stress on lady rhea
if the going gets tough well have to carry her on our backs and make a run for it
you think you can carry her um maybe someone else should do that part 
no matter what enemies are appearing we will be protecting her we will be winning
if we work together i am certain all will be well 
the ones we are soon to face have eluded us for a long time there is much to fear  we must all proceed with utmost caution lest we fall prey to one of their traps
the history of the empire spans 1185 years and just like that it ends but the hresvelg legacy could live on  when edelgard assumed power there were no other rightful heirs she said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by the virtue of merit not blood and she truly meant what she said at any rate  i feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart who knows if it can ever be filled
as history proves everything comes to an end eventually i knew that all along but it still came as a surprise those who slither in the dark  its all so fascinating and strange they must certainly have a long history of their own and when they fall that will come quickly too dont you think heh that almost sounded like a prophecy there am i spooking you yet
hes dead  my fathers dead  im ok though really i was ready for it he was a general in the imperial army after all minister of military affairs  he gave his own life so the empires soldiers wouldnt have to lose theirs thats a fight that only he could take on he was such a tough guy i fought side by side with you this whole time but did i ever get any stronger will i ever be as strong as my father
with edelgard gone maybe f√≥dlan will finally find some peace thats all well and good but um  she was also the one to put my father under house arrest so now hes been released and hes taken charge of house varley i cant handle it i cant deal with him please you have to do something
how about we exile him
we can put him back under arrest
thank you so much
so the moment we defeat edie the nobles cozy up to the alliance and the church  that lot really does think only of themselves and no one else but then theres count bergliez he used to be minister of military affairs  he sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter  when i heard that  i dont know  that simple act of humanity  i couldnt help it i burst into tears you know count bergliez is caspars father right i cant even imagine how caspar must feel about it
the empire has broken in  in smithereens now it is possible for me to go back to brigid but  i cannot choose that choice the time is still too soon for that we must be stopping the evil for everyone in f√≥dlan we will be fighting until the end of it
i thought that after the empire fell the boar might finally be avenged  but something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows   an organization behind the empire well have to take care of them if the boar  if dimitri is to rest in peace
ive only ever done what i thought was just ive got no regrets but sometimes i do wonder if ive done the right thing was all this really for the best sorry   thinking about the end of the war makes me reconsider all kinds of things but its not over yet is it i need to steel myself for the next battle
this war might be over but not war in general human beings thrive on conflict we cant get enough of it i dont know when but you know someday another war will begin
even so 
heh heh  thats the way it is right
youre probably right on that
yeah but the fight is still worth it
war may always come back but so will peace and peace is what we fight for
lady rhea still seems weak  but at least shes safe now im praying that shell be well as soon as possible goddess  i beg you  protect lady rhea
finally that awful war is over everyone lost something and everyone had to make sacrifices  but maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now lets hurry to shambhala professor we have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war
is it really prudent to bring lady rhea on our upcoming expedition it would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous considering how long she was confined 
its her decision ultimately
i feel similarly
there are still many in f√≥dlan who are seeking lady rheas salvation for their sake we cannot put her in harms way
a mysterious power threatening the very future of f√≥dlan certainly we cannot give it leeway right now the empire the kingdom and even the alliance no longer exist there is only f√≥dlan   and f√≥dlan must fight together as one
arent you frightened
fear will serve no purpose here the only path to survival now is victory
do you think we can defeat it
there is simply no option but victory the alternative is unthinkable
perhaps i will have the opportunity to strike the decisive blow on the enemy commander that would secure my place in history for certain
wake up eat train eat train eat sleep we gotta prepare for the assault but that hasnt changed my routine
youre doing plenty
isnt there more you can do
all the training  and eating  i do is for the sake of f√≥dlan gotta stay strong  and fed  to keep it safe
our next opponent is an ally of solon do you remember what solon called us
traitors
no he called us beasts
beasts
thats right he called us beasts
insects
no he called us beasts
meanwhile he refers to himself as the savior who exactly is he saving
those who slither in the dark  it seems well finally discover their true form i get the sense that theyre in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child i wouldnt be surprised if edelgard was subjected to them too theres no telling what their true motives are but whatever their motives what they have done is unforgivable they must be exterminated
i thought the war would end with edelgards defeat  but that wasnt the case this may be premature but im feeling a little relieved ill have to consider what ill do with myself and where ill go when this war is finally over  i dont have an answer yet  lets make sure the next battle puts an end to this war that way we can all move forward
shambhala it was called right scary that its so close to the house goneril territories whod have thought all those creeps were living under my nose i was hoping my big brother would help us in the next battle but he says that i can represent house goneril without his help that i have it in me im glad he recognizes that i have some ability still i wish he wasnt leaving it all to me
these are monicas people arent they the ones who killed captain jeralt then this is my real opportunity for revenge theres no way i can back down from this one
youre not scared
no im ok actually im eager to get out there and fight this is what ive been training for
i wonder if we can win
if we lose its the end for f√≥dlan so we have to win even if it kills us
rhea is sleeping right now if it is not absolutely urgent please do not disturb her rest the long confinement took its toll on her health truthfully she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all   to say nothing of a military expedition to make matters worse we are now facing a very old enemy one that has conspired against us since time out of mind please proceed with caution i have a bad feeling
i am so glad that rhea is unharmed my brother continues to worry about her however of course i am worried myself i cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state  i hope she will rest now and leave it up to you and my brother to see things through
a mysterious organization slithering in the dark of f√≥dlan  like something out of a midnight tale it appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the empire after the fall of enbarr theyve remained well concealed  that said i would keep an eye on edelgards uncle lord arundel something about him sits ill with me
professor i just got word from the opera company i dont know if everyone survived but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival they even asked if id consider making a return to the stage someday  i suspect i may refuse though were at the dawn of something new no reason to look backwards eh
youve done it you did it you crushed the empire and rescued lady rhea im sure the captain is proud of you right now as am i of course im as proud as if id done it myself
lets not celebrate just yet
we still have opponents left to fight
sorry i didnt mean to overdo it we still have to deal with monicas group  those who killed the captain well knock em down so hard that they cant get back up
we rescued lady rhea i can hardly express my joy but now we know about a new foe who intends to bring her harm in time well realize the peaceful world that lady rhea has always hoped for ill have to keep that in mind when im fighting
we saved rhea and the empire has crumbled the kingdom may as well be finished too the reasons for me to remain in f√≥dlan are fading
please stay with us a little longer
of course ive come this far may as well see it through to the end
is it time to bid farewell
thats a little hasty ive come this far may as well see it through the end
lady rheas back lady rheas back im so happy but  things arent gonna be like they used to be any time soon are they theres still folks out there that want us all dead and lady rhea still hasnt regained her strength yet speaking of which professor please dont ask too much of her right now ok
greetings professor nothing to report i can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that everyone did sterling work i really thought wed know peace after that battle but were not quite there yet huh
relying on a map entrusted to them by hubert the resistance army sets their sights on the base belonging to those who slither in the dark beyond its entrance they are met by a sprawling underground city
though the flame of war is quenched its embers endure you travel deep underground to confront those who slither in the dark and bring lasting peace to f√≥dlan
to think there is such a vast space hidden beneath the ground how very creepy
hmm the atmosphere here is very different from the holy mausoleum or the holy tomb look at the shapes and the light 
its too strange  its all really old but you get the feeling that its also new i dont understand it
this decorating is not of f√≥dlan  what is the meaning here
i hate the look of things in here is this some kind of city i would never ever live here
living underground all safe and isolated  it sounds really  um really awful
an underground city hiding those who slither in the dark i would not mind finishing up here and returning to the surface with haste
let us search for a way to descend further still we should survey our surroundings carefully
 
something on your mind
are you not feeling well
no it is simply  we must defeat those who slither in the dark no matter what happens but if my conjecture is correct the one who they will wish to kill the most 
is you dear child
why me
they are aware that you can use the sword of the creator your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon nemesis that is why i must protect you no matter what even if i must die to do so 
i dont understand
somewhere in your heart i believe you do understand you must at least have your suspicions there is something i have not yet told you dear child  i swear to illuminate you once this awful battle has concluded and at the same time  i will offer my apologies to you i must because when you learn the truth you will also learn what you are and how you were born into this world it will be a hard truth to hear when the time comes i hope you are prepared for it 
for thousands of years we have existed underground living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized here and now that vengeance is finally within our grasp there is but one thing left to do destroy them damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion away from the world of the living
now is the time remove the binding spell of titanus let their metal bodies be drenched in blood
what is that
demonic beasts  no i think not they appear to have no will of their own someone must be controlling them
initiate all that remain we must advance our preparations
viskam has been activated increase output gradually depending on the amount of magical energy charged i dont care if we destroy shambhala as long as our goals are fulfilled
theyre trying to take something out of here we should capture them before they escape
more of these giant weapons they must be controlled by someone nearby that facility over there seems suspicious
those awful weapons have been stopped they were being controlled from that facility
finally theyve stopped that should make things easier
you
that is the leader of those who slither in the dark we must go after him with all our might

it is imperial year 1185 nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at garreg mach and war continues to plague the lands of f√≥dlan fhirdiad has been captured the holy kingdom of faerghus is in shambles the leicester alliance is on the verge of collapse fractured by two opposing factions those who support the adrestian empire and its ruler and those who seek her demise meanwhile under emperor edelgards rule of law the adrestian empire continues to expand its reach the path to a new f√≥dlan unified by imperial strength may yet be in sight
sighs why am i even here i know they wont come but here i am anyway how has it already been five years time stops for no one i suppose
huh its   its you what are you doing here
i came here for you
for me
im not sure myself
a whim
highly doubtful so you were alive what have you been doing all this time
i was sleeping
i was dead
joking at a time like this well if you dont wish to tell me i wont persuade you all that matters is this will you return to the empire with me
before you answer know that friends from our black eagle days have chosen to join me in the fight ahead
i 
hesitation it betrays your true answer
i cant
as expected i knew your answer before i had even asked the question
that means  were enemies now you and i my teacher the time for discussion has come to an end
even though our swords may cross as they do now  
  theres no denying that our chosen paths never will
goodbye my teacher when next we meet one of us will breath their last
who is it is that   its you
its been a long time
yes it has been but this is no time for casual chatter
what are you doing here
i was going to ask you the very same thing
after you disappeared five years ago do you have any idea how dire the churchs situation became where were you and what were you doing all of those years
i was sleeping
you slept for five years  in that case i suppose there is nothing more to say you should know that rhea also disappeared after the battle at garreg mach five years ago since then the knights have been fully devoted to searching for her they have yet to find a trace
was she captured by the imperial army
was she murdered by the imperial army
it is possible however the empire has not made any such statement as of yet even if that were the truth there is no way for us to confirm we have searched all over but we have reached an impasse unless we do something our efforts to find rhea and rebuild the church will be stalled indefinitely our opportunity to strike back is close at hand sadly we are short on military strength however now we have you do you recall what rhea told you five years ago she asked for you to take her place should anything ever happen to her she entrusted you with leading the people of f√≥dlan
i remember
then i beg of you please heed her words
i cant do that
i will not accept that please  you must lend me your strength
it is up to you to lead us and to defeat the empire   no to defeat edelgard
why me
there is a very good reason but it is not yet time to divulge it just know that without you we have no hope
you should lead them
it is not for me to do you are the only one who can rise to this task someday you will know why that is until then i ask that you trust me
i dont want to fight edelgard
what are you saying she is tormenting all of f√≥dlan and you are the only one who can save us how can you not see that
sir bandits have entered the area they stole some hidden weapons and ran off theyre heading for the town so that might be where theyre hiding out 
vile thieves even with the knights gone i cannot believe they would dare trespass here this is unforgivable come professor let us give chase
in the holy kingdom of faerghus imperialist loyalist cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of blaiddyd to prevent further revolt prince dimitri has been sentenced now the backbone of the former kingdom houses gautier and fraldarius struggle to continue the resistance cornelia operating out of the royal palace has accepted the support of the empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining kingdom forces
in the leicester alliance house riegan leads an anti imperial faction while house gloucester directs the empires supporters despite the undeniable threat of fracture the alliances adept new leader claude deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front
in enbarr the imperial capital of the adrestian empire emperor edelgard fights to strengthen her regime she has extended her reach to the kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western f√≥dlan
in the meantime the knights of seiros have been dispatched to find archbishop rhea who remains missing despite their searching left unattended the monastery at garreg mach has fallen to ruin and become a haven for thieves
looters deserve no forgiveness after them
what the  intruders protect the goods
stop the thieves retrieve our stolen goods
we had no place to go so we came back to garreg mach but then    huh professor
looks like theres a fight im ready to join the battle
it is confirmed that professor is alive i will be cooperating
what are you doing here never mind well have to talk later help us with these thieves
people a battle oh there wasnt supposed to be anyone here wait is that  professor
professor  youre alive after all well then i am quite pleased with my choice to come here
professor never mind  we have to focus on winning this fight
lend us a hand lets beat them back
if we split our troops in two we can attack from the north and the south to trap their leader
do you remember our promise from five years ago professor todays the day
im so glad i get to see you again professor
i went back to brigid once but i had to be returning to f√≥dlan
ah professor you have not changed a bit i am so glad to fight alongside you again
so what have you been doing these past five years sleeping why i must say im a bit envious
took all my will to come out here today but seeing you again professor thats worth a little torture
no im not the one you want gah i guess ive got no choice
it isnt looking good for us should we retreat
he has some treasure from the monastery too do not let him escape
it seems we were able to expel the bandits who were hiding in garreg mach how fortuitous that you students should gather at the monastery like this 
we made a promise with the professor that was five years ago to the very day
we all gave our promise to be meeting here when the millennium festival arrived
though the one who came up with that plan is not here  edelgard still how incredible that those present gathered despite the terrible state of things 
pfft the most incredible part of it is that you didnt oversleep and miss the reunion
so that is the reason  professor the monastery is safe because of your devoted students i am now fully convinced you are the only one who can save f√≥dlan
thats taking it a bit far
no not so
you can count on me
ah so you have finally accepted your destiny
on the very day i return to garreg mach you awaken and return as well this is no mere coincidence but rather the work of the goddess
whats your reason for being here
actually  well it would be easier to just show you come with me to the holy mausoleum i realize that since you have been slumbering for so long you have no idea what has transpired in the various territories allow me to explain  after the battle of garreg mach there was a change of regime in the kingdom house blaiddyd suffered a series of brutal massacres which claimed the lives of dimitri and regent rufus the kingdom capital fell and was absorbed into the empire as the faerghus dukedom which is now under cornelias control some still resist the empire as of now rodrigue of house fraldarius is at the center of such efforts in the alliance claude leads the faction that opposes the empire and lorenz leads those who have sided with them the front lines are ever in motion but the war effort has stagnated overall in short both the kingdom and the alliance have been swallowed up by the empire and are on the verge of collapse we must gather our generals and soldiers under your command and reverse this dire situation
flayn look the professor has returned to us
hm what do you mean  oh goodness it really is you professor i cannot believe you are still of this world we were so worried we would never see you again
what are you doing here
i forgot something important at the holy mausoleum  i told my brother i had to go back for it no matter what and so here i am 
after we finished here we were going to continue our search for rhea but now that you are here things have changed we must not waste this opportunity we shall send word to the knights scattered all across the land the time has come for the knights of seiros to return to action we are counting on you professor
/***EOF***/
after seizing the great bridge of myrddin the resistance army starts making preparations to invade imperial territory when a surprising piece of information comes to light
emergency in gronder field  theres a  its 
we are in the middle of a military conference please calm yourself and tell us what is the matter
yes sir it seems that the kingdom and alliance armies clashed with imperial forces on gronder field amid the chaos of three armies battling each other out there the imperial army was routed edelgard sustained heavy wounds and retreated to enbarr
well then i suppose 
sir the kingdom army was also decimated and  his highness dimitri has been counted among the dead
what
the alliance sustained heavy casualties as well and the whereabouts of their leader claude is currently unknown
unknown i 
edelgard is injured 
dimitri is dead 
claude is missing 
it must have been a brutal fight to have lost his highness  how tragic our only solace is that edelgard sustained severe injuries this is all quite unexpected but we must find a way to use this situation to our advantage the empires main force has suffered a mighty blow edelgard will most certainly avoid the front lines now is the time for us to infiltrate the empire and aim for the capital
but what will happen to the lords of the old kingdom and alliance territories
they have lost many leaders and soldiers i am sure they must be hard at work rebuilding we will foster cooperation by aiding them through the local churches the remaining lords of the kingdom and alliance must join together to form one union and you should be the one to lead them  what do you say
in time 
i cant decide that just yet
indeed it is a question for another day we must focus on our battle with the empire for now what is our next course of action
we should set out
lets decide where to invade first
we must choose a place within the empire that will give us solid defenses for our front line  that will become the foothold for our invasion of the capital there is one massive fortress that boasts the greatest defenses in the empire fort merceus but we will stand no chance if we attack by traditional means we must gather everyone and devise a plan of attack
  it has been a lifetime  hasnt it professor
 i thought you were dead
yes  i thought so too i wanted to slice her throat but i did not get the chance i let people die and yet  i still stand rodrigue gustave dedue 
there must be a reason you survived
you sound just like rodrigue a reason 
you can still atone for your sins
you sound just like rodrigue a way to absolve my sins 
everyone gives such complicated advice and i can never quite grasp it all that is why  professor i came here to explain my decision
what decision
i have no resources to take back the kingdom capital much less to defeat the empire and that is why 
professor you will catch a cold sleeping in a place like this is something the matter
where did he go
hm i am the only one here were you dreaming
 
i cant say for certain that you were dreaming but if someone did come here to see you  that person only wanted you to see their face perhaps they wanted you to guide them 
dimitri the late prince of faerghus he despised the empire with all his heart he should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive
leaders are people too
dont leaders have feelings like everyone else
true enough but i suspect the reason he died is that he could not keep his emotions in check i see you are saying you met with dimitri but you could not tell if it was reality or a dream hm i wonder what it could mean
im rather curious to see what stratagem well devise to capture the fortress you know fort merceuss nickname i assume the stubborn old general but there must be one or two gaps in its defenses 
fort merceus is next huh ah the memories its a huge stronghold in my fathers domain the towns completely surrounded by high walls i used to run around there when i was a kid  way back when a fortress was a playground for me yeah those were the days
its always so peaceful coming back here but its hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon and assaulting that huge keep that sounds hard oh really hard dont you think itll be hard
its going to be tough
i knew youd think so i knew you   ow oh ow cant believe i tried to hug you through the door 
well be fine
of course youd say that whyd i even ask
i heard that a staggering number of people lost their loves in the battle at gronder and here we are preparing for the next battle as if nothing happened the day before its almost easier to think about war as theater with the stage an entire continent
though actors die the show goes on
something like that if an accident happens on stage the next days performance must be unaffected
it really doesnt seem like theater
even if an accident happens on stage the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened
everyone just pretends like everything is fine  focusing on their role in the play
i have excitement in my heart for secret tactics i enjoy attacks that are surprising
whys that
surprise attacks are safe with friends fewer injuries
because its like hunting
yes hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey surprise attacks are safe with friends fewer injuries
it hasnt sunk in yet they slaughtered the boar  i can hardly believe it i thought he was alive all this time he must have really hated edelgard to lead such an ill advised assault hmph no point in feeling sorry for the poor scoundrel now
ive heard dedues passed on just like his highness
we cant know that for certain
thats true i did hear that his body was never found
dont believe everything you hear
youre right i dont think anyones found his body so i guess he might still be out there
dedue is dead
thats what ive heard but no ones found his body
if somehow hes still alive i hope well meet again
ya know professor laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date first you get past her defenses then you make your move
thats not the best analogy
trust me i know what im talking about im a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing girls i mean  ive never actually you know captured any keeps 
you might be right
ha i knew youd get it professor
anyway you know more about tactics than me so i dont know why im offering you advice
oh goddess hear my prayer please bless the deceased with peace everlasting  and may his soul rest in tranquility you know i used to see him praying quite often when i would come to the cathedral at night i wonder who it was he prayed for back then 
professor they tell me my father died at gronder was that  was that really a fitting end for one such as him i dont know i just dont know
i only know what little i overheard but what i did hear implied that the empire was involved in the tragedy of duscur if its true that may explain why his highness chose to fight the empire perhaps i should have fought alongside his highness
why is that
because i too lost someone to that tragedy  the most important person in my world
are you having regrets
no not anymore i am where i belong
those of us still on this plane of existence will carry on the torch the inhumane actions of the empire must not be repeated
fort merceus is old and strong its reputation for durability is equal to that of arianrhod are you certain your plan is sufficient it seems to be a little simplistic
guess well find out
thats not terrifically reassuring shouldnt you have more faith in your own plans
well be fine
i suppose i must take you at your word mustnt i
incidentally have you heard any news of claude i for one have a hard time believing he is dead he was always a clever and tenacious sort
you know when you work your muscles and they start screaming that means you gotta be nice to them if youre muscles are hungry you gotta feed them and let them rest when theyre tired
i dont see how youd do that
whaddya mean how you just gotta eat and sleep its pretty obvious 
you can tell how your muscles are feeling
of course if my muscles hurt then i hurt if theyre hungry well then im hungry too
whats with the confused face professor you look like you dont get a word im saying
it sounds like the battle at gronder field was pretty gruesome we dont know for certain whether claudes alive or dead maybe hes all right i wish i could make sure somehow but it doesnt seem possible now
if claude somehow survived i imagine hes terribly wounded all three forces have suffered heavy losses were incredibly lucky to have not been involved this is a perfect and unique opportunity to go on the offense now is the time to prove ourselves professor
i never used to care whether i lived or died  but when i think of all those who died at gronder i realize how precious life truly is im ashamed of how arrogant i was to think that death could mean so little 
i like this idea of yours  dressing as imperial soldiers so theyll let us in but dont you wish there was one more twist in the plan come on professor think how could we add another wrinkle hm
we can dress you as the emperor
dress me as edelgard but we look nothing alike
we could dress seteth as a woman
seteth dressed as a woman i dont understand what the point of that would be
on second thought lets just stick to the plan as originally conceived that seems safer
under your leadership we can win any battle no matter the odds thats what everyones saying anyway hope you can keep up with our expectations professor
the battle at gronder field certainly took an unexpected turn did it not let us press on so as not to waste the opportunity fort merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the imperial capital enbarr we cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort but once we have it the city should be almost entirely at our mercy i will make the necessary preparations be ready
standing face to face with those whom i went to school with on the field of battle  how inhuman war is  how horrifying my heart feels shattered it is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior
fort merceus is the empires single most fortified military installation utterly impregnable they say i wonder do you happen to know the nickname given to fort merceus
the silver maiden
no im afraid that name refers to the fortress city of arianrhod
f√≥dlans locket
that one is a fortress that stands at f√≥dlans throat
the stubborn old general
indeed a very good answer but of course youd know that
seems f√≥dlans give everyone and everything a nickname why you were called the ashen demon myself i have been called the father of crestology which is a nickname as well as a title i suppose 
each step closer to enbarr im reminded of another part of my past riches and poverty glory and failure that city has it all and if im honest sometimes i miss it thats how the past works though isnt it its always a different story than what you really lived
youre quite a tactician disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in undetected a stroke of brilliance in a frontal attack our losses would be tremendous with this strategy we can really snatch victory from the jaws of deceit
thats a good point
yes  with you leading our fighters ive no doubt the empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit get it deceit again
thats a bad pun
ah rats youve seen through my cunning punning
i hardly recognize everyone  their faces have changed so much more experience in the eyes and more pain im glad that theyre stronger but i hate to think theyve all become hardened killers look after them ok try to keep em on the straight and narrow
did you give the ridiculous order to prepare imperial armor for every one of our troops ive reached out through all my channels but there are limits to these things ill have to recruit an entire towns worth of people if i ever plan on making enough
guess what i noticed i can see further than most other people can see but i cant figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly since i cant shoot what i see
you could detect enemy movements in advance
i suppose i could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away thats kinda useful at least
you could find our targets quicker than anyone
yeah i suppose it could be real useful for finding lady rhea too
a class reunion on the battlefield thats bleak that mustve been so hard on everyone you gotta keep looking after them all i mean they still look to you for guidance you know
greetings professor nothing to report is it true that well be assaulting fort merceus next that doesnt sound like the brightest idea  ive heard that its built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies not to tell you how to do your job but dont do it im not ready to say my final good byes to everyone 
we are just about to pass through gronder field we should be in view of fort merceus soon it looks like the battle made quite an impact  the imperial army has lost some of its luster we should soon be able to invade the fort without too much trouble
because of the alliance and kingdoms sacrifices 
yes we must win for them as well
we cannot let this opportunity pass us by
yes after a few short months they will already be back on their feet we cannot waste this opportunity
professor the soldiers have finished changing into their disguises we are ready to masquerade as imperial troops and infiltrate the fort
disguises
infiltrate the fort
i believe this was your idea was it not it is impossible to take fort merceus with a frontal assault we must take it from within we will infiltrate the fort as imperial troops and kill the enemy general all preparations are complete
according to the scout reports my father and the others are not inside the fort it seems they were moved to the front lines of the kingdoms western region
the death knight became the general of this fort after the battle at gronder field
what the death knight i think ill be taking a break now  you guys go on ahead
bernadetta you cannot be hiding on a field the enemy will be seeing you
no place to hide i guess  i have no choice but to fight
the death knight  i hear that he is counted among the greatest heroes of the empire at the moment we never determined whether or not he was truly jeritza so in capturing merceus we have encountered another obstacle
weve beaten him before
i suppose you have a point if we challenge him again with conviction we are sure to attain victory
lets be careful
yes now more than ever
the impenetrable fortress city of arianrhod goes by the name silver maiden yet she pales in comparison to fort merceus  the stubborn old general those who approach are driven back but once we make our way in its all ours
that fort has been brought to life on stage for countless operas 
let us commence we must puncture a hole in the empires defenses
that manwoman approaches  will deaths scythe claim you  or will i fall to that sword of yours 
at gronder field the armies of the kingdom alliance and empire collide the three forces engage in a fierce battle each suffering significant losses before deciding to withdraw seeing an opportunity the resistance army quickly plots an invasion of imperial territory in order to gain a foothold in the empire they will attempt to capture fort merceus
fort merceus said to be impregnable lies between you and enbarr the imperial capital seizing the sturdy fortress will require a carefully devised strategy
report a group posing as imperial soldiers has infiltrated they seem to be affiliated with the church
close the gates leave no survivors
the time is ripe
do not let him get away circle around and cut off his retreat
the time of ruin draws near  but their slaughter must wait until next we meet 
hes fled has he let us deal with the remaining foes and then make haste in our pursuit
you leave
no i wont i  i refuse to run from you anymore
so its you death knight remember me
you again here to lose more blood
never you will not lay a hand on me ever again
you will not escape death knight today you will be unmasked
my true identity has no value
i will be the judge of that once ive seen your face
if you desire to slay me follow the appointed hour is at hand 
it is coming  leave now or all of you will die
run we have to evacuate immediately
what just happened here
the fort its  its just  gone
whatever could that have been  it was almost reminiscent of that terror of legend 
what legend
we havent the time for stories 
we need to get out of here
agreed we must retreat for now
all we can do is retreat to the great bridge of myrddin and assess our situation
well now that marching was nearly as trying as the battle itself
we wasted a few days but now that were this far back we should be safe  or so i believe
i still cant believe it the fort was destroyed just like that 
the death knight knew about the attack was it the empires doing
guess that means theyd rather destroy the fort than lose it
whatever the case we need to get our bearings and decide what were going to do next
we all have many questions but for now we must focus on our next move
lets give up
what how could  ah yes i see
lets attack the imperial capital
i wish for that as well but we are sure to fall if we charge in without a plan hmm  but by the look on your face i have the feeling you are working out a plan even now
lets return to the monastery
what if we return to the monastery then our situation is sure to  ah yes i see 
now youve got it
whatever do you mean
no need to hide your intentions from me
so we make it appear as though we have ceased our invasion by returning to garreg mach then we divide up our soldiers and infiltrate nearby areas of the capital right under the empires nose finally we gather all of the soldiers somewhere we can get to swiftly from garreg mach and proceed to invade enbarr is that what you are thinking
are you serious you know theres no guarantee that we wont be spotted by the enemy right
if we fail to intervene we will be isolated inside the empire and be utterly obliterated
i will be embracing the nearness of death if i am needing to with each other
that sounds dangerous really incredibly dangerous
make no mistake if we fail in this plan there will be no coming back from it are you sure about this professor
its our only hope
i see if you are resolved then i will follow suit we may be weaker and the terrain may be against us but all we can do is use our resources the best we can that and pray for the blessings of the goddess
/***EOF***/
having parted ways with edelgard former students of the black eagle house now work alongside the knights of seiros at garreg mach they begin to create a resistance army strong enough to take on her imperial forces
ah thank the goddess  i couldnt bear the thought of letting jeralt down by not finding you
guess you lucked out
weve been looking everywhere for you but i see lady rhea isnt with you damn
everyone was real worried about you professor
seteth has told us everything from here on out you will have our aid
i am so grateful that everyone is safe i am sorry things are moving so rapidly but there is something we must discuss come with me
the time has come to make our true stand against the empire
lets win no matter what
lets all work together
i dont feel confident but well do our best
our base will be garreg mach monastery the interior is in less than pristine condition but we should be able to utilize it much the same as we had before
surely those imperial jerks have this place staked out right its a highly strategic location
it may be an area of importance but it is far removed from the front lines considering the burden of transport it is possible they are not paying too much attention to it
nothing escapes the emperor there must be at least a spy or two
professor what do you think
i have no objections
i see then it must be the right idea
im worried about supplies
your concern is valid however 
the town and surrounding hamlets are still present and though far from abundant the church still has funds at its disposal
thats true  professor i think we can leave expanding our army to my brother he was always good at negotiating and i believe he is best suited to the task
in that case i have a request please allow my soldiers to join your ranks as well house aegir already tried taking on the emperor as a result our territory was stolen from us as a consequence i do not have many soldiers left to speak of but those i have are yours to command
i feel like i should tell you that ive been protecting some kids who lost their parents in the war theyre in the town right now but maybe we can move them to the monastery im sure theyd be happy to chip in however they can
hm  yes i understand i will make the necessary arrangements
i nabbed some valuables from my house father is with the emperor now so  its not much but its yours
i dont have a thing to contribute in fact im still in my same old clothes
ive been wandering on my own for five years i wont go back to that house or my father thats for sure
i understand leave it to me no labor is too great if it means saving f√≥dlan 
i have lost my dominion my nobility may seem like nothing more that a title but i will never lose my noble heart i will stop edelgard even if it costs me my life i have turned my blade against her now i cannot go back on that decision professor  do you think i chose the wrong path
not at all
you are right 
well find out soon enough
you are right 
the promise was made five years ago but i must say im rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it personally i only showed up because i hoped to see you again professor ive been with my family in the empire until recently i admit to feeling a little guilty betraying her majesty but only a little now that were all together again i suppose the fighting will begin soon
hey professor you wont believe what happened i figured i couldnt go back to the empire after garreg mach fell so i started drifting across the kingdom and the alliance then i just happened to run into our old class so we came back to the monastery together
ah at last i return to my domain my lonely paradise my realm of exquisite solitude huh professor is that um is that you you um you didnt hear that just now did you
sorry
oh forget you heard anything
hear what
right you didnt well um good
laaa la laaa la laaa  professor oh my its so good to see you these days so many old friends seem to be disappearing but you  youre here its incredible to see you again after five years i have a feeling your name will go down in history
edelgard is controlling the empire she is putting the pressure on the kingdom and alliance empire and religion are at open war it will be difficult for us at first but corrupt nobles are many that means that common people will rebel and be joining our side with you professor the battle tides will ah will turn i have certainty
a country with no king has no future thats why i made my way here professor dont let me down
country with no king
hmph youll understand soon enough
lets forge ahead
yes lets find me a worthy opponent to battle and ill be content
i left home without telling my father did you know that i can just imagine my fathers face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me kind of a scary image actually but regardless ive put my faith in you professor and im hoping i havent made a big mistake
hey professor its been a while its really good to see you again gorgeous as ever might i add an awful lot has happened in these past five years there were so many times i wished you were around im glad youre back your skills are worth more than a whole army
youre here professor along with everyone from our old class its like weve gone back in time when i think that ill be around you again all of my sorrows just drift away
frankly i dont feel too happy
hmm i understand especially with lady rhea missing  it sounds like the kingdom and alliance have been in a sorry state too but we cant let that get us down
lets do our best together
hmm yes ill at least try not to hold anyone back
lets work together for the common good like we did five years ago
members of the knights tell me that father left their ranks five years ago they say he announced he was returning to the kingdom but nobodys heard from him since i havent received word that he went back home to mother  where could he be  where are you father 
professor i have a proposal why not go beyond the knights of seiros  instead uniting with allies from all across f√≥dlan to fight for our cause looking back it would have been best to ally with the kingdom and join forces against the empire but now the kingdom is not exactly  well 
fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true professor and dont worry about my little sis right now shes back home helping out with the family business i kinda figured i was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her but thanks to you guys i get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight
its been fixed up quite a bit but its battle scars arent so easily erased  to think that a glorious cathedral with a thousand year history would end up like this ill rebuild this place someday this cathedral is the symbol of f√≥dlan maybe i should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old while i still remember what it looked like 
ive grown weary and impatient  these past five years my hands have been bound but now i can finally take action with a clear goal im grateful to you and to everyone
i didnt do anything
nonsense your presence steeled everyones resolve
and that goal is
down with the empire surely peace will soon follow if the empire is overthrown then my parents can finally find peace themselves
even with the church in shambles we can still pray the goddess will surely hear our prayers but still  i hope the church can return to its former beauty someday
hey professor i know that we didnt plan to stop at the monastery but im glad we did im happy to be here with everyone again
youre happy at a time like this
what good does grimness do us lets try to enjoy our time together while we still can
im happy too
right its as though we went back in time five years i feel like my old self again
its not just for my village that im fighting alongside you here you know its also that captain jeralt asked me his first and greatest apprentice to look out for you of course it wouldnt be enough just to keep you alive its my duty to make sure you win too so do your best professor and count on me to watch your back
with the return of its knights garreg mach is finally coming back to life the church of seiros will follow you from now on but please do not abandon the search for lady rhea
well do whatever it takes to find her
thank you i know the battles ahead will be dire but we will support you with all our strength
we dont know what the future will bring
wherever she is rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you please do not let her down
professor i am so glad you are unharmed no matter the path you walk i will be with you every step of the way anything you ask of me i shall see it through you saved my life and i am in your debt
thankfully it appears the records and equipment i need for my research have not been damaged i am most curious though you say you were asleep for five whole years incredible perhaps this is another effect of your crest i do look forward to investigating you in greater detail
we can talk about that
wonderful news i am most excited to begin we must find the time of course
uh maybe later 
ill have to be content with observing you wherever you go then i cannot waste any opportunity
my professor you havent changed a bit at your age id expect your while demeanor to have changed greatly over five years  though i suppose i havent changed either right thank you for noticing by the way ah just the two of us forever young oh let me have my fun
id given up on ever seeing you again where have you been hiding anyway now that were reunited in the land of the living i must fulfill my promise
what promise
the promise i made to the captain to keep you safe i cant believe youve forgotten how cold 
right the promise
thats right i promised the captain id protect you in his stead and now ill make good on my word
in lady rheas absence i will follow you thats what she would want me to do know that wherever you might lead us ill continue searching for lady rhea
thats fine
good because i will not budge on that point welcome back professor
sounds like a lot of trouble
i dont care how much trouble it is i will rescue lady rhea at all costs
im more of a mercenary than a knight these days i work to get paid i never was too attached to f√≥dlan i was considering leaving soon  but i might change my mind if youre around
i dont know anything about rebuilding but i can sure do my best to clean up the mess im gonna keep lady rheas room spotless so she can use it right away whenever she gets back you gotta find her professor you just gotta
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report you know its such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again i almost died in the battle five years ago but i wont allow any enemies to get into this place again i promise you that even if the death knight shows up ill be sure to  well for now ill keep training so i can eventually feel confident that i can stop him
your attention everyone the knights of seiros and our most trusted allies have gathered we have rallied our troops for the purpose of stopping the adrestian empires efforts to rule all we have prepared a new flag to fight under 
much like the professor it bears the crest of flames i hope everyone finds this suitable beneath this flag we will bring back peace to the great land of f√≥dlan
professor im not sure i understand  why is the empire intent on making an enemy of the church
i dont understand either
quite perplexing  if the church disappears from f√≥dlan i wonder if the empire thinks it will benefit them in some way i feel i feel that it will only confuse the people
they must oppose the way of the church
what is meant by the way of the church what do they dislike about it
i have no idea what edelgard was thinking or how she arrived at the decision to raise an army however i do have some small insight as to what she is after she is attempting to destroy the existing social order that is why the church of seiros is first on the list of institutions that must be destroyed it may very well be her goal to rebuild f√≥dlan from the ground up 
i see  but that is only edelgards desire is it not i cannot imagine that the people of f√≥dlan would want that for themselves she may have high ideals but she certainly lacks any compunction about throwing the world and its people into an awful war  it just seems so illogical
you have a point flayn i do not believe the people will ever understand her aim so long as she makes the people suffer our knights of seiros will fight on and strive to protect them if we do not defeat edelgard and retake control of this world f√≥dlans future shall be as dark as night
thank you dear brother i finally feel i understand what is going on
i am always happy to answer your questions flayn is there anything else you wish to ask
well um  actually i have a question for the professor my brother mentioned that you slumbered for five years where was it that you slept
at the bottom of a valley
the bottom of a valley in the water that certainly sounds frigid i would never choose such a place myself i am surprised you did not fall ill
under a rock
under a rock  how similar we are as it were i took my rest in a casket made of stone
oh well i suppose ones first long slumber is difficult to recall 
 
pardon the intrusion but we must prepare a counterattack now it seems the imperial army found out about us entering the monastery
hm that is sooner than expected they must have been spying on us 
i wonder if we can win on our own 
there arent many of them  it looks like well just be facing the ones who were stationed nearby
did they move on us too soon perhaps if we fight by using the land to our advantage 
lets proceed carefully
of course if we are careful we will not lose
lets destroy them
yes i agree let us take them out in one fell swoop
never again will those imperial scoundrels disgrace garreg mach with their presence onward professor
though preparations are still being made to raise troops for the resistance army at garreg mach the imperial army is already one step ahead anticipating the resistance armys actions general randolph and the imperial vanguard under his command begin their advance towards garreg mach to reclaim the monastery
fulfilling a promise made five years ago your former students gather once more at the monastery as do the knights however your joyful reunion is cut short 
the knights of seiros are a powerful enemy but we have more soldiers well take them down all at once
clever tactics are our only hope here we will use fire to deal with the main enemy force
report the enemy has entered the periphery of garreg mach
if we allow them to take the interior the monastery will be lost we must drive them back
what that strange battle flag is  but isnt our enemy the church of seiros
they didnt have enough soldiers with just the church so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues it doesnt matter what flag they fly theyre nothing more than a mob well destroy them all
our troops are preparing the attack protect them until they reach their destination
ugh  to think wed let garreg mach fall twice to these rebels 
a total loss  but we cant just return home like this 
watch out professor theyre coming for you
our fire unit was destroyed the plan has failed 
it looks like they were planning something but it failed
all is prepared now we just need to draw the enemys attention traitors repent of your sins and the goddess may yet show you mercy
quiet dont think youll get away with mocking me attack make sure they never speak again
now begin
fire gyaaaaaah
it burns save me
argh a fire attack  the damage is too great we cant fight anymore all units retreat ill take on our pursuers carry away the injured soldiers
press the attack give them no quarter
we drove back the imperial army the real fight has only just begun 
i never thought id be fighting randolph  i guess it cant be helped seeing as how ive left my own territory and all but what will i do if my father or brother get involved i really dont want to face them 
we must stay strong
too true professor so long as the empire is our enemy we cannot avoid fighting those we are acquainted with though i suppose i have it easier since my house is no longer on the empires side
my friends from the opera said they would leave the capital and go west  so at least i wont be seeing them in battle
hmm i dont think i care if my own house falls lets make it a grand fight after a grand nap of course 
it does not give me happiness to have the people of brigid involved but it is not the time to be thinking of that if it is a possibility i will be having their strength
i dont mind at all really i have no friends anyway and my father hasnt done much to make me care for him not that hed ever step on a battlefield anyway oh but i do wonder how mother is doing 
each of our situations is unique what we share is companionship and the will to fight as one professor you are the heart of our efforts we will support you as best we can
i have a proposal it would be most difficult to fight the imperial army with the forces we have now as such i believe we should send messengers to whatever lords we can trust in the kingdom and the alliance so that we may gain their support do you agree
i agree
it is heartening to hear you say that
it concerns me
it is difficult to know who we can trust of course but we cannot just stand idle either
if all we do is bide our time out enemys main army will come down upon us like a hammer from above
who are you planning to ask
sadly house charon is out we can trust them but they have no help to offer
hm how about house daphnel of the alliance their leader is sure to at least respond
oh how about house daphnel of the alliance i recall that their leader was quite exceptional
judith the hero of daphnel  yes that is a fine suggestion that territory is on the border of the kingdom and the alliance it has not yet been claimed by the fires of war if they agree to lend us their troops out forces will be greatly strengthened we shall send along a secret messenger at once
/***EOF***/
after storming the streets of enbarr and bringing imperial forces to their knees the resistance army surrounds the imperial palace to topple the empire and save rhea from its clutches the resistance army steels itself for battle against emperor edelgard
everyone it is probable that rhea is within the castle walls we must defeat edelgard and rescue rhea in one fell swoop no matter what stands in our way
i dont want to kill edelgard
perhaps we can walk the same path as edelgard 
she is one of your students i understand your desire for a path to peace but she will never bend to our will you do understand that do you not we have no choice but to kill her
we have already killed hubert now is no time to hesitate
she has it coming after all she started this war
someone has to stop her and that someone is us
as her former classmates i feel we owe it to her to try talking it out
this battle will be a deciding one i am believing that it is her wish to be facing us
poor edie  professor wherever you lead ill follow
i  ill fight with all i got to save lady rhea
in the name of the knights of seiros well bring the hammer down on the imperial army
the lives of lady rhea and everyone here are more important than all else i shall be prepared
i leave this mission in your hands say the word and we shall begin
theyve made it into the palace but its actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them defeating them all will turn the tide of the war instantly taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option everyone prepare for a bitter struggle victory to the adrestian empire
the throne room is tightly locked but wherever there are locks there are also keys
so close  must press on 
infiltrators kill them
i must confess i never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far i dont mean to belittle your skills professor but youve far surpassed my expectations
block off the stairwells stop their reinforcements from getting through
well done their reinforcements are cut off
clever tactic its going to be difficult to turn the tables now
at last it is over  now we must find rhea
professor brother i have a letter the imperial general asked me to deliver this to my instructor
who is it from hurry up professor read it at once
it is from hubert though he has left this world he is reaching out through this letter 
if you are reading this letter that means i have perished as her majesty would never surrender to another i can only assume she has fallen as well it greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass  that said as the survivors i must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead you must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark i am sure you must recall monica and tomas
what hubert has written here  i cannot  no i know it must be true and if that is the case then all else makes sense now i must speak with rhea it seems our battle is not over just yet those who slither in the dark  we must kill every last one of them or f√≥dlan will never again know peace
they are allies of monica and tomas  correct the ones who were after my blood and also the ones who destroyed fort merceus with that mysterious light 
we shall discuss this more after we have rescued rhea
you  you have come to save me  is this  is this a dream i have longed to see you again  all this time  is it truly you
seteth flayn  you are here as well  thank you for supporting the professor and for rescuing me
rhea  i am overjoyed that you are unharmed i could not stand losing another of our kind
yes  i am reminded of the past  of reuniting in enbarr 
it is truly nostalgic i would love nothing more than to lose ourselves in memories of the old days but  i must tell you something rhea we have received incredible news albeit from the empire they have told us the identity of our enemy those who slither in the dark  it is time for us to stop hiding the truth about the goddess the progenitor god the truth about us it is time for us to tell the people everything
those who slither in the dark 
we are told they despise the children of the goddess as well as those who live above ground they are planning something horrible
 
please tell the professor everything about these vile people there must be things that only you know
i understand dear child  i will now tell you all that i know it is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of f√≥dlan since ancient times i am sure you have heard the stories of a man named nemesis 
the king of liberation 
the wielder of the sword of the creator 
nemesis the king of liberation  the man who received the sword of the creator from the goddess and became a hero however 
nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits he plundered the holy tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god when nemesis appeared in zanado some time later he already wielded the sword of the creator
in zanado
the red canyon we journeyed there five years ago do you recall
how did he get the sword of the creator
the legend that the goddess gifted him the sword so that he could fight the wicked gods is false that story was created after the fact
i do not know how nemesis obtained the sword or why he appeared in zanado but he used that sword to massacre the people there the children of the progenitor god from their corpses he gained even more power and brought war to f√≥dlan  a mere bandit like nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own 
it was surmised that someone was collaborating with nemesis and there was a massive investigation to uncover who it was but the truth was never discovered i am now certain that his accomplices were those who slither in the dark and this time they have utilized the imperial army to send f√≥dlan back into the flames of war 
so edelgard has made a temporary alliance with them in order to achieve her own aims  professor we must journey to shambhala and stop them
you must not allow f√≥dlans bloody history  the red canyon tragedy  to repeat itself 
/***EOF***/
having repelled the imperial vanguard the resistance army in desperate need of troops seeks help from judith head of house daphnel   the governing body in the northwestern regions of alliance territory
ah its you
we were just talking about rhea 
we have searched for five long years but have not found a trace of her it is possible that she is sleeping somewhere  just as you were sleeping all those years
is that what you think
that is my current theory yes
perhaps
do you think so i truly hope that is the case
we have moved against the empire with the intent of defeating them but have not given up hope of recovering rhea if she is alive we will find her rhea is like family to us and to you as well please lend me your strength 
the messenger we sent to daphnel returned with a reply please read it at once
i understand your situation i will help you with whatever strength i have to spare but there is a problem openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the alliance therefore i will secretly gather troops in ailell the valley of torment will your group be able to receive the soldiers in this location from there it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the alliance and the kingdom
ailell the valley of torment 
ailell is a deep valley located on the border of the kingdom and the alliance people stay far away there we can meet without anyone finding out it is decided make plans to meet up with our reinforcements at once
ailell the valley of torrment 
some day we will take the imperial capital it is odd to think that i will be invading the very city that i once called home ah that is still a ways off i will prepare for our journey to ailell
i never do get used to the sight of blood it always makes me feel as if i might faint i suppose ive told you that though yes ive no idea how you cope with it i hope this war ends soon i dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain 
i didnt think wed end up fighting randolph  hes my uncle well not by blood so  i guess i can handle it
im still worried about you
dont worry about me im ready for anything
youre very resolute
dont worry about me im ready for anything
ailell the valley of torment what kind of a name for a place is that it sounds scary do i really have to go with you hey um heres an idea  maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort
hey professor thanks for your hard work again nothing to report today was i convincing was it like he was standing right in front of you some things are the same as they were five years ago but i guess a lot more has changed 
since the past i have learned much of the language of f√≥dlan but speaking the f√≥dlan language still gives me difficulty i can understand read and write with nearly perfection now but understanding and speaking are fruits of a different color
thats part of your charm
i have gratitude for you professor i hope that i will have fluency one day
everyone has a weak spot
yes i will keep practicing more
some in faerghus believe dimitri is still alive my father is one such eccentric hmph they cant accept reality dimitri is dead hes not coming back
ailell the valley of torment aw man  i really do not want to go there
pull yourself together
professor have you ever been to ailell if you had youd know that place is crazy hot for guys like me who grew up somewhere cold man  its gonna be rough though i guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay
why not
that place is crazy hot for guys like me who grew up somewhere cold man  its gonna be rough though i guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay
we may not be students anymore but its still important to read we might even learn something thats useful for our next battle
studying is important
i couldnt agree more i hope the officers academy reopens when the war is over
training is important too
i suppose that may be true i always try my best at both
its a shame the monastery was ruined but  at least the books are still intact
professor is it really ok to rely on judith i hear there are still quarrels within the alliance  this generous offer of soldiers and supplies seems a little too good to be true i mean its also really impressive but im just a little worried i suppose 
my family the galateas are an offshoot of the daphnel family the family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance despite blood relations the families lived apart from one another so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged im not so much acquainted with judith the head of house daphnel
sharing her food with us for nothing in return judith really is a great person shes more like a goddess than the goddess is
she is very much like a goddess
i never met her so i dont know for sure but she must be beautiful and kind
im not sure about that
no well she can be a demon for all i care so long as she feeds me
the valley of torment  id heard of it but i never expected to go there its exciting i wonder what the landscape is like
it sounds dangerous
it probably is dangerous but i still want to get there and see it as soon as i can
it sounds painful
hmm that is an interesting point  the name does seem to suggest that
ailell the valley of torment lies on the border of three noble territories the kingdoms fraldarius and galatea families and the alliances daphnel family in the fraldarius lands to the north the former kingdom army and new dukes army are fighting
valley of torment  valley of torment 
something wrong
i once read a book full of legends surrounding ailell but i cant seem to remember 
are you chanting some sort of curse
n no  im trying to remember the legends surrounding ailell 
my big brother told me stories of judiths bravery with just one look she tamed a runaway horse that nobody else had been able to touch when an almyran general provoked her she talked him into a tearful apology shes spectacular i wish shed fight alongside us
youre not a teacher anymore and were not your students but everyone still calls you professor is there something youd rather be called
professor is fine
guess thats what were used to huh all right
call me by my name
oh all right then ill call you  ugh nope sorry cant do it too weird
meeting reinforcements in the valley of torment seems like an astute decision to me in that land of oppressive heat it is unlikely that we will be disturbed it also means we will contend with those harsh conditions ourselves however best ensure we are well prepared
it has been only five years yet so much has changed half of the kingdom has fallen to the empire skirmishes are rife throughout the alliance despite such tumult we look upon the same sky unchanged by the storm happening beneath it
do you wish you could return to those days
yes it would be nice i suppose things were  simpler then or so they seemed to be at the time
its true  its just like it was all those years ago
indeed i gazed up at this same sky with mother and father it does not feel so long ago at all wait but how would you know professor
the monastery repairs have made solid progress most excellent news when we first returned here i was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place  but if we can get the cathedral rebuilt well have it looking just like old times soon enough
hearing that an old student has died cuts me right to the heart  as this war with the empire continues well see more of it professor we have a duty to fight alongside our students we taught them how to fight after all now lets help them win
even though were getting reinforcements we should still be prepared for the worst never shirk your training no matter what to practice im going to chop something up with my sword unless youd like to train together care to spar
ive heard people talk about the hero of daphnel if the stories of her courage are true no one will be able to stand against us in different circumstances id have wanted to try crossing swords with her right now we have to focus on getting those reinforcements lets hope nothing goes wrong
there are enemy spies around remain vigilant capture anyone who seems suspicious
to kill them
what else would we do with them
all right i will
im glad you understand im counting on you
gotta clean out the storerooms tend the flowers do the washing dust the library 
that sounds like a lot of work
well its my job ya know gotta do your job
do you need any help
nah this is my job lady rhea herself gave it to me even if lady rheas not here right now i still gotta do my duty
like you you gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing yeah
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report is everyone setting out on a big campaign not exactly ah so youre meeting up with the reinforcements well you can leave guarding this place to me ill keep an eye out for anything suspicious
in response to the resistance armys plea judith has agreed to provide soldiers to meet up with the reinforcements the resistance army sets out for ailell the valley of torment unbeknownst to them something else awaits them there 
im overheated and have changed my mind id like to return to my cozy bed now
who knew somewhere so hot existed in f√≥dlan i wonder if its ok to walk everywhere 
just use the superior emotional fortitude of nobility and well be very careful
it is said that this land was born of the goddesss wrath there was an immense battle here long ago to end it she set the entire valley aflame of course there is no record of this some theorize this was done by another and then blamed on the goddess 
my head is being defeated by this heat i think i am seeing visions  there within the mountains  a shadow 
thats just the   whoa i see it too
it appears to be a military force but in a different location than the one we agreed to
its an enemy raid
they are dressed like kingdom soldiers  they fooled us
they might be allies
hold a moment  they are dressed like kingdom soldiers is this an ambush
damn  i thought we had disposed of all the spies
they carry the flag of house rowe  theyve joined the empire then to think theyd travel all this way
are you ready to confront them professor
im worried about judith
as am i we have no reason to believe she was intercepted en route but we must act quickly let us take them down and locate judiths army
we must break through
yes we must defeat them quickly and locate judiths army
they have chosen the valley of torment for this battle and so we shall send them to the flames of eternity
your party travels to ailell the valley of torment to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements it should have been a safe march 
the valley of torment  perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight only if that puny force of children is able to kill me of course 
that lion banner  it seems gwendal is the one leading the troops of house rowe he is an experienced general renowned throughout faerghus let us hold nothing back
this is ailell the valley of torment expect this smoke and fire to assail us at every turn touching the flames of torment will get you worse than a scorching proceed carefully
the crest of flames ha quite full of themselves arent they
just as i thought  the professors army but its too late to back out now in lonatos place i have to do my duty
here we go attack them from both sides
oh old gwendal is here and he doesnt look to be an ally 
oh the hero of daphnel is here ill expect more from her than the young ones 
all of your units fall in battle or judith is defeated
you  no lets leave the pleasantries for later first i want you to take this its nothing important but it may prove useful
forgive me  but as lonatos son i have a duty
i dont want to fight you professor  but this is how it has to be theres no turning back
i know this is it but  i dont want to die 
you want to spare me why ill  ill do it ill join your side let me fight for you
does a whelp like you really expect to kill me i am gwendal the gray lion a knight by the hand of count rowe do your worst
ah so i have found a place to die  young ones  i thank you 
that was quite a predicament but now we can see to the objective we had in mind
to think wed get into a scrap here of all places were lucky we all made it out alive
im sorry for involving you in this
dont worry about it in this day and age its a miracle ive been unscathed this long
i see why they call you a hero
well thats ancient history
so youre that professor everyone talks about youre just as claude described
claude
he asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy
that professor everyone talks about
you used to teach at the officers academy five years back right i guess you didnt teach claude though he asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy
claude of the alliance how did he learn of our plans we cant underestimate someone like him  there is a reason they call him the master tactician but i suppose we are both fighting against the empire now the enemy of our enemy is our ally
thats right i have a letter from him as well
its up to you to decide how to use it
that is yours professor please tell me what it says when you see fit
ok lets wrap up this hand off of soldiers not that i suspect you of anything but  i must warn you that these are very important soldiers for my territory dont treat them like expendable equipment
oh by the way i have some important information a witness saw lady rhea being dragged off by the imperial army after the battle five years ago
are you sure your source is reliable
one of my own saw it happen im certain
it seems we chose wisely when decided to fight against the empire
thank you for the information we will rescue her at all costs
now that we have reinforcements it is time to advance against the empire and yet we do not have enough troops to face our enemys main army head on we have no choice but to use our small numbers wisely by taking over key locations as we blaze our way to the imperial capital
its an easy win
do not indulge in being overly optimistic it would be our ruin
it will be a fierce fight
yes it will we must brace ourselves
as you know the oghma mountains lie south of garreg mach towards the empire in order to enter empire territory we must travel around those mountains there are two possible routes  through the kingdom to the west and through the alliance to the east
lets go west
the western half of the kingdom is under the empires control it may be too dangerous to pass through there i suggest we take the eastern route for safety
lets go east
yes that makes sense
there are lords in the alliance who support the empire but they are at least not completely under their control furthermore you hold a key to the empire within your grasp
claudes letter
yes precisely
the sword of the creator
my charm
this is no time for tomfoolery i am referring to the letter from claude
hey there teach its been a while hasnt it i never dared to imagine you might still be alive wonders never cease i dont know exactly why but i feel that i can trust you so im going to do just that to that end i propose an exchange youre intending to invade the empire that much is clear and that means your only option is to pass through the east youll have to cross the airmid river which runs along the border between the empire and the alliance that means youll need to gain control of the great bridge of myrddin the one closest to garreg mach it just so happens that my family house riegan is in conflict with house gloucester right now it would be easy enough for us to eliminate them but i would prefer that we settle things without it coming to that do you see where im going with this well act as a distraction and draw house gloucester away from there that will allow you to cross through their territory and take the great bridge of myrddin after you take the bridge from the imperial army house gloucester wont be able to receive their aid youll get to cross myrddin without any trouble and ill be able to maintain stability in the alliance not a bad deal eh i hope to hear from you soon be well teach
the master tactician indeed somehow he is already aware of our plan the conditions are not bad  all is he says it is if we take the great bridge of myrddin and house gloucester bows down to house riegan  the route from the monastery to the empire will be much safer for our forces
lets do it
it seems you are decided we will send our answer at once
im suspicious
i am afraid we have no choice considering the circumstances 
/***EOF***/
claudes plan to call in almyran forces succeeds and the alliance army captures fort merceus before they can celebrate their victory javelins of light rain down from the sky and destroy the fort forced to temporary evacuate the alliance army regroups at garreg mach until it is ready to march on enbarr the imperial capital
its almost time to invade the imperial capital we still dont know where rhea is but if shes alive shes likely in enbarr hopefully we manage to find her without too much trouble
we need to save her quickly
i know but if were not careful shell just be whisked away again
i wonder if shes alive
if the empire has some reason to keep rhea alive then shes alive
im sure you must be anxious to see her again
i need to see her again
i understand you need to see rhea again so you can figure out who you really are
all i care about right now is saving her
well if thats what you want ill do my best to make it happen
but were going up against edelgard here  it wont be so simple
our next stop is the imperial capital weve sure come a long way
whatre you talking about this is garreg mach its where we started
i didnt mean literally raphael i was speaking symbolically
my earnest desire to protect the alliance has carried me this far it will not fail me i am sure the rest of you all have your own reasons to fight as well of course i understand that the fight will not end until we defeat the empire  and now the time has arrived at long last to march on the imperial capital and defeat the emperor 
it really gets you thinking doesnt it we all come from different places and have different goals and dreams but thanks to those two we were all able to come together and overcome all sorts of challenges
you are referring to claude and the professor i assume even within our own odd group those two are particularly unusual
oh so you are aware that youre odd
well  thats  it was simply a figure of speech i am speaking about claude and the professor right now
theyre like the wind and the trees 
huh claude and the professor are what does that even mean and who is which
oh um  i was just thinking that if were the birds then those two are like the trees and the wind the professor is a great tree that kindly embraces us and watches over us as we perch on its branches  and claude is like the wind pushing us forward as we soar across the open sky 
hm the metaphor about the professor is solid but i think claude just blows us around on a whim still we owe him a lot
i think thats beautiful marianne i can really picture it when the war is over id love to paint a picture of those two oh and of all the people weve fought with as well
you mean like a historical painting i like that maybe our descendants will look at it a long long time from now 
i must say that piques my interest i look forward to seeing how you portray my valiant efforts
when you put it that way we may be witnessing one of the greatest events in f√≥dlans history its a lot of pressure but the sense of duty i feel is even stronger than the fear
im just happy to be here with all of you i wont get scared no matter what we face
we have our goal enbarr the imperial capital lets get to work
my friend the reinforcements the lords sent are finally gathering truth be told fort merceus wouldve made for a better base of operation but that weird pillar of light changes things its pretty scary honestly  i wonder what it is 
the rage of the goddess
well that is how the legend goes in ailell if it really was the rage of the goddess lets do our best not to enrage her even further
some kind of magic
makes sense but whatever it was ive never seen destructive power quite like it i wonder where it came from 
a natural phenomenon
you think its natural what the planet just up and decided to take a shot at the fort i dunno teach
well i guess pondering it is a waste of energy for now lets just get ready to move out the capital is edelgards domain so she has the advantage its going to be a tough battle
i was taught from a young age to believe that the creed of seiros was just the way of the world to question it never even occurred to me but claude and edelgard are different they challenge the common wisdom even defy it it is uncomfortable to discard familiar assumptions but that is an essential quality of the visionary indeed true greatness must lie beyond common sense hmm thats good i should write that down
were heading up to enbarr next i hope i make it back safe so i can tell my little sis about it i hear they got a neat opera house there where manuela used to perform what was it called again
mitreflanc opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
mittlefrank opera company
ah thats the one
mildewplank opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
my little sis always goes on about how much shed like to see em perform i know we cant see a show but do you think we could at least see the building
were about to put the finishing touches on this war i wonder how f√≥dlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction i cant wait to see it on the other hand im terrified of what the future might hold who knows if ill survive the assault on the capital
invading the capital and smashing the empire i wonder if doing so could really end this war care to share your thoughts professor
i think itll end the war
you say that with such confidence i want to believe that its true
i dont know
perhaps you feel similarly to me the whole mess puts me on edge
although for now better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand
if we can win this war then claude will be the king of f√≥dlan and  maybe hell tear down the wall that separates f√≥dlan from the outside world
perhaps he will
perhaps he wont
i know its hard to imagine  but i really hope he does it would be so much better if people could live together instead of apart i might even be able to live an ordinary life in the world claude envisions 
fighting in the capital ugh and were fighting against edelgard double ugh but with you leading us professor i know well win yeah wahoo fighting im a little scared to be honest im just shouting to relieve the tension but ill be fine
were finally going to the capital this will be my chance to avenge captain jeralt once we smash the empire im sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace
i think youre right
who can say for sure
monica killed captain jeralt for the flame emperor and the flame emperor was edelgard i know that the future of all f√≥dlan rests on this battle nothing else is more important but for me this is personal for captain jeralts sake im going to give it all ive got and more
professor at last the end is nigh i love the empire part of me wants it to survive but i know that is not reasonable the empires time has come what we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild f√≥dlan and rule it as a single nation nonetheless it saddens me that we will not have an adrestian emperor 
they used to call enbarr the city of seiros  to assault it together with the knights is surreal if seiros were alive today i wonder what she might make of our war  in enbarr there was once a southern church and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it a hundred years ago the southern church became entangled in an insurrection until five years ago the empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another
its such a relief that weve made it this far without having to fight my father
youll have to face him at some point
hey dont try and scare me
it sounds like youre scared
you bet im scared the imperial army hasnt lost a single battle with my father on the field
if he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault we might lose i better make my peace with that
professor my um my mother might be in the city i dont have many good memories of her if im being honest but shes dearer to me than my father if you happen to see her please make sure shes not caught up in all the fighting shes only a civil servant so hopefully she takes a cue from her bernie and stays inside
the whole of the capital is going to be a battleground the city has such a long heritage  even so perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once but we cant let the commonfolk get hurt we should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town
five years ago edelgard said a thing to me brigid is a vassal of the empire but she also said i always have the freedom to be choosing whether i am with or not with her i will become the ruler of brigid so she said i must make my own path so now my path and her path will be colliding
the death knight is no ordinary knight i will prey upon him i will quench my blades thirst with his blood his focus is on fighting you im sure but mine will be the last face he sees
those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in fort merceus think what might have happened if theyd have hit us during the battle at gronder field assuming it was the work of the imperial army 
so enbarr the capital of the empire its finally time i never thought id live this long its like any battle really  stay calm stay focused dont give in to your enemy or your own fear
you seem more serious than usual
hey im always serious when im chasing girls or preparing for battle always serious thats me 
well get through this together
striking down the empire is my offering to his highness heh i left the kingdom  what am i saying
its been so long since ive been to the imperial capital i used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother i never thought my return would be like this 
enbarr  never in my wildest dreams did i imagine id be returning like this of course most of the nobles in the empire make their home in the capital in the kingdom all nobles live in their own domains so if the capital is attacked it doesnt necessarily affect them directly what will happen to the imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield
once this battle is over what will become of faerghus and f√≥dlan
peace will reign
peace you say it sounds so foreign so unattainable but maybe just maybe
what would you like to see happen
my hope is for a world at peace a world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past the stuff of legends
i believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new better world so the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil the better we must win professor there is no alternative here i wont allow for anything else
rhea will be somewhere in the city i wonder if she can sense us coming if we are able to save her then i expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you are you prepared for that
i am
excellent
i dont think im ready yet
that is unfortunate well you must become ready
the battle will soon be upon us let us both be at our best for what is to come
i was born in enbarr my mother and father met in a church there not too long after i was brought into the world i do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place it is most regrettable
enbarrs streets are paved with unhappy memories professor ive avoided the damned place ever since i abandoned my nobility swore never to return now here we are to return in this manner  well i cant say it is something i ever imagined
in the opera actors came and went all the time but the people behind the scenes would stay forever ill bet id know a few of them now even after all these years
here we are facing the final battle with the empire its been a long difficult struggle we have to get lady rhea back and we have to crush the empire in the name of captain jeralt i dont know what comes next but we can sort out those details later
looks like were nearing the end of this struggle im sure lady rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her
probably
i was just kidding pay me no mind
i doubt it
oof  you dont mince your words try being a bit more mindful of other peoples feelings
lady rheas not waiting for me i know no matter how much i might wish she were shes waiting for you
ten years ago dagda and brigid attacked the empire from the west the final target was the capital but they were countered at a port town long before they reached their destination i guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs all things considered
whenever i think about how well be seeing lady rhea real soon i get happy and really get cleaning well get there for sure right well see her again
well meet her for sure
we dont know for sure
i got gotta believe lady rhea is waiting for us in the capital  we just have to find her
nader the undefeated  with a name like that hes bound to put up a damn good fight did you get a good look at judith she practically had hearts floating out of her eyeballs when she looked at nader
she must be in love
you saw it too heh i know that look well shes got it bad honestly theyd make a cute couple
im not so sure about that
pretty dense arent ya trust me pal no ones seen more heart eyed women than this guy shes got it bad
thats ridiculous
pretty dense arent ya trust me pal no ones seen more heart eyed women than this guy shes got it bad
it makes all the sense even seasoned warriors arent immune to love pal
that nardel guy  or nader i suppose it was all some trick and we fell for it hmph i dont think the nickname the undefeated applies is he flees from us though  maybe he only got that name by running away cant be defeated if you run off right
greetings professor nothing to report momentums really picking up for this final battle huh even im starting to feel tense me enbarrs history goes back 1400 years that even predates the founding of the empire its one of the sacred sites of the seiros faith so its a pretty big deal but hey no need to worry about the monastery while youre fighting the final battle ive got it covered ill defend it to my last
after making preparations at garreg mach the alliance army marches to enbarr the imperial capital in response to the alliances movements emperor edelgard orders her trusted retainer hubert as well as the death knight to the front lines to meet the alliance army head on the two forces clash in the city streets
vastly outnumbered by imperial forces it becomes clear that a surprise attack followed by a short and decisive battle is the only path to victory with this in mind you stealthily approach enbarr the imperial capital
there it is  enbarr the imperial capital and the largest city in all of f√≥dlan
its not just big this city was designed to protect the castle where the emperor lives its as though the city itself is a massive stronghold
and the citizens
what is the state of affairs in the town
they surely noticed us approaching some time ago and yet 
our scouts confirmed the citizens havent been evacuated theyre being kept in town
ive got to hand it to her imperial majesty using her citizens as a shield to protect the castle takes some resolve
i suspect those mages will be lurking within as well 
troops deployed to other areas are also returning
if we dont conquer the city quickly things will get complicated fast
i hope we find rhea 
we cant search until we conquer the city lets focus on the fight for now
lady rhea please be safe
weve kept the empire waiting long enough onward
we were told hubert would be leading the enemy forces but the death knights also with them well have to take care of both of them but we wont have time to mop up all the enemy units well have to split up and take them on at the same time or risk being overrun by their reinforcements
its here the crest of flames banner there on the other side of the canal
uninvited guests i see heh lets ensure they receive a warm welcome ready the artillery prepare to attack rocks arrows magic   rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave reinforcements will fly in shortly defend the heavy weapons until they arrive
our first wave of reinforcements is here it will not be long until the next
reinforcements that was quick  we cant hang around or theyll just keep coming well have to capture the artillery we can turn them against their reinforcements 
we have reinforcements coming in from another direction deploy them as soon as they arrive
ok just hubert left to deal with 
we are taking heavy losses we need more troops 
well done everyone now we can break through into enbarr we need to hurry up and attack the palace to block edelgards movements
its over lapdog your military rule is at its end
for every step you take along that path our thorns will cut into your heels
ooh that sounds painful ill have to wear thicker soles for the march
if your boots are too heavy you wont be able to lift your feet but enough prattle
you will not escape death knight today you will be unmasked
my true identity has no value
i will be the judge of that once ive seen your face
so its you death knight remember me
you again here to lose more blood
never you will not lay a hand on me ever again
hey how longs it been five years whod have thought youd end up an imperial general 
so you wish to die
heh as antisocial and unhinged as ever i see
i came here to get you lets return together emile
leave the place of your death is not here
weve made it this far  somehow edelgard is probably looking down on us from somewhere in that castle
i wonder if shes panicking or just smiling smugly 
from this point on shell be giving it her all too expect her to be tougher than the last time we fought this battle will settle things once and for all well attack as soon as everyone is ready
huh is that you dedue
i heard the alliances army has entered the city ive been searching for you ever since
how long have you been in enbarr
i arrived not long after the battle at gronder field i am here to kill edelgard
what are you doing in enbarr
im waiting for a chance to kill edelgard i have not yet been blessed with the opportunity
well if you want to fight alongside us wed be more than happy to have you
we fight for different objectives i swore to offer edelgards head to his highness but  should i fail i will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you this is the information i have gathered during my time in hiding here it includes details about the inside of the castle
i appreciate this but  what do you plan to do dont tell me you plan to do alone
ive done what i came here to do farewell
hey wait hes gone hes just as hard to understand as his liege was
the time has finally come my friend once we win this fight the empire will fall 
what will become of f√≥dlan
what will become of it well thats for us to decide isnt it
what will we do about f√≥dlan
the subject is heavy on my mind
odd as it sounds i believe the forces responsible for destroying f√≥dlan are also responsible for protecting the livelihood of its citizens everything even the land itself has been harmed by the chaos of war restoring it will be no easy feat to do that the first thing we need to think about is a new ruling system for all of f√≥dlan
the alliance lords could divide the territory
no i dont think that would work the western half of the continent has little connection to the alliance any attempt to force dominion on them would breed rebellion the world would slide back into war once again
we could unify f√≥dlan as one nation
as usual were on the same page i was thinking the same thing
even if the alliance lords and any remaining influential nobles were to divide up dominion of all of f√≥dlan  they would simply pursue their own interests another war would be inevitable thats why there needs to be a powerful ruler who stands above them all and unifies f√≥dlan as one nation
you should be that ruler claude
if it means i can lead f√≥dlan to a better future i wouldnt mind that at all
we must search for a new ruler
a new ruler huh i think ive got someone in mind
i should be that ruler
 my friend  do you really mean that
my dreams await in a future where f√≥dlan is no longer ravaged by war there are things i want to see with you some day ill keep thinking about the best way to achieve that goal whatever we decide to do we cant do it until we defeat the empire f√≥dlan cant welcome a new dawn until we win the war lets prepare as best we can
/***EOF***/
claiming the monastery at garreg mach as its home base the alliance army joins forces with the knights of seiros together they begin to take up arms against the adrestian empire
good work hilda you didnt do much manual labor but you managed to rope the knights into helping us restore the monastery
thanks claude but all i did was piggyback on your scheme i saw your eyes telling me to make some magic happen
thank you so much for your help with the restoration
oh please it was nothing were just doing our part as former students
im told you even routed the bandits that job should have fallen to us im sorry for the trouble
hey dont think twice about it were all allies in the resistance against the empire right
the church is at war with the empire but lets be realistic wouldnt it be better for the alliance to eventually submit
the way i see it the emperor wants to take over all of f√≥dlan and destroy the existing order of the world i cant see her allowing the alliance to continue to exist were in this just as deeply as you are actually  we were hoping to use this place as a base the empire begs to be meddled with and were first in line
what why would you want to make your base here of all places
garreg mach is situated in the center of f√≥dlan both geographically and spiritually we want to secure this location while the empire is still overlooking it
i see the empire doesnt see this place as important at the moment because its far from the front lines
but if we simply decide that its ours to occupy that does nothing to inspire the hearts and minds of the people of f√≥dlan luckily good ol teach has finally returned to us if the professor rhea entrusted with the sword of the creator fights at our side  well now thats a just cause anyone could get behind whats more here we are working alongside the legendary knights of seiros it smacks of divine providence doesnt it can you feel it
i have heard what you have to say claude and you professor where do you stand
i will fight the empire
hm on our own we lack sufficient military strength but with the help of the alliance 
i will find rhea
hm we are at a relative standstill but with the help of the alliance 
the archbishop said if anything should happen to her that we should entrust the affairs of the church to you if you intend to fight alongside the alliance then i will follow you as well is that acceptable claude
of course i cant think of anything more reassuring than having both teach and the knights on our side together well stop the emperor and her reckless ambitions
hey there my friend its funny how the monastery was once in ruins but now its downright bustling thanks to a little promise five years ago our buddies have all gathered and even the knights have returned its like we were all just waiting for you to awaken and now were all going to band together against the imperial army you should go and talk to everyone if you can there may be some who are still on the fence
i have written to my father to signal my intention to remain here not that i require his approval to do so there is not much for me to gain by returning to alliance territory now but by staying i will be able to influence the course of events directly on the field of battle
will you get along with the alliance leader
we will not be friends but i will cooperate with him as much as is necessary to secure victory
will you keep an eye on the alliance leader
naturally someone needs to make certain he does not lead the alliance to ruin
fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true professor and dont worry about my little sis right now shes back home helping out with the family business i kinda figured i was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her but thanks to you and claude i get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight
its been fixed up quite a bit but its battle scars arent so easily erased  to think that a glorious cathedral with a thousand year history  would end up like this ill rebuild this place someday this cathedral is the symbol of f√≥dlan maybe i should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old while i still remember what it looked like 
ive grown weary and impatient   these past five years my hands have been bound but now i can finally take action with a clear goal im grateful to you and to everyone
i didnt do anything
nonsense your presence steeled everyones resolve
and that goal is
down with the empire surely peace will soon follow if the empire is overthrown then my parents can finally find peace themselves
even with the church in shambles we can still pray the goddess will surely hear our prayers but still  i hope the church can return to its former beauty someday
im pretty headstrong but claude could give me a run for my money i mean hes dragged the knights into this you ought to be careful professor
ill be fine
i wonder if youve got a hidden headstrong side you must be hiding it really well though
you too
dont worry about me im here because i want to be also because being around my big brother feels like a real chore
its not just for my village that im fighting alongside you here you know its also that captain jeralt asked me his first and greatest apprentice to look out for you of course it wouldnt be enough just to keep you alive its my duty to make sure you win too so do your best professor and count on me to watch your back
i have lost my dominion my nobility may seem like nothing more than a title but i will never lose my noble heart i will stop edelgard even if it costs me my life i have turned my blade against her now i cannot go back on that decision professor  do you think i chose the wrong path
not at all
well find out soon enough
you are right 
the promise was made five years ago but i must say im rather surprised how many of us managed to make it personally i only showed up because i hoped to see you again professor ive been with my family in the empire until recently i admit to feeling a little guilty betraying her majesty but only a little now that were all together again i suppose the fighting will begin soon
hey professor you wont believe what happened i figured i couldnt go back to the empire after garreg mach fell so i started drifting across the kingdom and alliance then i just happened to run into our old class so we came back to the monastery together
ah at last i return to my domain my lonely paradise my realm of exquisite solitude huh professor is that um is that you you um you didnt hear that just now did you
sorry
oh forget you heard anything
hear what
right you didnt well um good
laaa la laaa la laaa  professor oh my its so good to see you these days so many old friends seem to be disappearing but you  youre here its incredible to see you again after five years i have a feeling your name will go down in history
edelgard is controlling the empire she is putting the pressure on the kingdom and alliance empire and religion are at open war it will be  difficult for us at first but corrupt nobles are many that means the common people will rebel and be joining our side with you professor the battle tides will ah will turn i have certainty
a country with no king has no future thats why i made my way here professor dont let me down
country with no king
hmph youll understand soon enough
lets forge ahead
yes lets find me a worthy opponent to battle and ill be content
im the heir of house gautier and im fighting alongside a bunch of alliance people i can just imagine my fathers face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me i dont know how standing and fighting for faerghus would have helped sorry professor i dont regret my decisions im just thinking out loud and im hoping i havent made a big mistake
youre here professor along with everyone from our old class its like weve gone back in time when i think that ill be around you again all of my sorrows just drift away
frankly i dont feel too happy
hmm i understand especially with lady rhea missing it sounds like the kingdom and empire have been in a sorry state too but we cant let that get us down
lets do our best together
hmm yes ill at least try not to hold anyone back
lets work together for the common good like we did five years ago
members of the knights tell me that father left their ranks five years ago they say he announced he was returning to the kingdom but nobodys heard from him since i havent received word that he went back to mother  where could he be  where are you father 
professor i have a proposal why not go beyond the knights of seiros instead uniting with allies from all across f√≥dlan to fight for our cause looking back it would have been best to ally with the kingdom and join forces against the empire but now the kingdom is not exactly  well 
five long years ive searched for you and the archbishop its a pleasure to see you again the church of seiros will follow you from now on but please do not abandon the search for lady rhea
well do whatever it takes to find her
thank you i know the battles ahead will be dire but we will support you with all our strength
we dont know what the future will bring
wherever she is rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you please do not let her down
professor i am so glad you are unharmed no matter the path you walk i will be with you every step of the way anything you ask of me i shall see it through you saved my life and i am in your debt
thankfully it appears the records and equipment i need for my research have not been damaged i am most curious though you say you were asleep for five whole years incredible perhaps this is another effect of your crest i do look forward to investigating you in greater detail
we can talk about that
wonderful news i am most excited to begin we must find the time of course
uh maybe later 
ill have to be content with observing you wherever you go then i cannot waste any opportunity
my professor you havent changed a bit at your age id expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years  though i suppose i havent changed either right thank you for noticing by the way ah just the two of us forever young oh let me have my fun
id given up on ever seeing you again where have you been hiding anyway now that were reunited in the land of the living i must fulfill my promise
what promise
the promise i made to the captain to keep you safe i cant believe youve forgotten how cold 
right the promise
thats right i promised the captain id protect you in his stead and now ill make good on my word
in lady rheas absence i will follow you thats what she would want me to do know that wherever you might lead us ill continue searching for lady rhea
thats fine
good because i will not budge on that point welcome back professor
sounds like a lot of trouble
i dont care how much trouble it is i will rescue lady rhea at all costs
im more of a mercenary than a knight these days i work to get paid i never was too attached to f√≥dlan i was considering leaving soon  but i might change my mind if youre around
i dont know anything about rebuilding but i can sure do my best to clean up the mess im gonna keep lady rheas room spotless so she can use it right away whenever she gets back you gotta find her professor you just gotta
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report you know its such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again i almost died as well in the battle five years ago but i wont allow any enemies to get into this place again i promise you that even if the death knight shows up ill be sure to  well for now ill keep training so i can eventually feel confident that i can stop him
everyone listen up i have a proposal we are now building our forces in order to rise up against the imperial army but it wouldnt be smart for us to fight under the banner of the alliance that would only incite the lords who support the empire weve also combined forces with the knights of seiros therefore i suggest that we operate under a new symbol thats why ive prepared this 
you may recognize it as the crest of flames which resides in teach the phantom crest that has reappeared after more than 1000 years were attempting our own miracle so it seems like a suitable symbol for us so  until we welcome the dawn of a new age in f√≥dlan  lets fight to the very end as one under the symbol of the crest of flames
impressive claude forget restoring the monastery youve somehow roped everyone into fighting back against the empire
if you recall i never asked anyone to join us if anything we have teachs achievements to thank now that you mention it i guess i should express my gratitude
hey friend so this is where youve been without you the knights never would have joined our cause i could never pay you back for that
youre welcome
lets do our best
just leave it to me teach when this fight is over i plan to see all of my dreams come to fruition and yours as well
what are you dreams claude
well for example  to bust open f√≥dlans throat theres a massive fortress there which is responsible for protecting the eastern border of the alliance i like to think of it as a lid on a bottle the people of f√≥dlan only know a small part of the world their prejudices are born because they dont know what lies beyond their borders and the opposite is true too those outside of f√≥dlan dont know about this place ignorance breeds discrimination whether you look inside the bottle or outside of it  if you really look all you find are people who you can get along with if you only try thats why i wanna bust open that lid which is keeping us locked inside or destroy the bottle entirely
are you going to tell our allies about this
ill find the right time to bring it up even if i talked about it now it doesnt seem realistic does it first we need to defeat the empire and restore peace to  huh
professor claude were under attack
i guess well have to cut our conversation short whats going on leonie
its a small group but some imperial troops are headed this way it looks like they were stationed nearby
i got to hand it to edelgard nothing gets past that woman
we should proceed cautiously
as long as we dont let our guard down theres no way they can defeat us
lets take them down
all right ill show you how much ive improved professor
this will be our first battle alongside the knights of seiros lets kick off our new partnership with a magnificent victory
though plans to resist the empire are still being devised by the alliance army the imperial army has already anticipated their next move an imperial vanguard just outside garreg mach led by general randolph begins to advance with the aim of toppling the monastery once again
fulfilling a promise made five years ago your former students gather once more at the monastery as do the knights however your joyful reunion is cut short 
the knights of seiros are a powerful enemy but we have more soldiers well take them down all at once
so the enemy intends to use their overwhelming numbers to defeat us lets fight fire with  actual fire
report the enemy has entered the periphery of garreg mach
if they reach the interior the enemy will take the monastery drive them back immediately
what that strange battle flag is  but isnt our enemy the church of seiros
they didnt have enough soldiers with just the church so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues it doesnt matter what flag they fly theyre nothing more than a mob well destroy them all
allied soldiers are making preparations for the plan protect them
what the fire attack unit was routed damn it my brilliant plan failed
it looks like they were planning something but it failed
were prepared for the fire attack now we just need to draw the enemys attention you cant defeat us with that many soldiers the imperial army is doomed without a capable general
quiet dont think youll get away with mocking me attack make sure they never speak again
now
argh a fire attack  the damage is too great we cant fight anymore all units retreat ill take on our pursuers carry away the injured soldiers
if we let them escape theyll come back to attack later we have to take them out
a total loss  but we cant just return home like this 
teach look out theyre after your head
phew nice work we won without much incident thanks to all of you
i dont think the empire will leave us alone now what do you plan to do
i intend to ask the alliance lords to share some troops with us to bolster our forces
i will speak plainly no matter whom we beseech for reinforcements our envoys will inevitably pass through gloucester territory my father is being cautious not to give the empire a pretext to intervene therefore he is unlikely to allow even envoys to pass through
why not request reinforcements from the kingdom
ah  i guess i havent told you yet teach the kingdom isnt in a position to be sending anyone reinforcements after losing king lambert during the tragedy of duscur a regent had been handling its politics but then  there was a bloody coup the regent and prince dimitri both  apparently the whole family was killed all blaiddyd territory including the kingdom capital is being ruled by those who are cooperating with the empire the kingdom is no more its not called the faerghus dukedom the vast majority of the former kingdom lords bent a knee to the overwhelming power of the empire and the dukedom and now fall under their jurisdiction
some who formerly held power are continuing to resist but it would be difficult for them to regain it
oh hey i can think of one person who we can ask for reinforcements someone whose territory is really close and whos on good terms with claude 
ah the hero of daphnel i presume
ive seen her before and she does seem to be reliable
youre talking about judith right i bet she would lend us a hand 
she seems intimidating
she seems strong
thats right youve met her once before teach shes a fearsome one woman army she did a lot for me even before i was recognized as the heir to house riegan i dont like the idea of owing her more than i already do but given the situation sacrifices must be made ill reach out to her as for the rest of you prepare for our next battle
heya teach how are you feeling does anything feel um  strange at all
nothing in particular
good i still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes but maybe thats not a concern now that youve spent five long years napping
i feel a bit sluggish
well you were asleep for five whole years after all itll probably take time to get you back to top form though im relieved to see you havent lost a step as far as combat goes
your command bringing my schemes to life  thats just how we fight best
any word from judith
not yet but theres no need to worry that woman adores me once weve bolstered our forces itll finally be time to start taking decisive action but i wonder  do you really think rhea is still alive
shes alive
i think so too its hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret
i dont know
theres no telling but its also hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret
i wonder where she is and what shes doing 
do you hope shes alive
all i know is that i still have a lot of questions i need to ask her
do you hope shes dead
thats a dangerous question teach to be honest ive given it a lot of thought all i know is that i still have a lot of questions i need to ask her
about the true history of crest stones and heroes relics  and the truth behind the legend of seiros and nemesis she has secrets too many of them for my comfort considering the state of the world  its suspicious you must be curious about what was done to you and what her plans were for you right and you never did learn about your mother did you none of our doubts will ever be clear unless we hear these answers from rhea herself in that sense i absolutely hope rhea is still alive but as far as f√≥dlan goes i do wonder what a world without rhea would look like
a world without rhea
the majority of people in f√≥dlan believe in the seiros faith that rhea preaches thats why they accept the noble system as if it were the only option and refuse to associate with those who believe in anything else that closed minded philosophy is the reason why f√≥dlans throat is locked tight but if you remove the archbishop who strictly advocates that doctrine that world view is no longer absolute theres room for free thought the leadership of the church would undoubtedly fall to you and you would hold the power to change the shape of the faith of the world then for the first time people would truly be free to think for themselves to decide whats right and whats wrong honestly i believe edelgard is probably hoping to achieve something very similar but her methods require too much bloodshed thats not something the world can get behind anyway  the best thing we can do is find rhea and hear what she has to say heh oops  i guess ive been going on for a while now sorry about that you should get some rest
/***EOF***/
the alliance army successfully rendezvous with judith in ailell with the addition of house daphnels forces the time has come to invade empire territory
preparations are complete now its a game of patience as they say good things come to those who wait
care to elaborate on this plan of yours claude can we really do this without battling my father
pretty soon count gloucester will need to gather his troops in the northern part of his territory
against the kingdom
the kingdom has experience constant infighting since the coup theyre out of the picture for now
against houses riegan and daphnel
you got it teach
the combined forces of the riegan and daphnel houses will threaten the northern part of the gloucester territory nardel that retainer i mentioned is going to draw their attention
well take that opportunity to make our way through gloucester territory and launch a surprise attack on the great bridge of myrddin
and are you not concerned about the possibility that i may tip off my father
the future of the alliance rests on this battle im certain you wont betray us
hmph i will ensure our success
i know you will if we win this fight then our next goal will be to topple enbarr the imperial capital i said before that my plan was to meddle with the empire but im going to do you one better we are going to defeat the empire once and for all but to do that we cant afford to slip up here bear that in mind and prepare yourselves for the coming battle
if our plan succeeds well arrive at the great bridge of myrddin unscathed the important part is what happens next were evenly matched in terms of military power more or less so if we can just launch a surprise attack 
we have the advantage
i wouldnt be so sure that bridge is almost like a fortress the defense there is rock solid
it could go either way
agreed the bridge is basically a fortress so the defense will be rock solid
well still be at a disadvantage
ill give you that the bridge is basically a fortress i wouldnt say were at a loss but we certainly shouldnt rest easy
but thats why youre here teach no matter the odds youre the wild card we need to win
i would like to believe that i have always made my own decisions even so i cannot deny that some small part of me has always been aware of my fathers wishes now here i am concealing our plan   claudes plan   from his sight
are you having second thoughts
no the strategy is sound and ive consented to it
youre not reluctant though are you
quite the contrary honestly i feel as though a fog has finally lifted from my eyes
in this fight i will finally stand upon my own two feet independent of my fathers influence
thanks to all that food from judith im full for once ive got so much energy let me at that great bridge of myrddin ill bust it down myself oh but then how do we cross
the great bride of myrddin isnt just a bridge it has the features of a fortress i believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the adrestian empire in other words its even older than the monastery so if we occupy the great bridge well have to search it from top to bottom
im sure you know this already but house ordelia is aligned with the empire they face the empire from across a river similar to the gloucesters even so i refuse to yield to the empire a second time the empire did unthinkable things to my family and to me the only option here is winning professor you must promise we will overcome the empire
legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged ailell i was reminded of that when i saw it  um professor do you think those legends are true
its likely
i think so too i dont know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger but 
yes and itll likely happen again
oh i suppose you may be right theres no way to be sure it wont 
theres still so many things we dont understand in this world
it looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town i guess they feel safe now that you and the knights of seiros have returned peddlers have become more common too so therell be food and supplies available after being run down for all those years its really becoming livable again
things have gotten a lot more interesting since weve joined up with judith havent they anyone who casually treats claude like hes just some kid is not a person to be trifled with i think captain jeralt would have liked her i hope someday i can be as strong kind and levelheaded as her
what used to be aegir territory lies far to the east of the great bridge of myrddin downstream of the airmid river for the sake of my family i wish we could invade the empire from there but i do not have the power to advocate for that strategically myrddin is more important
someday well take it back
thank you professor i will not give in not until i have restored my noble pride
taking it back would be difficult
yes i know it would be difficult but i will not give in
since im originally from the empire it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks fine by me honestly id bet theyre watching my every move to make sure i can be trusted
im sure theyre not 
if i were leading the alliance its what i would do
probably
i knew it war makes people crazy huh
the airmid river separates the empire and alliance its the largest river in f√≥dlan sometimes itll flood when theres lots of rain but  at least the land gets some extra water
war isnt kind to you if youre a recluse by the time you realize whats going on youre already under attack and if youre off by yourself you can get killed with no one ever even finding out
sounds like youre learning
isnt that a little pessimistic
oh thatd be awful just terrible ok professor i get it i know ill have to come out
were going to invade the empire which means well be fighting people we know wont we if were attacked by someone we know or used to think of as a friend it is permitted to run away
no its not ok
makes sense a commander running away would be terrible for morale
i wouldnt blame you
really if something happens will you keep me safe
if we can suppress this myrddin we can invade into the empire right i was in the empire now i will be an enemy  i am having strange feelings it is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy 
we can predict what the empire will do faerghus is our real problem the eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the dukedom but ive heard nothing about that conflict as of late its strange i havent heard much from my father either i cant help but find this silence unsettling 
its thanks to you that im here now i owe you professor you saved my life i swear ill do all i can to repay that debt
i had an encounter with lord gwendal  how many years ago was it back before the academy i met this girl who i fell madly in love with and her dad tried to kill me i suppose he just tried to scare me but i was sure i was going to die oh yeah her dad lord gwendal crazy right i never thought id seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle i kind of dont know how to make sense of it
lady rhea is in the empire isnt she we should hurry up and find her so many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried i want to ease their minds as soon as possible professor lets work together to find her
next we face the great bridge of myrddin  we actually crossed it a long time ago do you remember it was five whole years ago
during the battle of the eagle and lion
it seems like so long ago doesnt it its odd how fast time flies 
when we went to remire village
what are you talking about professor it was on the way to the battle of the eagle and lion
everyone was still friends then after the fighting we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses but now were fighting the same people who were our friends back then  even ashe  i often wish we could go back to those peaceful days 
so that was judith just as id heard of her she was an upstanding person the same daphnel blood runs through my veins and yet i feel as though i am nothing like her i am a phantom of what could be 
youre actually quite alike
 you think so wow thank you
true you do differ
if only i could be half of who she is
if rhea really is in the empire then we must defeat the imperial army by any means necessary the people at large are just as concerned for rheas safety as we are the sooner we can settle all our unease the better
judith is a wonderful person so strong and confident as well looking upon her i am sharply reminded of my mother
does she look similar
not in the slightest rather it is her way of being   her demeanor brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
does she act similar
very much so both brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
i  lost my mother long ago i miss her desperately
the battle at ailell was a tactical marvel you grow stronger with each passing day where does your talent end and your crests power begin are they one and the same i wonder most intriguing yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions given the situation it is quite unfortunate i did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out so much unknown now i fear i will not have those answers even by conflicts end so very frustrating
oh hello there professor did you need something from me it doesnt look like youre wounded or anything you just looking for  someone to talk to
yes
i thought so well im here for you making you feel better is my top priority
no
come on now you dont have to be shy helping you feel better is important to me
whether its physical pain or worries of the heart you can come to me for anything professor
so lady rhea was in the empire all this time glad as i am that judith told us i wish we had known this five years ago we spent all that time spread out over f√≥dlan searching for the archbishop and you it was a mistake to abandon the monastery to leave it in ruins now were paying for that mistake
id heard of the hero of daphnel but that was the first time ive met her in person shes the head of a prestigious noble family just like claude the alliance nobility is so  odd
you dont think she acts like a noble
is it different in the kingdom and empire
kind of but i dont mean that in a bad way you wont find such big hearted nobles elsewhere plus judith can drink with the best of em a woman after my own heart
five years ago when the imperial army attacked garreg mach they moved with incredible speed but in the middle of all that chaos she still had operatives watching the hero of daphnels spy network is impressive she shouldnt be taken lightly
is it true lady rhea was dragged off by the imperial army i heard that was true whyd they take lady rhea professor  they didnt take her to kill her did they
i dont think so
thats good we just gotta beat the imperial army and get her back right
they probably havent killed her
yeah good point if they did wed have heard about it by now
you gotta help her professor im begging ya
i dont know where he recruited that man but claudes got an eye for great talent im talking about his retainer nardel ive only spoken with him briefly but he seems to have a fair amount of both brains and brawn with the skills to match but theres something about him i cant quite place  like ive somehow heard of him before 
greetings professor nothing to report i was talking to some of the daphnel soldiers earlier and it seems that judith has a weakness but they wouldnt tell me what it is i got the feeling they didnt appreciate the question pardon me for being curious that said maybe keep this to yourself not that she terrifies me to my soul but id hate to get on her bad side 
the great bridge of myrddin is in sight beyond it the empire
whaddya know there arent bridges that big in almyra thats for sure 
how unsettling there are bridges in the southern part of ordelia territory but nothing like this
its the most strategic location in that area to move a large army across the airmid river the empire will want to hold on to it at all costs so expect tough defenses
lets finish this quickly
youre right the enemys guard should be down so lets end this quickly before they have a chance to retaliate
lets proceed with caution
youre right the defenses are pretty impenetrable lets make our move carefully
youre in command teach do whatever it takes to win well other than sacrificing the lives of our allies for the sake of victory try to avoid that lets get moving were counting on you my friend
sights set on the imperial capital the alliance army chooses to march through the territory of house gloucester   supporters of the empire under the command of nardel the retainer of house riegan the defensive forces of house riegan and daphnel draw out the gloucester troops thus the alliance army can continue its march towards the great bridge of myrddin and cross the airmid river which separates the alliance and the empire
after fending off the empire your forces decide its time to advance but first you must capture the great bridge of myrddin a strategic crossing point over the airmid river which borders the alliance and the empire
that symbol  its an enemy raid stay calm and face them head on send a messenger to acheron immediately if were quick we might be able to pull off a pincer attack
they say the enemy general ladislava is among edelgards most trusted lets see what shes got
our goal is to take down ladislava and gain control of the bridge lets go
you think well let you take this bridge from us
whoa new enemies from the central fortress by the looks of it that might not be all of them
acheron nows the time to show your loyalty to the empire attack the enemy from behind
ive got to make my name known to her majesty through distinguished service
acheron the weathervane hes of the alliance hes a minor noble who holds territory to the north of myrddin if hes gonna support the empire no need to hold back hes nothing but a nuisance even to the alliance
looks like we can capture this fortress quickly if we take out the soldiers protecting it
enemies approaching get the soldiers standing by to join the fight we may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too protect the fortress
well ally ourselves with the imperial soldiers too
i will leave this area to the reinforcements and then i will swing around to provide support from the south
im glad we defeated them here  i doubt theyre an enemy we could win against twice
the declining alliance will be finished if i kill you the empire will herald the new age
only if you manage to kill me hm whats that to the north looks like the home of another opportunistic noble is burning 
thats  thats my castle no
thats the declining alliance at work right there seems like you were facing the wrong way weathervane
well done everyone the great bridge of myrddin is ours
i was prepared for bloodshed but that was more than expected  i guess im still not used to this
even our enemies were fighting for their own cause they held out without fleeing until the bitter end 
you dont have to get used to it
that is true i wouldnt want to become the type of person who feels nothing when someone dies
we must overcome this
yes  we cant afford to stall here
now its on me to return to alliance territory and convince those lords to join us lorenz would you return home for the time being and lay the groundwork with your father
fine after all this is for the alliance or rather for all of f√≥dlan
for those of you who live in alliance territories i ask that you return to your houses and spread the word about the current situation until we finish our preparations judith and the knights will do everything in their power to defend the great bridge
thats a casual way to dole out such a deadly mission boy
do you object
just who do you think i am i wont let the empire pass this way even if it costs me my life
too bad youre not allowed to die fight like your life depends on it but flee if youre ever truly in danger
a tall order as always ill use my best discretion claude
we have no objections either go forth and secure us a sufficiently powerful army
ill stay here too the only ones id be going home to are my little sis and my grandpa
are you sure you dont want to see your sister it may be a while before you can return home again
but if i see her i may not want to come back so ill wait till im done here
what about me
ill stay here too
actually id like for you to come with me teach to help negotiate with the lords theyre followers of the church of seiros after all itll make things easier if we have someone there to speak on rheas behalf all right everyone lets meet back at the monastery next month good luck out there
is that you kiddo
i have returned nardel
oh ah master claude its you i mistook you for one of the local children my apologies
it seems you have adjusted to your work here our recent strategy was successful thanks to you
i was a bit concerned when house gonerils army intervened from the east
count gloucester must have requested reinforcements from them
yes and they have that young general who won some acclaim from his battles in almyra  regardless they showed no signs of seriously wishing to attack us and merely fulfilled their obligations to house gloucester
now then  who is this lovely lady
this is my professor who i asked to join me at the roundtable conference teach this is nardel that retainer judith was talking about
nice to meet you
hm how polite ive heard good things about you from master claude
 
youll make me blush if you keep staring like that though i suppose people like me are something of a rarity here
as you can see he wasnt born in f√≥dlan still trust me when i say he is highly capable
true in fact my capability is my only redeeming quality i hope youll continue to look after master claude professor
/***EOF***/
it is imperial year 1185 nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at garreg mach and war continues to plague the lands of f√≥dlan fhirdiad has been captured the holy kingdom of faerghus is in shambles the leicester alliance is on the verge of collapse fractured by two opposing factions those who support the adrestian empire and its ruler and those who seek her demise meanwhile under emperor edelgards rule of law the adrestian empire continues to expand its reach the path to a new f√≥dlan unified by imperial strength may yet be in sight
huh
you overslept teach pretty rude to keep a fella waiting like that wouldnt you say
whats with that surprised look my friend
you didnt really think id given up   on you coming back did you
can you feel it a new dawn is finally here not just for us though no for all of f√≥dlan
its been five long years where have you been teach you dont really expect me to believe that youve been napping this whole time do you
i was sleeping
i dont remember
thats a good one except  thats not your lying face i guess ive got no choice but to believe you youre not exactly normal to begin with so its not a huge stretch to imagine you sleeping for that long aaand this is where you say just kidding right if this is a rib nows the time to fess up
its the truth
you must be insane and yet  fine i believe you ok but that means you dont know anything that happened after your last battle right
i guess its on me to catch you up as you can see garreg mach was crushed by the empire and was never restored the monastery is in ruins and the town is in pretty bad shape too can you guess why
rhea has been sleeping too
huh it would seem thats one possible explanation since you insist thats what youve been up to
rhea has died
her body was never found and the empire never declared that she had been killed so  no telling
all we know for sure is that rhea suddenly vanished during that battle five years ago the knights of seiros have apparently been searching all over f√≥dlan for her  but the fact that this place is still in ruins tells me they still havent found her
we must find her
true ive got a mountain of questions id like to ask her after all
im worried
worried huh well for better or worse rhea was clearly fond of you
but im not so sure whether it would be good for her to return as the archbishop  rather with her gone  eh never mind this could be a dangerous conversation before we discuss the state of affairs in each territory  are you hungry you must be its not much but i did bring some food with me lets eat up and go from there
phew i am stuffed even the most humble of meals tastes great with the right company by the way teach do you remember the night before the ball i know it was five years ago  but we promised that the golden deer house would reunite during the millennium festival todays the day we promised to meet up  but no ones here
its still early
true  theres still some daylight left
they must not like us
heh you know everyone looked up to you right or is this your way of telling me i was a lousy house leader
lets just wait a little longer you never know  maybe someone will show up after all hey teach  just waiting around sounds boring so why dont we get in some exercise you know help with digestion and stuff you must be in bad shape if youve been sleeping for five years itll do you good to get your body moving again
you want to work out
you want to play a game
something like that look if you come with me youll understand oh and dont forget your weapons ok i want to make sure neither your leadership nor your skill with a blade have dulled
in the holy kingdom of faerghus imperialist loyalist cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of blaiddyd to prevent further revolt prince dimitri has been sentenced now the backbone of the former kingdom houses gautier and fraldarius struggle to continue the resistance cornelia operating out of the royal palace has accepted the support of the empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining kingdom forces
in the leicester alliance house riegan leads an anti imperial faction while house gloucester directs the empires supporters despite the undeniable threat of fracture the alliances adept new leader claude deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front
in enbarr the imperial capital of the adrestian empire emperor edelgard fights to strengthen her regime she has extended her reach to the kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western f√≥dlan
in the meantime the knights of seiros have been dispatched to find archbishop rhea who remains missing despite their searching left unattended the monastery at garreg mach has fallen to ruin and become a haven for thieves
the thieves are here apparently theyre trying to run off with treasures from the monastery
what the  intruders protect the goods
this is gonna get expensive collect everything the thieves carried out
the barbarity is even worse than the rumors on my honor as a noble i will expel these ruffians
today was supposed to be a happy day but the monastery is in disrepair 
over there  is that the professor and the others
professor youre alive guess wed better handle this before i celebrate though huh
you finally made it i guess virtue still exists in this crazy world after all
is that the professor and everyone else if theyre fighting i gotta go help
wow its you here i thought you were dead all this time
could that be the professors ghost
hey youre late hurry up and help
hm we could split into two groups if we hit them from the north and south we can trap their leader in a pincer attack
professor boy am i glad to see you how did we end up in this situation
professor its been too long i do want to chat but first lets handle these criminals
youve been alive all this time where have you been hiding never mind   talk later
we have much to discuss but first let us dispense with the riffraff it is a nobles duty after all
ugh the instant we arrive were neck deep in battle we shouldve arrived late
p professor is it really you
is that really you professor its been so long i thought id never see you again
ugh im exhausted what gives professor
i was so excited to see everyone again and then this happens 
im still tired from the long journey how did it come to this
lets all take a moment to catch our breath 
if youve got the time to play with those guys the least you could do is prepare some tea
thanks for your help
we were hoping someone would come to back us up when we started routing the bandits
blame claude
come on those guys were thieves we couldnt just let them get away
it seems theyve been taking advantage of the churchs absence and doing whatever they please here
in any case um  im glad that all of you are well
thats the spirit marianne
that was fun in fact i wouldnt mind romping around some more
so you were alive this whole time professor i am not surprised in fact that is why i came here
and it doesnt look like time has rusted your skills thats a relief
im just glad everyones alive and well on that note lets move this reunion party somewhere else
now that weve dealt with those violent bandits we could potentially use this place as our base of operations again
what could you possibly mean by that
im talking about the leicester alliance taking over garreg mach monastery after all its right in the middle of f√≥dlan its a critical strategic location
are you suggesting that we fight back against the empire
arent you getting a bit ahead of yourself the alliance is in complete discord at present
and as leader of the imperial faction of the alliance isnt count gloucester your father the main cause of that discord
i  yes that is true it was inevitable our houses territory is close to imperial land after all had we not consented to vassalage under the empire they would have invaded immediately
naturally and to be clear i have no problem with your house maintaining its imperial ties until were sufficiently prepared to revolt the empire is the cause of the infighting if we rid ourselves of them the situation should resolve itself thats why im thinking we should make this our base raise up an army and stir up some trouble for the empire
now youre talking sounds like fun
so then mr leader man does this mean you intend to rope us into your little scheme
leader man
hm ah my grandfather passed away that means yours truly is officially the leader of the alliance
if we had a more reliable leader perhaps the alliance would not have been divided 
think what you will all i need to know is if youre in or youre out
im happy to lend a hand i wont let those imperial dogs set foot in alliance territory i couldnt bear it if my village got caught up in the chaos of war
ill fight too ive gotta protect my little sis
i will join as well after all house ordelia was once dragged into an imperial revolt it ruined us
ah of course i understand your motivation
ill fight too  its time to take responsibility for my own future
i  i dont want to run anymore i hope ill be of use to everyone 
we can do anything if we work together marianne
what about you lorenz are you going to go back home to your scary father or what
we cannot rely on claudes scheming to lead us to victory therefore i will remain it is my duty to ensure claude does not worsen the situation in the alliance
all of us are fighting for a different reason but we share a common enemy if we dont act the empire will crush us eventually i say we stop them before they have the chance so teach  will you help as well
id rather search for rhea than fight
all the more reason to join us admit it youre not going to be able to do much on your own
ill give it some thought
please do im counting on you even if your ultimate goal is to find rhea it would be better to stick with us as you search
with you on our side the church will join us as well that makes fighting the empire a moral cause which means it will be easier to rally support above all your knowledge and strength are indispensable if we hope to stand a chance against the imperial army without you my schemes are nothing just words please  take all of that into consideration as you decide
youre really laying it all on the table arent you claude well all that aside this place is a mess we cant very well make our base in a ruin and repairing it sounds like a lot of work  i wonder if anyone would be willing to help us out with that
can it be you were alive all this time
professor it is so good to see you again my brother and i were worried about you
ah thank the goddess  i couldnt bear the thought of letting jeralt down by not finding you
guess you lucked out
weve been looking everywhere for you but i see lady rhea isnt with you damn
everyone was real worried about you professor
cyril is that you youve grown up kid have you been looking for rhea with the knights
of course without lady rhea i dont belong anywhere
cyril thats not  never mind well figure it all out
oh my the golden deer house is together again at last and all grown up well for the most part
i do regret that we were never able to hold a proper graduation for all of you students
why are you here
how is the search for rhea progressing
it has been five years since lady rhea disappeared we have devoted all of our energies to finding her however without being able to set foot in empire territory we are at a standstill we had hoped that perhaps the archbishop would return here on this day that of the long awaited millennium festival
unfortunately that doesnt seem to be the case though i dont suppose you had very high hopes in that regard even if she were able to return here with the monastery in ruins i dont think she would have felt safe enough to do so right hilda
yeah this is an important location for the church to think youve left it in such a state
the believers are mourning this destruction
its a danger to the locals too
thats true  perhaps weve left it alone for too long weve got to make things right
i can clean this place up like new its not fit for lady rhea like this
and leaving this place in ruins affects the safety of this area too
agreed there is also a great deal of valuable literature here
then lets do it if we all work together we can restore the monastery to its original beauty
we will require the aid of skilled craftsmen too i shall seek out any such individuals who are willing to return to garreg mach
fantastic ill figure out how to split up the work and then we can get started
/***EOF***/
on the streets of the imperial capital alliance forces crush edelgards army and take up the perimeter of the imperial palace the time has come to face emperor edelgard and to free rhea from her clutches
is everyone ready the objective of this battle is to defeat edelgard and rescue rhea according to the information dedue gave us the throne room is directly north of the castles main entrance its safe to assume thats where edelgard is
i dont want to kill edelgard
is there no way to walk the same path as edelgard
shes a fellow student to all of us if theres a path that we can walk together that would be preferable but that all depends on edelgard if she wont yield then thats that if showing pity would put my allies in danger i will not hesitate to kill her i ask that you and everyone here prepare yourselves to do the same
understood i think i speak for everyone when i say that we are prepared
the future of the alliance   no of f√≥dlan   is at stake i have been prepared for this my whole life
captain jeralt taught me that indecisiveness is a weakness one must cast aside their doubts before fighting
the lives of lady rhea and everyone here are more important than all else i shall be prepared
you know what i wouldnt be surprised if she took one look at my overstuffed muscles and surrendered in tears then and there
i really hope that edelgard will yield 
edelgard is a stubborn one i dont think shes likely to surrender
goddess  please protect us 
i ill fight with all i got to save lady rhea
rescuing lady rhea is my dearest wish we must prevail no matter what it takes
in the name of the knights of seiros well bring the hammer down on the imperial army
satisfied yet boy everyone made up their minds a long time ago
ok lets get started were yours to command my friend
leave it to me
everyone take your positions the battle is upon us
theyve made it into the palace but its actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them defeating them all will turn the tide of war instantly taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option everyone prepare for a bitter struggle victory to the adrestian empire
there are more enemies inside the palace than i thought its gonna take a lot to bring this situation under control but if we defeat edelgard then victory is ours everyone lets go
our bashful little emperor has locked herself up behind the door of the throne room the key should be around here somewhere we need to find whoevers got it and take them out
we must be protecting the throne room you will not be getting past
stay back ill protect edie with my life
well have to take out one of them if were going to advance  petra seems like the shortest route 
i wonder how dedue is doing  i hope i get to see him again
so close  must press on 
infiltrators kill them
i must confess i never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far i dont mean to belittle your skills professor but youve far surpassed my expectations inform the troops destroy anyone who sets foot in the throne room
we should be able to get through to the throne room now 
this should give us a bit more freedom of movement now how best to attack 
we did it the enemy wont be able to send any more reinforcements now
clever tactic its going to be difficult to turn the tables now
i cannot vanquish her alone so i will join you in this battle but if i fall leave me my only wish is for edelgards head
so youre another of the goddesss vanguard you dont have a shred of self awareness do you come at me so that i may put you out of your misery
professor  i suppose you think you can defeat me is that right but i will never give up even if my arms and legs failed me i would still find a way to move forward i will smash that false goddess and her minion into the ground i will fight to free this world from her vile grasp
this has nothing do to with where you were born that we are fighting now is only a result of the choices youve made so im going to give that the response it deserves i will crush you with everything i have
edelgard give up we dont want to kill you
but  i must kill you if i dont the righteous world i dream of will never see the light come at me with everything you have for one of us this is the end
your ideals i understand theyre not so far removed from my own but without sufficient knowledge of this lands suffering i cant entrust f√≥dlan to you
perhaps i daresay its true that i dont fully understand the history of f√≥dlan still ive seen many things in my life dont worry ill finish the job for you
edelgard please release rhea  release f√≥dlan
if you strike me down they will return i cannot permit what you desire you are a child of the goddess you must not be allowed power over the people
lysithea you and i are so alike we could have walked the same path
were alike you dont mean to tell me  it cant be
yet now we are at a crossroads theres no turning back must we fight each other for the things we believe in
thats exactly whats going to happen and i will defeat you edelgard
edelgard return rhea release your grip on f√≥dlan
if you strike me down they will return i cannot permit what you desire you are a child of the goddess you must not be allowed power over the people
it looks as though  my path  will end here
my teacher  claim your victory
strike me down you must
even now  across this land people are killing each other if you do not act now this conflict  will go on forever
your path  lies across my grave it is time for you to find the courage to walk it
if i must fall  let it be by your hand
i wanted  to walk with you 
its over we were only able to beat her because of you
  
this wasnt the conclusion i had hoped for even though  i  never mind its over now the important thing is that we won
here boy a letter an imperial general asked me to give it to you
a letter lets see it
it looks like its from  hubert edelgards vassal
if you are reading this letter that means i have perished as her majesty would never surrender to another i can only assume she has fallen as well it greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass  that said as the survivors i must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead you must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark i am sure you must recall monica and tomas their allies yet live they hold deep resentment against the children of the goddess and the people of the world and they are biding their time until they can exact revenge if left to their own devices it is certain they will eventually bring unimaginable calamity and suffering to the world i detected their sorcery when you took fort merceus i have deduced the location of their stronghold shambhala you will find its whereabouts enclosed there is no question that they are the enemies of everyone in f√≥dlan do not allow yourselves to forget that lastly  while i cannot say she is in good health the archbishop resides in a secret chamber in the imperial palace i have shared the location of the entrance to that secret chamber with the person to whom i have entrusted this letter i believe that her majesty will be victorious  even still i must plan for her defeat as well if you wish to lead this world i challenge you to rise to the occasion and surpass my estimation of you such is your obligation as the victors  and the only fitting tribute to all that lady edelgard sacrificed
hubert  to leave a letter like this behind  you were a better man than i believed you to be so rhea is alive and the fight isnt over yet those who slither in the dark  it sounds like f√≥dlan will never know peace unless we defeat them
the allies of monica and tomas  well we knew about them already i think its safe to assume this is the same group who used lysithea for their blood experiments and they were also responsible for the javelins of light that destroyed the fortress but who are these children of the goddess who they supposedly resent theres just not enough information here i dont suppose theres any chance of his idea of a prank  if so wow good one hubert  rather than writing a letter you should have just told us before we fought 
lets ask rhea about it
right we still dont know for sure if this letter is telling the truth lets go find out
you  you have come to save me  is this  is this a dream i have longed to see you again  all this time  is it truly you
claude  i can see you have grown into a reliable young man  thank you for supporting the professor and for rescuing me surely the protection of the goddess has 
wait rhea what do you know about the children of the goddess
children of  what is this about
forgive my bluntness someone from the empire filled us in on a few things i know it must be painful for us to ask you difficult questions after such an arduous confinement but we have no choice we must defeat a secret enemy  those who slither in the dark do you know about them
those who slither in the dark 
apparently they resent the children of the goddess and the people of the world and are planning something big something terrible
 
they use blood for their wicked magic and are capable of dropping javelins of light from the sky which are powerful enough to crush a fortress if you can think of anything at all please tell us now we need to know as much as possible about these enemies in order to stop them
 
this is the critical moment that will determine whether or not f√≥dlan falls cant you see that the time for secrets has passed
it is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of f√≥dlan since ancient times i am sure you have heard the stories of a man named nemesis 
the king of liberation 
the wielder of the sword of the creator 
nemesis the king of liberation hes the hero to whom the goddess gave the sword of the creator
nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits he plundered the holy tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god when nemesis appeared in zanado some time later he already wielded the sword of the creator
in zanado
zanado the red canyon 
how did he get the sword of the creator
according to legend the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods
i do not know how nemesis obtained the sword or why he appeared in zanado but he used that sword to massacre the people there the children of the progenitor god from their corpses he gained even more power and brought war to f√≥dlan 
thats completely different from what the legends tell us about nemesis
a mere bandit like nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own 
aha so nemesis had accomplices and those accomplices must have been those who slither in the dark they used nemesis and this time they used the imperial army to once again bring war to f√≥dlan i finally get it  and i even understand why edelgard was associating with them just as they were trying to use the empire the empire was trying to use them rhea theres still a mountain of things i need to ask you and i will but ill leave all of that for another day you must be weak after living in confinement for so long please rest for a while my friend  lets prepare for battle we need to strike shambhala as soon as possible
you must not allow f√≥dlans bloody history  the red canyon tragedy  to repeat itself 
hm it occurred to me that we never got an answer from rhea about the children of the goddess
arent they the people of zanado
she did say that the people of the red canyon were the children of the progenitor god so i suppose so but those evil guys continue to plot their revenge even after the red canyon tragedy does that mean some of the children of the goddess or their descendants are still alive
rhea
could be she was talking about what happened in zanado as if she was there herself
flayn
if theres something special about her blood we cant rule out the possibility
me
huh maybe though i get the feeling youre something else altogether
what are these children anyway and how are they connected to the goddess bah i almost disappeared into the bottomless swamp that is my mind i thought that after we defeated the empire id be able to see that sight i long to see
what sight is that
ive told you about my dreams before  i want to break down the wall separating f√≥dlan from the outside world the sight i want to see lies beyond that honestly its a trivial thing to fixate on just people gathered in their towns living our their lives together sometimes laughing sometimes fighting but the people living there arent just citizens of f√≥dlan they are people from dagda brigid and even duscur and sreng there could be people who were born in almyra or countries even farther east there too all of those people living together like its nothing special at all thats the sight i long to see its so simple but still so far away  but this is no time for complaining we need to focus on capturing shambhala lets hurry up and gather everyone together
so  you mean to tell me that f√≥dlan will fall to ruin if we leave those guys be
um if this map is reliable their base is just south of my familys territory
this story is a bit much to believe  and yet 
it does ring true somehow
remember monica the one who killed jeralt and the old man who was masquerading as tomas they were their allies and the flame emperor and the death knight were merely their pawns
the people who were after my blood
they were also the ones who used me to conduct their blood experiments 
as awful as it sounds theyre seemingly fond of using blood in their secret techniques
eww thats really gross i could never be friends with someone like that
i believe they were also responsible for the javelin of light that destroyed fort merceus
hold up boy do you really think that we can win against such powerful foes
i dont know but we have to try dont we
this is for f√≥dlans future
weve really taken on something big i wonder if our names will go down in history
my heroic name passed down to future generations haha a worthy cause indeed
its our responsibility as the victors
since edelgard cant do it i guess it falls to us
they were trying to use the imperial army to plunge f√≥dlan into war but we nipped that in the bud now we just need to tear our their roots and i know we have what it takes to do it
/***EOF***/
claude leverages his victory at the battle of gronder to secure reinforcements from alliance lords meanwhile the imperial army continues to tighten its defenses at fort merceus in anticipation of an attack on the imperial capital
our objective is enbarr the imperial capital but our greatest obstacle lies before that
and whats what
fort merceus if we cant pass through we wont be able to reach enbarr
fort merceus  the impregnable fortress or so its called
if i recall correctly its sometimes referred to as the stubborn old general
it is a massive fortress that was constructed to protect the imperial capital
the imperial army we defeated has withdrawn to enbarr fort merceus should be short on soldiers for now
we should attack quickly
yes it would be good to finish up here before more enemy reinforcements arrive
we should be careful
it would be best to take it before enemy reinforcements arrive still theres a reason its been called impregnable
the only real question is what our fearless leader intends to do 
sorry for the delay everyone those mewling lords kept me from leaving for quite some time
so were you able to secure additional reinforcements
its gonna have to wait until next month it doesnt look like they can afford to keep supporting us at present
then what should we do about fort merceus do you plan on waiting around
no if we wait until next month the enemy will have bolstered their defenses that said the prevailing theory is that you need triple your enemies forces to take a fortress with a frontal assault
right thats what we were taught at the academy and this is fort merceus were talking about its renowned for its strong defenses
our current army isnt nearly strong enough hmm  what to do 
whatever you do just dont ask us to scale those huge walls wed end up dead when they hurl rocks down at us
yeah no thanks if only someone would open up the gates for us from the inside
unfortunately we dont have any spies in there wait a minute  ive got it we sneak in stir up confusion and open the gates ourselves to let our allies in
right thats what i was saying all along
right nice one hilda but how do you propose we go about sneaking in
disguises if we dress up like imperial soldiers maybe theyll think were allies and let us in
do you really think theyd just open the gates for us id be pretty dumbfounded if that worked
no no   shes on to something its a good idea hilda we just need to refine it a bit and well be in there before we know it
really go me
what is your definition of refining the idea i know your go to strategy is nausea inducing poison but 
urgh i maybe ate too much my stomach hurts 
raphael  why are you eating meat during a war council
so fearless leader im guessing youre going to keep the crucial parts of your scheme under wraps until the time comes arent you
you know me so well judith whether we like it or not this war puts a damper on all of our spirits whats wrong with trying to have a little fun every now and again just leave the details to me
each time we take a step forward more blood is spilled  but by spilling that blood were able to take yet another step forward war is always a cruel affair but luckily we have each other to lean on weve steeled our hearts we wont be broken
im glad we have such reliable allies
i couldnt agree more without them we could never have made it this far
i wonder if were pushing them too hard
if anyones starting to feel the strain im sure just hearing from you will reassure them please  do whatever you can to keep their morale up
oh and about taking the fort  ill need a tad more time to prepare our plan its called an impregnable fortress for a reason after all my contingencies need contingencies this time or we might not pull it off
fort merceus is old and strong its reputation for durability is equal to that of arianrhod are we really going to leave this to claude with a plan concocted by hilda of all people
im uneasy too
i thought you might be with how secretly that man devises his schemes
have a little faith
i would like to but i am always troubled by how secretly that man devises his schemes
let us hope the end result is not too outlandish
you know when you work your muscles and they start screaming that means you gotta be nice to them if your muscles are hungry you gotta feed them and let them rest when theyre tired
i dont see how youd do that
whaddya mean how you just gotta eat and sleep its pretty obvious 
you can tell how your muscles are feeling
of course if my muscles hurt then i hurt if theyre hungry well then im hungry too
whats with the confused face professor you look like you dont get a word im saying
the battle at gronder field was gruesome wasnt it but perhaps its irresponsible to look away   to close our eyes to the horrors of war
i agree
as survivors we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain we must see the tragic foundations upon which well build our future
you dont have to force yourself
thank you but i think i do actually as survivors we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain we must see the tragic foundations upon which well build our future
may an age of peace rise from the ashes so that all this sacrifice means something
as i suspected they seem to be supporting the imperial army now thought i dont quite know who they are yet  nor do i know what tricks theyll use against us next we cant afford to let our guard down 
i never used to care whether i lived or died  but after seeing so much death firsthand i now realize how precious life truly is im ashamed of how arrogant i was to think that death could mean so little 
i wonder how far we can get with this plan dressing up like imperial soldiers to sneak in claude said it could use some refinement any ideas
we could dress you as the emperor
dress me as edelgard but we look nothing alike
we could dress claude as a woman
claude dressed as a woman i dont understand what the point of that would be
on second thought lets just stick to the plan as originally conceived that seems safer
claude takes care of the strategy you direct the troops and the rest of us focus on the fighting as long as the system keeps working we can win any battle no matter the odds thats what everyones saying anyway hope you can keep up with our expectations professor
dimitri the late prince of faerghus he despised the empire with all his heart he should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive
leaders are people too
leaders cant be emotional
no if a leaders emotions overcome them others must step in to prevent poor decision making why did his followers not intervene his attendants i used to call edelgard my leader and now she is running amok i am duty bound to stop her
theres word that claude has developed a rather interesting stratagem to capture the fortress you know fort merceuss nickname i assume the stubborn old general but there must be one or two gaps in its defenses 
fort merceus is next huh ah the memories its a huge stronghold in my fathers domain the towns completely surrounded by high walls i used to run around there when i was a kid  way back when a fortress was just a playground for me yeah those were the days
its always relaxing coming back here but its hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon and assaulting that huge keep that sounds hard oh really hard dont you think itll be hard
its going to be tough
i knew youd think so i knew you   ow oh ow cant believe i tried to hug you through the door
well be fine
of course youd say that why did i even bother asking
so many people died in the battle at gronder  and here we are preparing for the next battle as if nothing happened the day before its almost easier to think of war as theater with the stage an entire continent
though the actors die the show goes on
something like that if an accident happens on stage the next days performance must unaffected
it really doesnt seem like theater
even if an accident happens on stage the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened
everyone just pretends like everything is fine  focusing on their role in the play
i have excitement in my heart for secret tactics i enjoy attacks that are surprising
whys that
because its like hunting
yes hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey
surprise attacks are safe with friends fewer injuries
my relationship with the boar prince began even before i was born he was always by my side you might even say that at one time we were best friends
what do you mean best friends
what happened
i couldnt fathom the depth of his hatred for the empire so much anguish could i have saved him could i have stopped him
ive heard dedues passed on just like his highness
we cant know that for certain
thats true i did hear that his body was never found
dont believe everything you hear
youre right i dont think anyones found his body so i guess he might still be out there
dedue is dead
thats what ive heard but no ones found his body
if somehow hes still alive i hope well meet again
ya know professor laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date first you get past her defenses then you make your move
thats not the best analogy
trust me i know what im talking about im a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing girls i mean ive never actually you know captured any keeps 
you might be right
ha i knew youd get it professor
anyway you know more about tactics than me so i dont know why im offering you advice
oh goddess hear my prayer please bless the deceased with peace everlasting and may his soul rest in tranquility you know i used to see him praying quite often when i would come to the cathedral at night i wonder who it was he prayed for back then 
after the battle at gronder some people claim they saw my father they said he walked off the battlefield clutching  his highnesss dead body  so long as fathers alive i dont need anything else i just  i hope to see him again one day 
among our prisoners of war there were quite a few people who served his highness one of them stated that the empire was involved with the tragedy of duscur if this is true his highnesss motives seem clear i cant help but feel that perhaps i should have fought by his side 
why is that
because i too lost someone to that tragedy the most important person in my world
are you having regrets
no not anymore i am where i belong
those of us still on this plane of existence will carry the torch the inhumane actions of the empire must not be repeated
fort merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the imperial capital enbarr we cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort but once we have it the city should be almost entirely at our mercy whatever strategy you have in mind i have faith that it will lead to victory
standing face to face with those whom i went to school with on the field of battle  how inhuman war is   how horrifying my heart feels shattered it is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior
fort merceus is the empires single most fortified military installation utterly impregnable they say i wonder do you happen to know the nickname given to fort merceus
the silver maiden
no im afraid that name refers to the fortress city of arianrhod
f√≥dlans locket
that one is a fortress that stands at f√≥dlans throat
the stubborn old general
indeed a very good answer but of course youd know that
seems f√≥dlans give everyone and everything a nickname why you were called the ashen demon myself i have been called the father of crestology which is a nickname as well as a title i suppose 
each step closer to enbarr im reminded of another part of my past riches and poverty glory and failure that city has it all and if im honest  sometimes i miss it thats how the past works though isnt it its always a different story than what you really lived
hildas quite a tactician disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in undetected a stroke of brilliance with this strategy we can really snatch victory from the jaws of deceit
thats a good point
yes  with you leading our fighters ive no doubt the empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit get it deceit again
thats a bad pun
ah rats youve seen through my cunning punning
i hardly recognize everyone  their faces have changed so much more experience in the eyes and more pain im glad that theyre stronger but i hate to think that theyve all become hardened killers look after them ok try to keep em on the straight and narrow
please tell claude not to give us any more ridiculous orders ive reached out through all of my channels but there are limits to these things ill have to recruit an entire towns worth of people if i ever plan on making enough imperial uniforms
guess what i noticed i can see further than most other people can see but i cant figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly since i cant shoot what i see
you could detect enemy movements in advance
i suppose i could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away thats kinda useful at least
you could find our targets quicker than anyone
yeah i suppose it could be real useful for finding lady rhea too
thanks professor i think i get it now im gonna put my eyes to real good use
ah professor i have a question for you  have you heard of the death knight im referring to that imperial general who has been operating under that moniker
ive heard of him
nothing is certain yet but i get the feeling well have to face him soon enough
i havent heard of him
well now  i dont know very much myself only that hes caused a great deal of havoc in the west nothing is certain yet but i get the feeling well have to face him soon enough
greetings professor nothing to report is it true that well be assaulting fort merceus next that doesnt sound like the brightest idea  ive heard that its built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies not to tell you how to do your job but dont do it im not ready to say my final good byes to everyone 
i delivered our letter to fort merceus i dont think they suspected anything
i knew i was right to entrust that task to you youve got that honest kind of face that makes it easy to fool people
is that meant to be a compliment
what did you write in the letter
i informed them that reinforcements were on the way it would have been suspicious for troops to show up unannounced
so the plan is 
well disguise ourselves as reinforcements from the imperial capital and sneak in to fort merceus
oh you used my disguise plan after all
weve also procured imperial army uniforms
ooh good work i knew this was the only way
however  that alone wouldnt be enough
you did say the plan needed a little more refinement are you going to dress up like edelgard claude
im not sure that would accomplish much in the letter i included the name of the imperial general leading the reinforcements while were heading to the fort a separate army is going to attack us
were going to be attacked
thats all just for show though itll be our allies who are attacking us
oh i get it were going to make it look like the alliance is attacking imperial reinforcements
right when the troops in the fortress panic and open up the gates  were in
id love nothing more than for this plan to work but ive got some bad news for you apparently the notorious death knight has been placed in charge of defending fort merceus
the one who kidnapped flayn 
the death knight  i did not wish to ever think of him again
he got some acclaim in the battle to subjugate western faerghus they say he holds the most military prowess in the empire
even so weve got teach here to command us all will be well you have to trust us
so your big plan is to just trust your professor really boy
under the professors guidance im sure well manage somehow were counting on the tactics you learned from captain jeralt
prepare yourselves everyone its time
teach  this is for your ears only but theres actually one more part to my plan i had hoped it wouldnt come to this but i have no choice
no choice
absolutely we cant afford to hold anything back thanks to edelgards strength the imperial army is more unified than i would have expected it was a painful realization but after our battle at gronder field its clear that we cant win if we dont pull out all the stops i also realized something else during that battle there really is something special about you teach the reason we were all able to keep our cool in the midst of the chaos was because we all trust in you in your command and in your strength everyone here believes that we will win as long as we have you on our side our faith in you is borderline religious you and i  we have what it takes to free f√≥dlan from the empires rule i know in my heart that well make it through to witness the world after all the fighting has ceased
that manwoman approaches 
who are you talking about you dont mean that professor do you doesnt matter no one could take this fortress
ugh sounds like a bother  ill be taking a nap about now
will deaths scythe claim you  or will i fall to that sword of yours 
while waiting for reinforcements the alliance predicts the empire will continue to fortify its defenses at fort merceus knowing this risk claude an a select few advance hoping to gain entry to the fort through deception
fort merceus said to be impregnable lies between you and enbarr the imperial capital seizing the sturdy fortress will require a carefully devised strategy
general reinforcements have arrived from the capital they clashed with alliance forces in the outskirts of the city but should enter the fortress soon
you let them in make haste and slaughter them all
huh why
they are enemies slaughter them all i will not say it again
we made it in professor take control from the south i have my own task to do from here there are preparations to be made for our secret plan
i see your skills havent dulled yet kiddo
what did you expect
everyone listen up from now on the almyran forces will be fighting by our side
well work as one and we will bring down that fort together
an impregnable fortress is a wide open prairie once you get inside from here well attack from the north and south at once
no different than a prairie you say heh youve got a strange head on your shoulders kiddo
for nader the undefeated this should be as easy as a walk in a meadow right
heh well goddess or death god or whoever they may be lets crush them to dust
the time of ruin draws near  but their slaughter must wait until next we meet 
report the death knight has escaped the fortress
he gave up too easily does he have some other plan lets deal with the remaining enemies and go after him quickly
the time is ripe
report the death knight is moving it looks like theyre abandoning the fortress and making an escape
we need to put an end to this here and now come on lets circle around and cut off his retreat
hey how longs it been five years whod have thought youd end up an imperial general 
so you wish to die
heh as antisocial and unhinged as ever i see
hey kiddo what was with that  javelin of  light
javelin of light  that describes it pretty well the fortress was supposedly impregnable but look at it nowits hard to imagine that the empire would do something like that but if not them then who and for what purpose if they wanted to kill us then why wait until now to use it
we almost died just now  and without an answer to any of that speaking of unanswered questions why is nardel here care to explain i get the feeling theres something you two are keeping from us
ill go ahead and see my subordinates off to almyra kiddo
wait nader are really going to just leave me here and run away
i hope to see you again judith and you too professor ill be praying for your safety
nader are you saying that nardel is actually nader the unstoppable
unstoppable
its actually nader the undefeated almyrans love grand titles
i knew he was no ordinary person but to think he was the great hero of almyra 
hey um can we really afford to be chatting right now if another one of those javelins of light falls were all dead
claude there are things i wish to ask you but first we must hurry and withdraw
right you are come on everyone lets hurry up and get out of here
claude it is time for you to explain why are you so close with an almyran general
well he did quite a bit for me when i was younger
when you were younger  so before you joined house riegan how and where did you meet him there arent many opportunities to meet a general from almyra in f√≥dlan 
if thats what you believe its only because thats what youve been led to believe after all we have cyril here among our allies and he was born in almyra
hey now dont drag me into this
theres a big wide world outside of f√≥dlan and its overflowing with different places and cultures you think interacting with outsiders is odd but isnt avoiding contact with the outside world far more unnatural
dont change the subject claude to the people of the alliance the almyrans are 
its true that theres a history of hostility but why should that mean were doomed to remain hostile forever the almyrans arent monsters just look at cyril does he look like a monster to you
hey whats that supposed to mean
right teach what did you think when you met nader
hes  interesting
hes a reliable general
ha ill tell him you said that and im sure that if all of you got to know him all of your preconceived notions would change too i know you guys and you arent the type of people to reject someone without trying to get to know them
but  how did those almyrans even get past f√≥dlans throat i doubt my brother would just let them pass without saying anything 
about that  i actually made sure your brother met nader in advance
what lord holst met with an almyran general
oh so thats why you were so interested in my brother but wait theyre supposed to be bitter enemies theyve fought each other several times before
i know it was a big gamble but rather than having me try to convince them myself i knew it would be easier to just have them meet they were taken aback at first but sure enough they hit it off they were even drinking to their newfound brotherhood before parting
it makes sense if you take the greatest heroes away from the battlefield of course theyll get along
fighting one minute and drinking together the next  men are so weird
ultimately someones bloodline has nothing to do with the friendships they forge relations between the alliance and almyra is a matter well tackle in the future still i want to take this opportunity to make one thing clear to all of you after we defeat the empire i intend to tear down the walls that separate f√≥dlan from the outside world i want to let people and goods come and go freely and in doing so eradicate prejudices about the outside world
huh
would it even be possible to achieve such a thing it directly contradicts the seiros tenets
does it im not so sure im any case im prepared for the inevitable protests and criticism new ways of doing things are always met with resistance during our time at the officers academy all of you overcame the barriers of birthplace status and ideology having gone through so much with all of you i have no doubt that in time youll understand
i guess there were a lot of different people there people we wouldnt have met through the normal course of our lives
duscur once opposed the kingdom but there was someone from duscur there brigid once invaded the empire but the brigid princess was there we ate at the same table as those people sure sometimes we didnt get along but other times we helped each other out can we really draw a definitive line in the sand and say one group of people is all good and another all bad if i can realize my dream f√≥dlan will be reborn the old age will end and well welcome a new dawn
but if 
save your objections for another day gloucester boy
ugh 
that said there are more pressing matters to discuss our next step is to invade the imperial capital right
thats right im sure edelgard is eagerly awaiting our arrival in enbarr reinforcements from the alliance lords should arrive soon lets make sure were ready to greet them

with the destruction of shambhala the ambitions of those who slither in the dark are forever shattered however rhea has suffered grievous injuries in the aftermath yet certain mysteries remain unsolved so claude and the others approach rhea who is now confined to her room due to her wounds
i am happy to see you two 
sorry to interrupt your rest but there are some things that we absolutely must ask you
it seems i do not have much time left i do not intend to hide anything any longer
 
rhea  i have to ask youre the immaculate one arent you if what im thinking is correct thats what the children of the goddess is referring to in other words you 
i am the last child of the progenitor god a long time ago the progenitor god came from somewhere far away and descended upon this continent she changed her form to resemble that of a human and gave her own blood to birth her children the progenitor god and her children shared knowledge and skills with the people of the land together they built a prosperous civilization but the humans turned their backs on the teachings of the progenitor god and engaged in senseless wars eventually people began to think of themselves as gods and challenged the progenitor god herself to battle the land was scorched in the war that ensured and the majority of humans were annihilated i believe that those who slither in the dark are the descendants of those who retreated beneath the ground during that time
so they had been waiting all that time for their chance at revenge 
it took the progenitor god an astonishing amount of time to revive the ravaged world but eventually the continent found peace again and the progenitor god having fulfilled her duty fell into a long slumber in the holy tomb the children who stayed behind built a settlement in zanado to protect the holy tomb as they quietly lived out their lives but then nemesis appeared bringing tragedy along with him even now i cannot forget the sight of that massive canyon painted red with blood  i was never able to forgive those who proudly wielded weapons crafted from the corpses of my brethren i was the only survivor of zanado and all i could do was wander across f√≥dlan clinging to my desperate desire for revenge i called myself seiros fostered the founding of the empire and prepared to oppose nemesis and his followers
unbelievable 
i put zanado behind me to gather the remaining children who were scattered across f√≥dlan  finally we killed nemesis on the tailtean plains and i took back the sword of the creator
let me get this straight  saint seiros is you youre kidding me right
professor claude theres something you need to hear right away 
if you have something to report do so at once there is no need to let my presence worry you
as you wish  were receiving a constant stream of express messengers from cities to the east they claim that an unidentified military force is attacking and that there have already been a large number of casualties
what
the reports indicate that the cities and towns along the east gronder thoroughfare in the old hrym territory have already been destroyed some villages were razed completely leaving no survivors 
damn it did they come from shambhala could it be that there were some remnants of that wicked group hiding there
 
i have a report the unidentified military force has crossed the great bridge of myrddin alliance forces met them in battle but it seems they have already broken through
theyve already made it so far is count gloucester unharmed
the count is fine but apparently my brother joined with reinforcements and was gravely injured 
you mean to tell me they easily got past a general as skilled as holst
they say the enemy general has a weapon that resembles the sword of the creator even my brother was powerless to stop him 
the sword of the creator
thats not possible 
the enemy forces are flying a banner bearing the crest of flames as they continue their march west along the airmid river
 
we believe theyre marching toward garreg mach we are preparing to meet them in battle
a weapon that resembles the sword of the creator  and banner bearing the crest of flames  there is only one explanation the one leading the enemy force is nemesis himself
nemesis that nemesis do you really think the ancient king of liberation has been brought back to life
perhaps the seal was broken when shambhala fell  an incredible power that we children cannot hope to match dwells within the blood of the progenitor god nemesis obtained that blood so it would not surprise me if that were the case
the blood of the progenitor god  thats right he did take the remains from the holy tomb didnt he 
from the blood of the progenitor god sothis he acquired the crest of flames from her bones and heart he crafted the sword of the creator
the sword of the creator is made from her bones and heart
the heart of sothis is the crest stone that was placed in the sword of the creator the same is true of the crests of the 10 elites and the other crest stones  they were born of the blood and hearts of the progenitor gods children those who slither in the dark created them stole them sothis never gifted that power to the humans
the crests of the 10 elites the crest stones and the heroes relics  i cant believe those who slither in the dark made them all and after that nemesis used the sword of the creator to massacre all of the progenitor gods children in zanado  in other words the citizens of zanado were killed by weapons made from the remains of their brethren  how atrocious but i dont get it  the sword of the creator that teach wields doesnt have a crest stone so how is teach able to wield its full power
the crest stone of the progenitor god dwells within your professor
 
after i battled with nemesis as saint seiros i reclaimed the heart of sothis i wanted to use that heart to resurrect her even though i had to do some questionable things to achieve that goal i wished to see sothis my mother once more
you placed her heart in me
yes i believed that if i could resurrect my mother i could regain all that had been lost 
so thats the truth of it
i suspected that your body housed the consciousness of sothis those suspicions were correct and yet she merely gave you her power and vanished  my dearest wish did not come true  but you did inherit the power of the progenitor god now you must use that power to defeat nemesis once and for all f√≥dlans blood stained history must end
huh  what a magnificent tale its enough to make your head spin rheas real identity is saint seiros and the one who attacked us was nemesis the king of liberation on top of that youve got the heart of the goddess in you my flabber is completely gasted right now but now isnt the time for standing around in disbelief nemesis has made it this far for a reason if we arent victorious thats it for f√≥dlans new dawn the world will forever be shrouded in darkness  this is the final final battle finally my friend  please give it your all out there
a sudden invasion from nemesis has plunged the alliance territories into complete disarray against such overwhelming strength my father and his forces had no choice but to retreat
wise decision
im glad hes survived
it was certainly prudent for him to avoid a fruitless death but as things stand he will not leave much of an impression on history so that falls to me i will do all that i can for the future of f√≥dlan and the glory of house gloucester
hey professor have you heard from claude he says hes gonna throw a feast if we win the next battle enough food to clean out the stores
that sounds great
so what
so im super motivated to win im gonna train every muscle i got im coming for you nemesis im coming for you feast
i got the gist of it from claude those who slither in the dark  they seem to be descended from humans who were forced deep underground after the goddess defeated them
thats what i heard
is that right
they were trying to wipe out the goddess and her followers in hopes of taking back the surface thats why they called themselves saviors to their mind they were
it seems there are some shambhala loyalists in nemesiss forces as long as theyre around we can expect them to continue with their cruel experiments
we must win
lets wipe them out then
yes we have to its the only way to ensure nobody else will go through what i went through we must obliterate them in the next battle its the only recompense for edelgards death
just when we thought wed made it to the end another enemy approaches  can we be sure this battle is the last one
i dont know
of course theres no way to really know what will happen
this is it i think
i think youre right
just a little further to the end come on professor we have to win
my big brother challenged nemesis he knew he couldnt win he just did it so that his friends could escape he emerged from the battle with a terrible injury its a miracle he didnt die
im glad he made it
yeah me too
that was so noble of him
well maybe he should have been a little less noble when youre dead youre dead
dying to save someone else seems to defeat the purpose i wouldnt do it hes alive and in spite of myself im really proud of him
so were defending f√≥dlans future huh kind of makes my mercenary ambitions feel pretty small so ill think about my promise to captain jeralt to protect you instead thatll be my reason to fight
thank you
that works
if i can get you through this in one piece thats just as good as defending f√≥dlans future isnt it i just hope hes watching
the javelins of light that destroyed fort merceus  they are what destroyed shambhala they were trying to shroud the city in darkness perhaps they were planning to swallow us up in that same darkness maybe the javelins of light were a signal to nemesis to awaken him from his long slumber what do you think professor
i think youre exactly right
yes indeed i have done some good pondering here
i think youre way off the mark
oh really hm maybe i got a couple of things wrong but i thought i was pretty close 
if we keep up this momentum we will be able to take down nemesis and restore peace in f√≥dlan
when you think of it as one approaches the end of a war the sacrifices only grow larger dont they the winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow  while those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor neither side will give i only wish wed consider those who lose their lives in that struggle
were far from being safe ourselves
yes exactly my point lets be careful to ensure we dont lose our lives professor
its a necessary sacrifice
perhaps but that doesnt make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice
its better than dragging the war out
i can appreciate that but just because a choice is better does not mean that its good
everyone in f√≥dlans united but the whatstheirfaces in the dark or whatever wont let up lets get rid of em right away
lets do it
we gotta get some training in so we can crush em
we cant let our guard down
i know that come on lets go train so we can crush em
theres not a lot of time but im afraid we wont win if we dont train
the king of liberation the fell king his name is nemesis right and he was hidden away for over a thousand years wow thats a really long time all to himself  but that doesnt make him worth admiring no matter how much i envy him
you really envy him
youd like to be shut away for a thousand years
um maybe is that a trick question
i keep thinking the war is near its end then it isnt  when can we finally put this dreadful war behind us
lets end it with the next battle
that would be wonderful imagine the last moment of combat then peace it sounds like a fairy tale i want to make this a world a place where there is no fighting where children can grow up happy and safe
there can be no end to war
i suppose youre right  but we should still try our best to make the world a place where children can grow up happy and safe
i can feel a weight in the air it is different from before i do not know this nemesis person except what i have been reading but i am not of f√≥dlan my knowledge of this person is very little even so i feel that i can understand it i know that our enemy has great strength i am feeling great fear for this battle
dont worry
i have belief in you professor together we will not be losing
im scared too
you have fear too you do not look like you do  i have gratitude  i mean i am grateful that you told me
the fell king nemesis hmph i imagine hell be a worthy opponent how many foes have tasted my blade he will be an excellent finale we will be victorious professor
yes we will
splendid lets do it
calm down
im perfectly calm thank you
the king of liberation wakes after a thousand year slumber feels like im living a nightmare
i feel the same way
you too i hope youre not following my lead on this one professor
we must accept it
i know youre right but it still doesnt feel real
maybe this nemesis whos attacking us isnt even the real thing either way the damage and death hes causing are real enough i will fight to protect those who need it
just when we think were in the clear the legendary fell king resurrects whod have thought it can you handle this getting any weirder i dont know if i can
i can sympathize with you
i dont know how much of this nemesis guy is a legend and how much is true but i know this 
no time for complaining
i want to‚àí im going to survive ive spent this whole war afraid id die not anymore im going to live
i mean ill still fight like i want to die because thats worked so far and why change at this late date right
and if im right and i dont die would you go have dinner with me sometime
we went through all that trouble to finish the war and now we have to fight again what does this nemesis fellow have against garreg mach anyway
a vendetta 
a vendetta against garreg mach that doesnt make much sense at all
i have no idea 
well it doesnt make much sense to me either
at any rate ill do what i can to defend the monastery and lady rhea
is lady rhea ok she was quite weakened to start and then she took all those heavy injuries  i dont want to imagine it but what will happen if lady rhea passes away like this
well cross that bridge if we come to it
i suppose youre right
im sure shell be fine
yes im praying every day that shell get as well as soon as possible
come what may we should all combine our talents and defend the peace of f√≥dlan
shambhala is destroyed but are they vanquished entirely i wonder  just as kronya took monicas form perhaps there are some others living above ground
i dont know
quite possibly
once this battle is over i still have much to see to but right now i should focus on the task at hand on nemesis as long as nemesis stands both my future and the future of f√≥dlan hang in the balance
before the monastery was completed there was a massive battle on the tailtean plains in that battle the warrior seiros defeated the fell king nemesis and reclaimed the bones and heart of sothis those make up the divine sword that you wield and the crest that you bear now rhea seiros lies helpless the only one who can defeat this so called king of liberation is the inheritor of divine power you have our full and unwavering support only you can do this please save this world
please keep quiet rhea is sleeping right now she does not appear to be very well i beg of you please do everything you can to prevent an assault from nemesis
shambhala  an underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess shame phenomena driven by a source totally alien to the crests that we understand most unsettling could it be magic some manner of technology i would like to know the truth of it all very much so i want to know their history their knowledge why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy
well i dont know
i intend to carry out multiple excavations around the city there is so much to learn yet first we face battle with a king who has defied time hmm yes the excavations can wait i think
life can be tough you know but if youve got your friends to help you through it can be a lot easier maybe you butt heads sometimes but thats ok thats how you build bonds right and ive got friends professor plenty of those its true love that seems to have passed me by
you should relax
relax im relaxed
theres still hope
but where is my true love to be found where is my ray of hope
time to give up
yeah  im starting to figure thats the most realistic option
at this point im just hoping you stay single too then at least we can share each others misery
we thought wed taken down the mastermind of this war and then the fell king nemesis shows up well no matter what evil creatures we have to face this old soul will keep defending garreg mach not only garreg mach also lady rhea also you i think jeralt would be saying the same kind of thing if he were here right now
i try not to think about what would happen if lady rhea were harmed i cant bear the thought of it im not sure why the fell king nemesis picked right now to come back to life but it makes me angry thats for sure lets kick him back down into the dirt where he belongs
ghosts rising up from the ancient ruins  heh  no matter how hard we push back they dont stop coming theyre persistent ill give them that
i hear some super strong and evil fellas are after lady rhea she just barely made it back to garreg mach and then this has to go and happen ill protect lady rhea as best i can and youre gonna do the same thing arent ya professor yeah i know you will cut em down professor get every last one of those guys
did you hear our enemy is nemesis unbelievable it sounds so crazy but theres no laughing it off we must make our move before they reach the monastery
professor i just have to say thanks for everything im on high alert today so dont you worry about a thing this mysterious military force approaching garreg mach  is it true that nemesis is with them it was nemesis who led the 10 elites against saint seiros its the stuff of legend but this time he wont have the 10 elites on his side right he wont right
a military force bearing the crest of flames on its banner marches west to garreg mach from shambhala attacking nearby cities along the way rhea informs the alliance that the enemys general is none other than the ancient fell king nemesis and so the alliance army prepares for their final battle hoping to put an end to f√≥dlans blood stained history
shambhala has fallen but a mysterious army has emerged from its ruins bearing the crest of flames on its banner leading this force is nemesis the king of liberation presumed dead for a thousand years
whats the plan my friend
we will defeat nemesis
i thought youd say that and of course ill be joining you what about the rest of you our enemy is a monster of legend as always theres not a shred of proof that we can win
a foolish inquiry claude i must finish what my father started 
started your father ran away before the battle even began
i well all the more reason why i as his heir cannot flee now
im in i need to get back at him for hurting my brother im not going to let him get away with it
wow  hildas serious about this
i too will fight until the end i wish to protect f√≥dlans future
i feel the same as lysithea it would hardly be fitting for captain jeralts apprentice to bow out now ill show them everything he taught me
i i will give it my all as well for the professor for claude and for all of you who helped make me as strong as i am now
im in too and when were done im gonna eat tons of steak to celebrate
this truly is the final battle  at this point you shouldnt have to ask claude you know were with you
i do know that ignatz but i had to ask just to make sure
heh look at how reliable you kids have become youve trained them well professor this nemesis guy should be arriving soon is everyone ready
its finally time
i wont let us lose
i wont let any of you die
lets win this  together
im on board with that lets all make it through this alive lets defeat this dusty old king of liberation and put an end to this history of lies once weve done that therell be nothing holding us back a new and brighter age will begin lets go my friend f√≥dlans new dawn awaits
nemesis is here and with more soldiers than expected
a swamp huh but theres something about it  it looks odd somehow
agh cant breathe 
he should not have done that  be careful the water is poisonous to the living
it looks like wed better not get near that swamp  try to avoid it during the fight
huh i think theyve got some sort of magical link with nemesis 
could the magic be protecting him
not sure but wed better take out his 10 commanders before taking him on
seiros i will kill you do not get in my way
so thats nemesis  youre a crusty old bastard you know that
all those who stand in my way will be destroyed
wah watch out claude theyre coming for us
no effect so nemesis is  invincible 
nine more commanders remaining  we just killed number 10 these cant be the 10 elites can they nah not likely
look the swampland cleared
professor claude all the subordinates to nemesis have been eliminated
it took some doing but nows our chance to face off against nemesis
agh demonic beasts flying in from the south  someone here must be able to summon them
i sense an unusual presence someone may be hiding there
argh  thales
now he cant call any more demonic beasts time to see off his allies
now he cant call any more demonic beasts and the remaining forces of shambhala have been defeated too
whoa the swampland vanished
look the swampland cleared
hey  can you speak
 
just puppets controlled by nemesis  well theyre the strongest puppets ive ever known
feeble creature  prepare to die
that sword  you bear the crest of flames just as i do
that one seemed to work  were almost done lets go my friend
you are a foolish child
tough talk from a guy whos lived too long allow me to fix that
you are all pathetic weaklings you lack the courage to challenge me in lone combat
yet we have the strength to scale the walls between us to reach our hands in friendship so we can open our true hearts to one another
thats how we win
future historians will refer to this day as the new dawn of f√≥dlan of that i have no doubt
its up to you now teach as for my path 
a rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for f√≥dlan the ambitions of the fell king nemesis were crushed averting what could have been the greatest crisis in the history of f√≥dlan after 5 and a half years of war a new age was set to begin country faith history all that had once formed the order of the world was wiped clean the heroes whose very hands saved f√≥dlan from a dark fate commenced with the building of a new society the leaders of this new unified f√≥dlan began their walk down a seemly endless path one toward a world that would cherish differences in race and belief one where all life would be valued equally those clung to the hope that their path would not end with f√≥dlan that it would someday span the seas to dagda and beyond the throat to almyra

having repelled the imperial vanguard the alliance army requests reinforcements from judith head of house daphnel   the governing body in the northwestern regions of alliance territory
what not enough left for seconds im barely half full
ya eat too much anyways raphael supplies are running low so youre just gonna have to deal with it
youve always been so level headed cyril now that youve grown up youre even more that way
maybe its just that the rest of you havent grown enough you could work harder at being reliable
i cant grow if i cant eat
i have some good news for my hungry friends  we got a reply from judith
mr leader man has called a meeting about it hurry up everyone
we finally received a reply from judith the hero of daphnel has agreed to support us with soldiers and supplies
shes gonna give us food she really is a hero
maybe raphael will simmer down now
now regarding where were going to receive the delivery 
as this is a request from none other than the leader of the alliance i wish that i could send troops at once however  openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the alliance therefore i will secretly gather troops in ailell the valley of torment will your group be able to receive the soldiers at this location from there it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the alliance and the kingdom
ailell the valley of torment 
ailell is on the border between the daphnel territory and the kingdom itll make sense when we get there but its a peculiar region
i recall there being a scary legend about it 
in any case if we use that valley we shouldnt have to worry about being noticed by other alliance lords
ailell the valley of torment 
you know  id never have been recognized as the legitimate heir to house riegan without judiths recommendation  feels like im digging myself deeper and deeper in debt to the hero of daphnel but what do you do its all been worth it after all we need the daphnel army for our next move its possible well have to deal with our enemy sooner than later be prepared teach
the bridge that links alliance and empire lands is currently under the occupation of the imperial army in other words the empire can choose to invade the alliance whenever they wish i want you to understand that my father does not support the empire to antagonize house riegan he does it to deprive them of an easy excuse to cross that bridge
sharing her food with us for nothing in return judith really is a great person shes more like a goddess than the goddess is
she is very much like a goddess
i never met her so i dont know for sure but she must be beautiful and kind
im not sure about that
no well she could be a demon for all i care so long as she feeds me
the valley of torment  id heard of it but i never expected to go there its exciting i wonder what the landscape is like
it sounds dangerous
it probably is dangerous but i still want to get there and see it as soon as i can
it sounds painful
hm that is an interesting point  the name does seem to suggest that
ailell the valley of torment lies on the border of three noble territories the kingdoms fraldarius and galatea families and the alliances daphnel family in the fraldarius lands to the north the former kingdom army and new dukes army are fighting
valley of torment  valley of torment 
something wrong
i once read a book full of legends surrounding ailell but i cant seem to remember 
are you chanting some sort of curse
n no  im trying to remember the legends surrounding ailell 
my big brother told me stories of judiths bravery with just one look she tamed a runaway horse that nobody else had been able to touch when an almyran general provoked her she talked him into a tearful apology shes spectacular i wish shed fight alongside us
youre not a teacher anymore and were not your students but everyone still calls you professor is there something youd rather be called
professor is fine
guess thats what were used to huh all right
call me by my name
oh all right then ill call you   ugh nope sorry cant do it too weird
some day we will take the imperial capital it is odd to think that i will be invading the very city that i once called home ah that is still a ways off i will prepare for our journey to ailell
i never do get used to the sight of blood it always makes me feel as if i might faint have i never told you that huh oh well i hope this war ends soon i dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain 
i didnt think wed end up fighting randolph  hes my uncle well not by blood so  i guess i can handle it
im still worried about you
youre very resolute
dont worry about me im ready for anything
ailell the valley of torment what kind of a name for a place is that it sounds scary do i really have to go with you hey um heres an idea  maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort
hey professor thanks for your hard work again nothing to report today was i convincing was it like he was standing right in front of you some things are the same as they were five years ago but i guess a lot more has changed 
since the past i have learned much of the language of f√≥dlan but speaking the f√≥dlan language still gives me difficulty i can understand read and write with nearly perfection now but understanding and speaking are fruits of a different color
thats part of your charm
i have gratitude for you professor i hope that i will have fluency one day
everyone has a weak spot
yes i will keep practicing more
some in faerghus believe dimitri is still alive my father is one such eccentric hmph they cant accept reality dimitri is dead hes not coming back
ailell the valley of torment aw man  i really do not want to go there
pull yourself together
professor have you ever been to ailell if you had youd know
why not
that place is crazy hot for guys like me who grew up somewhere cold man  its gonna be rough though i guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay
we may not be students anymore but its still important to read we might even learn something thats useful for our next battle
studying is important
i couldnt agree more i hope the officers academy reopens when the war is over
training is important too
i suppose that may be true i always try my best at both
its a shame the monastery was ruined but at least the books are still intact
professor how do claude and judith know each other i hear there are still quarrels within the alliance  this generous offer of soldiers and supplies seems a little too good to be true i mean its also really impressive but im just a little worried i suppose 
my family the galateas are an offshoot of the daphnel family the family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance despite blood relations the families lived apart from one another so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged im not so much acquainted with judith the head of house daphnel
meeting reinforcements in the valley of torment seems an astute decision to me in that land of oppressive heat it is unlikely that we will be disturbed it also means we will need to contend with those harsh conditions ourselves however best ensure we are well prepared
it has been only five years yet so much has changed half of the kingdom has fallen to the empire skirmishes are rife throughout the alliance despite such tumult we look upon the same sky unchanged by the storm happening beneath it
do you wish you could return to those days
yes it would be nice i suppose things were  simpler then or so they seemed to be at the time
its true   its just like it was all those years ago
indeed i gazed up at the same sky with mother and father it does not feel so long ago at all wait but how would you know professor
the monastery repairs have made solid progress most excellent news when we first returned here i was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place  but if we can get the cathedral rebuilt well have it looking just like the old times soon enough
hearing that an old student has died cuts me right to the heart  as this war with the empire continues well see more of it professor we have a duty to fight alongside our former students we taught them how to fight after all now lets help them win
even though were getting reinforcements we should still be prepared for the worst never shirk your training no matter what to practice im going to chop something up with my sword unless youd like to train together care to spar
ive heard people talk about the hero of daphnel if the stories of her courage are true no one will be able to stand against us in different circumstances id have wanted to try crossing swords with her right now we have to focus on getting to those reinforcements lets hope nothing goes wrong
there are enemy spies around remain vigilant capture anyone who seems suspicious
to kill them
what else would we do with them
all right i will
im glad you understand im counting on you
gotta clean out the storerooms tend the flowers do the washing dust the library 
that sounds like a lot of work
well its my job ya know gotta do your job
do you need any help
nah this is my job lady rhea herself gave it do me
even if lady rheas not here right now i still gotta do my duty
like you you gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing yeah
greetings professor nothing to report is everyone setting out on a big campaign not exactly ah so youre meeting up with the reinforcements well you can leave guarding this place to me ill keep an eye out for anything suspicious
in response to the alliance armys plea judith has agreed to provide soldiers to meet up with reinforcements the alliance army sets out for ailell the valley of torment unbeknownst to claude something else awaits them there 
your party travels to ailell the valley of torment to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements it should have been a safe march 
ugh why is it so hot im getting all sweaty
dont be a wimp anythings worth it for more food supplies
move over raphael somehow you make the heat even worse
lets stay calm everyone once we meet up with judiths soldiers we can go right back home
oh i finally remembered the legend goes that this valley was born from the wrath of the goddess 
they say a pillar of light poured from the heavens and completely burned away the forest that used to be here 
so youre telling me the goddess who is supposed to be benevolent burned a forest to a crisp typical
thats what the legend would have us believe but its not recorded in any of the scriptures 
either its completely made up or the goddess is some kind of monster
huh is that 
the time for idle chatter is over claude look over there
ah has someone come to greet us
enemies
allies
that banner does not bear the daphnel crest
if memory serves  thats the crest of house rowe formerly lords of the kingdom they joined the empires side without hesitation during the coup and now here they are lying in wait for us
damn  i thought we had disposed of all the spies 
house rowe is mediocre and vulgar but i hear their knights are powerful
what about the daphnel soldiers you dont think 
im worried about judith
judith will be fine it would take a lot more than that to take her down
we need to break through their ranks
weve already been spotted so theres no time to come up with a brilliant plan
everyone prepare for battle i leave the command in your capable hands my friend
the valley of torment  perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight only if that puny force of children is able to kill me of course 
so their general must be that stubborn looking old man he looks like he wouldnt even forgive a sobbing child its good we came armed for the occasion care to find judith
flames are flaring everywhere and burning people where they stand  ailell is a terrible place everyone if you dont want to get burned to a crisp watch your step
the crest of flames ha quite full of themselves arent they
just as i thought   the professors army but its too late to back out now in lonatos place i have to do my duty
oh old gwendal is here and he doesnt look to be an ally 
oh the hero of daphnel is here ill expect more from her than the young ones 
all of your units fall in battle or judith is defeated
here we go attack them from both sides
so youre finally here supreme leader and something extra has tagged along
sorry judith that rat got away
hey dont worry and here you should have this perhaps it will come in handy
does a whelp like you really expect to kill me i am gwendal the gray lion a knight by the hand of count rowe do your worst
ah so i have found a place to die  young ones  i thank you 
that old man must have been struggling with the position he found himself in  its time to gather ourselves and pull back our troops
to think wed get into a scrap here of all places were lucky we all made it out alive
im sorry for involving you in this
dont worry about it in this day and age its a miracle ive been unscathed this long
i can see why they call you a hero
well thats ancient history
anyway long time no see professor are you still watching this boys back
can you quit calling me a boy in front of everyone im the leader of the alliance now its not proper 
not proper is it says the leader who has neglected alliance territory for years if youre really the master tactician you should go back to working quietly at whatever little desk you do your planning on
ugh dont call me that either who even came up with that nickname
its a perfect title for a boy who loves crafty schemes as much as you do you should be grateful to the professor on your own youd look like a scoundrel of a leader
haha claudes usually so flippant but even he gets overwhelmed when judith is around
as expected from the leader of the prestigious house daphnel her dignity if beyond compare even if she is no longer one of the five great lords
the five great lords
the prestigious house daphnel
the five most influential lords of the leicester alliance they hold the voting rights at the roundtable conferences house daphnel used to be included among their ranks but division from within has hastened their decline their vote has since been passed to the emerging margrave edmund
thanks for the exposition gloucester boy
boy i will not 
now to business there were some unexpected interruptions but ive brought soldiers and supplies as promised
thanks judith ill gladly take them off your hands 
hold your horses boy youre misunderstanding these soldiers are precious to me i made them what they are im not about to loan them out to someone
no then why did you come here
what im saying is that ill be joining your army youre going to fight the empire with the knights of seiros right fight for lady rhea not without me
thats admirable and all but we still dont know for sure if rhea is in the 
oh shes there a witness saw lady rhea being dragged off by the imperial army after the battle five years ago
are you sure your source is reliable
one of my own saw it happen im certain
it seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the empire
but youre the leader of house daphnel is it ok for you to leave your territory unattended
and what about you is it ok for you to leave the riegan territory unattended
thats  ive left it in the hands of a reliable retainer and 
and ive asked that retainer to watch over daphnel territory as well
wait wait wait  you just up and decided to get my retainer to do that without even asking me no respect this one 
what retainer
oh you havent met him yet professor his name is nardel he strikes me as a really special individual and hes quite handsome too
so thats your definition of handsome
no objections then good that settles it house daphnel is now yours to command
im sure youd come along even if i refused so be it well be counting on you judith
with judith joining our forces weve secured some more troops and supplies  albeit not many
hmph im sorry it couldnt be more
no its enough for the time being well use them to secure even more troops and supplies
how so
you think we can do that
the key to my plan is count gloucester the leader of the pro empire faction in the alliance
you intend to sway my father to join the other side
if count gloucester were to switch to the other side that would basically unify the alliance then we could utilize our full military force in the fight against the empire
you dont mean to ask me to persuade him do you that would be  quite impossible
i dont plan on it well just take his concerns out of the equation the airmid river flows along the border between gloucester territory and the empire right of all the bridges that cross it the great bridge of myrddin is the only one near gloucester territory large enough for an army currently the imperial army occupies it
so if we were to capture the bridge 
count gloucester would be freed from the threat of the empire thanks to us
but we have to pass through gloucester territory to reach the great bridge of myrddin do we not
yes and if we attempted it naturally he would try to stop us
i am sorry but i must ask surely you do not plan to engage in combat with my father
dont worry i want him as a future ally what good would it do to waste both of our forces fighting
i take it you have a scheme
who do you think youre taking to teach preparations are in the works even now
so well be sneaking through
we cant be stealthy with so many people but i have a scheme preparations are already in the works
so the master tactician is finally going to show us his true power im looking forward to it
ill do my best to live up to that name by making my scheme as impressive as possible
/***EOF***/
immediately following edelgards defeat the alliance army discovers the existence of another adversary   a group operating behind the scenes within the empire claude suspects that if the true enemy is left unchecked disaster will befall f√≥dlan and so he cuts short the celebration and the troops head for shambhala where this foe resides
i just dont get it 
what is it claude
those javelins of light  they were trying to use it to kill us at fort merceus right but then why not drop it on garreg mach they must have known for a while that we were here
it is not that they chose to refrain but rather that they were unable to do so
rhea how are you feeling
i am well enough  i cannot afford to rest while f√≥dlan is in danger
what do you mean when you say they couldnt drop a javelin of light here
once a very long time ago a massive ball of light fell upon this monastery however that light mysteriously changed course in mid air and landed in ailell instead
ailell the valley of torment  so thats what the wreckage of those javelins of light looks like
the holy tomb is not only the location of the progenitor gods eternal slumber but also a sacred vessel for a power that repels evil supposedly the progenitor god built the holy tomb herself to protect her children from the evil light
so the children of the goddess gathered in zanado because of its proximity to the monastery but weve fought at distant locations many times
despite that the javelins of light only fell on fort merceus
in his letter hubert said that he detected their magic when the fort fell in other words because they used a javelin of light hubert was able to pinpoint the location of their base
so they didnt use it before then because they didnt want us to know where their base is
in any case those javelins of light must be something they cant just use whenever they want and they finally decided to use one at merceus where they were sure theyd be able to finish us off its only thanks to the whims of the death knight that we escaped with our lives and no javelins of light have fallen since then
its possible that the enemy hasnt yet realized that weve learned the location of their base
if so their guard may be down which makes this the perfect time for a surprise attack
i will accompany you
what no that would be far too dangerous your long confinement weakened you greatly did it not
those people have opposed us since ancient times i wish to learn the truth about them for myself
i  i understand i will not stop you but please take care not to overexert yourself
we dont know exactly what were up against here but having you around is very reassuring rhea lets prepare to strike at shambhala before they make their next move
we crushed the empire at long last  but theres no time to bask in our victory we must prepare for the coming battle we knew there was a secret group behind the imperial army all this time now we have a chance to make the first move against them we have hubert to thank for that its also thanks to him that we were able to rescue rhea i still have plenty of questions id like to ask her
are you going to see her
well if we plan to have her march into battle with us again wed better let her recuperate
we should let her rest
rhea is the only one who gets a break though everyone else had better start preparing for battle
a mysterious power threatening the very future of f√≥dlan certainly we cannot give it leeway in comparison to this the internal power struggles in the alliance are utterly trivial
arent you frightened
fear will serve no purpose here the only path to survival is victory
do you think we can defeat it
there is simply no option but victory the alternative is unthinkable
perhaps i will have the opportunity to strike the decisive blow on the enemy commander that would secure my place in history for certain
wake up eat train eat train eat sleep we gotta prepare for the assault but that hasnt changed my routine
youre doing plenty
isnt there more you can do
all the training  and eating  i do is for the sake of f√≥dlan gotta stay strong  and fed  to keep it safe
our next opponent is an ally of solon do you remember what solon called us
traitors
no he called us beasts
beasts
thats right he called us beasts
insects
no he called us beasts
meanwhile he refers to himself as the savior who exactly is he saving
those who slither in the dark  it seems well finally discover their true form i get the sense that theyre in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child i wouldnt be surprised if edelgard was subjected to them too theres no telling what their true motives are but whatever their motives what they have done is unforgivable they must be exterminated
i thought the war would end with edelgards defeat  but that wasnt the case this may be premature but im feeling a little relieved i have to consider what ill do with myself and where ill go when this war is finally over  i dont have an answer yet  lets make sure the next battle puts an end to this war that way we can all move forward
shambhala it was called right scary that its so close to the house goneril territories whod have thought all those creeps were living right under my nose i was hoping my big brother would help us in this next battle but he says that i can represent house goneril without his help that i have it in me im glad he recognizes that i have some ability still i wish he wasnt leaving it all to me
these are monicas people arent they the ones who killed captain jeralt then this is my real opportunity for revenge theres no way i can back down from this one
youre not scared
no im ok actually im eager to get our there and fight this is what ive been training for
i wonder if we can win
if we lose its the end for f√≥dlan so we have to win even if it kills us
the history of the empire spans 1185 years and just like that it ends but the hresvelg legacy could live on  when edelgard assumed power there were no other rightful heirs she said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by virtue of merit not blood and she truly meant what she said at any rate i feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart who knows if it can ever be filled
as history proves everything comes to an end eventually i knew that all along but it still came as a surprise those who slither in the dark  its all so fascinating and strange they must certainly have a long history of their own and when they fall that will come quickly too dont you think heh that almost sounded like a prophecy there am i spooking you yet
hes dead  my fathers dead  im ok though really i was ready for it he was a general in the imperial army after all minister of military affairs  he gave his own life so the empires soldiers wouldnt have to lose theirs thats a fight that only he could take on he was such a tough guy this whole time i fought side by side with you and claude  but did i ever get any stronger will i ever be as strong as my father
with edelgard gone maybe f√≥dlan will finally find some peace thats all well and good but um  she was also the one to put my father under house arrest so now hes been released and hes taken charge of house varley i cant handle it i cant deal with him please you have to do something
how about we exile him
we can put him back under arrest
thank you so much
so the moment we defeat edie the nobles cozy up to the alliance and church  that lot really does think only of themselves and no one else but then theres count bergliez he used to be minister of military affairs  he sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter  when i heard that  i dont know  that simple act of humanity  i couldnt help it i burst into tears you know count bergliez is caspers father right i cant even imagine how caspar must feel about it
the empire has broken in  in smithereens now it is possible for me to go back to brigid but  i cannot choose that choice the time is still too soon for that we must be stopping the evil for everyone in f√≥dlan we will be fighting until the end of it
i thought that after the empire fell the boar might finally be avenged  but something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows   an organization behind the empire well have to take care of them if the boar  if dimitri is to rest in peace
weve all heard the legend of nemesis the king of liberation but now lady rhea is saying nemesis was just some kind of thief those two descriptions are totally at odds which versions correct i dont know what to think but i guess thats the nature of history i wonder what the generations that come after us will say about the battle were about to fight
this war might be over but not war in general human beings thrive on conflict we cant get enough of it i dont know when but you know someday another war will begin
even so 
heh heh  thats the way it is right
youre probably right about that
yeah but the fight is still worth it
war may always come back but so will peace and peace is what we fight for
lady rhea still seems weak  but at least shes safe now im praying that shell be well as soon as possible goddess  i beg you  protect lady rhea
finally that awful war is over everyone lost something and everyone had to make sacrifices  but maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now lets hurry to shambhala professor we have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war
is it really prudent to bring lady rhea on our upcoming expedition it would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous considering how long she was confined 
its her decision ultimately
i feel similarly
there are still many in f√≥dlan who are seeking lady rheas salvation
rhea is sleeping right now if it is not absolutely urgent please do not disturb her rest the long confinement took its toll on her health truthfully she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all   to say nothing of a military expedition to make matters worst we are now facing a very old enemy one that has conspired against us since time out of mind please proceed with caution i have a bad feeling
i am so glad that rhea is unharmed my brother continues to worry about her however of course i am worried myself i cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state  she should just leave things to you and claude and get the rest she needs 
a mysterious organization slithering in the dark of f√≥dlan  like something out of a midnight tale it appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the empire after the fall of enbarr theyve remained well concealed  that said i would keep an eye on edelgards uncle lord arundel something about him sits ill with me
professor most of the opera company fled but theyre back in the capital now i dont know if everyone survived but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival they even asked if id consider making a return to the stage someday  i suspect i may refuse though were at the dawn of something new no reason to look backwards eh
youve done it you did it you crushed the empire and rescued lady rhea im sure the captain is proud of you right now as am i of course im as proud as if id done it myself
lets not celebrate just yet
we still have opponents left to fight
sorry i didnt mean to overdo it we still have monicas group  those who killed the captain well knock em down so hard that they cant get back up
we rescued lady rhea i can hardly express my joy but now we know about a new foe who intends to bring her harm in time well realize the peaceful world that lady rhea has always hoped for ill have to keep that in mind when im fighting
we saved rhea and the empire has crumbled the kingdom may as well be finished too the reasons for me to remain in f√≥dlan are fading
please stay with us a little longer
of course ive come this far may as well see it through to the end
is it time to bid farewell
thats a little hasty ive come this far may as well see it through to the end
lady rheas back lady rheas back im so happy but  things arent gonna be like they used to be any time soon are they theres still folks out there who want us all dead and lady rhea still hasnt regained her strength yet speaking of which professor please dont ask too much of her right now ok
the folks were fighting next arent normal humans are they its that group who caused the javelin of light to fall right it just doesnt seem like something a human is capable of im not prone to flinching but i dont feel great about any of this 
greetings professor nothing to report i can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that everyone did sterling work i really thought wed know peace after the battle but were not quite there yet huh
incredible  who knew that there was such a vast space beneath the ground 
its like an underground city ive never seen buildings like these before
its like an ancient ruin  but not just because of its appearance
i dont recall ever seeing architecture like this
it is magnificent in a sense but i could hardly call it beautiful even the air feels stagnant
in any case it seems like we need to go further lets look around and see if we can find some stairs
 
something on your mind
are you not feeling well
no it is simply  we must defeat those who slither in the dark no matter what happens but if my conjecture is correct the one who they will wish to kill the most 
is you dear child
why me
they are aware that you can use the sword of the creator your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon nemesis that is why i fear for you
thats not much to go on
perhaps please forgive my errant thoughts once this battle is over  i will explain everything i will tell you all i know about who you really are
though the flame of war is quenched its embers endure you travel deep underground to confront those who slither in the dark and bring lasting peace to f√≥dlan
for thousands of years we have existed underground living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized here and now that vengeance is finally within our grasp there is but one thing left to do destroy them damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion away from the world of the living
now is the time remove the binding spell of titanus let their metal bodies be drenched in blood
hey what are those big things
demonic beasts  no i think not they appear to have no will of their own someone must be controlling them
initiate all that remain we must advance our preparations
viskam has been activated increase output gradually depending on the amount of magical energy charged i dont care if we destroy shambhala as long as our goals are fulfilled
those awful weapons have been stopped they were being controlled from that facility
aw those big things have gone to sleep on us that will make moving around a lot easier a dead end or perhaps  no if we worry about every little detail we wont get anywhere
you
that is the leader of those who slither in the dark we must go after him with all our might
it seems someone is trying to remove something wed better capture them first
youre nothing but animals performing tricks in the hopes of pleasing the goddess you will never see the sunlight again
so you have shown yourself fell star or should i say sothis i will spill every drop of blood in your body to fulfill the longstanding goal of the agarthans
your eyes hair ears and blood we remember it all we remember how you ruined us how you stole our light and condemned us to eternal darkness now suffer the wrath of the agarthans
ha it is laughable that base animals such as you would bare fangs at the likes of us
i may be a base animal but i have strong allies do you think you can beat teach and the sword of the creator
the sword of the creator  the blade given to nemesis who do you really think is superior
theres a big difference between the living and the dead the fate of the future lies in the hands of the living
you will never get to enjoy your victory
it cant be 
for all agarthans  let there be light
its coming down
seiros 
ugh 
hang in there lady rhea
get her to her room quickly
thats a serious injury  its a miracle that shes even alive right now ill do what i can but 
goddess  please save lady rhea 
all we can do now is pray 
remember when this place was taken five years ago and a pure white beast appeared on the battlefield i only caught a glimpse of it but i didnt understand where it came from there were rumors that the goddess sent it to protect the monastery  but now i know better that beast was rhea
she tried to save me 
did you know rheas true identity
looking back on it now i suppose i did
i once showed you a picture of a creature known as the immaculate one seteth confiscated it saying it must have been one of tomas personal possessions the beast that appeared back then looked just like it so rhea is the immaculate one the book said it was a servant of the goddess but wouldnt it make sense if beasts like that are actually children of the goddess
 
rhea is in a grim state right now its possible she may not make it but we have things we must ask her about once things calm down a little lets go and see rhea together the truth cant be delayed any longer
/***EOF***/
now in control of the great bridge of myrddin the alliance army invades the imperial territories in response the imperial army garrisons soldiers at fort merceus
all of that went about as well as it could have each lord has agreed to provide us with soldiers and supplies
im impressed you were able to convince all of those scattered nobles to help us i thought they would quarrel about how much support they should each provide thats what they usually do
well count gloucester took the initiative in taking on responsibilities i presume that was because you spoke with him in advance lorenz
i merely explained the situation at hand then my father simply followed your lead claude it was because you had the professor there to represent lady rhea my father is a pious follower of the church of seiros
i dont doubt it i wasnt under the delusion that it was my personal charm that unified everyone thanks for that by the way i hope you dont feel like i used you  because i sort of used you
dont mention it
i appreciate that we dont have time to be picky about our methods but be honest youre having a hard time adjusting to your new role arent you
im not well pleased
i understand youre having a hard time adjusting to your new role arent you you werent even a follower of seiros to being with and somehow youve ended up as a representative of the church
i realize that you might feel guilty about deceiving the believers for our cause 
i have news our enemy is gathering troops at fort merceus their army is immense likely led by a renowned general or perhaps even 
edelgard
well now that would be interesting if we can defeat the emperor then the empire will collapse
the flame emperor
perhaps but shes more than that now shes the actual emperor if we can defeat her the empire will collapse
theres something else an unidentified army has approached the great bridge of myrddin they passed through the daphnel and gloucester territories from the northwest with incredible speed theyre raising the banner of house blaiddyd perhaps they are the remnants of the faerghus royal family from what we could tell they posed no threat to the citizens of the alliance and so we refrained from engaging them in needless combat
maybe they hope to fight against the empire to avenge their fallen prince and what about the bridge itself
obviously we wouldnt let them pass without receiving envoys first we thought they may try to force their way through we considered firing warning arrows but they left immediately heading east
are they intending to use one of the bridges in ordelia territory
most likely but the imperial army still controls those bridges i cant imagine what they intend to do in the empire even if they do manage to break through 
im reluctant to ease up on our surveillance but it would be difficult to track them there  for now lets assume theyre just troops belonging to the old kingdom in any case we should proceed with caution soon well be entering empire territory ourselves if our enemies are going to intercept us with an attack  it will probably be at gronder field  how fitting that it was the site of the battle of the eagle and lion five years ago
we secured the win in our first skirmish but the next battle is a different matter the empire will come after us with everything its got even so the ultimate victory will be ours and im not just saying that ive made ample preparations to ensure our victory its my rule to never leave victory to chance you cant rely on the protection of the goddess with your power and my schemes i should be able to plot a direct course to victory
house gloucester has changed its allegiance and joined the faction that is against the empire the alliance will thus remain united but thanks to this latest ploy my father is more suspicious of claude now than ever if such a thing is possible ordinarily i might credit his helpful posture towards us to his devout faith in the church of seiros but it is clear to me now that this is nothing more than a shrewd calculation on his part he is only thinking of his position we are in the clear for now but please bear in mind that the alliance is never an entirely stable union
i gotta say its tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield
its like when we were fighting before  i saw lorenz and wasnt sure what to do with myself
everyone gets that feeling
so you cant avoid it huh how did everything get so messed up
you can run away if you want
hey come on even i know we cant do that
just because were fighting someone doesnt mean we gotta hate em thats probably the worst thing about war win or lose i still get a bad taste in my mouth
thanks to our victory ive been able to study the great bridge of myrddin at my leisure and you know what its an astounding structure so much history there imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big over water no less i hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of f√≥dlan   a historical site rather than a military checkpoint
i trust you and claude but i feel uneasy if we lose in the next battle the empires army will likely come surging into alliance territory if that happens my parents wont escape unharmed theyve raised their anti imperial flag after all
i wont let that happen
thank you professor ill fight with all ive got too
we cant take back what weve done
youre right i chose my path i must press on thats all anyone can do really
speaking with you has eased my mind a bit just enough in fact to put me in the mood for sweets
ive been praying to the goddess for lorenz  we wouldnt have had to fight like that if things were different
um i heard that some unidentified troops have appeared but  apparently they were flying the flag of the faerghus royal family  do you think it was dimitris ghost his country was taken before he ever wore the crown surely he must regret that 
poor lorenz he and i werent very close but we were friends
claude was saying that our next battle might be in gronder field is that right reminds me of the battle of the eagle and lion but of course that was a very different time when it was over all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery and then we had a party but we can never go back to that can we
we might see edelgard herself leading the enemy in the next battle if theyre coming out of fort merceus our troops might even clash on gronder field and those other troops on the march   who knows what theyll do or what side theyll take not sure how were supposed to form a strategy with so many unknowns
dont worry i can handle it
i dont know why youre so confident but it does somehow make me feel better
as long as youre here ill be fine
hey how come you only ever flatter me in times like these what am i supposed to make of that
anyways weve come this far lets just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get
we captured the great bridge of myrddin but the fight has only just begun enbarr the imperial capital lies far to the south beyond gronder field and waiting on the way there is the entire imperial army with twice as many troops as us we had better brace ourselves
i seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead if someone has passed even someone dear to me i could stand about and wail or get on with my life while im at it that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead i dont understand that either if i didnt like them when they were alive then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here
after we cross the great bridge of myrddin well be in my fathers territory we actually crossed it five years ago for the battle of eagle and lion remember ugh this is terrifying what am i gonna do i gotta get a grip 
dont worry ill arrange for your funeral
you think well meet him on the battlefield and hell kill me the front lines cover a long stretch of land you know we might not even run into him
ill pray for your safety
oh no no no you should pray we dont run into him at all the front lines cover a long stretch of land you know
so the campaign continues does it well allow me as a professional recluse with ten years of experience to volunteer for um staying behind oh who am i kidding the fighting wont stop until weve defeated edelgard will it or until we lose i guess but theres not much use in thinking about that
the great bridge of myrddin was considerably better fortified than it was five years ago  the bridge was full of soldiers and they all died
and ferdie was there we killed ferdie professor he used to be our friend do you remember those days
nobles who are changing allegiance again and again i do not have understanding for that how can you trust if treason comes with ease how can you be calling yourself a noble i do not have understanding of the reasoning 
theyre struggling for survival too
surviving is more difficult without trust there must be some other goal
for personal gain
survival has more importance than that are they not knowing this
so the boar prince is dead decapitated i hear i havent seen the severed head myself perhaps hes still alive and leading that army 
would you be able to fight him
dont patronize me if his head is still attached to his body ill remedy that without hesitation
dont get distracted
youre right i cant let my emotions take hold
either way a major battle awaits us try not to die ill be annoyed if you did
if we defeat the imperial army at gronder field what will our next objective be i guess we wont have much choice but to try to take fort merceus on the far side of gronder field its probably too soon for us to be thinking about that isnt it the battle just ahead of us is far from certain
the times come to fight the empire huh wow its shaping up to be quite the battle and ive got no problem with that but that mystery army really worries me theres no indication if theyre friend or foe  who do you think they are professor
remnants of the old kingdom
i suppose its possible after all his highness is supposedly dead
dimitri himself
heh not unless he rose from the grave to secure revenge that would mean  actually i have no idea what that would mean
well whoever they are i hope we can avoid fighting them
so were finally going to set foot in the empire im starting to get a little nervous
we already fought ferdinand at the great bridge of myrddin but 
i guess theres a good chance well be fighting more old friends from here on out
claude seems filled with confidence but i wonder if everything really will be ok  the imperial army might be hiding the emperor and the troops headed south might belong to the old kingdom ill be honest  im incredibly uneasy about all this but at this point theres no option but to move forward
ive cut all contact with my family since joining this fight were i to see soldiers of the galatea family amidst the host flying the royal familys banner  i  well all chance of reconciliation with my father would end there i do not know if that is the right path but the fact is ive come this far theres no time for second guessing not anymore
each time we press forward our search for rhea broadens to a wider area i certainly hope we will find at least some clue but i do suspect i already know where she is if i am right and she is in the imperial capital then we cannot save her until we topple the empire
the battle of the eagle and lion has it truly been five years since then can you recall whether it was before or after i joined your class professor
before
that is not at all the case professor your memory serves you poorly
after
im glad you have not forgotten
it was shortly after i joined your class   i remember it like it was yesterday
when undertaking research the usual methods is to form a hypothesis then test it with experiments those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods yet sometimes they also unveil an exception you seem to be that exception when it comes to my crest research
sorry about that
i dont understand
worry not professor exceptions are what make my work interesting why dont the rules apply to you i will find our eventually i feel it is my destiny as a crest scholar
i hear the next battle could be a big one is that true i miss the old days when if someone got hurt wed rush them to the infirmary and make them well  but on the battlefield theres not enough time to help people die professor dont be one of those
word just reached me that the empire has stationed soldiers in fort merceus if they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort well be in a difficult situation i hear its an impregnable keep surrounded by high ramparts taking it would not be easy
beyond the great bridge of myrddin its all unfamiliar territory for us we dont know where lady rhea is being held we ought to investigate all potential locations thoroughly the knights of seiros will handle the search well report back if we learn anything
reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory if i dont come back assume im dead
i know you wont get caught
im glad you think so highly of me but we have to be realistic
understood
good we have to be realistic
dont waste your energy worrying about me
i gotta keep this place clean and i mean properly clean every day dust it sweep it everything you never can tell when lady rhea might be back
since little claude became their leader the alliance lords havent been especially unified now theyre suddenly united for a common cause as a result the empire hasnt been able to perform even one successful incursion  rather were the ones who might get the jump on them its incredible magical even maybe his strategic genius was simmering for those five years and it returned to a full boil once you two were reunited or maybe he always knew hed meet you again and he was preparing for that this whole time 
greetings professor nothing to report i hear were sending troops to gronder field next is that whats what that whole area is in the territory of house bergliez its famous as the main granary of f√≥dlan if we could capture it we probably wouldnt have to worry about food anymore bread for all
gronder field should be around here right but its so foggy  even if there were enemies here wed never know it
i recall the terrain from the battle of the eagle and lion but without the ability to see the enemys formation 
our enemies are subject to the same conditions well just have to wait for the fog to clear up
speaking of enemies what do you think became of those unidentified troops any follow up reports
we havent heard anything since if they were headed this way  well id like to avoid being caught by surprise but we cant make use of our scouts because of this fog its hard to predict this fight theres no way to know what will happen
im worried
we did everything we could to prepare if we lose despite that then well just have to accept it as fate and retreat
lets try to stay calm
of course the morale of our allies would be crushed if we let them see us shaking in our boots
your guidance is going to be crucial teach now more than ever do whatever it takes to lead us to victory
departing from the great bridge of myrddin the alliance army marches south towards enbarr the imperial capital an unknown military force begins their advance under the banner of the kingdom the imperial army dispatches forces from fort merceus with the intention of interrupting them the curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies which will come to be known as the battle at gronder held on the same plains that witnessed the battle of the eagle and lion
at gronder field where the battle of the eagle and lion was once held the house leaders of five years ago have a fateful reunion but this time the contest between the empire the kingdom and the alliance is no mock battle
i will crush anyone who blocks my path
dimitri  hes alive but he doesnt look interested in joining forces with us
it would not be advantageous to take on both at once we must stop the kingdom and the alliance from joining forces i will create such chaotic warfare that they wont be able to tell who is friend and who is foe
mounted units advance
there are enemies in the central area  we need to head there immediately to protect it
the center is in danger of being taken we must be running to protect it
the imperial army is starting to crumble we will step on the empire right along with the alliance troops to the eternal flames with all of them
how kind of our enemies to fight one another and open flanks as well generous
if theyre going to stand in our way they must die smash them to pieces it is time someone take the central hill
those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives  in the crimson flames
this is not as i planned but theres nothing to be done burn the central hill
the central hill is up in smoke suppose ill have to quench the flames   with the enemys blood
even in an ugly battle like this its important not to lose heart we have to take pride in our victory we did it teach now we can move forward to our victory
want to die step forward ill take you all
not here  not like this 
felix 
we all choose our paths and ive chosen mine i fight for my lord to the death
your highness  i  failed you 
ingrid 
huh i guess this is fate sorry but i need you to please give up quietly ok
heh im not afraid  i figured it would end like this
 
oh i havent seen you in so long its such a shame we have to meet like this 
im  im sorry dimitri  i cant seem to stay  on my feet
hmph 
in the name of high highness you die here
i  can still fight your highness
shut up and retreat you must live dedue
are you trying to stop me too then ill just have to kill you
youre not worth it get out of my sight
where are you edelgard i will not stop until i kill you
calm down dimitri what does it achieve us killing each other here
move claude i have no time to exchange words with you
it doesnt matter what im saying does it you arent even listening but im not gonna budge
so  edelgard retreated i suppose she lives to be defeated another day
thats fine
i suppose a win is a win regardless of the circumstances
it was close
too close but i suppose all that matters is that we won
some of our allies are injured but can still fight well just have to accept this outcome and press onward still the battlefield looks awful and i wonder what became of the kingdom army and dimitri 
i saw him
who dimitri
he was completely different from how i remember him he looked like a crazed demon while he was fighting he pursued edelgard as she retreated but he didnt get far before he collapsed i saw him surrounded by imperial troops and  pierced by their spears ill never forget it he deserved a better end
dimitri  he went through so much to make it here only for his efforts to be in vain
i cant even begin to understand what dimitri must have been feeling but  there must have been some other way why did he have to go like that
and his vassal dedue  did he fall as well
i dont know 
your highness your ambitions are my own now i  i will bring you edelgards head  i swear it
professor claude may i have a moment of your time
lysithea what are you doing up this late trouble sleeping
thats understandable
we all have nights like that
anyone would be shaken after such a brutal battle if youre having trouble sleeping you should drink some warm milk thats a thing right
must you treat me like a child simply because i am awake a bit later than usual actually i can hardly muster any indignation right now i wanted to tell you that i noticed something odd during that battle
what was it
there were some strange mages among the ranks of the imperial army did you notice them
the ones wearing masks
the ones dressed in black
thats right i have seen people dressed just like that before it was a long time ago  house ordelia was involved in a rebellion that took place within the empire 18 years ago after it was quelled all of the key officials were caught and put to death the empire sent replacements who they used to take control of house ordelia among the people sent by the empire were mages dressed in black just like those we saw in battle
if theyre imperial mages it would make sense that they would wear the same clothing right
yes but the mages from back then and today  i do not believe they are from the adrestian empire
are they kingdom mages
are they alliance mages
no i got the impression that they were from somewhere else somewhere completely separate from f√≥dlan theres more those mages imprisoned the children from my house and performed horrible rituals on them blood experiments
lysithea  you cant mean  even you
yes all of the others were deemed failures they all died and even i  it doesnt matter the point is that those monsters possess dreadful knowledge and power i just thought you should know the sort of people who have allied with the empire
blood experiments  does that remind you of anything teach
the incident with flayn 
that incident with the flame emperor 
exactly there was that secret group who abducted flayn and extracted her blood five years ago the people involved back then were tomas and monica  well i suppose their true names were solon and kronya so that eerie group has been slithering behind the scenes in the empire for a while now  lysithea  thank you for sharing all of that with us one day we will uncover the truth of who those people really are
weve managed to invade empire territory and emerge victorious in our first battle i hope to maintain our momentum and push onward to enbarr the imperial capital unfortunately we are not legendary heroes in a fairytale our stamina has limits the longer we fight the harder the fight will become it will take immense effort to secure the supplies and soldier we need to prevail
boy you better not be saying this is as far as we go
of course not however the road ahead leads deep into enemy territory it will be a difficult journey strewn with hardship i cant guarantee that well make it out alive if anyone wants to leave now is the time to do it
i shall accompany you to the very end after all someone must step up to take leadership should you fall
im coming the future of my village depends on this besides  i have to protect the professor for captain jeralt
im not going anywhere because of the empire my little sis cant live in peace
we cant leave the future of f√≥dlan to others im sure that everyone here feels the same
the knights of seiros will keep fighting the empire we wont rest until we rescue lady rhea
i feel the same as the knights ive gotta rescue lady rhea no matter what
so what   were all supposed to take turns saying well do our best until the very end and what about you marianne what will you do
i  ill fight too
fine fine i suppose ill tag along too  until the bitter end
its an honor to keep fighting alongside such stalwart allies right teach
id expect nothing less from my students
hey now when you put it that way it almost sounds like youre just praising yourself
youre a stalwart ally too claude
i know im a great leader and all but praising me isnt gonna get you anywhere
all right now that i know where each of you stands im going to return to alliance territory for a while i intend to report this victory to alliance lords and draw out even more support from them our next battle will be even more challenging so brace yourselves for that
hmm  i should write to my brother hell want to hear about our victory
your brother lord holst how is he these days
oh hes doing great i even got a letter from him before the last battle he wanted to come and join our fight too
whats this lord holst come here that would be a most reassuring development
sadly it sounds like my father was against the idea they wanted him to stay in case they need to fight the almyrans
their logic is sound though it is vexing that the alliances greatest general cannot join us on the front lines
we should be glad that holst is staying behind almyra aside theres also no guarantee that the imperial forces wont try to launch a surprise attack from the old kingdom territory
um  if you have something you need to talk to my brother about id be happy to send a letter
no thats ok im just glad to hear hes doing well please send him my regards
/***EOF***/
the icy winds of the oghma mountains have begun to scatter and the verdant fields once again spring to life across f√≥dlan heralding the start of a new year as they celebrate the dawning year the people pray that they may realize their full potential just as a tiny sprout hopes to one day grow into a great tree
the continent of f√≥dlan said to be protected by a revered goddess has existed since time immemorial three ruling powers now control the land in the south lies a region long held by a more than one thousand year old dynasty the adrestian empire beyond its borders to the frigid north is the home of the holy kingdom of faerghus ruled by the royal family and its knights to the east a league of nobles that heeds no king nor emperor rules what is called the leicester alliance once consumed by a tempest of war and turmoil f√≥dlan and these three mighty powers now exist in relative harmony
this will be your first time at the monastery id be happy to show you around
it really is f√≥dlan in a nutshell the good and the bad
like it or not well be there soon enough
there it is garreg mach monastery
rheas here
i wonder  did the flow of time bring you here
its been years since ive last set eyes on this place to be forced to see her now 
her
you saw her in the courtyard earlier didnt you the archbishop lady rhea
youve been here before
ive never spoken of this to you before but many years ago i was a knight here i reported to the archbishop lady rhea
the archbishop
lady rhea
as you know the majority of folks in f√≥dlan are devout followers of the teachings of seiros the leader of that ridiculously large religious organization is the archbishop lady rhea
thank you for your patience jeralt my name is seteth i am an advisor to the archbishop
right hello
it has been a long time jeralt i wonder was it the will of the goddess that we have another chance meeting like this
forgive my silence all these years much has happened since we last spoke
so i see the miracle of fatherhood has blessed you that is your child is it not
yes born many years after i left this place i wish i could introduce you to the mother of my child but im afraid we lost her to illness
i see my condolences as for you i heard of your valiant efforts from alois what is your name
my name is 
a fine name indeed
 
you must at least show the basic courtesy of telling us your name do you not think you are being a bit rude to the archbishop
it is all right seteth my dear i am called rhea i am the archbishop of the church of seiros in truth i was only being polite i already know your name and a fine name it is
from the bottom of my heart i thank you for saving those students of the officers academy
hmph
jeralt you already know what it is i wish to say do you not
you want me to rejoin the knights of seiros dont you i wont say no but 
your apprehension stings i had expected that alois would have already asked this of you i must step away for now but i expect they will desire a word with you soon please listen carefully to what they have to say until tomorrow  farewell
i cant believe it forced back into the knights of seiros im sorry i dragged you into this looks like ill be stuck here for a while and im afraid your services are requested as well
as a mercenary
as a servant
nothing like that they want you to teach by the sound of it you heard those brats earlier talking about the officers academy right well the academy just happens to be short a professor and apparently that damned alois went and recommended you to lady rhea
so you must be the new professor my how stern and handsome you are
er no im not the one youre looking for you can handle things from here good luck  and watch out for lady rhea i dont know what shes thinking making you a professor like this she may be up to something stay on your guard
oh its you then so young 
competence and age are not necessarily correlated as you well know i am hanneman a crest scholar and professor at the officers academy i wonder if you bear a crest of your own when next you have a moment to spare i insist that you pay me a visit so we can delve into the subject further
im manuela im a professor a physician a songstress and available its nice to meet you
youre a physician
i look too pretty for that line of work do i but yes when im not teaching i can be found in the infirmary if youre ever lonely please do come and pay me a visit i would love to 
youre a songstress
of course before i came here i belonged to a renowned opera company perhaps youve heard of me the mittelfrank opera companys beautiful peerless 
spare our colleague the needless chatter manuela now then it seems youll be taking charge of one of the academys three houses i expect you havent yet been briefed on the nature of each have you
do you really not know fine ill do you a favor and explain the officers academy is comprised of three houses of students each of which is closely affiliated with its region of origin the black eagle house is for students from the adrestian empire their house leader this year is edelgard the imperial princess who is in line to be the next emperor
the blue lion house is for students from the holy kingdom of faerghus their house leader this year is prince dimitri he is to be the next king of faerghus
lastly there is the golden deer house which is for students of the leicester alliance their house leader is claude grandson to duke riegan the leader of the alliance
to think that the next emperor king and sovereign duke are all here it certainly is a promising year for the academy
ill say i just hope none of those little treasures cause any trouble
hm quite for now i suggest taking a stroll around the academy to get your bearings and when youve a moment please stop by my research laboratory
the old man has a point oh and keep in mind that ive only notified the house leaders that youre our new professor its more fun that way i suggest you try spending time with the students some odd ducks in that bunch but theyre good kids im sure lady rhea will have more information for you tomorrow but that should get you going good luck youll need it
have you no intention of changing your mind rhea appointing a stranger a child no less as a professor at our esteemed academy is 
i have made my decision seteth i know worrying comes naturally to you but there is truly no need that ‚Äústranger‚Äù is jeralts flesh and blood after all
i cant say thats all too comforting how trustworthy is this jeralt character is he not the man who went missing after the great fire 21 years ago i would remind you that flayn is now here with us as well i beg of you please consider whether this is an unnecessary risk
seteth they have my trust let that be enough for you as well more importantly i have received a report from shamir i am increasingly concerned about a matter regarding our suspicious individual we cannot ignore those who harbor ill will towards the church especially if they are frequenting garreg mach
yes that matter is of great importance as well i shall continue my investigation rhea  for now i will have faith that you are placing your trust with the utmost care i pray that nothing occurs to shake that confidence
i assume you are already aware that you will be teaching here at the officers academy correct to start please speak with the three house leaders you should also take a look around the academy and acquaint yourself with your new home that is your first task here at the monastery please let me know if you accept it once you have finished come and speak with me
you should speak with every student you can this might be your only chance to see what theyre really like before you become a professor 
 you are responsible for choosing which house to lead if there are still students you have yet to speak with try visiting each houses homeroom
ha i imagine you were a bit surprised that i recommended you as a professor here frankly we had someone else in mind for the role but they ran off during our dustup with the bandits cant entrust students to someone whos abandoned them once before huh
you saved the lives of the students you came across that at least was admirable now you should make the rounds go around the monastery and see that you greet everyone
so youve accepted a teaching position here  pity i was hoping you would lend your strength to the empire i never properly introduced myself did i my name is edelgard von hresvelg i am the princess and heir apparent to the adrestian empire i wonder if youll be tasked with leading the black eagles  i hope youve had a chance to meet everyone would you like to know more about any of the black eagles
yes
me well some think im a bit distant arrogant even but theres little to be done one day i must rise to become adrestias next emperor what else  well it seems to me that we may have similar personalities
hubert is the heir of marquis vestra he has served me since i was a child you may think his blood runs a bit cold but  heh actually thats rather accurate still if you can get past that youll see hes quite astute and reasonable
for some reason he thinks of me as a bitter rival and is always trying to challenge me its terribly irritating his house is that of duke aegir which produces adrestias prime ministers that family is perhaps too pleased with its own status
hes remarkably intelligent but he only wishes to apply himself to tasks that particularly interest him and nothing else hes also fond of well napping if he had any work ethic or sense of duty to speak of i suppose he would be destined to become an official of the empire
hes the second son of count bergliez he has no inheritance in his future which is perhaps why hes always so eager to prove himself hes overly energetic and rushes headfirst into any battle if he ends up in your care be sure to keep a close eye on him
shes count varleys only daughter i suppose you could say shes a bit eccentric but she seems like a gentle soul i believe shes shut herself away in her quarters and doesnt care to leave but dont worry ill make sure she finds her way to class
few commoners have joined the black eagle house but dorothea is an exception shes a songstress from a famous opera company in the empire im not entirely sure what brought her to the officers academy
to the west of f√≥dlan is an archipelago called brigid petra is the granddaughter of their king brigid is a vassal state of the empire which is how she came to be enrolled here shes incredibly smart and studious
please accept my apologies for the other day you came to our aid yet i hadnt even the courtesy to properly introduce myself i am dimitri alexandre blaiddyd crown prince of the holy kingdom of faerghus of course at the academy i am simply a student and ive heard word that you are to become a professor here delightful news i still have much to learn but im confident i could benefit greatly from your guidance in any case welcome to the monastery i hear youre investigating the different houses did any of the blue lions catch your attention
yes
me oh um please forgive me  its difficult to open up on the spot dont you think im afraid my story has not been a pleasant one  i do hope that doesnt color your view of me but i understand if that cant be helped
dedue was born in duscur and has been loyally working in my service for the past four years hes rather taciturn but once you get to know him youll see hes a kind and good natured young man
felix is the heir to house fraldarius he has a bit of a sharp tongue but dont let that fool you deep down hes a good guy he gravitates towards people who are skilled perhaps you would enjoy a friendly competition with him sometime
hes the adoptive son of lord lonato of castle gaspard but i hear he was born a commoner he has an extremely earnest personality so im certain he will approach your lectures with great enthusiasm
sylvain is the heir to house gautier he is a capable person who highly values his friends that said  well hes always been a bit of a ahem skirt chaser so to speak pardon my bluntness i speak with him about it often but it doesnt seem to help
i hear she was born to imperial nobility but a twist of fate brought her to the kingdom she may seem carefree on the surface but shes actually a kind soul who pays careful attention to everyone around her
annette is baron dominics niece she is a talented student who scored extremely high marks at the royal school of sorcery shes cheerful and hardworking brilliant really though she can be a bit oblivious at times i hear she caused an explosion in the kitchen last night 
ingrid is count galateas daughter she is also a childhood friend of felix sylvain and myself she is diligent industrious and principled in truth she is more knightly than most knights you will ever meet
well well scored a teaching gig here did ya talk about a great first impression i guess that means id better introduce myself properly im claude von riegan im from the ruling house of the leicester alliance but dont worry too much about all that madness im guessing you dont know which class youll be teaching yet do you i bet youd like ours were not as difficult as the other two have you met the folks from the golden deer house yet care to know more about anyone
yes
laughs piqued your interest have i as luck would have it im pretty curious about you as well but whats life without a bit of mystery lets just spend the next year or so learning about each other little by little
hes the heir of gloucester territory if you havent already picked up on it hes a bit arrogant and fancies himself a ladys man that said deep down hes really devoted and honest  though i wouldnt mind never hearing him talk about his noble obligations ever again
he comes from a merchant family but his parents died in an accident seems like hes had a rough life despite all that hes just about the most cheerful guy youll ever meet his passions are training eating and  actually thats about it
hes the second son of a merchant family since his brother will inherit the business hes training to become a knight if you ask me doesnt seem like he truly wants to be a knight  hes probably just doing it to please his parents 
lysithea is the daughter of count ordelia and is probably the youngest student here but watch out she gets angry if you treat her like a child as for me i do it on purpose you have to make your own fun in this place you know
marianne is margrave edmunds daughter and thats pretty much all i know about her she doesnt interact much with other students so i wouldnt be surprised if a lot of folks here have never even heard her speak
hilda is the only daughter of duke goneril it seems her father and brother coddle her quite a bit if you look up lazy in the dictionary her picture wont be there because she never got around to submitting it not too unusual for a noble i guess
leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary i think she said that her father is a hunter shes pretty blunt and as stingy as they come a habitual saver too i think shes hoping to repay her village for helping to send her here
i suppose i should return to rhea 
this is the classroom of the black eagle house which is for students from the adrestian empire our house leader is princess edelgard there are many other nobles among our ranks as well
i am hubert a humble servant of lady edelgard i heard you came to the aid of her highness you have my most sincere thanks this is petra she has come all the way from brigid to study in the empire back on her archipelago she is actually a princess in f√≥dlan terms she would be called heir to the throne
hello i am called petra i am pleased to be meeting with   no i am pleased to have met you
is it true that you saved edelgard thats incredible the names caspar by the way pleased to meet ya

 greetings you must be the new professor what a pleasure  as for me my job is to stand here at this glorious entrance and leisurely watch over the comings and goings of everyone make folks smile you know  er and by that i mean to vigilantly guard this entrance with my very life no levity whatsoever as of now nothing to report
here i am again the office of the captain of the knights that said im merely here to assist apparently the current captain is getting on in years i hear the captain has a hard time keeping up with the responsibilities of the job  thats where i come in
this is my research laboratory ive worked hard to furnish it with the rare materials and purpose built equipment required for my work
oh professor dropping by so soon i expected wed take some time exchange a few smiles as we passed in the hall flirt a bit you know  well youre here now and i do like a man who knows what he wants lock the door huh that welcome didnt faze you at all did it whats the matter dont you like me or are you just so innocent you dont understand me
im real busy so could you please move along now thanks ok now what else did lady rhea need doing today
 welcome to the library here you may find literature from the far reaches of f√≥dlan  i am tomas the librarian if you have need of me do not hesitate to ask i have worked here for hm i have lost track of the decades it seems
how are you enjoying your time at the academy thus far i hope you have found our halls brimming with the vitality of well intentioned souls
hm i suppose it is time for you to take charge of one of our three houses of students i must note that i am personally against entrusting someone as lacking in trackable history as yourself with such a task but it is as the archbishop desires
the black eagles the blue lions and the golden deer  all so different i hope youve made it a point to get to know each of them
since you are new here we have decided to allow you first pick manuela and i will take charge of the remaining two houses
which house will i choose 
are you having trouble deciding please open your heart to the will of the goddess and choose carefully
so you have chosen the black eagles led by edelgard correct
so you have chosen the blue lions led by dimitri correct
so you have chosen the golden deer led by claude correct
your heart has made its choice then all i ask is that you guide these open minds with virtue care and sincerity
they are all promising youths who bear the weight of f√≥dlans future upon their shoulders i hope you appreciate what an honor it is to lead them
brother oh i am so sincerely sorry i did not mean to interrupt
i am in the middle of something flayn is it urgent
no no its nothing more importantly  who is this
this is our newest professor at the academy
oh my a new addition to the officers academy i am so very pleased to meet you professor i am seteths little sister flayn i am so happy to make your acquaintance
let us focus on the topic at hand there is something you should be aware of in a few days time there will be a mock battle between the three houses intended to gauge the current progress of the students we will be using this battle as an opportunity to ascertain your own abilities as well please do not disappoint the archbishop that is all
wait so our new professor is you i didnt see that one coming
easy caspar arent you being a bit rude
you know its a waste of time to expect politeness from him  it will be a pleasure learning from you professor now if youll excuse me im off to take a nap
ah dont look at me like that oh and please dont talk to me too much either
 im sorry for the chaos youve walked into 
i hear we are rather close in age professor i hope you do not mind if we treat you like one of us in our class we try to treat each other as equals despite any differences in age or status personally i would love to include you in that inner circle
i dont mind at all
you have a gut professor i will take great joy from your teachings
petra i believe you mean to say that our professor has guts thats a bit different from having a gut you cant go around saying someone so slim and attractive has a gut
oh please take my apologies i have not yet mastered this language
professor i want you to know that its perfectly acceptable for you to treat me as you do the others i may be the imperial princess but here at the academy im just another student that said know that i have high expectations of you and high hopes but im certain you can lead the black eagle house to greatness
sure sure now lets break the ice with a training session i want to see our new teacher in action
why will the ice be broken is this a custom i have missed in my studies
not real ice just the ice of um    well it just means lets get to know each other
i dont wanna train lets stay in the classroom and learn from a book
lets all calm down and have a nice cup of tea how about doesnt that sound lovely professor
 
i know we all agreed to treat each other as equals but there is a limit to what i can tolerate the esteemed black eagle house requires order
 looks like your first job will be to quiet down this racket i dont envy you
ugh theyre not normally this rowdy i do hope you can manage professor
wait does this mean our new professor is   no i really cant believe it but i was speaking to you so casually as though we were companions oh i am so sorry professor you just look the same age as the rest of us and   oh and im sorry i just said that too i really must watch my tongue 
i dont mind if you treat me as a friend
you say that but i just dont know about all of this
ill admit it doesnt sit well with me either after all we wish to show you due respect
sure but if the professor says it ok shouldnt that be enough that is if your highness can consent to such a thing after all were already speaking this way to our future king so we may as well relax our speech with our professor too right
well were not in the kingdom so it only goes to follow that we should all speak companionably  i concede if the professor says its fine we ought to accept that kindness gratefully
as for me im not sure i can manage
you dont have to force yourself if its too difficult youre fine with that too right professor
such benevolence is a sight to behold i dont suppose you would care to join me for tea we could discuss education and marriage
control yourself sylvain i have more important matters to discuss with our new professor
having heard of your skills im eager to meet you in battle come to the training ground later there you will show me what youre capable of
you arent wasting any time are you felix as it were count me in for any such battle
hmph
pardon me but i would also love to observe you in battle for future reference if thats ok with you
ashe i dont have you speak of merely watching you should join us as well
 if you get injured simply say the word and ill patch you up straight away
your highness do take care not to go overboard
you worry too much dedue ill be fine i promise
my companions is there not something inherently wrong with crossing blades as a way to bond with each other
huh i never thought of it that way well if thats how you feel i suppose youll just stay behind while the rest of us are at the training ground
ingrid my dearest friend you really are too hard on me
well then professor what do you think as you can see the blue lion house is a lively bunch but youll fine none who work harder im certain well cause our fair share of trouble but im very much looking forward to the year ahead
wait what are you really our new homeroom professor
is that true you arent quite what i pictured oh sorry i didnt mean that the way it sounded
i was sure youd be roped into joining the knights
dont tell me you chose this class just to get to know me better right im flattered really  whoops now that youre our professor maybe i should choose my words more carefully
i dont mind
oh well then since were pretty close in age and all i suppose formalities arent all that necessary
one must truly marvel at the exceptionality of this appointment becoming a teacher to students almost the same age as yourself how unusual ive heard you are a skilled mercenary but i cannot shake my discomfort at your new position
are you really as strong as they say lets see your biceps i bet ive packed on more muscle than you
i doubt that apparently our new professor was personally recommended by alois one of the knights
as far as skill goes i saw it with my own eyes whats more teach here is the child of the most renowned former captain of the knights of seiros
i heard theres no way a child of the captain isnt worthy its simply not possible
the captain who are you talking about
captain jeralt of course the most notable captain of the knights of seiros and a peerless mercenary
hes not that well known 
youre exaggerating a bit
hmph it doesnt matter what you think of him captain jeralt deserves nothing but respect
hm well after working as a mercenary alongside a father figure such as he i have high hopes for our professor
just because someone is special  doesnt mean their children are special too lysithea assuming that a child is going to be exceptional just because of their lineage is a bad idea  dont you agree marianne
huh oh um yes i suppose so
well we can find out for ourselves in battle i cant wait to see what tactics youve learned from the captain
a battle shouldnt we have a welcome party or something first ill get the meat
how savage i propose a nice conversation over tea instead i am more than willing to procure some high quality leaves
tea you cant get to know someone over tea if theres no meat involved its not a party
your common sensibilities are grating to my noble ears please quiet yourself
sorry for the bickering teach as you can see the golden deer is a rowdy bunch were not especially unified youll find nobles and commoners alike here   those who are dedicated to their studies alongside slackers but hey that just makes your life more exciting right i really hope youre looking forward to the year ahead as much as i am
say while youre here id like to use this device i designed to determine whether the power of a crest resides within you wont hurt a bit promise you dont know about crests well allow me to tell you everything absolutely everything about them is your calendar clear this will take a while crests are a fascinating topic but before one can dive deeply into said topic one must first understand what crests are they are power incarnate they are said to have been bestowed upon humans by the goddess countless ages ago they exist within the flesh and are passed down through bloodlines those who carry crests may excel at magic display exceptional strength or any number of boons each crest has its own power the nature of which is beyond mortal understanding for now
and you believe i have a crest
i suspect as much yes but we wont know for sure unless i look into the matter as i said crests are passed down through the blood however just because someone carries a crest does not necessarily mean their descendants will inherit it as well only a scarce few descendants of a crests bloodline end up inheriting that crests power perhaps one of your ancestors bore a crest and you just happened to inherit it that is how a crest usually presents itself after all
do what you can to find out
yes of course ill get to the bottom of it straight away
theres no need to look into it
i most strongly disagree there absolutely is a need my crest research is of critical importance to the church ill have you know since you are now a professor here i must insist that you aid in my research of course there are those who lack the foresight to aid in my endeavors such as that stubborn seteth but such individuals are the rare exception
now then please go ahead and hold out your arm over this device here
what is this a pattern ive never seen before is it possible an as yet undiscovered crest has been detected to think there are still crests out there that even i am unaware of how thrilling ahem  pardon my unrestrained jubilation i have much to consider you may leave now i have more research to do in regard to this crest yes so very much more research but for now your work here is done  hmm  what could this line here be indicating perhaps it represents a lack of symmetry  or perhaps  what in the world oh i see  it may be connected to that but to a greater degree than usual 
 
with each moon professors of the officers academy receive a schedule for the month ahead it notes the days on which events and missions will take place that month pay careful attention to your schedule so that you may thoughtfully plan what you intend to do each month and when
so this is my room  i thought i heard a girls voice but i must have been imagining things
some believe the dignity of the empire rests on the results of the mock battle thats an overstatement of course still we must do our best to prevail you should take the time to learn each students abilities perhaps some extra lessons and training sessions are in order you look as if you have no idea whats going on here i know my way around so im happy to help you find your footing
the monastery has some exceptional facilities that everyone who lives at the officers academy is welcome to make use of for example you can enjoy a meal with your students at the dining hall or take part in some one on one sparring at the training grounds i suggest visiting the various facilities whenever you have the time to spare its a great way to get to know the students faculty and various workers here
have you noticed the bulletin boards placed around the monastery those contain requests people have posted as well as helpful information from the market if you prove yourself by helping people with their requests certain facilities here will become available for your use the bulletin board is updated frequently so i suggest checking it at least once a month
you should take your time when speaking with everyone but when it comes to using the facilities  well you need to be more careful with that if you use them without planning ahead your free time will be gone before you know it
a great deal is expected from professors of the officers academy so its important to hone your skills to put it plainly youll need to keep expanding your knowledge of all disciplines not just battle
i trust youre eager to face the black eagles in battle enjoy the thrill of anticipation while it lasts soon youll wish you had chosen to lead our house instead
i hear there will be a mock battle soon we must not neglect our training i trust that you will carefully study the strengths and weaknesses of each of your students that you may provide effective guidance regardless of the results this battle will be a great learning experience even so  what is the point of competition if the aim isnt to win as this is your first time at the monastery please allow me to show you the ropes
both students and teachers of the officers academy are free to use the facilities within the monastery for example you can dine with others at the dining hall or partake in one on one combat in the training grounds i encourage you to wander around the monastery and lend an ear to the people living here
there are bulletin boards in various places around the monastery have you seen them professor there you can find requests from various sources as well as information about the market if you fulfill these requests you should eventually be able to use even more of the facilities here the bulletin board gets updated frequently you would do well to check it once a month
this probably goes without saying but no matter which facility you use it will take up a considerable amount of your time its helpful to plan out activities in advance so that you dont mistakenly squander your time here
professors at the officers academy are expected to have exceptional leadership skills students and teachers alike must devote themselves to their studies and strive to acquire great wisdom even outside their respective fields
i heard about the upcoming mock battle i want you to know professor that i do not intend to lose i hereby declare my intention to prevail at  goodness listen to me the thrill of competition has carried me away i wont speak so formally of a class assignment in the future
did you hear the news teach looks like were gonna have a good ol mock battle between the houses the golden deer house isnt exactly what youd call an elite group just yet so you may want to whip everyone into shape with some extra training after all competition is only fun if you win to that end id better prepare as well you know i was researching what its like to live here long before i even enrolled want me to fill you in teach
students and teachers of the officers academy are all free to use the facilities within the monastery that means you can chow down with students in the dining hall or get in some one on one sparring at the training grounds as you explore the monastery try visiting the various facilities and talking to the people who live here
if you havent noticed there are bulletin boards in various places around here you can check them out to see posted requests or to find more information about the market i hear that fulfilling requests can even earn you the right to use more facilities the bulletin board gets updated frequently so its probably a good idea to check it once a month
far be it from me to tell you how to use the facilities but its a good idea to be mindful of how youre using your time if you dont think about how youre spending your free time itll be over before you know it
here at the officers academy even professors are expected to study often to help maintain their strong leadership skills in other words students and teachers alike have to strive to grow in every possible field
hey teach i hear theres gonna be a mock battle between the houses im not gonna lie im a bit concerned about facing an elite mercenary like you maybe take it easy on us what do you say
dimitri and claude are the leaders of the other two houses do not underestimate them when we take the field it would be best not to engage the both of them at once
if you continue to insist on distracting me i will have no choice but to get rid of you joking of course
let me tell you the provenance of our class name the eagle that refers to the twin headed eagle on the adrestian empires coat of arms and black is the traditional color of the empires armor hence black eagles
 the great tree moon is the best time of the year for naps i could just forget all about my assignment 
thats not a good idea
now im feeling sleepy too 
yeah 
who jeritza sure seems strong i kinda thought he was gonna be the new professor assigned to our class after that teacher ran away during our outdoor training i figured jeritza was a natural replacement i was surprised when you were suddenly appointed professor instead i dont think i could hold my own against jeritza in battle i could probably take you though
not a chance
you really think so with enough training im sure ill beat you someday
probably
hah seriously you should really work on your self confidence if youre planning on becoming a professor
um i ah was just heading back to my room bye
 
i dont like to come out unless i really have to hope youre ok with that professor
hi professor howre you doing if youre not busy would you like to join me on a little trip into town if im cooped up in this dusty old monastery for too long it drives me absolutely crazy
yes its true that im the only commoner in the black eagle house i knew that before the first day of class those people are simply exhausting
professor i hope you know i am having great abilities for reading and writing with sadness i still have struggles with speaking if my ways of speak of speech are causing a burden i hope you will have forgiveness
here at the monastery i have had many great learnings from many great people i am hopeful to have learnings from you too as forever i will do my best trying
his highness has said that he trusts you and i have no cause for doubt but if you mistreat him in any way i will take action
let me know when you are hungry i will make you a quality meal as thanks for your service to his highness
im busy do you want something
i was hoping to spar with you
i cant right now but lets fight soon i look forward to beating you
nothing in particular
then get out of my way
oh did you come to look at the plants too the greenhouse here is really incredible there are so many rare flowers id never seen back home and herbs i never even knew existed
ive never had much interest in plants
thats normal they all looked the same to me before i really studied them
you seem well informed on the subject
my adoptive father is the real expert he taught me everything i know about herbs including how to tell them apart and how to make medicines
you should try looking around the greenhouse sometime if the mood strikes you maybe something will catch your eye
hey professor if youve got spare time want to join me for a trip into town we could try to pick up beautiful girls  or not im kidding dont look at me like that
well theres dorothea hilda and mercedes lady rheas quite the beauty too and i must admit ive even checked out professor manuela once or twice you know professor i think im going to like it at the officers academy there are beautiful girls as far as the eye can see 
before i came to the officers academy i attended a school of magic in the kingdom capital thats where i met annie thats what i call annette oh i guess lorenz was at the school of magic too but annie was always just so nice to me even though i was older shes my best friend in the world
hello professor uh i have a teeny tiny question for you if thats all right  you havent seen a man with hair the same color as mine a scowling face and a generally gloomy demeanour have you
looking for someone
well yes its a bit difficult to explain  please just let me know if you do see him ok
cant say that i have
i suppose it was silly to ask sorry for wasting your time
the blue lion house derived its names from the honorary title of the first king of faerghus loog the king of lions wore brilliantly blue garments his chivalric exploits are recorded in multiple legends the library holds various historical accounts regarding him and the blue lions if you find time you should read them theyre filled with insights
our house is that of the golden deer do you know the significance of that name professor golden deer are sacred creatures said to have protected leicester since time immemorial all three of the houses have a meaning behind their name you should feel free to ask around if that sort of knowledge interests you
ugh i really need to eat i cant hold out until the next meal why cant the dining hall stay open all the time i need to keep eating if i want to get stronger
have you memorized everyones names yet im ignatz in case you forgot im looking forward to learning from you
this is the golden deer house youre in charge of a different house right too bad we wont see more of each other im happy to learn from you if the opportunity comes up
hi professor have you gotten around to visiting the library yet its absolutely loaded with valuable information i only wish i wasnt burdened with the necessity of sleep so i could spend all my hours there
you like reading
in a manner yes but its more that i want to learn as much as i possibly can
you ought to get some rest
please dont treat me like a child i may be a bit younger than the others but that really shouldnt factor in
goddess i pray to thee  please protect us   
so about the mock battle thats coming up you dont mind me sitting it out do you as a fragile maiden im useless in battle ill just cheer everyone on instead
oh professor have you adjusted to life at the academy yet me im still not used to it im not one for all this studying and training
im captain jeralts first and best apprentice i can beat anyone professor even you if i have to it may have been only for a short time but i learned from the absolute best
do bear in mind that even as you are appraising your students they are appraising you as well i hope that you will do your best to form lasting bonds with your flock oh and i look forward to witnessing your prowess in the mock battle
these are the students quarters to better help you supervise them you also have a room here your room is here at the end commoner students also reside on the first floor while the second is primarily for students of noble birth as a rule we try to avoid discrimination based on social status here but the nobility can be quite insistent when it comes to matters of propriety speaking of it would be best for you to avoid improper conduct i expect you to set a good example for the students
hello there professor well i call you that but i am afraid that i am not a student here myself 
thats a shame
should the opportunity arise i would love to become a student and begin my studies in earnest
where can i visit you then
my brother would not be pleased if he heard you saying such things
the monastery is kind enough to provide a sanctuary for my brother and i hes the only family i have
captain jeralt has hardly changed since 20 years ago ive aged at least three times as much as he has why am i talking about this oh right it was because i just overheard tomas remarking on the subject the leader of a legendary group of knights returned people are bound to be talking about the ol captain
i care nothing of friendship if you have no business here leave
the church has changed a lot since my time seteth hanneman manuela jeritza and many of the knights  none of them were around 20 years ago have you met leonie yet apparently it was my influence that inspired her to leave her village sorry to burden you but could you watch over her for me shes the only apprentice ive ever had
apparently there is to be a mock battle between the houses interesting but i hope you understand that i have far more important things on my mind my research is proceeding slower than i would like your crest is something of a challenge frustrating yet also quite intriguing i was wondering if i might get a sample of your flesh a couple square inches would do no perhaps some blood a couple of drops on the device are all i need
its some kind of experimental apparatus 
i might as well assist by providing a blood sample 
oh thank you professor those few drops of blood are invaluable to my research oh so much more to learn
i had better keep my distance
a mock battle this early wow professor theyre not giving you any time to settle in are they dont you worry though should you get injured i will care for you all through your recuperation i will see to you oh so very very personally
professor i hear you are lacking in knowledge of the church of seiros the library contains countless documents about the teaching and history of the church i encourage you to make good use of them
im a little busy
oh sorry
if youre looking for the greenhouse its right there see it looks like a greenhouse thats it
cant we talk just a little
i really cant right now i got a lot of things to do work and stuff like that why dont you look at the flowers in the greenhouse instead theyre pretty
greetings professor nothing to report by the by have you ever regretted a decision and wished you could go back and undo it its too bad theres no lesson for how to turn back the ol clock huh but i suppose a bad decision isnt worth all that fuss anyhow
im not too keen on the professor of my class i really hoped to focus more on strategy hmm maybe i should talk to my professor about transferring to a different class
there are two types of crests major crests manifest their power most effectively while minor crests are slightly weaker it is said that the closer a persons blood relation is to various saints and heroes the higher their chance of bearing a major crest of course there are also examples of major crests manifesting in children whose parents bear no crest whatsoever the exact nature of how and why crests are inherited is still a mystery
i hear a member of house hresvelg the ruling family of the empire has entered the officers academy for the first time in ages it is said that the adrestian empires very founding was aided by none other than saint seiros that is why the crest of seiros is on the imperial flag in recent years a rift has developed between the empire and the church  let us hope that this will be a good opportunity for both parties to reforge their close relationship of years past
as part of our commitment to the goddess the knights undertake various missions across all of f√≥dlan assisting with the education of young nobles is also a part of our sacred duty
the imperial princess the crown prince and the heir to the alliances leading house  this is one exceptional year thats for sure if youre a teacher here youd better watch your step if anything were to happen to those kids  well suffice to say that it could harm the reputation of the church of seiros which weve spent almost a millennium establishing
tomas has served as the monasterys librarian for decades actually he was away from garreg mach for a spell but he returned to his post last year there is no one as familiar with the monastery archives as he is
its finally time for the mock battle this is my chance to measure your worth as an instructor do you think you can rise to the challenge
leave it to me
so confident this will be interesting
im concerned 
that doesnt inspire much confidence does it
each of us has undergone strict training were prepared for anything that comes our way that means theres no need to hold back show us what youre capable of
hey there did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting oh no worries well just join in now
simply tell me your weaknesses and youre welcome to stay but is there enough time to cover them all
ah so you cant win unless you know my weakness poor princess you really should believe in yourself more
i spare no effort when pursuing victory as a master of schemes i should think you would understand
schemes me i have no idea what youre talking about i plan to fight fair and square as ever
hearing the words fair and square from claude can only be a bad omen
your highnesses havent known me for very long but you already have me figured out dont you
no need to poke fun i will fight with honor that said i will fight to win
yes and the same is true of us right professor
dont go too hard on us
no use trying to hide how you really feel teach i can see it in your eyes you dont intend to lose
i dont intend to lose
if that is how you feel then i will not hold back
aw how precious looks like you and the students have become fast friends
while i am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students im afraid its about time for the faculty strategy meeting
ah how time flies in that case ill see you later
edelgard professor be careful out there
ah its finally time for the mock battle im eager to put my skills to use and you professor
im looking forward to it
excellent i have high expectations for your command that said ive no doubt it will take everything weve got to pull a victory
i hope we can win
i wouldnt worry too much about it if you command use as you did back in the village i have no doubt well be fine
our opponents are mighty that much is certain but im positive we can win
hey there did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting oh no worries well just join in now
nice try claude but i do not intent to let slip our strategies especially when we are up against such strong opponents as you two
well now kind words from his kingliness if thats the case wed better come up with some clever schemes so as not to disappoint right princess
right no matter the tactics you devise we will destroy you the best you can hope for is to learn a thing or two
haha theres nothing wrong with a friendly rivalry but lets not get carried away a rash attitude could be your undoing after all
hmm  perhaps your time would be better spent preparing instead of worrying about the competitions mindset
hey now if you two are getting this fired up before the battle even starts itll make it that much easier for my class to sweep up a win so please carry on
a good point claude i apologize that wasnt my intention at any rate lets vow to make this a productive battle shall we
dont go too hard on us
no use trying to hide how you really feel teach i can see it in your eyes you dont intend to lose
i dont intend to lose
oh in that case i wont hold back
aw how precious looks like you and the students have become fast friends
while i am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students im afraid its about time for the faculty strategy meeting
ah how time flies in that case ill see you later
i look forward to assessing your abilities i hope you dont disappoint
time for a mock battle eh hmm how should we go about this  well youll be our commander that much is for sure just dont screw it up and everythingll be great got it teach
im not concerned
leave it to me
right ill do whatever i can to help too i mean im kind of obligated to for example if i add a little something to their food to upset their stomachs 
dont even think about it
yeah yeah wink wink i read you you cant officially condone that sort of thing right but say hypothetically speaking students from the other houses started racing to the infirmary  as far as anyone knows it could just be a harmless little stomach bug making the rounds
well well what a fascinating conversation you two are having may we join
claude i cant believe you would stoop to such crooked schemes to gain the advantage have you no honor
if that was really my scheme i wouldnt be talking about it out in the open im afraid youll have to wait until our battle to see whats really in store
its irrelevant anyhow whatever you have planned wont save you from a crushing defeat
she has a point still im rather eager to see what sort of scheme that mind of yours conjures up
you heard em teach we cant let these fine folks down
it will be a fair fight
heh of course a fair fight as all fights are good one teach play innocent now so they wont see it coming
if they insist
are you serious teach well if a crooked scheme is really what youre after ive got more than a few of those up my sleeve
aw how precious looks like you and the students have become fast friends
while i am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students im afraid its about time for the faculty strategy meeting
im sorry professors its about time i returned to my training anyhow claude edelgard until we meet again on the battlefield farewell
i look forward to assessing your abilities i hope you dont disappoint
formerly a promising young mercenary you are now the newest professor at the prestigious officers academy students and faculty alike look on with curiosity as you engage in a mock battle between the schools three houses
the mock battle is finally here will you lead us to victory
im sure you already understand but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner incidentally ill be overseeing this mock battle so listen well if you want to win
none of your shallow tactics are required claude ignatz and i will dismantle the opposition
me but im not ready
are you making light of our new professor if you drop your guard youre going to get hurt 
ashe can you move to the front lines i want to lure the enemy this way
got it your highness leave it to me
once youve finished preparing make your move dedue mercedes keep our enemy occupied until then
im on it
oh my well try our best
well done teach i may have to take this seriously after all
lets use the forest to set up an ambush im counting on your support everyone
if theyre waiting in the forest wed do well to take a detour
welp were surrounded all we can do is fight back with all our might
are you really gonna fight two houses at once heh an impressive display of confidence
this is a good opportunity for us lets forge ahead
beautiful work professor but the true challenge starts now
youre a tough opponent but i refuse to yield do not fool yourself into believing i will hold back
dimitri  its time we can finally settle the question of whos stronger
very well i accept your challenge with you as my opponent i wont hold anything back
i would expect no less
coming up with brilliant schemes i can handle no problem but im not much for fighting go easy on me
 
you know that was a joke right jeez not so much as a smile 
look at that a real life princess ill have to be careful not to scar that little face of yours
careful claude ill win no matter what but youre only making things harder for yourself
losing hasnt even crossed your mind has it ooh thisll be a bit of a shock then
to shock was your intention to begin with was it not
ive lost oh unthinkable
ive lost the new professor is quite a commander
ouch was that really necessary
argh i hate losing i guess ill just have to settle for cheering the others on
i must have let my guard down i guess thats a loss for the golden deer house
well done i nearly wound up a patient in my own infirmary
ah so strong have to do better next time 
ngh apologies your highness i can go no further
oh no  this is as far as i can go 
my training was insufficient  i am so sorry everyone the rest is up to you
i suppose that does it for the blue lion house 
my goodness the leadership of someone with actual battle experience is  well i was as good as useless
i am the son of house aegir how did i fail i must need to train harder 
hmm the new professors rather strong suppose ill have to call it a day
my my  the new professor seems very capable
forced to retreat  well things will only get tougher from here on out
to think that the black eagles could lose so readily 
all right thats that the winner of this mock battle is  the black eagle house
even though it was just a mock battle we defeated both houses masterfully take pride in this victory everyone
this victory is the result of everyones hard work thank you my friends you did well
it is about time for the battle to begin our victory depends on your leadership do not let us down
none of your shallow tactics are required claude ignatz and i will dismantle the opposition
me but im not ready
are you making light of our new professor if you drop your guard youre going to get hurt 
dorothea will you head towards the front lines i wish to draw the enemy towards us
you got it edie leave it to me
ferdinand hubert if the enemy comes stop them
leave it to us although i could do this on my own
heh clearly not or her highness would not ask me to watch your back
well done teach i may have to take this seriously after all
lets use the forest to set up an ambush im counting on your support everyone
if theyre waiting in the forest wed do well to take a detour
welp were surrounded all we can do is fight back with all our might
are you really gonna fight two houses at once heh an impressive display of confidence
victory is in sight black eagles do not let up
flawless tactics professor our only choice in this situation is a head on attack
psst your princliness youve got a thing for edelgard right come on fess up youll feel better
claude please this is no time for idle banter your defenses are wide open
that didnt get to him huh what a shame ill find a better way to ruffle him up next time
there can be no victory unless i defeat you so be it
so this is the stage for the mock battle  the commands all yours teach
i will fight on the front lines i can stop the enemys advance with grace
do you have lady edelgards permission to  hmph i suppose ive no choice but to provide cover
thank you hubert we are off to a terrible start
ashe can you move to the front lines i want to lure the enemy this way
got it your highness leave it to me
once youve finished preparing make your move dedue mercedes keep our enemy occupied until then
im on it
oh my well try our best
hm you are performing as expected professor we will have to face you with our full might
we will use the forest to ambush our enemy everyone i am counting on your support
if theyre waiting in the forest wed do well to take a detour
it seems were surrounded  at a time like this our only option is to cut a path through
are you planning on fighting two houses at once i will admit that is favorable for us
this is a good opportunity for us lets forge ahead
beautiful work professor but the true challenge starts now
great work everyone even if its just a mock battle the taste of victory is sugary sweet
excellent work today professor though our victory should come as no surprise
it was a close call
was it im not sure i agree with that
it was easy
yes it was further proof that youre well qualified to guide the black eagles
that was impressing professor i mean impressive we gained a victory because of your great leadership
we certainly did we all tried our best of course but we couldnt have won without you
i was curious what it would look like if you did not hold back and you did not disappoint
hmph i daresay we owe our victory to lady edelgard
how so for that battle she was only a soldier following our professors command sure she was an incredibly powerful soldier 
dont worry about it too much linhardt all that matters is that we won
im all done with being on the battlefield ok id rather stay back than pursue victory out there
you are all as ridiculous as always we only managed to win because we worked together
was it something i said is it so odd me talking about togetherness if so that perception must change in fact im canceling the festivities so we can discuss this topic further im kidding of course come on everyone weve earned this celebration
professor ive been looking for you
i was hoping we could all share a meal together it could serve as both a victory celebration and a post battle analysis what do you think
a victory celebration
of course after all we fought hard out there such exertion is bound to make anyone hungry for respite dont you agree
im invited
of course why wouldnt you be
come now professor we cant very well celebrate without the key to our victory present
hes right he really is we were only able to win because we had your help professor
yes compared with that boar who knows nothing save frontal attacks your tactics were nearly decent
felix you really ought to stop picking fights with his highness
dont worry ingrid i encourage all to speak freely and i must agree that the professors tactics were truly extraordinary i have much to learn
oh sure but today was exhausting im so hungry i can barely stand 
to be honest so am i lets head to the dining hall together
 
professor im sorry to intrude but you dont look too happy for someone who just won
youre mistaken
you say that but your eyes tell a different story
is that so 
hm well i understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes im sorry for prying
i know we only just met so this may be difficult for you but  id love nothing more than to share our happiness with you joy can be so fleeting after all were all in this together so i hope you will consent im sure the rest of the class feels the very same well come along professor lets enjoy the fruits of our labor
great work teach that was a brilliant win
im glad we won
ive been anticipating that magic moment when your tactics and my schemes entwined and you did not disappoint that composed expression you always sport like a permanent mask is a perfect complement to my ruthless scheme thats a joke of course mostly
everyone did well
huh playing ignorant as to the quality of you command and deflecting the praise to your students you really are a model professor teach
to be honest i had a bunch of other schemes planned as well just in case the situation called for it but i didnt have to resort to any of them i suppose our opponents lucked out
well met professor the breadth of your skill was on full display today i must admit that your tactics were masterful i shudder to think what may have transpired had it been claude leading us into battle
i noticed that too we just did what you told us and we won i love it
as expected from a child of the former captain of the knights thank you for today professor i have much to consider
i never doubted that our professor would be amazing it was way too obvious dont you agree marianne
huh me oh um yes of course well done professor
captain jeralt taught his child well it would have been more of a surprise had our professor proved lacking
dont you think its a bit hard to give jeralt all of the credit leonie in any case its clear that we only won because of our new mentors guidance
a mercenarys wisdom and techniques are forged in battle those are the sorts of things you can only learn through experience right teach but more importantly its time to celebration our victory teach here has yet to try my well renowned home cooking
i really do hope youll join us after all i swiped some finely aged cheese from the dining hall for just this occasion
your work with the students was remarkable i can see jeralt trained you well i do hope you were able to use the occasion to bond with the students
i did
i am so happy to hear it nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still
not really
oh well you have only just met them so i suppose that should come as no surprise
of course the mock battle was mere practice the real fight is the battle of the eagle and lion which will take place during the wyvern moon you are expected to properly train your students so as not to humiliate the academy during the long held tradition that is the coming battle
as for today i have called you here to tell you of your mission for the month ahead your class is to dispose of some bandits causing trouble nearby
my mission
bandits
those affiliated with garreg mach monastery have a moral obligation to help those in need regardless of social standing students are no exception each month before the newly birthed moon departs each house of students must complete their assigned mission you shall work to complete the task at hand alongside your students and report back to the archbishop before the deadline understood i will soon provide you with the necessary details for your first mission if i told you now i expect you would only forget and i despise repeating myself
i can sense something special within your heart  i have high hopes for you
bandits they say 

do you recall when we first met you shall not fall so shamelessly again correct
 
have you no words for me do not tell me that you are shocked to hear from me you ought to know that i am always with you now to hear my voice should not come as a shock
right
i dont understand
whatever shall i do with you i am alive within the confines of your heart i am unknown to all but you but through your eyes and ears i see and hear just listen to your heart as you are doing now and we may speak like this that is all that i know
 
what is this nonsense all i was told was to kill as many noble pipsqueaks as possible no one said anything about the knights of damned seiros being on our trail
you have proven yourself worthless distracted by something so trivial i had hoped you would achieve your goal despite the setback but now a child of the knights former captain is in play how interesting
hey this isnt what i agreed to
hiring a mercenary as a professor what was that woman thinking
are you listening to me how do we finish this
you die
wh  what
underestimating the knights was an amateur mistake one you will pay for the road to eternal torment awaits you all now i must locate your replacements 
wait get back here damn you
/***EOF***/
though most stars will still glimmer in the crisp winter air the blue sea star has gone back into hiding legend states that the goddess prays for peace from her home in the heavens in the town of garreg mach the anniversary of the monasterys completion nears and the peoples prayers intensify ahead of the millennium festival still five years hence
we are planning a grand ball for this month i am sure the students will be most pleased
yes certainly however we must not devote all of our time to frivolity we have a new mission for you we have found evidence of someone sneaking into an unused chapel
a chapel
it is a building that was once a temporary sanctuary at a time when the monastery was under renovation
was something stolen
no there is nothing of value in that building we do not yet know what the intruders objectives are
this month your class is tasked with guarding the chapel and investigating these intruders with the recent state of affairs surrounding the holy church we cannot afford to overlook any abnormality no matter how seemingly trivial
i am ordering a seasoned knight to assist you to ensure the safety of the students in times like these i am afraid we must always expect the worst
thats reassuring
which knight
reporting for duty lady rhea
i thought you two could use the time to bond and to speak of important matters 
appreciate the thought
bear in mind that jeralt has a separate mission of his own he will join you once he has finished it
its true ill be away from the monastery for a while but when i return  ill come and watch you work ill be looking forward to it
tomas  no solon was it not and the flame emperor  it is most clear that something has transpired and it relates to you somehow or is the fault my own and youre just caught inside the wave  sothis the goddess of this world  i bear her name  hmm  how confusing i feel as though my head has turned to mush
everyones in such a festive mood i feel a bit out of my element here i cant help but worry something might happen while were all distracted  after all our enemies are always plotting still this air of levity is much more agreeable than the grim atmosphere of late
it seems the dastards who set remire village aflame have yet to be apprehended monsters trampling mercilessly over innocent lives they deserve a gruesome end 
someone entered the old chapel  i think the townsfolk used it for feasts and such in the past with that whole tomas business you cant blame the church for being on edge
another month full of chaos ive barely had time to catch my breath what is the objective of tomas and his ilk and what makes flayn so special does that not bother you
ah the ball it reminds me of my first such event back in the imperial capital it was held by my father the prime minister i really showed off my dancing skills everyone was quite impressed with me
you know professor i used to think i would be comfortable with all manner of experiments so long as they provided usable results but when i heard of solons work well i realized id not consider the moral and philosophical limits of what all manner of experiments might mean urk  sorry im not great with blood even when im just thinking about it i feel a bit ill now
i cant believe this  im so angry right now first its the death knight and now tomas and neither of them are in custody i cant stand the thought of such evil lurking in the world we have to do something about this i have to do something about this
the ball a grim reminder of my sad reality the other nobles will be fine im sure theyve all been to events like this before but me im a noble and ive never even been close to one of these things
i wonder if remire village will ever be the same again how do you recover from such a terrible event so many dead so much destroyed  i cant see how the whole village doesnt just end up abandoned
our class was also sent to help put the village in order but then 
dancing of f√≥dlan is not the same as dancing of brigid the reason is maybe that the music has many differences in brigid dancing is different for each person our dancing has vigor and ferocity there is no speech of technique for our dancing
even though there is to be a ball we still have a mission it would be nice if this month passed by in peace
argh  too much merriment the librarian betrayed us the death knight is back is this the time to be throwing a ball
last month was  well you know even better than i do i hope this one will be more cheerful this ball though  i dont know its all new to me
great work in remire village professor who would have ever guessed it was tomas ah but no now isnt the time to get lost in gloomy thoughts
oh now where did that ingrid run off to the ball is soon and she hadnt even put on any makeup i was trying to help her out
so tomas the librarian was a bad guy but he always seemed so nice cmon self youre better than this you promised youd be on top of things this month
mercedes locked me in her room for hours earlier  she was slathering pounds of makeup onto my face saying something or other about the ball it really wore me out 
ah the long awaited ball finally an opportunity to showcase my exquisite skills on the dance floor these skills were ingrained in me when i was a boy my hands and feet move on pure instinct
the ball is coming up soon i am so excited i cant wait to fill up on food while everyones dancing i even heard therell be some prime cuts of meat
some scary things have been happening lately i hope that this month of all months is peaceful the ball is coming up and everything  although im not much of a dancer actually
its true that tomas was employed here under the recommendation of house ordelia but thats all i know of the topic id never even seen him prior to enrolling here even when he was supposedly in ordelia territory i never once saw him there im still feeling bothered by all of this but theres not much else i can say about it right now
a ball um i dont think ill partake
its almost time for the ball oooh my am i excited this being a school we dont have many chances to get dressy
im glad the remire village situation got sorted out but its not over yet is it and i cant believe old tomas turned out to be an enemy who can you trust anymore
before the ball it is customary that we host a competition of dance known as the white heron cup the students are quite fond of this tradition each house must select representatives to compete their dance shall be judged by its beauty grace and technique the student who is deemed the winner will be given the opportunity to train as a dancer should they so please it is a very precious thing the gift of dance i hope that you and your students will choose to participate
i have been told that your house won the white heron cup this can only be a result of the students talent and effort not to mention your steadfast instruction
it would appear your house was defeated in the white heron cup with the white heron cup concluded all that is left is to wait for the ball i hope you will find it enjoyable
it has come to my attention that you did not participate in the white heron cup were none of your students skilled in dance with the white heron cup concluded all that is left is to wait for the ball i hope you will find it enjoyable
i have looked into tomas but i just cannot make sense of this at all from his behavior up until now i never would have suspected that a man like him could turn on us i have also discovered that his appearance has changed  it is almost as if he is not even human what in the world is going on
hello professor the ball will soon be upon us ah i can feel my heart fluttering already i  i have never danced in front of people before not even once in all my life i am very much looking forward to it
ah the ball  it reminds me of how i met my wife i was at a villages harvest festival there was a full moon bathing everything in its cool glow she appeared out of nowhere dancing gracefully in the moonlight a lovely fairy
that story sounds fake
hah the full moon was an embellishment i admit but you can forgive a man for waxing poetic cant you anyway 
thats a wonderful story
we soon fell in love and tied the knot now we have a daughter whos as bright and beautiful as a sunny morning so whenever i see people dancing i think of my wife and my heart does a little waltz
the area with the old chapel was supposed to be off limits it was at risk of collapse so they didnt even post guards its not too strange does that surprise you eh garreg mach has lots of places that are blocked off for one reason or another thats true of the underground holy mausoleum as well as the northern woods people call it the sealed forest but as far as i can tell its nothing special just a forest
whats this about the ball knights dont participate its an event for students but it does pique the interest of some knights in particular
alois cant dance but i hear he likes to watch he volunteered to judge the white heron cup not that i care
it cannot be true that our siblings in arms could turn against us however i will continue investigating members of the church to think even someone as senior as tomas would fall under suspicion  i know not how far to take my search
even the knights 
unlike the monks the knights of seiros are lady rheas direct subordinates some are in quite unique circumstances but i cannot think any of them would betray us
even the students 
yes a great many strange and terrible things have come to pass this year  i must not dismiss the possibility that someone among the students is behind it all
garreg mach monastery is said to have been completed during the ethereal moon why 995 years ago as a matter of fact thats rather a long time ago dont you think every year a ball is held to celebrate the founding and every one hundred years a very special celebration takes place its a grand festival involving all of garreg mach it is thrilling to read of past festivals and im rather excited to experience one for myself once in a lifetime eh the next one in five years will make a millennium should be quite an event do you imagine youll still be here teaching then
great just great its that time when all the students get all lovey dovey youre new but you know about the ball yeah i cant bear it young love is wasted on the young they cant appreciate it to its fullest ugh i wish i could fall in love too 
oh speaking of the ball professor have you selected your representative for the dance contest yet if you dont the contest will go on without your house and that would be embarrassing
nah tomas wouldnt betray the church i dont believe it i wont believe it theres some people in the church who hate people like me who are from almyra but tomas was always real kind but if he really was lady rheas enemy  well id defend her against anybody no matter how kind theyd been in the past
hey professor hows it going making lots of coin id love to catch up but im super busy right now working for money you understand
greetings professor nothing to report ah other than the legend of the goddess tower of course have you heard the students talking about it on the last night of the ethereal moon on the same night as the ball  if a man and a woman go to the goddess tower and make a wish its sure to come true i have a wish but i cant find anybody to make it with me 
is there someone i feel that way about
the white heron cup is a competition of skill and grace in dance please encourage your house to participate that said if you are serious about winning be sure to choose your representative carefully
by the way have you chosen our houses representative for the white heron cup if nobody else comes to mind im willing to take up the challenge professor
understood just leave this to me and victory is assured
i see  if you believe theres someone more qualified i certainly wont object
on a lighter note ive heard youve yet to choose a class representative for the white heron cup its not something im interested in but if no one else wants to do it then i will shoulder the burden
how very whimsical of you i suppose ill have to do what i can
wise better to choose someone with more charm
do you see what i am trying to say here do not make me beg you  please choose me as our representative for the white heron cup
wonderful you will have a chance to see the legendary footwork of house aegir
hmph if you really think someone is better suited for it i will not argue
let us change the subject and settle my stomach i assume youve heard about the dance competition have you chosen a representative yet or  oh my you havent have you have you come to tell me im to be it
i see  i can dance in theory but i dare say in practice things may go very differently
i think thats wise i simply cant really be bothe   what i mean to say is i lack the confidence
ugh sorry about that professor im just so frustrated right now i need something to take my mind off things that reminds me if youre looking for a volunteer id be happy to represent our class in the white heron cup im an excellent dancer
great we both know im our classs best chance at winning this thing
you really think you can find a better dancer than me
what is a white heron cup anyway wh what a dance competition thats terrifying w we need a representative for our class please anyone but bernie
youre just trying to humiliate me arent you
oh what a relief thank you so much professor
im sorry professor im talking about such grim and terrible things when we could be talking about the white heron cup its a big dance contest between the classes and i simply adore dancing im quite good at it since i was a diva in an opera company you know
i think my heart just skipped a beat you want me to represent the class im not sure when i last experienced such flattery professor
what why not me oh whatever so long as you remember to chose someone hm
are you choosing me to represent at the white heron cup or are you not
i will display all that i have learned i will grab the victory
i have understanding you believe that i cannot grab the victory i am guessing
i  im sorry please ignore my troubled ramblings was something the matter something to do with the white heron cup professor i beg of you please do not chose me as our house representative i am utterly serious
what curse you professor i will of course accept but know that you have damned us all
oh thank the goddess please be sure to select someone with the confidence to win for us
incidentally i have heard there will be a dance competition prior to the ball have you chosen a representative yet
i will take part if you insist
someone must want to participate you would do well to find that person
ah whatever you look like youre about to say something are you considering me as our representative for the white heron cup heh
i was joking you really couldnt find anyone else
i see thats a relief
but speaking of the ball isnt there something happening just before it the white heron something it sounds like every class needs a representative have you picked ours yet
are you sure you want m me to do this i guess ill just have to do the best i can then
you should pick one of the nobles they all have experience with this sort of thing
the ball is almost here and the white heron cup dance contest so professor who will be representing our class
me uh sure why not ill get out there show off my moves and drive the ladies wild
i get it no worries really id rather see a beautiful person dancing instead of some goof like me
while were on the subject of the ball whats this i hear about a dance competition physical activity isnt my forte but dancing can be fun if theres no one else youd rather select im happy to represent our class
thanks for having faith in me professor ill try my best to win
are you sure please let me know if you change your mind
after all we have the ball to look forward to and the white heron cup before that oh speaking of have you chosen our house representative yet if not id like to volunteer
really thats fantastic ill try as hard as anyones ever tried you can count on it
aw thats too bad but if you reconsider you know where to find me
speaking of i heard that theres going to be a dance competition have you sorted out who will represent our class professor its not me is it please dont say its me 
oh dear  well ill see what i can do then on my honor
thank goodness i dont know the first thing about dancing
considering this recent rash of strange incidents i wonder if having a ball is really the best idea  and then theres the white heron cup sheesh what poor sap are you enlisting to represent our house teach
claude me dont be unreasonable teach ugh  i mean if i have to make a miracle happen i guess ill figure it out 
oh but first the white heron cup who will appear onstage i wonder youre choosing a representative for the dance contest isnt that right choose me im a pro
great now that im in the spotlight ill do anything to win
aww i was really getting excited for it let me know if you change your mind huh
from what i hear the white heron cup will be held just prior to the ball say no more professor i would consider it an honor to represent our class
you will not regret this choice
by all means take your time and think it over but i do assure you there is no candidate better suited to the task than yours truly
apparently theres supposed to be a dance contest too i think its called the white heron cup whos gonna represent our class i can do it if you havent picked someone else
you made the right choice professor everyones gonna think my moves are hilarious
aww really i may not look it but im actually a pretty good dancer
watching other people dance can be fun though ive heard people talking about the white heron cup do you know who will be representing us
me what no please you cant
i think a noble would make for a better choice bound to know their way around a ballroom
right  its the dance this month isnt it i cant see how anyone would be much in the mood for dancing considering  although i suppose the white heron cup does sound pretty fun
uh you want me to be our representative ive certainly got a few moves 
it would probably be more logical to ask someone who likes dancing in the first place so i certainly understand
theres a dance contest as well i see ill cheer for our class of course so um  who will represent our house in the contest
i see well  um im sorry what did you say
im sure whoever represents our class will do a fine job much better than i could do
the ball doesnt matter i dont dance i might show up for the food though not that its got anything to do with me but have you picked someone to represent us for the white heron cup yet
what youre asking a peasant to dance youve got some pretty weird ideas
well someones bound to want to do it im sure weve got a few people with the talent to win too
have you heard yet about the white heron cup if you have yet to choose a representative do you mind terribly if i volunteer
ah thank you professor i am overcome with joy just you wait until my feet touch the ballroom floor
understood ah well either way i am still so excited about the ball
well i suppose we should practice then shall we
how was that i believe ive improved my technique
huh  well lets practice whenever you can spare the time agreed
to think id be rehearsing my dance moves of all things give me some advice professor
a little less grotesque now maybe
all right but if we want to avoid a tragic accident during the contest i will need more practice
professor uh  do you know how to dance i could really use some guidance
you really can do everything i am envious of you if you will pardon my frankness
fair enough you do not think i need guidance you are probably right
professor are you here to practice with me for the dance contest
i dont enjoy a bit of this you know entirely too much standing up and moving around for my taste but if im going to do it i may as well be in it to win
i see  well thats just fine by me theres a book on fishing that id like to finish
hey professor did you want to practice dancing with me
what did you think pretty perfect right
youre probably right i dont need any more practice im a natural
professor will you give me some dancing lessons
was that okay a little reassuring at least maybe
is this your idea of an education clip my wings and toss me off a cliff
hey professor youre here to help me practice for the dance contest
how was that was my dancing everything you hoped for and more i certainly enjoyed it we simply must do it again soon
well i am terribly talented agreed still i think ill practice on my own if youre too busy
i have much to be learned we will now practice the dancing ok
i have much more knowledge of f√≥dlan lance how is my dancing professor
that is not fortunate i will have patience
i am in the thick of battle so battle i must will you help me prepare professor
how was that i perhaps did not offend as much as usual but i do not like our chances
i suppose i must practice diligently while i can on my own away from prying eyes
will you teach me to dance
was that satisfactory
that makes things difficult
here help me practice my dancing you forced me into this so youre going to help me
how did i get roped into this
hmph you irresponsible fiend
ive been practicing as best as i can professor but do you think you could give me a little help
was that all right im completely self taught so i really have no idea
you really want to leave this all up to me
oh professor im glad youre here i need help figuring out this whole dancing thing mind helping me
one and two and three and four  got it im pretty good at this
aw dont be like that professor you chose me  you should help me win
oh professor do you mind watching my dance routine i would appreciate your honest opinion
how was that i hope its good enough to win 
im so sorry i didnt realize you were busy i didnt mean to distract you
professor would you watch me dance really quick ive been practicing a ton
mwahaha well what do you think id say im pretty great wouldnt you
oh do you have really important professor things to do well let me know when you have the time
professor i admit  i have two left feet when it comes to dancing do you have time to give me any pointers
how did i do was i awkward i felt awkward
perhaps some other time then since you chose me ill need your guidance in all this
teach this is all your doing step up and take responsibility youve got to help me practice my dance moves
my legs arent as unwieldy as before i think  if i keep this up i might do not terribly
youre too busy too busy to take responsibility for your actions wow well youd better make time for me before its too late
hey professor care to join me for dance practice
phew i dont think we can possibly lose just you wait and see
what youve got something better to do than watch me practice
rehearsals will not be necessary but if you insist i can give you a small taste of what is to come
well professor are those not the most exquisitely refined moved you have ever witnessed
i assure you dancing is fully ingrained in my being any further practice would be redundant
hey professor you want to teach me some winning dance moves
that looked pretty good right i think i can win this thing
if you think my moves are good enough then i dont need dance lessons
professor can you watch me practice
is this how you do it im feeling a little unsteady 
professor dont abandon me in my time of need whyd you pick me in the first place
professor can you supervise my dance rehearsal if im going to do this i want to win it
well how was i i figure if i dance with passion and fervor ill appear even more mature
youve chosen me but you wont even bother to help me prepare thats rather rude professor
did you need something professor i suppose i should p practice right
no no thats no good i cant seem to get a feel for it 
oh very well
professor come join me for dance practice
im going to have to do this in front of a crowd i can feel myself going pale already
hey youre the one who put me up to this the least you can do is give me a hand
yes do you need me for anything professor i would be happy for some dancing guidance should you have any
thank you so much i am eager to improve my dancing
i see perhaps soon
ladies and gentlemen my sincerest apologies for the wait thank you for gathering here on the eve of the highly anticipated ball to bear witness to  the academy wide dance competition welcome to the white heron cup
the competition will be judged by me your humble servant alois rangeld and also  the acclaimed former songstress of the mittelfrank opera company manuela casagranda
yes yes thank you oh and it should go without saying but i swear to show no bias to my own house got it good
last but not least the glamorous assassin who does all of her dancing in the dead of night shamir nevrand
hmph
the three of us swear on our honor to judge the following proceedings with utmost impartiality and fairness and with that will the representatives of each house please make their way to the stage
contestants are you ready to dance and is the band prepared to play very well  begin
time thats all folks splendid all three of you were fantastic now lets hear what the judges have to say 
oh my lets see i suppose i have no choice but to vote for 
oh my lets see i suppose i have no choice but to vote for 
great feedback both of you well then lets see  factoring my own humble opinion  yes we have a winner and i will announce who it is right now without any delay the winner of this years white heron cup is 
well a victory is a victory
i am not sure the judges are in their right minds 
haha as expected of someone as accomplished as myself
oh well just so long as nothing else is expected from me
i won i won how did i win
bernie are you sure heh heh 
i wonder if i can use this to bolster my singing career 
everywhere dancing is dancing this is the proof
i won there must be some mistake 
is this a joke
nonsense
are you sure this is ok
heh heh heh i knew i had it in me
oh really how lovely
i did it go me
oh um sorry i really didnt see this coming
ah what a burden to be great at everything
perfect wheres the prize there is a prize right
haha as expected
me uh really
cant say i had much confidence going in but this is great
yes it was the logical choice my dancing was superior
oh dear  this is a bit embarrassing
i can dance huh
have i prevailed oh most glorious my practice was not in vain
the ball is tomorrow i have no worthwhile memories of such events yet im still looking forward to this one
as am i in the sense that i look forward to destroying all of the unworthy suitors who will inevitably swarm lady edelgard
i will admit edelgard is adorable however when it comes to elegance on the dance floor i am superior
youre not a bad dancer ferdie but you do have some moves that are hard to watch
you honor me with your kind words i understand that i am sometimes too dazzling to behold directly
im envious of your positive attitude i also know how to dance in theory maybe i should participate as well
not me you wouldnt catch me dancing at a ball any sooner than youd catch a fish swimming through the sky
 you do tend to flop around like a fish on the land after all
wh why would you say that now i feel like a fish on a skillet 
on a skillet  hahaha ahem never mind
speaking of the ball do we get to pick who we dance with i wonder who i should ask 
a bold subject change should lady edelgard wish it i would be honored to 
i will fight with all that i have in me
fighting no thats not really the point 
i will not be as a fish upon the flame
 um  ok 
i have a proposition lets all agree to meet back at the monastery exactly five years from today
like a class reunion thats a great idea
five years from today will be the millennium festival for garreg mach monastery ive heard the magnitude of the festivities will exceed all prior years
ooh how exciting sounds like a great excuse to come visit our dear professor
you will be seeing how much growing i have done you will be pleased professor this idea is good
who knows where each of us will be in five years time or who we will become still i have faith that all of us will gather and celebrate our reunion
thats assuming the professor is still here in five years and not enjoying a cozy early retirement
even if thats the case you will come wont you whether or not youre still teaching here 
of course
i will try
dont forget my teacher even if the millennium festival should be canceled i promise to return here 
this is the only ball of the year and i see why everyone is absurdly excited 
your highness you sound so detached we are all encouraged to enjoy the ball tomorrow
right you are what a burden 
huh i never thought wed see eye to eye but i agree id rather be swinging my blade than wasting my time with some girl at a ball
felix your highness you must be joking right this is our chance to dance with all of the ladies of the academy to our hearts content you wish to throw away the best day of the whole year for sword practice insanity i tell you
im pretty excited about the ball myself its not like we get to do things like this very often
too true ashe in fact im gonna do you a favor and give you a crash course in chatting up girls by tomorrow youll be an expert
actually id much prefer if someone could just teach us how to dance 
dont worry about the dancing part i can teach you that easy
its time for the ball that warrants at least a tiny bit of makeup dont you think ingrid just a smidge
i hmm maybe ill think about it
its settled tomorrow morning well meet up in ingrids room ooh i cant wait
hahaha you know  theres no telling where life will take us after we leave here if only we could find a way to come together again just like this 
a fine notion your highness perhaps five years from now
five years from now ah thats when garreg mach monastery will be holding the millennium festival
by then well be addressing your highness as your majesty instead
thats right i suppose we all know its coming but by then youll be far removed from us
come now you know me better than that my title may change but i wont and it wont just be me you know five years from now youll all have your own stuffy positions to contend with but as i understand it the festivities at the millennium festival will be of a scale far beyond anything weve yet seen  in other words the perfect excuse for us all to return here
ooh a reunion that sounds fun i wouldnt miss it for the world
id love for you to be there as well professor after all youre the heart of the blue lion house
ill be there
ill try
good then its settled of course if something happens and im not able to attend im leaving all of the logistics of organizing this reunion to you professor
you have to attend
its true im sure being a king will keep you busy but its a bit early to be backing out of your own plans dont you think
yes  i suppose youre right im sorry you have my word i will return as well count on it
the time has come for the annual ball but first an eve of merriment ok ill admit it the officers academy isnt as uptight as i thought
ooh i adore such things dancing is the only thing im really good at anyway
theres a feast tomorrow isnt there isnt there ah i cant want a moment longer
dancing singing  im not good at either of those things
so dancing is fun oh and remember you cant dance with the same partner multiple times its tradition that means you have to dance with all of the gentlemen in all of the houses swapping dance partners as you please 
how scandalous i for one plan to simply behold the pure essence of dance
ill um  watch from a distance
you cant just watch marianne if a boy asks you to dance you simply must accept its only polite
you can ask anyone to dance gah whatever should i do
hahaha lucky you ignatz tomorrow if only for a day you may live out your dearest dreams of an exalted existence as for me i am surely to be overwhelmed with the propositions of desperate ladies i will doubtless have little time for partners of my own choosing
which one of you is dreaming now lorenz
everyone listen up to no ones surprise i have a brilliant idea teach youll want in on this too
whats your idea
this may sound impetuous perhaps irresponsible almost certainly impossible but were gonna do it anyway in exactly five years time lets promise to meet again right here at the monastery
a reunion theres usually food at reunions count me in claude
five years from now  will be the monasterys millennium festival celebrating 1000 years since the founding of garreg mach
i hear the millennium festival will be the largest celebration in the monasterys history
oh i get it itll be easier for us to all get back here with the millennium festival as an excuse
how true as the new leader of the alliance i will certainly have the occasion to attend and pay my respects to lady rhea
that almost certainly will not transpire
and you teach i guess its hard to imagine that youll still be teaching here five years from now  but im sure no matter where you end up youll come running at the chance to see your adorable little golden deer again right
i dont know
who knew teach had a heart of ice too bad i can see from a mile away that youre joking how you really feel is written all over your face
probably so
ahem  that was your cue to promise everyone youll return go on set a good example teach if you promise everyone else will too
hahaha im already excited after five years well all be whoever were going to become
please professor invite captain jeralt too i want to show him how well his apprentice turns out
its settled then what do you say claude is it official
the promise is sealed that means were all obligated to keep it five years from today all of us will meet again at the monastery dont forget it teach you and i will meet here again 
running away i understand you hardly had the time to breathe in there it must be hard to be the favorite teacher at the ball poor poor professor
i am not everyones favorite 
was that a joke i find it hard to tell with you just think of all the students begging you to dance
it is difficult
so you do think youre the favorite i might have known
but where is there to run this place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance
ah  i see the goddess tower waits for you 
ah here you are are you waiting for someone
im not waiting for anyone
good i would not wish to interrupt anything
i was waiting for you
 for me well you should have summoned me earlier regardless here i am
has something happened
no nothing in particular in fact thats why i came here this place the goddess tower  it was special to my parents my father attended the officers academy himself a few years after graduating he was crowned emperor one day during a visit to the monastery he snuck into the goddess tower on a nostalgic whim and there she was my mother she had just enrolled in the academy that very year they were instantly drawn to each other love at first sight you could say it was the first time either had truly been in love  or so the story goes
their first love
yes of course as emperor my father had already married for political reasons as the empire demands many heirs he also had numerous other lovers in the end my mother settled for becoming one of his many consorts but i choose to believe there was genuine love between them heh i suppose its a silly story to cling to
its a lovely story
isnt it its a shame that the lovely stories ended after i was born for as long as i can remember my mother had already been exiled from the capital its strange something about you makes me reveal all of the things i so carefully keep concealed
who was your first true love
hmmm for some reason i feel compelled to tell you all of these things i have kept hidden i cant say the name but it was a noble who i met in the kingdom a lifetime ago
anyway  what about you its your turn to reveal some long held secret you can share a story about your past or perhaps tell me about your first love
i have no such stories
youre telling the truth i can tell hm  i wasnt even able to make you blush
please dont ask that of me
you realize that just makes me more curious than ever
sorry 
heh  no im the one who should apologize it wasnt my intention to pry im just intrigued by you and your mysterious past you have supposedly always been a mercenary but i believe there is more to your story than that  lets leave it there for today and return to the ball there must be plenty of students hoping to talk with you and to dance with you i would not wish to prevent you from mingling i cannot keep you all to myself after all
here for a tryst professor i wont interfere i shall take my leave at once farewell
just a moment
yes what is it i assume you are waiting on someone
what do you mean a tryst
you have arranged to meet someone here at the goddess tower have you not
no not at all
i see apologies for the misunderstanding then i take it you are unfamiliar with the rumors about this place
what rumors
there is an old legend that says promises made between lovers here are sure to be fulfilled if you believe in that sort of thing i would have expected you to be familiar with the story already considering how popular you are i was certain that someone had asked you here
i am not that popular
on the contrary i suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try
that is not the case
no need to sound so dejected i suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try
but thanks to their cowardice i am gifted with this opportunity to speak with you its clear you have never felt at ease around me as a result of how little trust there is between us i should get back to the ball regardless i imagine there would be quite a scene if you turned out to be lying
you dont believe me
trust is not in my nature good night
hello professor i just needed a quick break from the festivities fancy running into you here
you followed me didnt you
i beg your pardon absolutely not it is simply a coincidence the heir to the great house of aegir chasing after a woman in the dead of night the very thought of it
what a nice coincidence
yes a coincidence 
anyway seeing you here i cannot help but recall the legend of the goddess tower it is said that when a man and a woman meet here by chance on the night of the ball their paths become one the goddess blesses them and ensures a harmonious union
i heard it differently
oh you heard the legend too how was it different that the goddess is sure to grant any promises made here ah perhaps that is how it goes come to think of it
are you sure thats the legend
indeed that is how it goes or at least that is the version i heard
how long have we known each other now about nine months by my count the passage of time is swift indeed listen i need to tell you something after i graduate i must pass stern judgement on my father his greed got the better of him he has strayed far from the righteous path as the next duke aegir i will succeed him as prime minister and it will fall to me to hold him accountable only then can i justly guide the empires subjects and work to create a better world that is my dream my will and my future i pray that i will have the courage to fulfill my solemn duty and that i will have your support
of course im with you
im always happy to listen
thank you knowing that you are on my side i feel unstoppable well shall we head back plenty of people must be wonder where you went specifically the legions of men who would like to dance with you to be honest i count myself among them
professor youre late
what do you mean
to tell the truth it was an act of sheer hope that i might find you here
we didnt have plans to meet
true but a young man can hope to accidentally bump into someone
oh sorry
my apologies professor it was a bit of a joke ive been waiting here because i thought you might come by
im glad to find i was right i hoped to find you so i might ask  well i would very much like to research your crest
not right now
does that mean you might be interested eventually lets decide the place and time right now then what is that not acceptable
why would i let you do that
because it would be terribly interesting
anyway  have you heard the legend of this place professor its a sentimental one to be sure the story goes that if two people share a vow at the goddess tower theyll be bound together forever hm or was it that theyll be cursed forever one or the other for certain all the same i think its a rather lovely legend
it doesnt sound that lovely to me
tell me more
well i suppose it does depend on your enjoyment of potentially mistranslated myths professor be warned this may seem forward of me  however lets vow that one day i will be allowed to research your crest as much as i please
i think not
excuse me
ive overstepped my bounds again havent i its just that today is such a special day and well i suppose i got caught up in all the excitement how about this instead lets agree to meet here again one day just the two of us
if the opportunity arises
such an opportunity wont just arise we have to make it happen for ourselves i look forward to that day
i agree
i look forward to that day i really do 
hey professor i was looking all over for you what are you doing up here i think this place is supposed to be off limits 
i didnt know
well thats the official rule i dont think anyone follows it though
if its only supposed to be 
heh good point no one follows that rule anyway and i heard no one from the monastery really cares
where did you hear that
huh i cant remember her name it was just some girl who started talking to me last night she was trying to get me to leave the ball tonight and go to the goddess tower with her she wouldnt say what she wanted to do here though said it was a secret or something i told her id be too busy dancing and stuffing my face with food so she left dont know why but she didnt seem too happy about it i guess i was curious though so i came to check it out thats when i saw you walking this way so i followed you in
thats just awful
isnt it she wouldnt explain herself and she got angry
i was referring to you
i cant help but feel sympathetic
i appreciate that but im not really looking for sympathy i just wish she wouldve explained herself before getting all angry
my sympathy was not for you
huh why well its all over now cant change whats in the past
i like your positive attitude
thanks i had a feeling youd get it
maybe you should worry about the past a little
ugh really i just dont like to dwell  but if you say so i could keep it in mind
anyway im going to head back to the ball you coming doesnt look like theres anything too exciting going on here
lets head back
maybe coming to the tower wasnt a total waste of time i got to talk to you at least right
im going to stay
all right dont stay too long though you might catch cold
welp im starting to get hungry again time to fill up on some more food
 ah wh whats that ghost is it a ghost dont eat me
calm down its ok
itll eat the skin right off my bones and no one will ever  huh oh its you professor what a relief
its just your professor
i knew it i said bernie this place is haunted youll just get eaten by the ghost of some dusty old professor or  oh oh its you
you can relax now
right im better now thanks but try not to scare me like that again please  with the ball happening tonight i was sure there wouldnt be anyone here and from far off you look  well you kinda have a spooky silhouette i guess you havent heard the legend
legend
oh so if a couple swears a vow on the night of the ball the goddess grants their wish thats amazing is it true i guess thats the sort of thing you miss when you spend all your time avoiding people but wouldnt it be nice to spend some time alone with a nice guy in this lonely tower cut off from all the rest of the world anyway  oh professor since youre here and all could i ask you for a favor as you probably know by now its my lifelong dream to live in solitude forever  so could you help me to swear that vow
nice try
saw right through me huh
i cant promise that
guess youre right it probably wouldnt work out so well for me would it
ah well no use complaining actually im happy i got to see you here tonight even if it was just by coincidence would you mind staying a little longer its nice and quiet and the skys really pretty i quite like the atmosphere on a night like this being out in the open doesnt seem so bad 
ah professor you showed up
why are you here
um im the one who called you here remember
why do you look so happy
well because youre here of course
you came here because you read the letter i sent you right
not that i recall 
what letter
are you saying this is a coincidence how disappointing to think you didnt come here specifically to see me still if were meeting by complete chance  that has a certain appeal too its as if destiny brought us together and tonight is the night of the ball  lucky me
what are you plotting
plotting thats a bit rude dont you think
i thought you werent comfortable around me 
oh thats just when youre looking through me in front of others when its just us i kind of like it
originally i wanted to see what youd do when you read my letter i just wanted to see if youd come here like i asked i had a feeling that you would though i suppose you didnt even read the letter to begin with  i should just be thankful i wasnt left here waiting all alone forever do you know its been almost nine whole moons since you arrived at garreg mach you must have found a special someone by now havent you professor
i have
ooh who could it be youve made me so curious oh dont worry im not going to pry if you dont want to share your private life is private after all
i have not
uh huh right i bet youre just hiding it theres someone youre sweet on  dont you worry i wont pry if you dont want to share these things are private after all
is that what you wanted to talk about
are you changing the subject dont do that ohh i bet that means you do have someone dont you dont you worry i wont pry if you dont want to share these things are private after all
well i oughta get going  i wouldnt want to be in the way if your special someone shows up either way i do hope youll share a dance with me later
professor what is bringing you here is the ball not enjoyable
i had to escape
escape i thought the ball was for dancing not fighting  oh escape meaning to leave i have understanding
i wanted to see you
but you are seeing me every day why would you be wanting to see me now maybe you and i share a reason for being here 
im lost
lost but this monastery is where our home is  i am not understanding
i have been hearing about a legend about the goddess tower people have a belief that the goddess watches this place on this night if you share a promise the goddess will make that promise become true that makes men and women who are close come to this place on this night i am wanting to see that and so i came to observe with secrecy but no one is here i have much disappointment
i wanted to see that too
someone might arrive still we could go find a hiding spot for both of us we may have to be squished with each other but i will not be worried if you are not
you shouldnt spy on people
yes that has truth i will be thinking about that from now on
oh i have a realization if someone sees us here with each other they will think that we are with each other that is not accepting acceptable for people to misunderstand
that could be a problem
we should be returning to the ball separately
i wouldnt mind
is that ok professor i think we are agreeing on that maybe we should be returning to the ball  with each other
its quiet here isnt it professor that reminds me do you know the legend associated with the goddess tower
ive heard it
is that right you dont strike me as the sort to enjoy stories like that
im not concerned with such things
just as expected
they say that wishes made in this tower will come true i wonder who came up with such a silly notion
you dont believe it
legends are legends nothing more i doubt there are many who really believe that wishes can be granted the goddess just watches over us from above  that is all no matter how hard someone begs to be saved she would never so much as offer her hand and even if she did we lack the means to reach out and grasp it thats how i feel about her in any case  i suppose theres no harm in passing the time with silly legends what do you say professor care to make a wish we are here on the night of the ball why dont you try wishing for something
after you
i cant think of anything so go ahead
a wish of my own  i suppose my wish is for a world in which no one would ever be unjustly taken from us or something along those lines
thats a great wish
ill wish for the same
thank you professor although at a time like this  perhaps it would make more sense for me to wish that well be together forever what do you think
 
  haha well now professor you must admit ive improved in the art of joke telling
thats cruel
it didnt sound like a joke
im sorry  i guess that was rather thoughtless of me   honestly  i do regret saying such a thing please think nothing of it ive blurted out irresponsible things like that to my classmates promises that well see each other again and the like i have no business making such promises for the future there are certain things that i must accomplish even if it means risking my life i may not even have a future to promise to someone
 
we should head back soon its rude of me to keep you all to myself shall we professor
what are you doing here
i could ask you the same
i needed some quiet
i felt similarly
though i elected to attend this ball i did not know what to do with myself once there i do not wish to be a nuisance to his highness or to my classmates thus i have sought solitude i noticed a number of people looking for you however should you not return to the festivities
id like to stay here a bit longer
not just yet
as you wish
 
 
the stars seem brighter here somehow i have heard the goddess of f√≥dlan grants a special blessing at this tower the blessing ensures that any oath sworn between man and woman here shall be fulfilled that is what i have heard we had similar legends in duscur some elements of human culture are universal i suppose is there an oath you would like to swear
not that i can think of
i understand
i swear to work toward peace for f√≥dlan
i am not sure that a full and lasting peace is possible
but while i have this opportunity permit me to swear an oath to you i swear that we will look upon these same stars again when his highness has led us to a more tranquil age
that is a worthy oath
i look forward to it
good there is a chill in the air is there not i am accustomed to cold weather but you should go back indoors
lets go back together
if you wish i suppose the damage to your reputation for being seen with me has already been done
will you share a dance with me
i do not know how to dance if you wish to teach me then i will endeavor to learn
let us return if the cold is too much i will lend you my coat
oh look who it is
what are you doing here
i just wanted some quiet its so loud i needed a little respite
are you waiting for someone
no i just wanted a bit of quiet
besides what are you doing here
i thought i might find you here
huh you must be joking
im here for the same reason as you
ah well i guess it figures
hm have you heard the legend of the goddess tower that if you make a pledge it will be fulfilled childish i know but if it were true  lets make a pledge to the goddess i pledge that someday i will surpass you ill surpass your technique your skill with the sword and your cunning as a warrior then i will make you taste defeat
that seems extreme
thats your pledge to the goddess
what a disappointment if youre looking for a passionate affair youve got the wrong man go find someone else ive spent my life avoiding love and romance theyre distractions blades blood and battle thats what im made of and nothing else if someone saw us however this may look like an amorous meeting youll have to settle for being mistaken as my lover
thats mean
what nonsense
its time i went back to training ill always be more comfortable holding a sword than a womans hand try not to catch a cold up here id hate for such a good sparring partner to be out of commission good bye
professor did you come up here for a rest too
thats right
i guess we think along the same lines i was feeling kind of worn out
actually i was looking for you
for me oh im so sorry to put you out of your way i was just kind of worn out from all of the excitement i am enjoying the ball but its a bit much you know
everyone else seems used to this kind of thing but ive never been to anything like it before my friends did teach me a bit about proper manners and how to dance but i still feel out of place stepping on girls feet messing up the pretty floral decorations  haha ive been a bit of a disaster sometimes i wonder if its even right for someone like me to be in a place like this
i feel that way sometimes too
really you do thats kind of reassuring
you have every right to be here
youre right of course im a student at the officers academy just like everyone else lonato was kind enough to send me here i need to live up to his expectations
by the way have you heard the stories about the goddess tower they say that if a man and a woman make a wish together here the goddess will make it come true
what would you wish for
oh never mind me id like to know what youd wish for
lets make a wish together then
my thoughts exactly do you have anything in particular youd like to wish for
my wish is 
your wish is
for your wish to come true ashe
what my wish w well um let me think
i cant think of anything
well if you cant come up with anything maybe i should think of a wish instead
all right ive got it i wish for my brother and sister back home to be able to live out their lives in peace
thats just like you
thats a lovely wish
this kind of thing is pretty embarrassing huh maybe i should be heading back ill never get better at fancy social events like this if i keep running away from them right i guess i should ask another girl to dance oh but id better make sure i go over the steps again first
you could dance with me
really youd do that wow thatd be great just promise not to laugh if i mess it up ok come on lets head back
evening professor lovely night isnt it just look at those stars  i heard you were headed over to the goddess tower and i got curious about who you might be meeting but here you are all by yourself this isnt a lovers tryst at all heh heh 
tryst
oh yeah the goddess tower is where lovers meet didnt anybody tell you they say that if you exchange vows here they always come true its a sacred place for lovers
why are you here alone
where is your lover
well the person im interested in is already here youre here alone im here alone i was thinking maybe 
wait me
well of course were the only two people here arent we i keep thinking about it and it just makes sense my crest and yours 
thats too much too soon
marry you i cant even trust you
heh ok true true you know ive never regretted any of my past behavior until you turned me down just now i cant be who ive been my whole life i gotta get it together and become a man you can trust i know that sounds like another one of my games but its true ill prove it to you anyway im going to head back to the ball since were both here would you accompany me
ill go back with you
well then my lady i do hope youll give me the honor of a dance it will be good practice for our first dance at our wedding reception heh heh im kidding
im going to stay here for awhile
its chilly out tonight so take care not to catch cold and if you do get cold you know where to find me sorry old habits die hard i guess  ok well im headed inside
anyway  lets get going before you change your mind
why professor i was wondering where you ran off to i searched the entire floor but couldnt find you anywhere tired are we i can tell by that look on your face it must be exhausting being so popular huh
im exhausted 
i can imagine shall we take a break here then say professor have you heard the legend of the goddess tower they say that if two people exchange a vow here the goddess herself will fulfill it
ive never heard that before
well that simply wont do youll fall behind if you cant keep up with your students
i think i recall such a story
ah so even you have heard that one the stories must travel far
many young couples come here in private all thanks to that legend they make promises to stay together forever things like that i actually saw a man invite a lady to join him at the tower while on my way here its rather romantic dont you think
i think so
indeed
i disagree
really youre a strange one professor
though just because two people share a promise that doesnt guarantee theyll be together forever youve noticed many nobles at the academy right they very rarely have the freedom to choose their own partners yet still they wish to stay together maybe thats why they pray to the goddess are you waiting on anyone professor
no theres no one
what a relief i was afraid that i was keeping you
i was waiting for you
oh my even though we didnt make plans to meet youre a charmer arent you
ah i almost forgot why i came looking for you i was wondering if youd like to dance with me its just so loud in the reception hall though i think id rather stay here with you  if thats all right with you professor thank you i appreciate it
professor im happy to see you here everybodys been asking about you youre really popular with the students
i had to escape
im worn out
oh really huh uh actually ive been trying to find you too but if youre not interested in dancing thats ok we are supposed to be at a ball thought  if youre not going to dance tonight when and where will you get another chance
here
now
wait really there isnt any music  but this is too special to pass up maybe i could sing a little something i may not look like it but im a practiced singer though people do tend to think my lyrics are a little odd ‚ô™ fry the food it tastes so good  it fills up our hungry tummies  ‚ô™
now im hungry
what an interesting song
its about this yummy stew one of the monks taught me to make a while back oh i know ill make it for you it really is just about the tastiest thing in the world um  if im bothering you please tell me now and ill leave you alone
 
say professor  did you know that if you make a wish here at the goddess tower it will for sure come true thats why people usually meet up with someone they like here for a rendezvous and they make a wish that theyll stay together forever so  uh i thought you might be waiting for a girl here and that im messing it up
ive never heard about that tradition
nothing of the sort
hehe thats just what id expect you to say but since were already here lets go ahead and made a wish together
what kind of wish
sure
ive already decided what it will be dearest goddess  i wish for the professor and i to always be the best of friends hows that sound can we wish for that
id be happy to
really that makes me so happy
its a little embarrassing 
oh no actually when i said it aloud i could tell it was an embarrassing wish  oops
well id better be going now and you should think about returning to the ball too but make sure you save me a dance
whew i cant manage one more bite so full  so full
oh professor what do you think youre doing here i came here to stuff my fa i mean to have some me time
i sort of followed you 
you mean you saw that just now all the food everything ugh so embarrassing  maybe theres a nearby rock i can crawl under
no reason really
oh so were just running into one another by chance then phew if you had followed me here id be a little bothered and probably embarrassed
were you waiting for someone
who me no no of course not i was just about to walk off all that food i just ate really i came here to have some privacy but youre here now so i suppose that makes it a bit less private
are you worried people may get the wrong idea
i suppose theres that possibility now that you mention it
just the two of us 
uh well yes i suppose its just us here 
does that concern you too professor im happy to return to the reception hall
its not terribly concerning really
of course nothing to see here im happy to keep walking off this food in that case ah the stars certainly are beautiful tonight hm its peaceful looking up at them together dont you think maybe we can do it again sometime
id love to come along
if we return from here together i worry that people would start unsavory rumors about us i dont concern myself with gossip but id hate for it to mar your reputation in any way are you certain fair enough lets head back then
oh hey teach what brings you to the goddess tower you know what never mind the answer is as clear as day you couldnt bear the ball anymore and simply had to escape
i wouldnt say that 
i just needed a break
theres nothing wrong with admitting youre not comfortable in a noisy crowd really i get it im the same way
i dont believe it
ha see right through me do you but i really do mean it parties arent for me music and fun are all well and good but those dances the nobles do are something else i was never really taught to do that sort of thing my upbringing was lacking in certain ways
even though youre from a noble family
even though youre heir to the alliance
even so i may have secured a fancy new title but who i am on the inside  well status alone cant change that thats a bit of an aside though say teach  have you heard the legends about this tower they say if a man and a woman pray for the same thing here on this night the goddess will grant their wish without fail
why tonight
who knows maybe it has something to do with celebrating the anniversary of the monasterys completion maybe the goddess comes down from above on this night and this night alone to celebrate with us even goddesses like to party right the truth is that its just a legend the students here like to tell its not based on any real facts but i suppose it would be a waste to pass up a chance of having our wish granted what do you say teach care to try
what would we pray for
hm  lets see  how about we pray for our ambitions to come true you dont exactly seem like the selfish type but even you must have an ambition or two
i do
i do not
more of a hope 
thats what i thought its the same for everyone
even if youre not aware of it im sure theres something your heart of hearts wishes for
thats what i thought its the same for everyone
no one is ever completely satisfied everyone has something they long for otherwise whats the point of it all of course same goes for me without even realizing it i found myself holding tight to some pretty big ambitions if you would  i would love for you to share in those ambitions with me teach
but all that aside lets get started lets pray to the goddess before she tuckers out for the evening ok  here goes oh divine goddess hear our prayers we beseech you and your radiance please grant us that which we seek
huh i think that should do it the goddessll make our dreams come true now yeah
i wonder
at any rate weve done all we can whether we actually believe our dreams will come true or not is up to us
i suppose we should head back soon im sure everyone is looking for you just promise to spare a dance for me ok teach i swear so long as its not one of those goofy noble dances i am a treasure on the dance floor
ah there you are professor i didnt see you at the ball i was wondering where youd slipped off to everyone is waiting for you shouldnt you be heading back
momentarily
no id like to stay here
well theres no need to hurry the ball will continue a while longer was the noise becoming too much it must be difficult if you are unaccustomed to high society i say that but im actually the same after a while of excitement i yearn for peace and quiet
did someone turn you down
professor rude just what do you think of me there are definitely students in there making the most of things flirting as if their very lives depended on it but for a catch such as myself every day is an opportunity theres no need to appear desperate still its unexpected that the two of us would be here together isnt it
why is that
do you not know the legend of this place the goddess is said to grant a special kind of blessing unique to the day of this ball it is said that on this day she will honor any vow sworn between man and woman here at this tower its a famous legend amongst the students which may be why i expected to find more of them here
so you came here to spy on people
of course not i would never stoop to such despicable behavior honestly i forgot all about the legend until now im not interested in that sort of foolishness though i suppose it couldnt hurt to test it even if it is only a legend what do you say professor shall we swear some sort of vow together something that will benefit the both of us what dream should we promise to make a reality
peace for all
happiness for the two of us
thats very fitting i will remember that we made this vow here today well i should head back lest by my absence the festivities lose their luster
 omm  mmm  mmm  huh whos there
p professor is the ball over already what uh  what are you doing here
just taking a break
ah a break sure sure thats uh  thats what im doing too
i heard a strange noise
strange noise no need to worry ill uh  ill look into it for you
huh i suddenly have the energy to dance maybe ill head back to the ball
what were you eating
ah you noticed it was just some meat it was a much nicer cut than im used to we all got one helping but some people didnt want theirs can you believe it i hate to see good food go to waste im sorry professor
you should be
you need to follow the rules
youre right i know  oh by the way i heard something on my way here i heard that if two people make a wish together in this tower on this night the goddess will grant it
two people
i dont know the specifics just that you cant do it alone there has to be two of you since were both here now lets make a wish together what should we wish for more delicious cuts of meat
no then how about bigger muscles
what else is there to wish for hm me becoming a proper knight but thats just for me not you 
we can wish for that
we can professor thats so generous of you
now that we wished for it im sure ill become a proper knight
lets wish for peace in f√≥dlan
peace in f√≥dlan thats a good wish too
i really hope our wish comes true
 
gah is that you goddess professor ah im sorry i thought you were the goddess
thats ridiculous
youre right youre right imagine if she just appeared out of nowhere do you know of that old legend professor
old legend
yes its said that if a man and a woman make a vow tonight at the goddess tower  she will appear before them and bless them ensuring that vows fulfillment
ridiculous
i know but can you imagine if she just appeared out of nowhere still  maybe even if we cant see her we can sense her presence i envision the goddess as the most beautiful creature in the world  more beautiful than any landscape any artwork utterly beyond compare thats what i think anyway or perhaps what i hope since i first heard that legend ive wanted to try it and perhaps meet the goddess
but if the legends true 
yes i know what youre getting at she would never appear before a single person frankly i didnt know any girls well enough to invite them here so i was hoping a couple would come along and i could sneak a peek  wait that came out wrong i take that back i have absolutely no intention of peeking
shall we make a vow
what you and me i suppose we do fit the criteria but are you certain you would want to do that
in that case lets try it what should our vow be please pick whatever sounds best to you
peace for f√≥dlan
of course might be a little ambitious but lets give it a try
happiness for all
of course might be a little ambitious but lets give it a try
may you live your life honestly
oh oh i see yes thats a wonderful vow
now let us pray
 
did you feel that i think the goddess is near
still ridiculous
youre right of course
professor
yes
i saw you wandering off to this tower i thought you might be lost or something so i followed you inside
actually im a ghost
dont toy with me like that professor i know its you i figured you might be lost or something so i followed you inside
everyone seems to be looking for you youre surprisingly popular
that surprises you does it
i do find it surprising yes particularly your popularity with the ladies
naturally
despite your confidence im still surprised by your popularity with the ladies
it isnt like youre very sociable after all not to be rude mind you
how do you fare in such matters
er i wouldnt know to be honest i have no interest in such things the academy is for honing ones skills not for frivolous romances despite what the other students may think i overheard them gossiping about a place where a man and a woman can make a vow and it is certain it will come to pass seems to be some folktale they enjoy i wonder where this place is 
the goddess tower
oh of course i recall now its  wait thats  thats here isnt it uh just to be clear this is pure coincidence i didnt follow you for for that but we are here alone so people may wonder what our aim is lets get out of here before someone sees us and gets the wrong idea
theres no need for panic
are you saying you dont mind if someone sees us and thinks  oh i suppose you believe theres no danger of that since its just me youre treating me like a child arent you well i dont mind either then obviously theres nothing going on here if youre going stick to around until we collect dust then so will i
 
actually im gonna go now dont you stay too long either youll catch your death of cold out here
please be patient ill be done with my prayer in a moment  dear goddess i beg thee  oh professor
is someone else here
no  im the only one here umm  well more accurately im the only human present my bird friend is here as well
youre talking to a bird
no well its more like the bird is doing me a favor they say if a man and a woman pray here on this night their wish will come true at least thats how the legend goes
and the bird
its a pigeon a male pigeon at least i think so i thought he might count as a man
 
 
well id better be leaving it seems my pigeon friend got impatient and flew away
im sorry 
no its fine the goddess probably wouldnt accept a male pigeon anyway
ill take his place
oh um are you saying youll pray with me professor
 
thank you if you have a wish for the future lets pray for it ok
what is your wish
who me oh nothing in particular lets pray for your wish there must be something you want well
peace in f√≥dlan
very well let us pray
only to see you smile
hey no need to tease me 
professor i must be going now but im glad i ran into you
professor youre not waiting for anyone right thought so i bet youve never heard the legend about this tower then
i havent 
what legend
something special happens here during the ethereal moon on the night of the ball first an unmarried boy and girl need to meet at the goddess tower and make a vow then the goddess will grant them divine protection and ensure that their vow comes true or so they say its a well known story among the students a couple guys invited me up here but 
you turned them down
yes i did
they stood you up
no how rude i turned them down
if i accepted their invitations then our vow would come true its just a legend sure but i prefer to be cautious about such things one of the guys was pretty handsome and he came from a good family  but that doesnt really tell you what a persons like on the inside i want a life partner whos good hearted and good looking anyway i went for a walk and happened upon you and i thought  the professors perfect why dont i just make a vow with him hah im just kidding professor to be honest i wanted to spy on you see if you had someone else up here although if you did want to make a vow with me i wouldnt object need some time to consider
yes lets revisit this tomorrow morning
hang on it wont mean anything tomorrow oh i get it everyones looking for you down there girls included you dont want to keep them waiting youre pretty smooth you know that well im off then ill see you at the ball ah  did the goddess hear that conversation
hey professor you all alone here i mean youre not waiting for anyone or anything are you
actually im meeting the archbishop
liar i saw lady rhea just moments ago she was in the reception hall
manuela should be here any moment
yeah right i just passed her flirting with some guy on my way up
anyway i saw you heading to the tower so i thought id drop by i figured you might be lonely
you figured that did you
hey dont make it weird by the way  have you heard the legend about this place they say if a guy and a girl make a promise here together the goddess will make sure its kept
ive heard
its a pretty well known legend
i had not heard that
really its a pretty well known legend
thing is the way the story goes it doesnt work all the time it has to be the night of the ball tonight so since its just you and me here what do you say we give it a go i mean i dont know if the goddess will really take the time for a pair like us but its worth a try
what are you suggesting
well you know lets make some kind of promise weve got the chance itd be a shame to waste it i mean not something romantic or anything thatd be weird we could promise ill become a top tier mercenary though i guess thats more of a wish  lets see  ok ive got it i solemnly swear to meet you once more on this very ground as a mercenary beyond compare oh but that was all about me no fair you probably have something you want to promise too
no i think that covers it
hah you really do take after captain jeralt always putting others first all right then goddess you heard the promise its a done deal say professor why did you come out here anyway
i just wanted some time alone
ah well it is pretty crowded down there i guess i shouldnt have interrupted ill leave you to it but dont stay out here too long all right youll catch a cold
professor is that you over there it seems both of us were curious about this place
what are you talking about
oh perhaps i was mistaken i figured you had come to this tower after having heard the legend
what legend
youve not heard of it then i suppose i only recently learned of it myself from a friend legend tells that on the night of a ball when a man and woman pledge vows at this very tower  the goddess will bestow her blessing ensuring those vows come to pass of course such things do not really come to pass but there are many who place stock in this legend i wondered what sort of vows youths tend to pledge  so here i am hoping to gain deeper understanding only to bump into you are you meeting someone here perchance
no im not
thats unfortunate i wonder if anyone else will be coming  professor if the legend were true what type of vow might you pledge
its hard to say 
no ideas perhaps your imagination is lacking due to the lack of a partner what say you to being my partner how about sharing a vow with me ill give you until the count of three to come up with something heartfelt and honorable one two three go ahead
may we always be together
may we both find joy
oh you made my heart flutter i see this is the type of vow one would make to another youve taught me well as a professor should im most certainly wiser and more mature than i was even just moments ago oh dear what if the goddess really did hear your vow although i suppose i would not mind if that turned out to be the case i bid you good evening
running away i understand you hardly had the time to breathe in there it must be hard to be the favourite teacher at the ball poor poor professor
i am not everyones favorite 
was that a joke i find it hard to tell with you just think of all the students begging you to dance
it is difficult
so you do think youre the favorite i might have known
professor what are you doing here
arent you going to dance with edelgard
no i should think not
arent you going to dance with claude
haha good one professor i could see saving a dance for edelgard but claude is another story in any case i have no intention of dancing with anyone
as a child edelgard taught me how to dance it was a bit awkward honestly
edelgard
as a child
ive told you before were siblings by marriage havent i her birth mother was my stepmother although i didnt know that at the time my stepmother treated me with such kindness just as though i were her own flesh and blood and yet she never so much as hinted that she had her own child edelgard we were born and raised in different territories without ever knowing the other even existed yet against all odds for just over a year we became childhood friends
friends
not siblings
indeed unaware of each others stations or backgrounds we met and became incredibly close this was when she and lord arundel were living in the kingdom
why were they in the kingdom
they were in exile  this was a time of great turmoil within the empire i ran into her when visiting lord arundels residence with my father she seemed quite bored with everything at first i found her to be difficult and stubborn but that facade quickly fell away revealing her true self beneath  thats around the time when she taught me how to dance her instruction was  oh lets call it strict to put it nicely
wrong foot dimitri youre supposed to lead with your right
el the suns going down i really oughta be heading home 
that one year before she had to return to the empire was so much fun the time of my life in many ways
its kind of pathetic to think about it all these years later but can you guess what i gave her as a parting gift
flowers
a book
no that makes too much sense actually i gave her a dagger you should have seen the look on her face
a dagger
huh good guess professor but i swear it came from the heart
in faerghus weve long considered blades as tools of destiny as a way to cut a path to a better future she was being dragged all over unable to live the life she wanted i thought the dagger could help her cut out a path to the future she dreamed of however that was many years ago im sure shes forgotten all about the boy i was back then
im afraid its far too late for that things are different now shes different im different  anyway  im feeling a bit out of place here festivities like this dont suit me
professor  will you join me for a bit you must be getting a bit tired of the ball by now
but where is there to run this place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance
it seems that everyone is having a delightful time will you not dance some more
im tired
id rather not
how dull of you had i a body of my own  oh i would sing and dance until i fell upon the ground but you  hmph do as you will
ah youre not the only one who feels that way look over there
 
hmph im bored beyond compare will you not follow her
why would i
i have no reason to
oh come on hurry up i know that you are curious to see what she is up to  i hear someone singing from other there 
 ‚ô™ in times flow see the glow of flames ever burning bright  on the swift rivers drift broken memories alight  ‚ô™
that song  i feel i have heard it in the past  actually  it is not that i have heard it i  did i once sing that song to someone no theres more i wrote this song  oh but how could that be so if that were true then how could she be singing it unless  no no i am suddenly so exhausted  as are you no doubt quickly then to bed with you
captain captain where are you hey professor have you seen your old man
too bad i guess it will have to be you then 
im back sorry for the delay my last mission took longer than expected
captain thank goodness youre here there are reports of demonic beasts near the chapel
nonsense i havent heard anything about the monasterys walls being breached
thats why im heading there now to see whats really going on youll join as well wont you
of course were both sworn to protect this place
where did they come from
demonic beasts
its odd just before they appeared someone saw a number of students heading toward the chapel they were apparently acting strange as though they werent in their right minds shortly after demonic beasts started to appear one after the other
are the students safe
were the students killed
hm  the students  theres no way those demonic beasts got in from the outside  but none of that matters right now we need to act go summon your students
damn it  i wanted to talk to you about something important but theres no time theres never any damn time but this is much more urgent so it can hold for now ill meet you there
things take a turn for the worse as you and jeralt investigate an abandoned chapel in garreg mach
there really are demonic beasts here  theyre emerging from the chapel ill head that way the rest of you protect the students who werent able to get away
help me these beasts  theyre 
argh somebody help me
that beast  theres a stone or something on its forehead 
 
do you really think you can keep going dont push yourself too hard thinking about what happened in remire village its clear youve gotten the hang of being a leader maybe you should have taken command of me too
 
the demonic beasts were actually students how can this be 
thank you but my friends who couldnt get away  are they ok
i was so scared  ill find a way to repay you i promise
sorry that was a close one 
phew  you saved me thank you
there isnt a trace of evidence to be found in the chapel this must have been something to do with remire perhaps 
wait
huh another student
run along now
thanks for all your help sir
youre just a pathetic old man how dare you get in the way of my brilliant plan you dog
run along now
thanks for all your help sir
huh what are you doing here
you must survive merely because there is a role that i require you to fulfill
sorry it looks like im going to have to leave you now
to think that the first time i saw you cry your tears would be for me its sad and yet im happy for it thank you kid
so this is where your father lived  hm are you still crying if turning back the hands of time was not enough to save his life you must accept what came to pass was fate
it wasnt fate
control yourself though jeralts death was at the hands of wicked ones a fate is still a fate
our enemies will pay
agreed we cannot let the wicked ones run free
oh your father said to look for something here he must be referring to whatever is behind that bookcase there 
your fathers diary  huh his handwriting is prettier than his face would suggest well well these entries here are from before your birth he seems to have been writing this for quite some time hm ah  read that part there horsebow moon year 1159 
day 20 of the horsebow moon all is cloudy i cant believe shes dead lady rhea said she died during childbirth but is that the truth and still the child she traded her life for doesnt make a sound didnt even cry at birth
well now that baby must be you that means  hm someone is approaching us
there you are lady rhea is looking for you professor and after your audience why dont you join me at the dining hall you havent eaten since since it happened have you
 
forgive me  i suppose its too soon to try and coax you back into the normal swing of things as for what happened to jeralt  im so sorry im sorry i couldnt do anything to stop it stay here until youve found some peace ill cover for you with lady rhea and everyone else
thank you
well be waiting for you whenever youre ready to return to us
if only
no need to put on a brave face no one would blame you for taking time for yourself
i dont believe its a sign of strength to just keep going forward no matter what taking the time to grieve for those weve lost theres strength in that too thats what i think anyway that said  its also important to remember that no matter how sad you are eventually your tears will dry up thats when you have to figure out what it is youre living for then you can cling to that with all your might and start moving forward again
what im living for
four years ago in duscur i experienced the same pain youre feeling now my father was the strongest man i knew someone i loved and admired deeply that day he was killed before my eyes his head severed clean off my stepmother the kindest person i had ever known left me behind and disappeared into the infernal flames
everyone who i considered precious my family and my closest friends i couldnt save any of them not a single one now the burden of the work they left behind falls on me i must ensure they have no regrets thats my duty as the sole survivor of the tragedy its a heavy burden but accepting it gave me the strength to pick myself up off the ground and start moving again start living again
jeralt is gone  so what will you do now professor what must you do look deep in your heart and im certain youll find the answer there indelible and inescapable
ive probably bothered you enough for today but i have just one more thought to leave you with even now seteth is gathering the knights to begin a full scale search for the enemy it may not be right away but before long they will find their trail
no matter what happens or what anyone may say know that i plan to stand by you professor through anything until the bitter end
well did you search deep within yourself as he suggested and did you find yourself some answers this book is filled with secrets yet unknown we must return another time to read the rest oh but i have at least figured one thing out i know now why our fates are intertwined 
ah  here you are to think that captain  that jeralt would meet his end like that i hope you know that you were the most important thing in the world to him
i was
what do you want
he wasnt the most emotional guy im sure expressing his affection wouldnt have come naturally to him after whats happened its up to me now i alois swear to protect you in the captains stead  sorry this isnt the time for my blathering lady rhea is looking for you i came to tell you that ill take my leave now
this book is filled with secrets yet unknown we must return another time to read the rest oh but i have at least figured one thing out i know now why our fates are intertwined 
professor i have been waiting for you i am filled with grief at the loss of our most celebrated knight jeralt was an ally of many years and also a dear friend
many years
when did you meet
it was a long while back at the time jeralt was a soldier of the kingdom he was injured in battle and i saved him just as he was about to perish that was our first meeting after that he became a knight of seiros he gave his all to the service of the church
why did he leave the knights
but it had been so long since you last saw him 
he fell in love with one of the nuns here at garreg mach their love produced a child whom she died giving birth to it was her decision she weighed her own life against that of her childs and in the end implored me to save the child your father never truly accepted that decision he took the child took you and disappeared without warning
who was my mother
did i inherit my crest from my mother
your mother she was my 
sorry for the interruption lady rhea theres something you must hear immediately a report from the knights patrolling the area 
very well professor you are dismissed for the day please rest and focus only on mending your heart understood
/***EOF***/
huh
lady seiros
tell me nemesis do you recall the red canyon
youll die for that die die you took everything  that i loved
hes gone now mother 
oh my what could have brought you here
i wonder how you got in here  it is most rude to interrupt a moment of repose very rude indeed now come to me i wish to have a look at you
hmm  i have not seen the likes of you before who are you anyway
im a ghost
do not deceive you would do well to keep your wit in line
im a demon
do not deceive you would do well to keep your wit in line
im a mortal
i see then you must have a name of sorts go on
huh i shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names you must possess a day of birth as well beneath which moon and on what day were you born to this world
well wonders never cease it seems we share our day of birth how strange hmm it all feels so familiar i think it may be time for yet another nap  it is almost time to begin 
hey time to wake up
were you having that dream again
i was dreaming about a war 
massive armies clashing on a vast field right there hasnt been a battle like that in over three centuries 
i was dreaming about a young girl 
youve described her to me before i dont think ive ever met anyone like that
in any case just put that out of your mind for now the battlefield is no place for idle thoughts risking your life is part of the job for mercenaries like us letting your mind wander is a sure way to get yourself killed
ok time to get moving our next job is in the kingdom i told you before its far from here so well need to leave at dawn
oh right 
of course
hm good grief everyone is already waiting for us outside
jeralt sir sorry to barge in but your presence is needed
whats happened
please forgive our intrusion we wouldnt bother you were the situation not dire
what do a bunch of kids like you want at this hour
were being pursued by a group of bandits i can only hope that you will be so kind as to lend your support
bandits here
its true they attacked us while we were at rest in our camp
weve been separated from our companions and were outnumbered theyre after our lives not to mention our gold
im impressed youre staying so calm considering the situation i  wait that uniform 
bandits spotted just outside the village damn  there are a lot of them
i guess they followed you all the way here we cant abandon this village now come on lets move hope youre ready
lets take care of those thieves before they overrun the village take down the enemies in front first that should take the wind out of their sails
you have a strange aura about you  you say youre a mercenary so show me what you can do
thank you we are in your debt it wouldnt do for us to fall in a place like this please lend us your strength lets work together to drive out these thieves
its because of you guys that im not dead right now thanks for that i didnt expect to run into mercenaries like you in some remote village the gods of fortune must be smiling on me
well advance while protecting ourselves from the enemy take up position inside the forest
yes good if were in the forest we can sustain their attacks without losing the advantage
this is a fine opportunity use the combat arts i taught you
attack when an ally is nearby and the enemy will be intimidated making them easier to hit
damn why are there mercenaries in the village guess well have to deal with them too
im gonna kill you where you stand 
what the arent you jeralt the blade breaker whats a renowned mercenary like you doing here
im the one who should be complaining im caught up in the mess you started
hey you with the blank stare outta my way
youll die
honestly what are you accomplishing with that little stunt its like youre trying to get me killed you fool
well its fine after all if you dont know the value of your own life youre not going to protect it very well are you course not  well then i guess its up to me to guide you from now on right you can call me sothis but im also known as ‚Äúthe beginning‚Äù
hmm  sothis  yes that is it my name is sothis and i am also called the beginning but who once called me that
what are you talking about
sothis
i was not able to recall my name until just now and just like that it came to me how odd that look upon your face  did you think me a child a mere child who forgot her own name phooey that ‚Äúchild‚Äù just saved your life and what does that make you
i am no child
ha such arrogance you look the part but are you truly an adult
im less than a child
correct you understand
you threw yourself before an axe to save just one young girl yet all is well as i have stalled the flow of time for now you would have died had i not intervened
thank you
there now is gratitude so much to ask i did deem you worth saving after all
you stopped time
hm i do not hear your gratitude perhaps i should force you to leave  there now is gratitude so much to ask i did deem you worth saving after all
though it is only momentary time has stopped however did i manage that 
what will happen when time resumes
what now
when time begins again the axe will tear into your flesh and you will surely meet your end how rude of you to drag me into this now what to do 
turn back the hands of time
of course i must turn back the hands of time
keep time frozen until im safe
that is ridiculous oh but perhaps  of course i must turn back the hands of time
ill just stay here and wait to die
as though i could stand idly by and watch that come to pass oh but perhaps  of course i must turn back the hands of time
yes  i do believe it can be done you really are quite troublesome i cannot wind back time too far but all is well you are aware of whats to come which means you can protect yourself this time now go  yes you who bears the flames within drift through the flow of time to find the answers that you seek 
huh
youll die
hey over here
hey  did you just 
the knights of seiros are here well cut you down for terrorizing our students hey the thieves are running away go after them the students seem to be unharmed and whos this
ugh  why him
an unexpected reunion
captain jeralt it is you goodness its been ages dont you recognize me its alois your old right hand man well thats how i always thought of myself anyway it must have been 20 years ago that you went missing without a trace i always knew you were still alive
you havent changed a bit alois just as loud as ever and drop that ‚Äúcaptain‚Äù nonsense im not your captain anymore these days im just a wandering mercenary one who has work to do good bye old friend
right  good bye captain wait that isnt how this ends i insist that you return to the monastery with me
garreg mach monastery  i suppose this was inevitable
and how about you kid are you the captains child
he is a stranger to me
great sense of humor this one clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain
im a bandit
great sense of humor this one clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain
that is correct
is that so well physical differences aside your mannerisms do remind me of the captain
id love for you to see the monastery too you will join me wont you
whats troubling you captain you arent about to run off again are you
even i wouldnt dare run from the knights of seiros
the knights of seiros  they do seem rather skilled
ah it seems your presence is required get going
i appreciate your help back there your skill is beyond question youre clearly an experienced mercenary and your father that would be jeralt the blade breaker former captain of the knights of seiros oft praised as the strongest knight to ever live have i missed anything
the knights of seiros
you havent heard of the knights of seiros the most famous order of knights in all of f√≥dlan
i didnt know he was a captain
how curious id wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed
hey you are coming with us to the monastery right of course you are id love to bend your ear as we travel oh i should mention that the three of us are students of the officers academy at garreg mach monastery we were doing some training exercises when those bandits attacked i definitely got the worst of it
that would be because you ran off
too true i was the first to make a strategic retreat everything would have worked out if these two hadnt followed me and ruined everything because of them every single one of those bandits chased after us utterly ridiculous
ah so thats what you were thinking claude and here i thought you were acting as a decoy for the sake of us all
his intentions were as clear as day you will prove a lacking ruler if you cannot see the truth behind a persons words
hm you will prove a lacking ruler if you look for deceit behind every word and fail to trust those whom you rely on
oh joy a royal debate between their highnesses i wonder how being completely predictable affects ones ability to wield power personally as the embodiment of distrust id say your little exchange smacks of naivet√©
me na√Øve tell me are you actually incapable of keeping quiet or is your lack of self awareness a condition of some sort
in any case forgive our digression i must speak with you if you can spare a moment the way you held your ground against the bandits leader was captivating you never lost control of the situation it showed me i still have much to learn
your skill is precisely why i must ask you to consider lending your services to the empire i might as well tell you now i am no mere student i am also the adrestian empires 
halt edelgard please allow me to finish my own proposition the holy kingdom of faerghus is in dire need of exceptional individuals such as yourself please do consider returning to the kingdom with me
whoa there you two sure are hasty trying to recruit someone you just met tactless really i was personally planning to develop a deep and lasting friendship on our journey back to the monastery before begging for favors but it seems theres no time for niceties in this world so capable stranger lets get right to it where does your allegiance lie
hmm it seems ones place of birth is quite significant to them yet they are so impressed by you that you may take your pick well
adrestian empire land of ancient history
a wise choice though the empire has fallen from its former glory the other regions are merely offshoots that pale in comparison
holy kingdom of faerghus land of noble knights
understood faerghus is a noble and distinguished kingdom that has always valued chivalry
leicester alliance burgeoning league of nobles
is that right well thats a win for the alliance so i suppose im obligated to be happy
all right thats enough with the small talk its time to head back to the monastery
looks like well have to pick this up another time
my my they are in such a hurry you know  each of the three is most unique
edelgard 
dimitri 
claude 
yes i thought the same i am so sleepy once again  i may be sleeping but i 
/***EOF***/
as cold air begins to creep in from the north of faerghus f√≥dlan welcomes the riches of fall the women spend their days reaping the golden fields gratefully embracing the bounty the goddess has once again provided the men venture into the wild with horsebows and empty sacks ready to be filled with game
as i believe you are already aware seteths younger sister flayn has gone missing at present all we know for certain is that she has not left garreg mach
flayn is not the type of person to just wander off on her own without telling me where she is going we have searched the monastery thoroughly but have found nothing i am now mobilizing the knights to begin searching the town troubling rumors have been running rampant lately i do not wish to consider the worst but 
troubling rumors
what is it youre afraid of
there are rumors of someone prowling the streets and attacking innocents night after night the knights have investigated the matter they have not discovered any remains nor have they found any concrete evidence
the people are panicked they all insist someone called the death knight is coming to claim their souls with his blade there is no way she could have escaped unscathed if she were captured by such a fiend where is she
seteth recall that impatience begets error please do your best to calm yourself i think of your sister as family as well you know that you have my support we will devote ourselves fully mind body and soul to recovering her  professor your mission for this month is to help find flayn the knights have the town covered so i ask that you focus your efforts on searching the monastery again we do not have time to waste you have your orders
flayn has gone missing most unsettling
it doesnt seem likely that shes simply gotten lost ill help in any way that i can
so our mission this month is to find her well then let us hurry and locate her before anyone else
i hope flayn is ok what would happen if  just what would we do if 
you cant think like that bern seteth would have a heart attack if he heard you
ive heard that she has a crest but i suppose for this moment that is irrelevant
well start by gathering information someone must have seen flayn recently
right if we work together im certain well find her
flayn has disappeared seteth must be beside himself
so finding little flayn is our mission for this moon leave it to me professor chasing after girls is my specialty
sylvain  even you must agree that now isnt the time for jokes
i hope flayn is ok ive heard rumors about some death knight running around town 
sounds intriguing i had been hoping to cross blades with him
felix please consider how seteth must be feeling right now
in any case we must start our search at once every moment matters on your order professor lets try to collect as much information as we can
what flayn is missing
so finding flayn is our mission for the month i take it
wait whos flayn
seteths little sister surely youve seen her flitting about the monastery
she is the girl who looks about the same age as me but seems well beyond her years
seteth is much older than flayn hes always looking out for her he must be worried sick if i were to go missing i cant imagine what that would do to my brother
when searching for someone its best to start by gathering information hopefully someone has seen flayn
im on the lookout for suspicious individuals the only place ive yet to check is the library
well go together
as you wish
get some rest
as you wish after i check the library
candlelight  and who is that
is it flayn
is it the death knight
no it isnt impossible 
professor dedue what are you up to at this hour
your highness my apologies
oh none necessary im sorry for startling you i was just doing some research but im just about finished i didnt realize how late it had gotten wed better head back to our quarters dedue until tomorrow professor
a most unusual man whatever could he have been looking for so late at night hm that book is quite askew  he must have rushed to put it back upon the shelf
 
it seems to be a record of donations from nobility arundel  thats not a name i know but look at that this arundel gave quite a sum each year  that is until the year 1174 he must have died or fallen to financial woe hmm  i cant imagine what this has to do with flayn
oh my  just one small girl whos gone astray has caused all this we cannot let this stand you must do all you can to find out wheres shes gone now ask around to see what information you can find come now no time to waste
we must begin our search for flayn professor if she ran off on her own free will thats her business but that may not be the case for her sake i suggest we assume that she was abducted and begin an investigation who benefits from kidnapping her lets gather all the information we can on anyone whos been acting strangely
manuela ran off with jeritzas mask hmm  well have to speak with both of them but where could manuela be jertiza is likely at the training grounds or in his quarters on the eastern side of the knights hall
flayn is missing  we should split up and search for her there isnt a moment to waste we must find her before its too late
when i consider how seteth must be feeling my heart breaks we must find flayn as soon as possible there are no signs of her having left the monastery but we cannot safely rule out any possibility just yet im wasting precious time standing about trying to think of a solution ill survey the monastery and see what information i can gather there must be someone who has a clue as to flayns whereabouts
what professor manuela ran off with professor jeritzas mask i have a bad feeling about this  we must find them both at once professor jeritza will be at the training grounds or his quarters i believe the latter can be found on the eastern side of the knights hall
i have thoroughly surveyed the entire monastery and yet i have not found a single trace of evidence that suggests flayn was abducted perhaps we must seek out personal recounts rather than physical evidence  in any case we must hurry before something terrible happens
no sign of her leaving the monastery eh that is assuming we can actually trust that information 
oh but im sure this space has no shortage of secret passages and hiding spots
true for now theres not much we can do aside from making a thorough search of the monastery
lets ask around and see what we turn up you never know who might have seen something
professor manuela ran off with professor jeritzas mask what could that possibly mean
well thats suspicious sounds like we should try talking to them
professor jeritza is almost certainly in the training grounds or his quarters where was that again oh over on the eastern side of the knights hall
flayns gone missing where could she be if it were an ordinary kidnapping youd think thered be a demand for ransom or something by now i dont like the sound of this 
if flayn has been taken hostage then we know she is alive at least for now there would be no point to abducting her if simple murder was the objective thats only logical professor
a beautiful delicate maiden vanishing into thin air  it is like something out of a book if it were a book we would have no need to worry she would be rescued presently by a dashing nobleman do you have any idea as to where she might be where she might have wandered off to
perhaps she went looking for treats
that is what i thought why i am here in fact but she is nowhere to be seen
to the greenhouse for some flowers
hmm the greenhouse i did not think of that i will take a look around there later
flayn no i havent seen her shes been abducted oh youre looking for her sorry my mind was somewhere else i just recently learned she has a crest did you know that professor if it was a particularly rare crest i could imagine professor hanneman would have quite an intense interest in her oh no im not accusing professor hanneman of abducting flayn
i dont know if she ran off or got kidnapped or what i just know that flayns in trouble thats it i cant keep sitting around i gotta go find her now where do i start
uh flayns not in here ugh i guess i have to let you in to prove it dont i
there see no ones in bernies room but bernie maybe flayn just wanted to be alone for a while have you considered that come to think of it where is her room anyway
hey professor have you seen manuela i saw her running off somewhere in a terrible hurry i wonder if it has anything to do with flayns disappearance do you know professor
youre on first name terms with professor manuela
oh yes didnt you know she was the senior diva in our opera company
flayn was childnapped that is what you are thinking and the villain is inside our monastery hmm i must have admittance one person has been catching my eye shamir is a knight not like other knights her movements are being reminders of no they remind me of warriors of brigid before she was here what was she getting up to 
ive heard the monastery is full of secret passages if there is no sign of flayns departure its possible that she used one of those whatever has happened i hope she is all right
ah youre looking for flayns kidnapper i cant say anything for sure but i do have suspicions about jeritza theres something about how hes handling his blade lately it seems more impulsive than usual it couldnt hurt to try speaking with him at least at this hour i think youll find him sparring with catherine at the training grounds
i heard something like this happened last year too neither the culprit nor the missing student were ever found last time some people say it was the work of evil spirits
maybe it was
d dont say things like that professor im sure the culprit is you know corporeal well catch whoever it is
then it could be the same culprit
i thought the same could there be a connection
ow ingrid just about slapped the teeth out of my head all i did was suggest that flayn had eloped 
quite an insensitive joke
insensitive i was just exploring possibilities
is that a possibility
i dont know i was just suggesting things then suddenly i was seeing stars and ingrid was yelling at me
do you really think flayn was kidnapped
she must have been
i have a feeling youre right we really need to find her and quickly
there must be another explanation
do you think she ran off on her own that doesnt put me any more at ease
there have been a lot of rumors swirling around lately about a death knight who kidnaps people from the nearby town  you dont think flayn was you know do you
we cant rule it out
i dont believe so
whether the rumors are true or not i just hope our flayn is safe 
to think that flayn would disappear like this  seteth must be worried sick i havent got much to go off of and perhaps its out of line for me to feel so uncomfortable  but something has been bothering me for a while about gilbert i feel as though ive met him somewhere before  i also noticed him staring intently at annette once hmm 
if flayn were taken hostage i expect we would have received demands from the culprit by now perhaps this is not a kidnapping at all do you suppose she could have simply run away
thats possible
if that is the case it is unlikely that we will find her anywhere in the monastery
i dont think so
what could it be then what possible motive could there be to abduct her
i hope flayn isnt going hungry if someone really kidnapped her ill never forgive them now that i think about it i saw alois hanging out by the pond not too long ago he was always getting into trouble for trying to talk to flayn you know its probably a crazy thought but im starting to worry
ive only ever spoken to flayn a handful of times she always seemed so naive about the ways of the world im worried about her
you think shed be easily deceived
yes im afraid so i just hope she comes home safe
do you have feelings for flayn
wh what makes you say that this is hardly the time for teasing you know
reflecting on it now flayn has always seemed a rather odd person she appears young yet theres something about her that seems much older than her years suggest and shes quite wise but also surprisingly naive 
maybe shes lived a very sheltered life
hmm you might be right whatever the case seteth seems to care for her more than anything
maybe shes actually a ghost
a ghost dont be absurd
dear goddess hear my prayer  please watch over flayn  please protect her 
i bet flayn ran away she couldnt stand being held back by seteth any longer i can emphasize i know what its like to have an overbearing big brother
where could flayn have gone do you think shes really been kidnapped i hear tomas has been going around asking about her  but hes probably just worried like the rest of us though it wasnt just flayn he was asking about you and captain jeralt too
professor have you still not found any leads regarding flayns whereabouts i have looked everywhere not even the knights on guard have seen anything of note
youre searching too
i too care for flayn she is like family to me
we will find her together
yes let us work together it reassures me to have you by my side
may the goddess protect dear flayn until she returns to us 
 
i will find her i swear it
that is all i ask please lend me your aid
try not to worry
you ask the impossible oh flayn 
she would have never left the monastery of her own volition why is there not a trace of her to be found
hey there professor did you want to talk  what me abduct flayn you cant really believe i did that
did you find anything in the pond
well this may sound silly but  i was too scared to even look i couldnt bear the thought of finding her in its depths
i hear she was always yelling at you 
oh thats just because of my dumb jokes she says that theyre not very good but if i went around kidnapping everyone who said that the whole monastery would be empty
did you hear about flayn its just one thing after another this year i swear some of the lower ranked knights are searching for her in the town if they find anything ill know  what jeritza hm come to think of it i havent seen him today what would make you suspect him
that mask he wears is suspicious
i heard that he goes out every night
i see well ill let the knights know
what brings you here im taking a break  is this about flayn you find me suspicious hah
youre not from f√≥dlan
true your point being
what did you do before coming to the monastery
i was somewhere else fighting is that a problem
i understand that i dont fit in among the knights of seiros  but that hardly links me to flayns disappearance
working hard arent you ill admit im impressed i can assist with any tasks or help with your students
on it im available anytime im not on a mission with the knights
miss flayns whereabouts are unknown i pray she is safe  we do not seem to have any leads at present  i am one of the suspects am i well hopefully i can lay your suspicions to rest do you know of my lets call it unique situation
your true identity
do you mean annette
i was once a knight in service to the faerghus royal family if ingrid believes she saw me before it was likely in fhirdiad the kingdom capital annette is  she is my  but no i would appreciate it professor if you would ask no more
because of flayns disappearance all of the knights are searching nonstop but we havent found a single lead seteths face is getting paler by the minute its hard to watch  whats that youre looking for manuela well i did pass by her earlier she was carrying something a mask of some sort 
jeritzas mask
im not close to the guy so i cant say for sure but come to think of it you could be right
flayns mask
are you feeling all right when have you ever seen flayn wearing a mask
young flayns disappearance is most troubling  what who would suspect me you know what ill tell you who a fool thats who
is her crest rare enough to justify kidnapping her
flayns crest the major crest of cethleann is rare but there are others who possess it
you have already investigated her thoroughly
alas seteth would never allow that however while flayns major crest of cethleann is rare there are other who possess it
is something the matter i see so flayn has gone missing i will do what i can to support the search  hm it seems that you are a bit suspicious of me might i ask your reasons
why were you asking about flayn
i was away from the monastery for a few years but do not forget  i have spent more than four decades in total working here at garreg mach monastery yet it was not until recently that i learned that seteth has a sister
why were you asking about my father
it has been two decades since i last knew jeralt yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him
it is only natural to be curious dont you think i assure you there is nothing more to it than that
i cant believe flayn just disappeared i dont like it one little bit oh are you here to see someone alois and shamir and all the knights are gonna head into town soon
greetings professor today there is quite a bit to report there is a masked individual who has been going into town every evening and not returning until the following morning you see nothing gets past this guard i doubt it has anything to do with flayns disappearance but  well better safe than sorry i always say
professor i saw him a knight wielding a gigantic scythe he was just like the rumors say all covered in jet black armor it was the death knight i just know it you dont think he has something to do with flayns disappearance do you
i can only imagine how worried seteth must be but isnt mobilizing the entire order of knights a bit excessive i was originally assigned to investigate those reports of the death knight in the town near garreg mach when i think how many more victims that dastard might claim while were all busy searching for flayn  im sorry  that was insensitive were all under a lot of stress right now its important that we find her quickly
ive served here at garreg mach in some capacity or another for several decades now but after all that time even i cant claim to know everything about the layout searching the entire interior of the monastery is a more difficult task than you may think it makes you wonder who designed such a titanic compound there are fragments of records remaining from its original construction but none of them name an actual architect 
this might be the first time ive ever seen seteth look so worn down if poor flayn was lured away by anyone  i personally think the clear suspect is that miscreant from duscur those people are deceptive by nature 
the whole monastery has been turned upside down i wonder if were still going to have the battle of the eagle and lion next month its a yearly tradition but with things the way they are right now its hard to imagine at any rate i hope they find flayn soon
it seems flayn is still missing what could have happened to her
everyone hurry i heard a scream from professor jeritzas room
jeritza  ah the combat professor with the mask he has always been rather suspicious we must hurry
professor jeritza are you there
he does not seem to be here  hm on the ground professor manuela
is she injured
is she dead
no shes unconscious someone clearly attacked her
look at her hand it looks as though she is pointing at something  there
theres an opening behind that shelf perhaps a secret passageway 
what is the meaning of  wait is that manuela what happened here
we know as much as you do she needs to be taken to the infirmary
yes of course and quickly give me a hand child
understood ill support her head professor ill be back shortly please be careful
does this mean professor jeritza did it could he also have kidnapped flayn
we should start by investigating this passageway do you agree professor
lets investigate
agreed the culprit could be hiding inside
we should call for the knights
we dont have time for that it would be on us if the culprit escaped
that settles it well take the offensive here we come you monsters
shall we professor
we still dont know where flayn is  but we cant give up not until shes found
professor your highness i just heard a scream in professor jeritzas quarters
jeritza  ah the combat professor with the mask he has always been rather suspicious we must hurry
isnt that  professor manuela
professor manuela please wake up professor manuela
is she injured
shes still breathing but she needs medical attention immediately
is she dead
no i believe shes just unconscious but this wound requires immediate attention
look do you see professor manuelas hand its like shes pointing at something 
i see it behind that shelf could it be a secret passage
what is the meaning of  wait is that manuela what happened here we must take her to the infirmary immediately you dont just stand there help me carry her
of course ill return shortly professor
do you think this is related to flayns disappearance
what should we do professor
lets investigate
it looks dark uh dark in there
aw youve always been scared of dark places havent you annie but dont worry the professor and i will protect you
we should call for the knights
youre right we should call for help
but the culprit could flee while we wait sh shouldnt we take a look
there are sounds coming from within if were going to investigate now is the time
well be ok im sure of it are you ready professor
theres still no sign of flayn  what should we do teach ill admit im out of schemes here
professor claude somethings very wrong please hurry to professor jeritzas room
knock knock is anybody whoa professor manuela
i heard a scream coming from here just moments ago it must have been professor manuela
is she injured
shes unconscious she was clearly attacked by someone
is she dead
no i believe shes just unconscious it looks like she was attacked by someone
hey it kind of looks like professor manuela is pointing at something
so we follow where shes pointing and  oh what do we have here theres a rather suspicious hole behind that shelf
what is the meaning of  wait is that manuela what happened here we must take her to the infirmary immediately you dont just stand there help me carry her
right right hold down the fort for me teach ill be back once we get professor manuela taken care of
what could have happened here and where is professor jeritza
this must be related to that girls disappearance what if shes being held captive down there no no thats crazy  right
lets investigate
right  its scary but  ok
dont be a coward ignatz well be fine as long as we stick close to the professor
we should call for the knights
but what if something bad happens while were searching for the knights
you mean like a captured girl being strangled or something
ah youre right what should we do
weve got to investigate lead the way professor
the culprit may be hiding inside so lets be extra cautious
i never would have imagined  hm i see someone theyre unconscious
is it flayn
yes and there is someone else too it appears to be another student
is it jeritza
no professor its two young girls
someones coming i recognize that scythe and mask  its that jerk we fought at the holy mausoleum
what is this place its so bah i see someone i think theyre unconscious
is it flayn
yes i see flayn but who is this other person
is it jeritza
are you blind theyre obviously female and there are two of them
professor someones coming from farther in that scythe  is that the knight who attacked the holy mausoleum
its way too creepy down here and it smells funny and bah a person theyre unconscious
is it flayn
yes its flayn oh but theres someone else too 
is it jeritza
look closer professor there are two girls
someone is coming that scythe  could it be the knight we fought at the holy mausoleum
that sword you must be  one of us will die the other will live i will enjoy this dance of damnation
the monastery is shocked to learn that seteths younger sister flayn has gone missing after an exhaustive search for clues you finally come upon a lead 
our objective is to recover flayn let us hope we are not too late
hmm something odd about the floor over there what will happen if we step on it
contraptions in the floor stay alert
interesting apparatus i wonder if we can operate it
so you have come ill make sure you never leave
that knight looks like death itself we must rescue flayn immediately
theres something strange about the flooring at the end of the corridor something might happen if you step there
some kind of contraption has been activated
what is this device it appears operational
professor we need to defeat the death knight and then rescue flayn
hm look at that strange tile over there i bet something will happen if you step on it
whoa look at those weird contraptions on the floor
i wonder what that is looks like you can use it but who knows whatll happen
i have no need of you 
now you will die together  how joyous 
you should withdraw from here
i dont take orders from you 
kill them
halt youre having a bit too much fun
you are getting in the way of my game
hmph youll have more opportunities to play soon your work here is done
understood i will go 
we will cross paths again i am the flame emperor  it is i who will reforge the world
flame emperor rather worrisome that he sounds intent on showing up again
are they both ok we should get them out of here
the enemys withdrawn lets carry them up
flame emperor and the death knight i have to say they both looked very dangerous
where did they go it doesnt matter we need to get these two out of here
bring them up
flame emperor eh seemed quite frightened of us if you ask me haha
hes gone we should get these two out of here
lets get out of this horrible place cmon we can carry them up
theyre pale and their pulse are slow  still i dont believe their lives are in danger
you found flayn where
you missed the most important part of the mission we found her within that secret passage the culprits were the death knight and what was his name ah the flame emperor sadly they got away
all that matters is flayns safety right professor
right
i wanted to catch them
it is unfortunate if only you could have waited for me to return 
we will take these two to the infirmary professor please inform seteth
whatever the circumstance im glad flayn is safe though im curious to find out who that other girl is  huh professor is that a smile
heh you look happy i dont think ive ever seen you like this before anyhow we should hurry to seteth he must be beside himself by now
thank goodness those girls are pale as ghosts but at least theyre alive but that death knight person feels so familiar
you found flayn thank goodness
she was unconscious at the end of that secret passage we found the culprit too but he got away
no use dwelling on it
we almost had him
im just grateful that everyone is safe thats what matters most id like to hear what transpired but first we need to get these ladies to the infirmary
 understood well go at once
 im im sorry professor im so relieved i suddenly felt weak i couldnt be happier with how things turned out and i imagine no one will be more overjoyed than seteth hm hey professor can you make that expression one more time
like this
i dont think ive ever seen your face like that
no
i dont think i can 
heh i apologize ive forgotten myself and come dangerously close to teasing you its just ive never seen you look so happy before its downright mesmerizing ah but this isnt the time for idle chitchat we must hurry and share the good news with seteth
theyre both alive  thank goodness
you actually found flayn nice work
it is a shame you could not be there claude i would have liked for you to witness our mortal struggle against the death knight
he got away
we could not defeat him
hey at least we managed to rescue flayn and complete our mission thats what counts right right excellent work everyone now then lets get these limp ladies to the infirmary shall we
no problem i can carry them both at once
be gentle with them raphael let us carry each one individually and slowly
you know teach seeing you smile sure makes me feel better you look happy for a change hm do you really not know well truth is ive never seen you smile before now at times it made me wonder whether you were even human but i suppose that was just my imagination running wild anyhow weve probably kept seteth waiting about as long as he can stand lets hurry up and tell him the great news
professor  please allow me to express my eternal gratitude once more flayn is safe and sound and i have you to thank for that mere words could never express how thankful i am i i am indebted to you
i couldnt have done it without the students
yes of course i shall express my gratitude to the students as well
im just happy shes safe
yes indeed i i too am overjoyed
but why was flayn taken to begin with
her kidnapper was the masked knight who vanished during the rite of rebirth the one known as the death knight considering the circumstances it seems plausible to assume that his true identity is jeritza and we cannot forget about the mysterious flame emperor  his true motives are yet unclear however i have an idea i believe the enemy may have been after flayns blood the blood that flows through her veins is special it is extremely rare and extremely dangerous if enemies who know the secret of flayns blood have appeared our only option is to leave the monastery and go into hiding
brother wait
flayn what are you doing here you should be resting
i do not like the path of your thoughts i do not wish to live in some lonely remote location where i never get to see anyone not ever again
if we stay here you may be targeted again wouldnt it be better for the two of us to live in peace
even if we ran off to some new secret location there is no guarantee that they would not find us that is why i believe it would be safest to stay in the monastery where we are surrounded by capable knights and professors
i see your point i do however 
you know it is the only reasonable option what if i were to join the professors class
that is a great idea
you think so too i am so very pleased to hear that with a professor like you nearby i shall be safe no matter what foe should appear
why would you do that
because with a professor like you nearby i shall be safe no matter what foe should appear
i see i am afraid you have a good point professor  due to my position i have closely scrutinized everything about you after all that has happened i must admit that you are indeed a trusted ally so what say you can i entrust you with flayns safety
it would be my pleasure
i suppose i have no choice
i am so glad that flayn is safe yet i cant help but wonder what the story is about the other girl she wore the uniform of the academy but who is she
well done professor i see that i was right to ask your class for assistance i have been told that manuela and flayn are recovering nicely as is monica
is monica a student here
who is monica
monica the girl you rescued along with flayn is also a student at the officers academy however 
she is a student from last years class she went missing just before she would have graduated it never occurred to us that something might have happened to her at the monastery we assumed she had run away i never dreamed that we would find her not like this
monica has asked to rejoin the black eagle house once she has fully recovered our enemies are still out there so we must remain cautious and continue our investigation however we must also help the students to move on from this incident
after all the battle of the eagle and lion will be held in gronder field next month
yes the students will remember it for the rest of their lives please guide them so they may show us their best at the coming battle
so youll be going to gronder field next month youve never been there before have you there is unease in the western side of the empire but everything east of the capital enbarr is stable well there was a noble rebellion a short while ago but it didnt amount to much
what will you do next month
i have my own mission the church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them
will you come to the battle of the eagle and lion
sorry but ive got my own mission and its far from gronder field the church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them
what im more concerned about is finding out who among us is pulling the strings ever since the rite of rebirth strange groups have been seen around garreg mach and elsewhere too there was also an incident where some knights investigating these suspicious strangers turned up dead not that its likely but if something like that ever happens to me  search this room every corner behind every shelf im going to leave something for you
dont say things like that
dont get me wrong i have no intention of dying i know it would be too much to ask you to cheer up but can you at least drop the serious   well ill be was that a smile just now
i promise
dont just nod solemnly theres nothing to worry about im just being cautious then again i guess youre always solemn
/***EOF***/
together the people of f√≥dlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends they recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike but each person must still walk their chosen path alone with each day the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky a silent reminder perhaps of some inescapable truth 
unforgivable i cannot believe that the adrestian empire would embark on such a violent course of action
the fault is my own i failed to see the wickedness within edelgards heart
is she wicked
she plotted with ill meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the holy tomb if that is not wicked what is
what is her objective
there is no question on that front she clearly wishes to conquer all of f√≥dlan and in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions she plotted with ill meaning strangers and defiled the holy tomb
or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know perhaps she is planning to make herself a false deity by demonizing the church of seiros 
adrestia received its very name through a divine oracle to injure the goddess is a sin most foul that shall not be forgiven nor forgotten we must stop the empire and quickly
i have returned rhea
welcome back shamir were you able to discern the empires movements
their main troops are marching towards garreg mach it is said that they will join forces with edelgards army and arrive within two weeks
two weeks that is not enough time it will require all of our efforts just to prepare our defenses before then we must send notice to all surrounding villages at once we must order the residents of garreg mach to flee for their lives
it will be done
 professor listen closely if our enemy invades the monastery i will have no choice but to stand upon the battlefield if something happens to me i am entrusting my sacred duties to you
why me
sacred duties
you must have guessed it by now the truth of who you are or perhaps i should say your lost memories are surely beginning to return i have acted all these long years as a mere proxy for you but the duty is yours and yours alone only you can lead the people of f√≥dlan
 rhea please you must tell me all that you know i beg of you
 
that one is the progenitor god am i correct
in a sense our dear professor is a vessel one who carries the power of the progenitor god within in time the vessel will become one with the power contained within and the progenitor god shall return to this world
i see i trust that you are aware of the questionable nature of this experiment but i suppose there is no turning back 
i ask that you help our friend and in doing so help her i am waiting and hoping for the moment when our creator rules this wayward land once more
i am sorry but i cannot do this i am not certain it is just 
i see that is a shame
i understand as ever i will take you at your word
lady rhea brother i will do my part as well
flayn were you eavesdropping regardless i am glad to hear it you owe your life to the professor after all and in the end they may prove to be our brethren
you have my gratitude seteth and you as well flayn as followers of the progenitor god it is up to us to see our mission through
  ill have that girls head just you wait 
the empire is moving quickly edelgard must have been preparing for this for a while now if you really think about it she must have been planning for this even before you got the sword of the creator  of course she was always a step ahead of us we were blinded by the ball and the battle of the eagle and lion and everything else 
half of the empires six great noble families have declared their support for edelgard of the other three lord vestra was assassinated hubert his son will succeed him bernadettas father count varley is under house arrest his wife is now supporting edelgard and my father he was stripped of his role as prime minister as as result house aegir has lost all of its power all of its land we have lost everything i i  what do i do
the most important nobles in the empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor my father included i didnt think it possible that the imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily however it seems that both my father and caspars are supporting edelgard  having both the minister of domestic affairs and minister of military affairs on your side gives you total control over the empires military and finances they must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing 
i dont normally have a problem jumping into a fight but it feels strange going up against my father we arent especially close but hes not an opponent id want to face id almost rather fight a monster i hope hes not part of the group coming to attack garreg mach 
what does war with edelgard mean for us professor and why does she even want that
i dont know
yeah i guess wed have to ask her
she seems to think force is the only way
i wonder why shed think that 
thats how it always goes i guess you never realize something cant be undone until youve done it
edelgard became emperor and raised an army huh who knew the kid had it in her i mean yeah of course i knew shed be emperor eventually but  the more i think about it the more surprised i am i wonder whos going to win 
us or her you mean
but would it really be ok for edelgard to win
we will not lose
thinking about it makes me scared were up against the entire imperial army still i know someone as smart as you will figure something out 
i am owing big debts to duke gerth of the empire he is the minister of affairs that are foreign he is a friend of edelgard he is to her side what should i be doing
i have had the arrival of a letter from edelgard she is asking that i join her side she is making the decision no she is deciding if brigid is a friend or an enemy of the empire but my choice is not to be friends my choice is to fight with you brigid is not a friend of the empire we will not be following again we will be ready to fight with you instead
his highness calls for the head of edelgard for me that is cause enough to fight
that is against the teachings of the goddess
perhaps but it is too late to stop him now
youre truly all right with that
the hatred of his highness is also my hatred any other feelings i may have are irrelevant
and if edelgard was responsible in any way for the tragedy of duscur that is something i cannot ignore if that is the case then she is my enemy
you saw it too didnt you the boars true nature hes hidden his desire for revenge pretty well but now its stirred up well regardless that girls starting an all out war isnt she but an enemy is an enemy no matter who they are dont let compassion for her get in your way
once the imperial army reaches the monastery well have no choice but to fight 
whats going to happen to us
everything will be all right
i believe you with the knights on our side and especially with you professor i know we can do this
i cant say for sure
oh well well just have to try our best
things must be pretty crazy in faerghus about now my father must be beside himself i dont get it why did edelgard make enemies with the nobles
i have no idea
me either  of course even if we did get it what do we do about it
for the sake of her ideals
ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them those must be some lofty ideals to say the least
i hope this all gets sorted out quickly and safely im worried about my father
i guess we have no choice but to fight have we oh but why would edelgard do something like this im sure well be all right though professor the goddess will keep us safe
ive known his highness since i was a child but ive never seen that side of him before he seemed like a completely different person than the one i know 
the empires aggression cannot stand but if we are going to attack them now we must be honest with ourselves about our chances of success it goes without saying that i will fight the imperial army with everything i have for as long as i am able but house gloucesters territory is adjacent to imperial lands let us proceed with caution
i hear the alliances territory will be in danger if we dont get rid of these empire guys if the alliance is in danger that means my sisters in danger too theres no way im gonna allow that it doesnt matter how many guys they throw at us ill beat em all these muscles arent just for show but first i gotta get some food
you know professor im glad that i came to the officers academy i feel accepted here ive learned so much honestly im surprised at how much ive grown so i will not let the academy be destroyed its important to me and i will protect it
i feel the same
i feel braver just hearing you say that professor
dont do anything rash
ill try to keep a clear head but there wont be any turning back for me i dont want to have regrets
were gonna win this professor
so edelgard the one who calls herself the flame emperor was connected to those strange beings the imperial army might be using even more terrifying methods than we know you had better be cautious professor any amount of carelessness might prove to be our undoing
can we really defeat someone who is willing to turn their back on the world just to uphold their own beliefs ive spent my whole life running in fear and now i 
we can win this together
surely we can win if we rely on each other right professor
we cant win if you run
youre right its time to stop running ill fight with everything ive got
youll battle edelgard right good luck me oh im going to run away i have zero interest in dying here thank you very much
at times like this i just feel so anxious you know but youll watch out for me there right professor
what is edelgard even trying to achieve she wants to destroy the church so badly that shell take on anyone who doesnt fall in line i dont get it
her ideals are in conflict with yours
its a hard thing to accept
i just cant believe shed start a war over it not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way could captain jeralts death have also been a part of her plan dont you go and die on me professor captain jeralt would never forgive you
how are you professor any new changes to report with the imperial army drawing near it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did  thankfully you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side please try to listen carefully for her voice 
i will try
i cant hear a thing
please do not say such sad things i am certain you will hear her in time
may the goddesss voice reach you 
we must protect garreg mach defiling the holy tomb was a sacrilege i will not allow such a thing to happen again the archbishop has already given you a new responsibility i want you to rise to that honor
professor  war is breaking out again is it not
again
there was a truly terrible war once upon a time
i want to stop it if i can
an honorable notion do you think there is something to be done whatever shall we do
i never wanted another war  all we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead
well perhaps its pointless to get upset about the past my duty now is to prepare for battle were depending on your strength professor crush our enemies
ill try
im depending on you
captain i hope youre watching we will protect garreg mach
ugh if i could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self now it turns out edelgard is the flame emperor and the new adrestian emperor and shes striking out against the monastery with the full force of the imperial army behind her we gotta beat her at her own game for our sake as well as lady rheas 
were falling behind i dont know that we can keep up with the new emperor to think that she was able to raise an army of that size right under our noses  however hard we fight i give us a 50 percent chance of winning the enemy has too many advantages we must make careful preparations
there are always small power struggles still  it has been hundreds of years since all of f√≥dlan was consumed by war i didnt actually think it would come to this  i feel as though im not in my rightful place i cannot protect the things i should  professor if i survive this war i wish to return to my homeland  to the land of my king
the holy tomb held many crest stones this is the first time ive heard of crest stones being hidden away in such a place  but more importantly im interested to know the empires aim why would their army desire crest stones there is power there yes and yet  i must think on this the crest stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding conand tower and the chapel as well  and of course the crest stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into demonic beasts  could that possibly be their aim the empires army may well plan to use crest stones to create demonic beasts
the mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was edelgard wow doesnt make much sense though does it there would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess  eh im gonna stop i dont really have the head for this political stuff mostly im worried about my old opera company i wonder whats happening in the capital right now i hope theyre safe 
its my job to protect lady rhea ive gotta do it and i gotta do it as best i can and if that means i gotta die for her then i will ugh how could edelgard treat lady rhea like shes the bad guy shes never been anything but nice to everybody i just dont get it at all 
i cant believe the empire raised an army  even i couldnt have guessed it war is profitable but dangerous i really dont like seeing people i care about out there mixed up in all this
greetings professor something to report unexpected isnt it apparently this is the first time garreg mach has been invaded in its whole 995 year history its my job to protect this gate so even if enemies come in droves i will never let them through i hope we both survive  lets battle with all our might and pray we win this thing
listen up everyone the imperial army is upon us if you can fight pick up a weapon everyone else hurry up and evacuate we have the goddesss protection on our side we have nothing to fear victory will be ours
professor are you ready
almost
well hurry up i dont need to tell you that the situation is dire we have some support troops from the local nobles but the army were facing is immense no matter how you look at it were at a disadvantage to make matters worse the enemy is being led by edelgard do not underestimate how extraordinary her abilities are
of course we know but we cant let her get away also please cease your unwarranted glaring we dont deserve your judgement
my father was removed from his role as prime minister and is still under house arrest in the imperial capital as his successor it is my duty to stop her
the way shes going about all of this is wrong its up to us to help her realize that
i wont be following her but l wont run away either
edies going to come at us with all shes got and thats a lot that means we need to fight her with all of our might too
she is one who has strength that has certainty but we have strength also we will not be losing
i shall fight with all that i have it is an honor to fight alongside each of you
you students really have guts dont you though i suppose i cant call you students anymore youre now part of our order you have our support and our gratitude professor im counting on you go ahead and take the lead
leave it to me
ill protect the students
these kids they look up to you i guess that goes without saying just look in their eyes and you can see it if we all make it through this lets meet again good luck out there
theyre here at long last
it seems this will be a battle to remember about time
ill never give up no matter how outnumbered we are ill fight to the very end
hm i should have made a move on the imperial princess before things got this far it could have changed everything
we have the goddesss divine protection on our side all thats left to do is to try our best
all we can do is fight as best as we can though if im being honest im really scared right now 
we cant just hand over the kingdom and the monastery well stop her no matter what it takes
your highness you do not seem well
  unwell you say whats gotten into you nothing could be further from the truth im so happy i can hardly contain myself my father my stepmother my dear friends they want her head they want her life theyve whispered as much to me and the chance to answer their pleas has arrived at long last
dont lose control out there
  im always in control professor and ill stay in control until i have the pleasure of killing that woman
dont act rashly were all in this together
  of course of course but dont mistake my intentions edelgard will die by my hand and mine alone
lets move professor even if it costs me my life i wont rest until ive crushed her skull in my bare hands
shes back already talk about impatient
if we dont stop them the academy will be destroyed prepare for battle everyone
we will stop edelgards rampage
our opponent is formidable but if we work together we will not fail
enough talking lets go
dear goddess  please protect us all 
i shall fight with all that i have it is an honor to fight alongside each of you
professor claude  youll lead the way wont you you wont let any of us fall right
i wanted to talk to rhea first but as expected that wont be possible what did she hope to accomplish at the holy tomb what happened to you as a baby there are still so many things i need to know the same goes for the real origin of the crest stones and the heroes relics as for seiros and nemesis just how much of their mythology is true
its true but lucky for me i refuse to die with so much still unknown hey teach  all joking aside can we possibly survive this battle
well find a way
thats all we can do right if we gave up the god of fate wouldnt be happy
i dont know
hey now i wasnt really looking for an honest answer honesty is bad for morale teach youd better cut that out
im a lot of things but im not the kind of man to just roll over and die in a place like this i have my own ambitions to see to there are things dreams that i must see come to fruition and ive been thinking i want you to see those dreams realized as well on top of all that there are still so many secrets out there just waiting to be uncovered we cant let that stand can we
so teach  no scratch that youre so much more youre my ally and my friend teach  friend  none of those words quite capture what youve come to mean to me we may not be connected by blood but i believe our bond goes deeper than that now that we know each other our hearts are connected even if our paths diverge and were forced to say good bye  i know that well meet again
and so for lack of a better word i gratefully call you my friend and i hold fast to the belief that this isnt it for us no matter who or what you really are ill always be on your side you cant count on much in this world but you can count on that
the imperial army led by edelgard advances on garreg mach as everyone struggles to process this turn of events the grim reality of war fast approaches
i have a report the enemy is within the walls theyre about to break the defensive line
the archbishop and the defensive line both require our assistance we must protect them until reinforcements get here
report the enemy has taken the entrances there the reinforcements were heading
we must retake the strongholds to the east and west so our reinforcements can get through
one stronghold secured
both strongholds secured with time to spare
alright thats one stronghold recaptured now the other
thats both strongholds it appears we were right on time
no the monestary has fallen weve been defeated 
im here and ive brought reinforcements dont worry  well protect the monastery
i brought reinforcements ill send them to the front line
they have taken the monastery we have lost 
we took back one of the strongholds on to the next 
all right we took back both of the strongholds lets keep up the momentum
damn it  the monastery has fallen into the hands of our enemy we failed
the goddess protects us  what is there to fear rebel swords  this is blasphemy against the goddess stop this now
n no  i cannot fall here 
a wonderful chance to earn some recognition ill be the one to take down the monastery
i have no choice but to distinguish myself in this fight
argh im finished im loathe to say it but i must retreat 
such a shame there are people in the empire you truly care about too arent there i wonder what will become of them
what you fail to appreciate is that we have at our backs a force you cannot hope to defeat
i can afford to fall back we still have the advantage
this fight is but a sideshow  to the ravaging of the sacred place that is garreg mach 
the time is not right  i will wait for the next opportunity 
i will not allow you to get any closer to her majesty
my life was changed forever by her majesty  now i lay it on the line for the empire
lady edelgard im so sorry i cant keep going i must retreat
think very carefully about whether you wish to raise your sword against the empire  or if you will offer it to us in fealty and after youve thought it through if you still wish to fight i wont stop you i will simply use the full extent of my power  and crush you
you will come to regret raising your blade against the emperor of the adrestian empire
huh this guy seems real familiar 
y you dastard arent you  no 
eh that doesnt matter right now lets go
lady edelgard held you in such high esteem in the end however it seems like you are nothing more than a slave to your goddess
this battlefield is too chaotic  for us to kill each other upon 
i wish you were someone whose heart could be swayed by my words and deeds if it were so i would have done anything to make you my ally 
youre late i  we are all tired of waiting now lets separate that sick head from your neck shall we
heh you never were one for patience
you fought well but now your fight is over send in our reserve troops and give my uncle the signal
what  is this
everyone here young and old is in your hands
no i will not allow another red canyon tragedy to happen here
what is going on
what now
why did you come
in imperial year 1181 the new adrestian emperor edelgard von hresvelg led a strategic assault against the monastery at garreg mach though her own losses were great her foes had no choice but to surrender archbishop rhea commanded the knights of seiros leading from the front lines against the imperial army but amidst the chaos of battle she vanished and her whereabouts remain unknown with this single attack the adrestian empire officially launched its offensive against the holy kingdom of faerghus and the leicester alliance the unification of f√≥dlan has begun
/***EOF***/
the northern lands are enveloped in a bitter cold and frigid winds are carried across the sea to the south of adrestia when feather white snow falls on f√≥dlans locket the fort looks as delicate as a pearl however beneath that snowy blanket her throat is more treacherous than ever
rhea please talk to me what are you hiding what is the meaning of how that one looks it is almost as though 
as i said there is nothing of which to speak for now at the end of this month 
i read jeralts diary i happened upon it in his room
what
in it he stated the reason for his departure the baby thought to have died in the fire has returned to us jeralt realized that you had done something to the child and decided to flee what did you do to that baby rhea nothing questionable i should hope
seteth enough they will be here shortly no more i beg of you i will take our dear professor to the holy tomb there i should be able to see our dearest wishes to fruition when i was young i heard her voice there  im sure of it
you may enter
i have been awaiting your arrival professor now that you have received sacred power from the goddess there is somewhere you must pay a visit to at once you must go to the holy tomb so that you may receive a divine revelation from the goddess
the holy tomb
a revelation
the holy tomb is where the goddess sleeps this monastery was originally built for the purpose of protecting that hallowed temple
only a select few know of it but there is a legend about seiros and the holy tomb saint seiros the first soul to be gifted power from the goddess received her revelation there she was told it was her sacred duty to save the people of f√≥dlan and that she must use her power wisely in order to lead them the words that were handed down to seiros from the goddess will likely fall upon your ears as well
prepare yourself to go at once there may you find out why you were blessed with such power
there will be a ceremony at the holy tomb it is then that you will receive the goddesss revelation you may share this mission with your students
do you think it wise to bring them into this
a mission now
it is said that when seiros received the revelation she had holy warriors by her side protecting her your students who have followed you and fought alongside you through the darkest of times are well suited to stand by you for the ceremony of course as the leader of the church of seiros i will be by your side as well
strange 
the occasion is too significant to be missed
isnt that too dangerous
the holy tomb is a sacred temple that is sealed off from the rest of the world there is nothing to fear
even if something were to happen i am more than capable of protecting myself
much has changed but your duty has not wavered steel your mind for the ceremony and prepare your students well
rhea and seteth were not their usual selves what happened to teach thats questionable and what really awaits at the holy tomb the way they were acting i dont think they have any plans of sharing that information
i cant hear sothiss voice anymore 
professor you should know that ill be away from the monastery for a few days
where are you going
its meant to be a secret but im going to enbarr the imperial capital dont worry ill be back in time for the ceremony at the holy tomb
professor please if he hears it from you that he needs to rest perhaps his highness will listen
hes exaggerating he thinks my color is off and that rest will cure all i have a headache but thats just from lack of sleep its not going to stop me from completing this months mission
you should rest
the professor agrees please rest at least until the task is at hand
i wont even if i tried its not like i would get any decent sleep it would only be a waste of time
dont overexert yourself
i must insist 
who do you think you are i can take care of myself dedue
in any case we wont let you down this month professor you can rely on us
hey teach is it ok for you to be out on your own right now just please be careful not to topple over again you scared us nearly to death anyway  doesnt rhea want something from you sounds important im glad ill be there to witness the ritual at the holy tomb i want to see whether or not something happens with my own eyes
i always knew there was something special about you but youve only gotten more and more extraordinary the longer ive know you that transformation was just the beginning wasnt it i have a feeling that things will only grow more dire from here on out
edelgard and hubert have been busier than usual constantly coming and going in and out of garreg mach perhaps they are doing something in the empire as the legitimate heir of the aegir family i have not heard anything about it but if it were significant i am sure my father would have told me
how are you professor did hanneman make his i will do no harm speech or promise this wont hurt a bit when he asked to study you both ive a bit of research id like to perform nothing so crass as hannemans poking prodding and drawing of blood no i wish to investigate crest power itself crest power must have some kind of limit right lady rhea says any limits must be the protection of the goddess but that doesnt quite answer it for me hmm 
youre so strong now im starting to understand why you were appointed professor
i thought i was stronger but i still have such a long way to go
try to catch up to me
oh i will i still plan on beating you some day
ill help you get there
youd better not go easy on me i need your training to be strict if im gonna get any better
so hungry  oh is that you professor sorry im really not feeling well this month even leaving my room for dinner is just too much its got nothing to do with your um changes so um dont open the door please
recently professor i feel as though youve been a bit distant its like youre sort of floating above the clouds separate from other people  and like youve got no interest at all in ever coming back down how can i help
im not being distant so dont worry
i dont know what to say to that
hey dont worry i thought maybe id ask and see what youd say
in brigid we have legends stories containing people who have a spirit living inside of them those spirit people have much strength they are maybe able to fly in the air or race across the ocean hair that shines and eyes that glow  they have qualities that are not unlike what you are looking like professor
i cant fly
are you knowing that for certain maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky 
perhaps
do not have doubt professor the powers you have are like the powers of the legends
hurry up and cage the wild boar look hes losing his grip even in his swordplay hes getting sloppy if he keeps progressing like this hes going to get himself killed kronya solon  theyre dead but we still have a glut of enemies we still have to take down the death knight and the flame emperor our next battle is fast approaching im ready for it
i cant even imagine what it must be like inside the holy tomb
i dont know either
well its probably a grave that much is for sure and its likely underground beyond that who knows
its just a place to bury people
i guess youre right holy or not all graves are kind of the same arent they
i cant help but wonder though  just what kind of ritual is this
i swear its like youre an entirely different person
i havent changed on the inside
heh i guess youre right if i look hard i can still tell its you
isnt it weird
 no not at all im just not used to it it really suits you though
 its not weird at all its  youre somehow even more beautiful than before im joking im joking dont get mad
youve been granted this power by the goddess herself truly you must be a very special individual maybe seiros transformed before receiving her revelation too
hmm i havent heard anything about that before  maybe that part never found its way into the legend
it is told that seiros had a revelation instructing her to use her power for good and to lead the people of f√≥dlan to salvation  i wonder what sort of revelation you might have professor
bah professor sorry this will take some getting used to  your hair and eye color are completely different you just dont look like yourself anymore
its only my appearance that has changed
of course youre right im just being silly as usual
maybe i am a different person 
dont scare me like that you are still you right you are right
to be honest i cannot keep up with all thats been happening recently monica was actually kronya tomas was actually solon who were these people what about you professor you are a true ally yes
thats my intention
not the most convincing answer you could have given still i simply must take you at your word
i dont know
pull yourself together it is still your duty to lead us is it not
you look so different youre still our professor in there right did anything else change besides your hair and eyes are your arms bigger how do your abs look
ive changed quite a bit
really you gotta teach me how to do that
i havent changed that much
thats disappointing whats even the point
so this months mission is to take part in a ritual at the holy tomb where you will receive a revelation from the goddess herself what if she really appears what if i finally get to gaze upon her radiance ive always imagined the goddess  how beautiful she must be
youre going to the ritual at the holy tomb right i hear that a revelation from the goddess is expected what if she shows herself ill be so jealous
your hair and your eyes what happened to you you didnt lose something as a result of gaining those powers did you
dont worry im fine
i see well that makes me feel better but still be careful
i dont know yet
sometimes our frail bodies dont do well with excess power  so dont push yourself too hard
long ago saint seiros was gifted with a divine revelation from the goddess as well as incredible power is that what happened to you too professor
no way the professor transformed before receiving any kind of divine revelation right still i wonder does the fact that youve changed really mean youve been granted some kind of power
if thats the case then what sort of revelation can be gained from the ritual
im guessing the revelation will just be a gentle reminder to use this new power to save the people of f√≥dlan what else is there to say you dont actually believe were going to hear the voice of the goddess do you
when you changed even the other professors were taken completely by surprise theres a ritual at the holy tomb this month isnt there i wonder what will happen with that im sure youll be all right but dont lose sight of who you really are ok however you may change and whatever new power goes along with those changes  youll still be the same person deep down remember that
you havent a thing to worry about you have been gifted the power of the goddess furthermore you have overcome the death of your father jeralt and you have destroyed countless of our wicked foes i am proud so very proud of who you have become
thank you
once we finish the ritual at the holy mausoleum all will be well
im uneasy
that is understandable just know that your unease should disappear the moment we conclude the ritual at the holy mausoleum
hmm  ah it is you i am sorry but i have a lot on my mind i would prefer to be alone right now
professor i am so happy your new hair and eye color suit you well we make quite the pair but recently i sense that things are a bit strained between lady rhea and my brother she wants to do something at the holy tomb i do not know what but  hm whenever it has concluded i hope they will return to their friendship as it has always been 
captain  oh professor how long have you been standing there i didnt see you i was just sorting through captain jeralts belongings i  havent made much progress i keep finding things that bring back memories clearing out this room of his belongings again its  its not easy
in our battle last month we really cut the enemy down to size but there are other enemies we have yet to hunt down not the least the flame emperor once weve crushed them all we can return to our peaceful lives at the monastery it will happen soon i have a feeling something big is coming
people who live an inordinately long time people whose hair changes color and those odd heroes relics  is f√≥dlan some mystical land full of inhuman creatures
its not like that
you still look human for now at least
is the world different outside f√≥dlan
you should see for yourself id recommend exploring west of the empire
sometimes i find myself thinking i should leave garreg mach and return to my home  where i should have been all along
where you should have been
ignore me im sorry its a silly thing an old mans ramblings and nothing more
i wont stop you 
i hear that lady rhea will accompany you for this months task shes the pillar that supports the hearts of f√≥dlans people her safety is paramount i hope there are no complications 
are you positive really your appearance is due to the influence of the crest of flames intriguing unfortunately i have found no record of nemesiss hair and eye color ever changing however  if that transformation was brought on in part by the power of the crest that would be most  well i suppose interesting is too small a word still it would be an absolutely exceptional discovery to know for certain we must investigate further so clothes off
 
what a full physical is in order yes we need to know if this transformation affected you adversely dont worry it wont hurt a bit
the holy tomb huh ive worked here for years and this is the first ive heard of it i mean it does make some sense sort of something about it is still weird i understand now why theyd build the monastery in the mountainous center of f√≥dlan although  when the monastery was built the kingdom and the alliance werent even around yet but look how cleverly it was placed right in the middle of the empire kingdom and alliance thats weird right
when i first saw you professor with that hair color and that eye color i thought you looked kind of like lady rhea like maybe you could be related i like the way it looks i wonder if i could change my hair color too  maybe if i tried hard enough if i thought real hard about it i mean
that would be exciting wouldnt it
all i need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape right just like you did
you dont need to do that cyril
i might not need to but i still wanna
hey professor you seem different lots of things seem different around here lately ive noticed it have you
greetings professor nothing to report although i suppose you are something to report for a moment i thought you were someone suspicious lucky for you i am quite perceptive it took only that single moment for me to recognize you  the professor went out and got some new power
professor will you join me theres something i must do it will take a few days but i promise well be back in time for the ceremony at the holy tomb
where are we going
its meant to be a secret but im going to enbarr the imperial capital there is something i must do there
ill go with you
thank you my teacher
father forgive me for asking this of you i know how much pain youre in  how the burden of the throne weighs heavily on you  and so  
there is no need to apologize edelgard you must know   that i do not have much time left in this world the time has come
thank you father now to complete the imperial succession you must relinquish your crown here in the throne room the archbishop of the church of seiros would normally act as witness but my professor will fill that role instead
edelgard 
from this day forward the weight of the empires future shall rest upon my shoulders all that i do will be for the benefit of the people of f√≥dlan
edelgard von hresvelg the crown is yours by the covenant between the red blood and the white sword and by the double headed eagle upon your head i hereby pronounce you the new emperor are you prepared to take those responsibilities as your own
in accordance with the ancient covenant and in keeping with the hresvelg legacy  i swear that upon this throne i shall use my reign to lead f√≥dlan to a new dawn and achieve peace for all
the imperial succession is complete  my daughter i regret that i could not do more for you when you were stolen away to the kingdom when the prime minister did those horrible things i could only watch in horror
i   i understand father in those dark times your eyes and your fists were my salvation within your eyes i saw true care and upon your fists clenched tight with indignity i saw the blood that dripped and fell even as i bled i felt that you too must also be bleeding
your majesty you must not leave your sleeping chambers in your condition  ah edelgard i did not expect to find your highness here
prime minister you have misspoken i am no longer your highness but rather your majesty
i impossible
it is true edelgard is the new emperor of the adrestian empire we will summon the officials  and prepare an ordinance at once and you prime minister  
  are dismissed it will be some time before you are allowed to make contact with the outside world again
no how can this be i  understood your majesty
edelgard  my dear el i leave the fate of f√≥dlan   in your capable hands
father 
thank you for staying by my side professor now that im the emperor its time to grasp my destiny after the ceremony at the holy tomb i must return to enbarr this may be the last we see of each other we are out of time my teacher everyone is waiting for us we must go
a revelation from the goddess  to think well have the honor of attending such a historical event
i hear the archbishop will accompany us to the holy tomb
if something happens to her all of f√≥dlan will suffer we must protect her at all costs
this may sound mad but perhaps we dont have to worry so much about that lady rhea has said before that she is capable of protecting herself i have a felling that is true i thought it was a strange thing for her to say and beyond that her movements bring to mind a great warrior with an extensive military background
who is rhea really
if so we have nothing to fear
i wonder mind its also possible that im way off track regardless perhaps we should brace ourselves for anything
i never imagined attending a ceremony for real revelation
i wonder what the ceremony will be like im so nervous im not ready for this
theres no chance for battle unless something goes terribly wrong right how boring
if you keep saying things like that something bad is bound to happen
 whats wrong flayn you look like you have something on your mind
who me no it is nothing may we all see this through to the end
 your highness i will protect you no matter what  your highness
 
lost in thought
you havent seemed like yourself lately 
hm ah i suppose you could say that nothing to worry about its about time for lady rhea to arrive lets all steel ourselves for whatever may occur at this ceremony
youre going to receive the goddesss revelation at the holy tomb thats news to me i did not see that coming
lady rheas going too right i hear it will be well guarded but it is that really okay
if solons allies are still around its certainly true that we dont know when or where they may appear
i dont know what type of place this holy tomb is but we should be cautious
if something happens well have to take matters into our own hands
what do you think professor is it really okay for lady rhea to attend
im worried
it seems to be tightly sealed ill give you that we should be fine as long as nothing goes terribly wrong yep  just as long as nothing goes wrong
its encouraging
leave it to our fearless leader to shrewdly factor in rheas fighting ability youre bold teach i love it
well the truth is we wont know whats going on until it happens all we can do is stay on our guard and play it by ear
thats quite enough babbling claude there is nobody more unfit for a holy ceremony than you
um divine punishment wont strike us for setting foot in the holy tomb right
good grief why are you always so negative
hm flayn is something on your mind
who me no it is nothing may we all see this through to the end
it still doesnt make sense to me a goddess was living inside teach right but now theres a ceremony to receive a revelation or whatever how could that be necessary anymore there must be another objective  its pointless to speculate about it now well know the answer soon enough there isnt any danger for us students but  be careful teach
are you surprised professor this is the holy tomb
to think there was such a vast space beneath the monastery all this time its hard imagine that any of these enormous contraptions are of this world
this is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest along with her children
it is said that our creator the goddess sothis sat upon this very throne professor do you recognize this throne
i do
so long  i have waited so very long for this day sit upon the throne i have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess
i do not
there is no need to hide anything from me you have seen it havent you in a dream 
well  it was supposed to be but a step away what could possibly be missing
 stop right there
 dont move any of you if you move your lives will be forfeit thank you ever so much for guiding us this far the imperial army will now take possession of everything in the holy tomb
whats the imperial army doing here
wait does he work for the flame emperor
so the flame emperors connected to the empire i never thought that possible
edelgard did you know about this
yes in fact i gave the order i am the flame emperor
i guess thats the end of play at school lady edelgard i mean your majesty
get to work everyone the crest stones belong to us now and take those filthy bones too
insolence you will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place  professor destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator
wait whats the meaning of this edelgard
 you  made use of us why
im sorry my teacher i cut this path and now i must follow it my friends i ask that all of you stay back it is not my intention to fight you  by order of the adrestian emperor edelgard von hresvelg i command you to collect the crest stones if anyone attempts to stop us kill them
are you surprised professor this is the holy tomb
incredible to think such a vast space has been hiding beneath the monastery all this time i wonder what powers that giant mechanism that descends beneath the ground
this is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest along with her children
it is said that our creator the goddess sothis sat upon this very throne professor do you recognize this throne
i do
so long  i have waited so very long for this day sit upon the throne i have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess
i do not
there is no need to hide anything from me you have seen it havent you in a dream 
well  it was supposed to be but a step away what could possibly be missing
halt reveal yourself
 dont move any of you if you move your lives will be forfeit thank you ever so much for guiding us this far the imperial army will now take possession of everything in the holy tomb
why is the imperial army here
this cant be how did they get into garreg mach
even the flame emperor is here that can only mean  
the flame emperor is connected to the empire what do you know
i never imagined youd have the nerve to return here what are you after flame emperor
is it not obvious the holy tomb contains great power the power to rule all of f√≥dlan
and to attain that power youll trample anything that stands in your way just like you did in duscur
i had nothing to do with that  quickly retrieve the crest stones kill for them if you must
insolence you will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place  professor destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator
are you surprised professor this is the holy tomb
that mechanism for descending underground back there  what powers it when i tried to come by myself it wouldnt even budge
this is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest along with her children
it is said that our creator the goddess sothis sat upon this very throne professor do you recognize this throne
i do
so long  i have waited so very long for this day sit upon the throne i have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess
i do not
there is no need to hide anything from me you have seen it havent you in a dream 
well  it was supposed to be but a step away what could possibly be missing
sorry to disturb you when youre distressed archbishop but it seems some uninvited guests have arrived
 dont move any of you if you move your lives will be forfeit thank you ever so much for guiding us this far the imperial army will now take possession of everything in the holy tomb
the imperial army what are they doing here
so they knew we were heading to the holy tomb and followed us here
hey who is that standing next to the angry guy could that be  
the flame emperor i see so youve been allied with the empire from the beginning
what are they doing here what do they hope to gain
theres only one goal for grave robbers like these right flame emperor youre here to steal the treasure that rests within the holy tomb
for a fool you catch on quickly those crest stones will be ours that infernal power which is masquerading as a medicine but is truly a poison will plague this world no longer
insolence you will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place  professor destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator
your house ventures into the holy tomb to receive a revelation from the goddess in that hidden place deep beneath garreg mach a shocking truth is revealed
i will not allow such violence from the empire strike down the rebels and protect the holy tomb
the crest stones are in the caskets open every last one of them
the holy tomb must not be desecrated protect as many of the crest stones as you can
heretics what could be gained from desecrating these tombs and disgracing the dead
i guess were fighting over who gets those crest stones  what in the world do they intend to use them for anyway
take away every last one of those crest stones
that is enough do you even know what those stones are
take away the crest stones all of them
that is enough do you even know what those stones are
im told its fine to kill those who resist now then how shall i cook you
wait  no i was just following orders i just  graaargh
despite what i said i have no intention of killing you so why not stand down and get out of my way
so the end has come 
professor i will make no excuses thank you for all that you did for me in truth   no lets leave it at that
you could have had a peaceful life  why did you have to come to garreg mach
you wish to interfere then your life is forfeit
you are the one person i did not wish to make an enemy of 
do not try to say you have forgotten  do you know just how many people died in duscur
why bother with this stay silent and fight
so you want to turn your eyes away from the lives you have trampled dastard you are a monster the lowliest beast i have ever known
so youre the fabled flame emperor go ahead and enlighten me what are you planning to do with the crest stones what did you use flayns blood for whos kronya whos solon
silence there is no need for you to know
is it that mask thats to blame for your curtness if so maybe i should rip it off and ask again
ugh 
 
so the end has come 
is this some sick joke the flame emperor is actually edelgard
is this some kind of twisted joke
ive been looking for you  i will take that head from your shoulders and hang it from the gates of enbarr
stop right there
 
before i break your neck there is one thing i must ask you
stay out of my way
i dont recall giving you permission to speak answer my question that is all you have left to do flame emperor no edelgard tell me now why did you cause such a tragedy
 
you killed your own mother and yet you havent even had the decency to stop and consider the reasons behind your actions have you
i already told you i had nothing to do with that
ha it was foolish to think i could reason with a lowly beast
your majesty now
you are a monster 
come hubert
to flee is futile wicked girl the church of seiros will raise its entire army against you until you have been captured and punished you have defiled the holy tomb dishonored the goddess and humiliated your brethren that crime will never be erased even if you burn in the eternal flames and spill all of your blood into the goddesss soil
come professor let us return and decide upon our next course of action
ngah 
are you ok
i cant believe it edelgard 
we werent able to defeat her
your highness 
i will kill edelgard with my own hands i swear it  lets return to the monastery professor it is clear what must be done
you have disappointed me edelgard to think that a descendant of house hresvelg would dare betray the holy church   professor kill edelgard at once she is a danger to all of f√≥dlan such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating
i have achieved my objective i will retreat farewell professor if we meet again it will be on the battlefield
come hubert
to flee is futile wicked girl the church of seiros will raise its entire army against you until you have been captured and punished you have defiled the holy tomb dishonored the goddess and humiliated your brethren that crime will never be erased even if you burn in the eternal flames and spill all of your blood into the goddesss soil
come professor let us return and decide upon our next course of action
im not exactly on friendly terms with the princess but i do have a few questions for her edelgard said that the crest stones represent power that means she knows how to use them she almost certainly knows other secrets of f√≥dlan as well  once things calm down a bit theres a lot more that rhea needs to tell us
i just hope theres still time i have this strange feeling  that history is being written that an age of anarchy is upon us lets hope im mistaken
you have disappointed me edelgard to think that a descendant of house hresvelg would dare betray the holy church 
so it is my teacher who stands in my way i always knew it would come to this 
professor kill edelgard at once she is a danger to all of f√≥dlan such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating
i will withdraw  for now
come hubert
to flee is futile wicked girl the church of seiros will raise its entire army against you until you have been captured and punished you have defiled the holy tomb dishonored the goddess and humiliated your brethren that crime will never be erased even if you burn in the eternal flames and spill all of your blood into the goddesss soil
come professor let us return and decide upon our next course of action
you  how dare you
 my teacher i   thank you but are you certain that   no now isnt the time for discussion
words cannot properly express my gratitude professor
so this is the choice you have made you are just another failure your presence soils this holy tomb and disgraces my brethren i will not allow one who would lend our enemies strength  to wield the power of the goddess sothis i have passed judgement and now i shall rip your chest open  and take back your heart myself
 that must be the immaculate one 
yes the monsters that have controlled f√≥dlan in secret for far too long rhea is their leader
there is no time to waste your majesty professor we must escape while we can
edelgard and hubert have disappeared they will surely return to the empire the knights have been dispatched to search and investigate if there is any movement we will know we cannot ignore the possibility that there will soon be open hostilities between us and the imperial army when that happens are you prepared to fight your own if you wish to return to the empire i will not stop you that is your choice to make
if edelgard is acting afoul then we have no choice but to strike her down
its up to us to stop them we have a war on our hands
i have no interest in fighting not even for her and yet  
how are we supposed to decide just like that
edie hubie im sorry about this but  im siding with the professor
her doings are wrong it is our duty to make everything right
i am sure you all have much on your mind i encourage you to confer with your professor and make a decision you have until the fighting commences  professor i am depending on your strength for the safety of f√≥dlan
the leaders of the church have misused its creed to fulfill their true desire   to rule the world they have fooled the people of f√≥dlan long ago they divided the empire to create a kingdom and then divided that kingdom to create an alliance they did all of this to make the masses bicker amongst themselves they caused instability in order to reinforce their own authority they gathered gold and lived in extravagance how by preying on the devotion of those who wished for the goddesss salvation those corrupt hypocrites cannot lead f√≥dlan to true peace their foul belief system must be torn asunder so that true wisdom may finally prevail and so i have decided   by order of the adrestian emperor edelgard von hresvelg   the empire hereby declares war on the church of seiros
i cannot believe it  let us recount the situation as it stands professor after you returned from the holy tomb  the adrestian empire declared war upon the church of seiros as well as our allies
declared war
edelgard demanded her own father relinquish the throne and then assumed the position of emperor she has deemed the church of seiros to be an evil of this world and is calling upon the people of f√≥dlan to help her tear it down i must discuss our response to this declaration with the archbishop after the knights return from their investigation until then watch over the students see that they remain calm
so  hes finally shown his true face the same dimitri ive seen once before a beast who loves spilling blood
youre wrong im sure of it there has to be an explanation 
i knew hed been carrying the burden of that tragedy i understand his thirst for revenge his family and closest friends all massacred right in front of him but it still doesnt add up there must be more that we dont know
thats true dimitri didnt come unhinged until after the flame emperor was unmasked 
you dont think theres some connection between those two do you
professor the empire has declared war on the church of seiros
we knew this day would come sooner or later
whats going to happen
dont worry
we need more information
we cant afford to be optimistic its entirely possible the kingdom will be invaded
settle yourself ingrid we need to carefully consider our options
we cant just act rashly that will only make things worse
one weve ascertained the situation we must return to fhirdiad  your highness 
 
i heard what happened teach the princess   well the emperor now   she really did it didnt she the lords and dukes of both the kingdom and the alliance have been called out and now have to choose between the church and the empire the seed of conflict was always there and now we find ourselves in the middle of a war that will tear f√≥dlan in two
the empire is rash but i never thought it would come to this
how could something like this happen i hope everyone back home is safe
im sure its mass confusion at home right now my brother must be worried sick about me
only time will tell
lets calm down
youre absolutely right teach im sure a lot of us are worried about our homes but  all we can do now is prepare for battle  and tread carefully
/***EOF***/
hoarfroast now graces treetops and open fields alike and an icy chill blown in from the north of faerghus blankets the land all of f√≥dlans creatures begin to settle in for a long winter the setting sun bathes the full winter coat of every wolf in a foreboding scarlet glow hunters can now spread the word that the red wolves are back on the prowl
thats what were dealing with is there no chance its an infectious disease
there are no absolutes in medicine but the chances are extremely slim restless movements fits of violence becoming bedridden or even impossible to wake  with symptoms that varied there are only a few possibilities its either a mixture of poisons or magic and dark magic at that
youre talking about remire village arent you manuela
oh my if it isnt jeralt tell me what was the first thing you heard
everything after you mentioned that its not likely its an infectious disease my child and i owe the people of remire village if somethings happening there we must help them
we scouted the area ourselves speak with the knights hear what they have to say i must go thank you for your help manuela
you know im more than willing to go with you to remire village  after all i owe you my life if youd like i bet we could even manage the mission all by ourselves just the two of us 
thats nice of you
professor a bit of a tease are we a girl could get used to this side of you
im afraid not
youre saying no well arent you just a great big bore
nice try but ill be going to the village as well enough nonsense its time to move out
as you like good bye jeralt good bye professor
ill be in my office making preparations what about you if you have the time it would be helpful if you could go ahead and talk to the knights
 
hey whats wrong
im ok
i just got a little dizzy
if anything feels off return to the infirmary no need to just grin and bear it got it
ugh  what could have caused such dizziness i felt it too actually  ive felt that way before 
you look unwell its because of what happened isnt it
dont speak of it aloud
you cant change the past for now all we can do is use it to our advantage
i know that i also know that i must steel myself to ascend the imperial throne
those preparations are going well we  someone is coming
professor i heard about our mission for this month something terrible is happening in remire village thats where you were when fate sent you our way this feels preordained
are the knights making progress with their investigation
i dont know
they are
if what is happening there is by design there must be someone pulling the strings there is the death knight of course and the mysterious mages who were implicated with the western church they showed up when flayn was kidnapped as well and now there is another strange occurrence near the monastery  it seems an unknown organization hopes to make the monastery its stage for something
do you believe that all of these incidents are connected professor
i do
that is the logical conclusion but im not so sure
i do not
oh im surprised to hear you say that but actually i agree
it certainly appears that all of the events surrounding the monastery are connected by a single thread however  i think its possible that it may just be a result of different motives overlapping remember professor  if you think of people as simply enemies or allies it may be impossible to grasp the truth
i see so youll be staying here for some time then honestly im surprised ive heard its been a few years since you last donated to the church
that was merely because of the financial situation of my territory i assure you it has nothing to do with my dedication to the church by the way dimitri  isnt edelgard currently enrolled at the officers academy as well
yes shes in the black eagle house i dont believe she has any plans to leave anytime soon why not pay her a visit
i may do just that its nice to stay in touch with my dear niece every now and then of course im also delighted that i was able to speak with my nephew as well whether through marriage or otherwise family is family after all
of course the feeling is mutual
professor  if you were watching you should have made your presence known
who was that
that was lord arundel the regent for the empire he is also edelgards uncle
an acquaintance of yours
he called you his nephew 
my stepmother was his younger sister we are not related by blood but he is technically my uncle
in other words 
so you and edelgard 
yes my stepmother was edelgards birth mother edelgard and i are siblings by marriage we can delve into that topic another time for now lets make preparations to investigate whats happening in that village
oh dear the princess of the empire and the kingdoms prince are kin how very odd
so thats why he was worried about her 
all beings are attached somehow to those who are their family yes even i i must have had a family too  i wish i could remember them my family  i wonder who and where they are and what theyre doing now
i find it odd as well 
they likely harbor knowledge they do not wish to share oh yes im sure of it but i suppose we must wait until the time of truth arrives 
in any case  about this arundel youve heard that name before correct
in the library
quite true we came across that name within the library right where the prince had been
in the office
your memory is worse than mine the library we came across that name within the library right where the prince had been dont you recall
i thought that arundel had died  and yet not so he seems alive and well i wonder what the prince had hoped to learn from reading of his uncles charity  so many things the prince has yet to tell  how bothersome 
tomas doesnt seem to be here  oh well thats fine ive been researching the heroes relics a lot since we last spoke to him i found out something interesting
why have you been researching them
why do you have to ask trust me what really matters is what i found out
something interesting
its about the connection between crests and the heroes relics the crest stone of each relic is carved with a specific crest the one that has the ability to wield it properly the crests are the keys you need the right one to safely use a heros relic the only thing i cant figure out is why doesnt the sword of the creator have a crest stone bearing a crest
its by the whim of the goddess
hey now no need to write off my findings by saying its a mere whim of the goddess
it had one in the past
precisely at least thats my current guess
theres more i believe the crest stones might be the source of the relics inhuman power when miklan transformed into a black beast he was taken over by something that originated from the crest stone and the crest stone was on his body it all seems to add up now look at this picture i found in the library
that creature is called the immaculate one who was supposedly sent by the goddess to save the followers of seiros see the pattern on its brow and the faint circular boundary isnt it possible thats a crest stone if all this is true then crest stones are what power the ability to assume massive forms like that of the immaculate one and maybe the heroes relics can harness that transformative power 
oh it is you have you seen tomas recently
no such luck i was hoping to speak with him myself but he seems to be out on the town
i see well  hm where did you find that picture
it was in the library why do you ask is it something my youthful eyes shouldnt be seeing
no of course not however that is not part of this librarys collection it must belong to tomas it would be problematic if it got mixed in with the other books i will take possession of it for now
 take it away where no one can see it you mean 
what was that
thats what tomas said he said records that the monastery doesnt approve of tend to disappear
tomas said that preposterous i have far too much to accomplish to waste time with this foolishness
he was certainly in a hurry i wonder if hes off to confront tomas well he took the picture so i guess thats that for now ill see you later teach
so the church is hiding something after all some massive secret about relics and crests a secret that must have something to do with the professors true identity 
i do not know why it is so but being here makes me feel quite unwell i am so sleepy and a bit  it is a struggle merely to stay conscious  are you feeling the same
i am
and yet it feels familiar  as though pulled from a corner of my memory from a time long ago  i simply cannot fathom it
i am not
why must you be so difficult i know the entire contents of your heart and soul so you should know there is no fooling me
they say that things rarely if ever go according to plan still plan we must after all if we dont effectively force things to go our way nothing will be achieved how about you professor are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself
i am
your character must be stronger than most
i am not
thats surprising  but i suppose its possible youre telling the truth
they say that things rarely if ever go according to plan still plan we must after all if we dont effectively force things to go our way nothing will be achieved how about you professor are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself
im sorry to ask this of you but i would deeply appreciate it if you would promise to keep my association with edelgard to yourself it is a complicated history what she and i share
professor you seem unwell how are you faring if youre not feeling well id strongly recommend some rest
even if i spend all my time rummaging through this library theres a limit to the knowledge that can be gained apparently it only contains books whose contents have been deemed appropriate by the church if only tomas were around i bet he has some interesting stories he could regale us with 
what in the world is happening in remire village i hear even the knights have been dispatched i hope its nothing too serious  after all thats where we first met i have valued memories of that place
need something professor i was just asking monica here to be less demanding of lady edelgards time
hey its not like im bothering her sorry for the ruckus professor please dont worry about it too much nooothing to worry about here
ugh i wish you would worry about it a little more
remire village  is that not where you met edelgard if you had not been there something terrible could have happened did one of the house leaders know that mercenaries were staying in remire village i wonder  it will remain a mystery for now all we can do at this point is speculate
i fear i may become a social recluse soon  my life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall although i guess a real recluse wouldnt leave their room eh that would be me if you werent my teacher locked away in my room reading napping never to be seen you know i never see bernadetta outside of class i wonder what it is that she does in her room all day
i fear i may become a social recluse soon  my life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall although i guess a real recluse wouldnt leave their room eh
hey professor did you see that my father came by during the battle of the eagle and lion he left soon after but i saw him talking to edelgard first i wonder what they could have to talk about
your father
yeah hes pretty important in the empire i thought i mentioned it to you before hes the minister of military affairs
empire business perhaps
i guess that would make sense he is the minister of military affairs after all
still though  i couldve sworn those two didnt get along
what is it sorry ive um  ive got a cold
get well soon
um thanks
no you dont
how did you know my act was perfect alas tis no mere illness of the body but a malign affliction of mine soul so um back to bed
 
congratulations on winning the battle of the eagle and lion did you get a special reward i certainly feel like i earned a special reward dont you professor
no winning is its own reward
i was afraid you might say that i do wish youd dote on me just a bit more 
aww  disappointing
this is a place of mysteriousness i have awareness of how much difference every part of the world is in a place alike to this place you can imagine the goddess of f√≥dlan truly existing at times i miss those places in brigid at times  i am missing those places so painfully
all this month his highness has been going out late into the night he will not speak of it to me professor do you happen to know anything
as i recall 
lord arundel is here that may well explain it
i dont know
i see i am sorry to trouble you with questions
his highnesss headaches have been growing steadily worse i would prefer that he retire to bed early
investigating remire village be on your guard
you know professor the tournament fish and the meal we indulged in after the battle of the eagle and lion  why all of the food ive eaten in this monastery has been absolutely delectable every last bite of it
food really is the only thing you think about huh
hardly i think about all sorts of things
oh like tomorrows menu for instance
im worried about remire that affliction is a little too mysterious for my liking im pretty sure its not normal
ive heard its not an ordinary disease
then what could it be
ive heard its the work of a cursed specter
wh what ah come on dont tease me but what if it really was something like that how could we hope to stop it
i wonder how remire village is faring hopefully were not dealing with some new epidemic it wouldnt be unheard of almost 20 years ago a terrible plague blazed through faerghus it even hit the capital city taking the queen consorts life or so i heard the whole kingdom was in an uproar over that loss the person who saved the kingdom wasnt a doctor but a holy woman the fair lady cornelia after that she was awarded the honor of being a mage in the service of the royal family she sounds like an amazing woman but  she must be pretty old by now but hey maybe shes aged like a fine wine
oh goodness is something the matter professor you look a little pale  please be careful its so easy to catch a cold this time of year
hmm  the librarian is always out and about these days and just when i had some questions about a book id borrowed  ugh now im so curious about where hes gone off to hed better come back soon 
how are you feeling professor you look rather ill if you dont mind my saying so are you sick if so i would urge you not to push yourself too hard take some rest
nothing gets by you
just my natural talent nothing out of the ordinary enough wit now you should lie down
what an unexpected kindness
what is that supposed to mean never mind if youre not feeling well you should stop trying to walk it off and simply lie down
hey professor can i get your advice on something i just dont know what to do anymore i used to think they were the best but now i cant even stand looking at them
its ok to be worried
but worrying about it wont solve my problems what if i can never eat fish again
time heals all wounds
good point professor i think i need to see other meats right now then i can come back to fish when im good and ready
ah professor the battle of the eagle and lion was such good fun dont you think
ignatz how long are you going to keep harping on about the battle of the eagle and lion
aw come on let me gush did you see how the house leaders came together after the battle what an incredible thing to witness harmony even after something so hard fought
true if they can keep playing nice perhaps there will be peace in f√≥dlan after all
i heard about remire village from some of the knights its certainly troubling if its a contagion we at garreg mach should be on the lookout as well
i dont believe it is
oh well thats better but i wonder what the real cause could be  your words are oddly persuasive professor even if theyre not exactly based on anything
ill handle it
your words are oddly persuasive professor even if theyre not exactly based on anything
good day professor well then i should go
professor captain jeralt just told me remire village is in a bad way right
the situation there is worrying yes  but tell me how is your vertigo
im all right now
were you not feeling ok you seem fine to me
i hope youre not just saying that we cant have you putting on a brave face only to fall in battle
still a little unsteady
are you not feeling ok you should get some rest
hm if you must go to the village make sure youre in good health before we depart
professor  do you ever wish you could return to your life as a mercenary
i do
i thought you might traveling the world just you and jeralt  how lovely it must have been
i do not
is that so i suppose you have become accustomed to your new line of work this months assignment will again take you outside of garreg mach to remire village
it was in remire that you first met alois and the rest of his order was it not half a year has come and gone since then how quickly time passes 
what is it i am in the middle of my daily duties i assume you know by now that the four saints are all important figures in the teachings of seiros  still i have a particular fondness for saint cethleann
i am so happy to be part of your class professor i honestly cannot recall the last time i interacted with others on a daily basis like this  it reminds me of when i was a child ha that was so very long ago now 
how long ago
oh i mean very very very very long ago
youre still a child
despite how young i may appear to you im quite mature you may be surprised you know
im going to catch me some mighty fish just you wait and see i didnt catch a single fish last month but this month this month
time to give up
thats exactly what captain jeralt said
maybe youre doing something wrong
im casting my line just as the captain taught me all those years ago 
youre going with the captain to investigate remire village arent you it feels like so long ago that you two came here 
of the four or five years since i started here this is certainly the busiest
it was four ive been here five
oh whats a year here or there don t be petty now shamir
you count your enemies the same way
if i take care of them quickly what does it matter how many there are oh sorry we didnt mean to ignore you professor
as you were saying its been a busy year there never seem to be enough hands for the work
that reminds me do you have that thing if you do we want it
want no we need it give it to me not her
hey now im the one who brought it up we may be friends but thats just rude
professor tell me is this about remire there are more villagers acting strangely today than yesterday knights have been dispatched yet  the underlying cause is as yet unclear and the most anyone can do is stand back and watch it is most distressing professor what do you think about all this
some kind of illness
if it were indeed a disease why would it only affect the villagers and not infect the knights stationed there
some kind of conspiracy
in that case we should strengthen the guards if you visit the village professor please take care
punishment from the goddess
the goddess you have spoken near blasphemy and i would suggest a hasty apology
i thought we might make it through last month in peace but no another incident just had to arise didnt it if only this debacle had to do with crests why id have gone and dealt with it in an instant
i know you figure medicine and magical healing are two ways to do the same thing but its way deeper than that medicine is all about preventing infection and suppressing symptoms with well medicine  thats probably obvious but magical healing is focused on closing up wounds faster raising a bodys vital energy stuff like that
the knights go out from garreg mach to take on all kinds of other duties id sure like a job like that one day then again i dont know  serving lady rhea here is pretty good
greetings professor nothing to report oh except that tomas departed the monastery and is yet to return consider that reported hes been gone for periods of time before and has always returned so im not too worried still  i wonder what in the world hes doing out there
weve got to go now
whats going on
ok
the situation in remire village has changed drastically we dont know much more than that were hearing reports that the villagers are killing each other some say houses are burning regardless we need to move
kill kill ahhhh
haha  hahaha  hrngyarhh
help somebody please help
whats going on here 
this is horrific its even more revolting more terrible than i expected
im revolted too
it really is horrifying
true but if we are not careful how we proceed we will only increase the death toll
the villagers are all attacking each other lets knock them all out one by one
 always so reckless you do know that if we mess up we will either kill or be killed right
still we cannot just stand here twiddling our thumbs and doing nothing
id r really like to go home now but theres no time for thoughts like that
we have to help them
i am waiting for your orders with full readiness
wait those people over there  they seem to be observing the chaos they must be behind this eliminate them and rescue all of the unafflicted villagers
 ungh 
whats wrong with you
are you ok
i  dont worry about me im fine
dont waste your time on me saving the village is far more important we havent a moment to lose
what can we do amidst such confusion
well have to take up arms against the villagers who are rampaging if we strike carefully it should be possible to spare their lives
oh dear  isnt there a more peaceful way to deal with this
no matter how long it takes well need to check and rescue them all one at a time
those who have gone made may be victims themselves is it possible to save them
well saving the poor people who arent crazy is definitely our top priority lets get on with it
slow down annette it wont do anyone any good if we panic and get injured ourselves
isnt that  your highness suspicious figures spotted in the village they seem to be watching the chaos
are they the ones responsible for this madness if so its clear what must be done kill them all dont let a single one of them escape sever their limbs and crush their wicked skulls
this is unbelievable  theres no way to tell whos lost their mind from whos mad with fear 
if we dont act quickly things are just going to keep getting worse
its horrifying
i really dont want to get involved here but we cant leave these people on their own right
what can we do
how about we hit them hard enough to knock them out but not hard enough to kill them
thats too reckless but  ill admit i cant think of a better option
if some must die just know it was by the will of the goddess 
stop that marianne we have to save all of them theres no way this madness is by the will of the goddess
nobles are responsible for the safety of commoners by the honor of house gloucester i swear that i will save them all
claude there are some strange looking people here
so you noticed too look theres a suspicious group hiding amongst the villagers could they be the culprits if so 
they will not be forgiven
i wont let them escape
there you have it our objective is clear take down that suspicious group and rescue the villagers
a pattern of strange occurrences in remire village has suddenly erupted into something far more serious
there are some suspicious looking ruffians out there but our top priority is to rescue the villagers got it ill rein in the villagers whove turned violent you focus on rescuing the others
the one giving commands in the back  im certain thats tomas the librarian
the one giving orders to the others isnt that tomas the librarian
it cant be  the one giving orders to the weird ruffians  isnt that tomas
tomas what are you doing here dare i even ask
tomas what are you doing here
tomas what in the world are you doing here
im not tomas my name is solon the savior of all
whats the matter so shocked you cant even speak you were so easily fooled by my disguise  i was hiding away in garreg mach to get the blood of that little girl called flayn with her blood well be one step closer to realizing our goal
ill have a bit of fun here too 
thats the death knight he must be an ally of tomas or solon or whoever he is
they charge in without any plan whatsoever beasts all of them  the experiment is over kill them
solon what have you done you will not escape punishment
  i will cut you to shreds
you monster we could have saved them
kill kill
th thank you
weve rescued as many as we can now its time to capture solon
ah the cursed fell star  this will be a fine opportunity to measure your power
you are but a savage insignificant beast  yet you think you can kill me
tomas no  solon i will stop you
what if you insist on turning your blade against me then expect no mercy
my pleasure  do your best to kill me with that blade 
you are not the one i crave 
my blade craves their flesh  the weak will eventually die 
what are you trying to do here
youre the one who should be answering that question stay out of my way
the death knight was just a distraction lets concentrate on killing solon
we let him get away  that doesnt matter now our top priority is to kill solon
what does he want anyway in any case we need to take care of solon
why have you gone after this village what are you planning
heh i could have conducted this experiment on any test subjects now that i have what i came for i must bid you farewell
wait damn it hes gone 
we let him get away  ill survey the village there may still be enemies in hiding
i will survey the village there may still be some survivors
its over  all we can do now is focus on our next move ill have a look around the village there may still be people who need our help
it looks like we somehow managed to sort things out and casualties were kept to a minimum they said they werent picky about who they used as their test subjects because of them the people of remire village 
there you are
that armor so youre the flame emperor
yes i believe you have met my subordinate the death knight
oh weve met him all right but back to you youre the one responsible for the destruction of this village
do not get the wrong idea
what in blazes does that mean
it is true that i am working with solon but that does not mean our objectives are the same had i known they planned to do this i would have stopped it you have my word
your words are meaningless now ill have to insist you accompany us back to the monastery
i cannot abide that however if you wish to join forces i will hear your plea
what
if left to their own devices they will commit countless more violent acts like this one do you not wish to prevent that with the sword of the creator on our side solon would not be a threat 
i will join your cause
you are lying i can see that you cannot contain your fury toward me pity
i must refuse
pity though not unexpected
pray that you do not live to regret your choice
jeralt professor have you seen lady edelgard
jeralt professor have you seen his highness
jeralt professor have you seen claude
whats wrong kid huh damn it hes gone 
hey ive been meaning to talk to you since coming to the monastery youve changed
changed
how so
youve been angry since we first arrived in remire village and you look so happy when youre instructing the brats before the monastery id never seen you bear your emotions like that not once
you might be right
its thanks to the students
then perhaps its a good thing we came to the monastery if only so i could see your face lit up like that or maybe there was never any reason for us to leave the monastery in the first place 
a reason to leave
wasnt i born after you left the monastery
ah  ive put my foot in my mouth havent i though i suppose it may be nearly that time  come to my office when you next have a moment to spare theres something i need to tell you
just what was that about i cant recall a time of old when you were at the monastery  i wonder what is hiding in the mist that is your past 
professor i dont know if this is appropriate to say but admirable work out there i really believe we did all that we could
i wish that were true
jeralt said the same thing we must try to stay positive even through the horror
i wasnt strong enough
no mortal is all powerful we must try to stay positive even through the horror
i hear the so called flame emperor appeared in remire village as well hubert told me that you spoke with him
he said he wasnt involved in this incident
and do you believe him professor
i believe him
oh but how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are
i dont believe him
that makes sense its hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how theyre connected to all this
even if his words are true his objectives are still unclear but if the flame emperor should someday reveal his true intentions  maybe then he will appear before you without his mask and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe
he asked me to join forces with him
really is that what you want professor
i do
oh but how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are
i do not
that makes sense its hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how theyre connected to all this
even if he wants you as an ally his objectives are still unclear if the flame emperor truly wishes to make use of your power  perhaps someday he will appear before you without his mask and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe
edel i need to ask you something oh im so sorry did i interrupt
no not at all if youll excuse me professor
professor  i im sorry you saw that side of me in the village it must have been quite a shock to you and the others im mortified by my behavior when i saw the chaos and violence there my mind just went completely dark
i felt the same
i see  so that happens to you as well then
you werent yourself
i see why you would say that i always strive to keep my emotions at bay but  sometimes the darkness takes hold and its impossible to suppress it just shows you how lacking i am  i have much to learn
ive told you before that some day we may find ourselves facing something we simply cannot accept thats what the chaos in remire village was to me solon and the flame emperor are both beasts who must be eliminated demons who kill the innocent they arent even human at this point
the flame emperor said he wasnt involved
and you believed him he doesnt deserve our forgiveness he became an accomplice when he refused to turn himself in and return with us to the monastery
where is this anger coming from
it must be hard to fathom its true that i dont have any strong connection to those villagers and yet 
you see professor  i saw the same flames of torment just four years ago in duscur
please have mercy
gah the pain make the burning stop help me  somebody 
avenge us those who killed us  tear them apart destroy them all
ugh  gah  my father my stepmother  four years ago they lost their lives to those flames ill never forget  i still remember their faces their screams the tortured last moments of every person who died that day  but right now all that matters is that we do whatever we can to help the surviving villagers get back to their normal lives
thank you for everything  theres a reason that i came to the officers academy just one reason i came here for revenge and one day i will have it
hey teach that assignment wasnt my favorite ive got to admit i suppose pretending to be unaffected doesnt do anyone any good that was terrible to behold its always hard to see innocents die
it is
i wasnt strong enough
hey all you can do is keep smiling keep marching thats part of a leaders job you cant give in to despair not just for me or for you but for all of us in the golden deer house we have to keep smiling so the others can move forward too as long as we dont show that were disheartened theyll know they can make it too thats what matters
sorry for getting ahead of myself teach thats how i feel but how you handle it is really up to you by the way  i hear that guy who calls himself the flame emperor showed up in remire village i couldnt believe it when hilda told me the news what could he be after
the heroes relics
maybe after all he was after the sword of the creator in the holy mausoleum  but then they kidnapped flayn and used her blood for their recent attack based on that we should probably assume that their true objective is something other than the relics dont you think
you have a point
what do they want with flayns blood
they called this incident an experiment and they said they got what they came for that means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time sadly thats all we can assume there are far too many things we still dont know
world domination
ha i know i just laughed but that really isnt funny teach world domination  hm ok actually  i wonder they called this incident an experiment and they said they got what they came for that means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time i hate to even consider it but if they can replicate the incident at remire village on an even larger scale  if were not careful well have a full scale war on our hands then world domination wouldnt be a joke anymore
i dont know
i was afraid youd say that frankly theres way too much that we still dont know they called this incident an experiment and they said they got what they came for that means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time sadly thats all we can assume
flayn your timing is impeccable would you care to join us for a while fair lady
wha   why oh my
damn she gave us the slip in any case i doubt she knows the full story it seems more like she has something on her mind that she cant divulge
youre pushing too hard
we cant go easy on her
whoa there settle yourself teach
seems like it would be better to push seteth for an explanation or best of all to go above his head and ask rhea  now that we know tomas was an enemy we cant be sure that exposing the churchs secrets would be to our benefit where are the answers i seek where are they 
you did well handling that awful business in remire village i am certain the goddess shares in our grief at the senselessness of that calamity more importantly i was shocked to hear that our own tomas was actually a dark mage i must reflect on our blindness
you surely must you failed to notice that a rat was hiding in your home pathetic who are these wicked foes how did tomas escape your gaze
who are these villains
why did tomas come to the monastery
tomas came to the monastery 40 years ago by recommendation of house ordelia of the alliance around eight years ago he went back to house ordelia before returning to the monastery once again just last year after having worked at garreg mach for decades why would he betray us now just what did he hope to accomplish jeritza became a professor at the officers academy because of a recommendation from the imperial nobility supposing that he is the death knight that means that our enemy is an organization that has taken root in at least two territories
in the long history of the church of seiros  no long before even that  there have been an endless number of threats to the peace of f√≥dlan yet those who oppose us still operate in the shadows their identities a mystery i believe that solon and the death knight are merely one part of a much larger whole
a threat to f√≥dlans peace that means we have no choice we have to stop them all
what now
without knowing what their objective is we cannot afford to act recklessly the knights will investigate for now you and your class should focus on your training
they must be stopped
i have truly come to rely on you i believe that the monastery will remain safe so long as we have you we do not yet know the enemys objective or whereabouts for now please devote yourself to preparing for whatever comes next
that is all for today
professor please wait i know there is much that you still do not understand however one thing is clear you possess great power i believe that you are destined to be a source of great hope for all in any case i expect great things from you walk this world proudly dear professor may the goddess sothis protect you
the goddess sothis is that what she just said
is something the matter
its nothing
i see in that case farewell
i had never heard the name of the goddess
i see sothis is the goddesss true name please do not use it carelessly farewell
do not say something that we may regret she  i  what exactly am i for now lets leave this place please  go
/***EOF***/
from on high flocks of wyverns roar in chorus and soar the pristine skies heading south for the winter f√≥dlans children lend their hands to winter preparations by gathering firewood and catching fish from the rivers cool waters yet all the while their gazes are turned skyward drawn to the magnificent sight above
professor you already know about the battle of the eagle and lion correct
only the name
i cant recall
i see in that case allow me to fill you in its a large scale mock battle between the rival houses that takes place every year
its scale is incomparable to the mock battle we fought during the great tree moon it will take place in the vast gronder field that is in empire territory to the southeast of garreg mach
whichever house defeats the most opponents wins of course the professors also fight alongside their respective houses
well usually professor manuela is being prudent she will not be participating this year since his long time rival will be absent professor hanneman has also declined
in that case i must sit out too
what should i do
oh dont worry about us you know you wanna see the kids in action
are you feeling any better professor manuela
thanks to all of you but id only be a burden out there my students dont need to see me collapsed well not on the battlefield anyway
correct we will not be participating regardless do not expect victory to come easily or at all
well put weve spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits you can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you
if im the only professor present 
this doesnt seem fair 
oh my look at you if youre as confident as all that my students will walk all over you
we have taught our students well there is no need to hold back challenge them with everything you have
the battle of the eagle and lion is finally upon us this is our chance to show off the results of your expert training professor
battle of the eagle and lion
have lady rhea and seteth really not filled you in well if thats the case im happy to explain
it slipped my mind
haha i highly doubt that if you dont mind id be happy to explain
the battle of the eagle and lion takes place every year during the wyvern moon it can best be described as a mock battle between the three houses
much like the one we had during the great tree moon do you remember professor
yes i remember
i remember our celebration most of all
it was certainly an unforgettable time ive never seen anyone put away as much victory food as you did that night professor
this battle will take place in empire territory at gronder field in other words far removed from the monastery its a mock battle between the three houses the house that defeats the most opponents wins
your highness if the rumors are true i believe professor manuela and professor hanneman will not be joining us
ah yes right you are given recent events professor manuela has opted to sit this one out since she wont be present professor hanneman has decided to skip this year as well
in that case i must sit out too
what should i do
oh dont worry about us you know you wanna see the kids in action
professor manuela are you feeling better already
thanks to all of you but id only be a burden out there my students dont need to see me collapsed well not on the battlefield anyway
in that case perhaps it is best that you sit this one out
correct we will not be participating regardless do not expect victory to come easily or at all
well put weve spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits you can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you
if im the only professor present 
this doesnt seem fair 
oh my look at you if youre as confident as all that my students will walk all over you
we have taught our students well there is no need to hold back challenge them with everything you have
its finally time the battle of the eagle and lion at gronder field is this month dont tell me you forgot teach
it slipped my mind
youre kidding come on teach i need you to keep it together for me dont lose focus when it counts
i know little about it
youre kidding didnt rhea or seteth fill you in guess i have to do everything myself around here
the battle of the eagle and lion is one of the academys annual traditions its a huge mock battle between the three rival houses
but you know all about rivalry battles professor there was one right after you got here remember i hear the battle of the eagle and lion will be held in gronder field far away from garreg mach
the house that defeats most opponents wins its a three way battle that relies heavily on strategy sounds exciting doesnt it
hey claude what about professor manuela do you think shell be able to join us despite her injuries
im afraid shes sitting this one out as is professor hanneman  as my persistent rival will not be present it only goes to follow that i must also sit out this years battle now leave me be claude
in that case i must sit out too
what should i do
oh dont worry about us you know you wanna see the kids in action
if it isnt our own professor manuela all things considered youre looking well
thanks to all of you but id only be a burden out there my students dont need to see me collapsed well not on the battlefield anyway
does that mean you really wont be joining us for the battle
correct we will not be participating regardless do not expect victory to come easily or at all
well put weve spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits you can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you
if im the only professor present 
this doesnt seem fair 
oh my look at you if youre as confident as all that my students will walk all over you
we have taught our students well there is no need to hold back challenge them with everything you have
hmph this monastery is more dangerous than i expected its likely that our foes have infiltrated the ranks of the teachers  and there may be others of questionable character about as well if you ask me there is something amiss about that old man tomas
what do you say edel shall we meet up in the library later to  oh hello professor
do you need something im a little busy at the moment
sorry professor ive got a lot of questions to ask edel here since i couldnt graduate last year i really want to make sure i can do so this year dont worry i wont participate in any assignments so as not to take any attention away from the younger students i look forward to learning from you professor
what do you say edel shall we meet up in the library later to  oh hello professor
do you need something im a little busy at the moment
sorry professor ive got a lot of questions to ask edel here since i couldnt graduate last year i really want to make sure i can do so this year
the battle of the eagle and lion  its name comes from the war in which the kingdom won its independence from the empire its imperative that we fight our best we must live up to the legacy of the king of lions
to hold a fishing tournament at a time like this  participate if you must but i urge you not to lose sight of our goal as for me i wont be joining in im so focused on the battle ahead i fear i would snap my poor rod right in half
flayn and monica was it im glad they were returned safe and sound
going all the way to the empire for a mock battle this is serious business and theres a reward to be had as well id really like to win this thing everyone else seems to be raring to go too were all looking to you to guide us teach
going all the way to the empire for a mock battle this is serious business and theres a reward to be had as well id really like to win this thing
seteth that stubborn goat holding a fishing tournament now just last month he looked like death warmed over
the battle of the eagle and lion is a free for all contest among the three classes if you are victorious the archbishop will no doubt present you with a reward
consider me motivated
im not interest in rewards
just what i thought youd say
you know the empire used to control all of f√≥dlan but after the civil war the northern region split off and became the kingdom later the eastern part of the kingdom seceded to become the alliance there are three powers today but a thousand years ago we were all united as one even now among the nobles of the empire there are some who dream of reunifying f√≥dlan 
im just absolutely exhausted i swear to you professor every month were worked harder than the month before i had imagined the academy as a chance to possibly relax before our lives began in earnest
you came to the academy to relax
after graduating well enter into noble society which mean contending with all the intrigues and dramas that entails i want to just postpone life for a bit fish  nap under a tree  skip out on lectures and  well not on your lectures of course professor
it is what it is
agreed thats the church of seiros for you what is it they say those with power are obliged to use it
are you gonna participate in the fishing tournament professor
hi professor want to know something gronder is in the territory of house bergliez in the empire thats right next to my home the region of house varley oh oh no what if  what if my parents come to watch aaah
calm down
im calm of course im calm why wouldnt i be calm ugggh
i dont think nobles are allowed to watch
really are you sure you wouldnt say that if you werent completely sure right
fishing no thanks i tried it once and ugh gross i dont even really like to eat fish let alone catch and gut them besides who can think about fishing right now the battle of the eagle and lion is coming up soon feeling confident
very
thats the spirit
not really
oh have a little faith in yourself professor youll do fine im sure of it
i fished with frequency back in brigid i will not have losing will you be trying to fish too
the battle of the eagle and lion draws near his highness insists upon training well into the night he has said it is nothing to worry about but how could i not be concerned
did you want something
ever since the tournament the kitchen is completely overtaken with fish the cooks cannot keep up
im not interested in glory or prizes all i want is a formidable enemy to sink my teeth into as far as i can see there are only a couple of opponents worth my time
since we were little ingrids always gotten this odd look in her eye when someone brings up food
you know im pretty good at fishing my older brother used to take me out why dont you give it a try too they say we can eat whatever we catch
a fishing tournament huh sounds fun but not as fun as reeling in the ladies heh just kidding of course the most important thing right now is preparing for the battle of the eagle and lion after all the ladies love nothing more than a winner and around here theres no bigger game
thats the wrong reason to compete
everyone has their own reasons to fight at least im honest about mine
im sure they do
i knew youd understand professor
hmm  ah im so sorry i was lost in thought
you seem a bit down
its very kind of you to be concerned but i promise that im fine i was just thinking  the death knights true identity could it actually be professor jeritza
what were you thinking about
the death knights true identity could it actually be professor jeritza
gronder field is in the empire right i wonder how well get there i thought i heard that theres no path that goes straight from the monastery to the empire  oh perhaps well travel through alliance territory yes i see from the east we would go hm there ah yes that must be it
holding such a frivolous and downright ridiculous event so close to the battle of the eagle and lion  its absolutely absurd although they did say we could eat whatever we catch im a sucker for a good meal i just couldnt resist
i received a rare letter from my father recently he said that he is praying for the golden deer house to emerge victorious insistently praying my father attended the officers academy and won a glorious victory in the battle of the eagle and lion i think he is quite proud of that even to this day i suppose that shows how great an honor it truly is
hey professor did you hear about the fishing tournament you get to fish in the pond as much as you want the more you catch the more you get to eat
sometimes its nice to dangle a fishing line and let your mind wander id love to spend some time lounging around by a scenic river or lake
why would we go all the way to gronder field its idiocy to travel that far it may be a tradition but it takes forever to get there and is exhausting so pointless i guess theres nothing to be done about it even by you professor
excuse me professor um do you think it would reflect poorly on me if i chose not to take part in the battle of the eagle and lion
yes it would
oh i see 
dont you want to participate
well i dont really want to leave the monastery 
im not very confident but ill try my best
professor do you have a second its about monica does she seem off to you she was imprisoned for a long time but she seems to have recovered almost instantly and shes been bizarrely cheerful
now that you mention it 
you see what i mean i wonder if shes straining to seem happy just to make people comfortable
shes moving on isnt that a good thing
i guess youre right it just seems fast doesnt it
hmm  and why is she so close to edelgard anyway
why are they having a fishing tournament now are they just giving up on the battle of the eagle and lion youre not condoning this right are you
yes im taking part
what if youve got all this free time shouldnt you be spending it on your students
no im not taking part
good im looking forward to seeing you in action i hope captain jeralt will be watching
the situation last month was dire indeed the students endured great hardship i hope you are able to put all of that behind you so that you may focus on this months assignment
of course
a most reassuring response i trust that your class is in good hands
it will be difficult
that is to be expected i too cannot quite shake that feeling of unease even so we must both strive to put that nasty business behind us
i look forward to seeing your skills on display at the battle of the eagle and lion
i have something to ask of you
what is it
leave it to me
i have not even told you what my request is yet well fine
flayn has been through an awful lot this past month to make up for that i have decided to give her whatever she wants i asked her what she would like and she expressed a desire for a feast of fish since im sure the students would be interested i have decided to hold a fishing tournament here at the monastery i have left all of the specifics to shamir please enter and put in your best effort
i hear that you participated in the fishing tournament i appreciate you taking the time
i told my brother i had a craving for some tasty fish i did not realize when i did that it would turn into well this my apologies
im going to catch me some mighty fish just you wait and see er but they havent been biting 
your shouting is scaring the fish
what shouting everyone told me i was too loud so ive been using my quiet voice
maybe the fish are frightened by you
i didnt think of that ah the truth is right in front of me   just kidding as though a fish is smart enough to be afraid of me
can you believe what seteth said catch some tasty fish for flayn im her bodyguard
welcome to the monastery fishing tournament you look confused didnt seteth tell you about it just catch whatever fish flayn requests show any fish you catch to flayn
the fishing tournament is over i heard you did some fishing and that flayn is happy
professor has seteth told you were to have a fishing tournament given the events of the last month i believe this is just the sort of distraction we need staff and student alike
will you take part
im afraid i am not one for festivities i do enjoy a spot of fishing though
are you good at fishing
i do enjoy the sport yet i wouldnt say im particularly good at it
i believe it best that i stick to quietly fishing by myself
the recent happenings at the monastery  there is something going on behind the scenes here ive been commissioned to investigate as well as ive already mentioned this month im off to the kingdom you be on your guard ok
im not worried
well i hope youre right
im more worried about you than myself
 perhaps ive gotten into your head too much i wont go dying on you ive stayed alive this long after all
how are preparations for the battle of the eagle and lion going hm fishing taking it easy are you
i don t know if youve heard but flayn is very special her blood carries a rare crest  oh the lengths to which she could advance my research if only i was allowed to study her if only it werent for seteths strict orders he protects his sister with unusual zeal
you should give up
i dislike it but i agree the time i would spend begging him and accomplishing nothing would be better spent on other research
maybe you can convince him
have you ever tried convincing seteth of anything im not sure i could convince the man the sky is blue if he hadnt already looked up for himself
i always thought i was pretty good you know then i go and get stabbed ugh  but my opponent was the death knight so i figure i did pretty well to only get stabbed i wonder if its true that he is actually jeritza  whoever he is im going to make him pay it turns out that when i get stabbed i get really mad
he hurt you this time next time he may kill you
ill help you get revenge
im not going to let him get the better of me again
when you feel that first refreshing breeze upon your face you know it is almost time for the battle of the eagle and lion gronder field is within the empire but the path there from the monastery necessitates passing through alliance territory f√≥dlans biggest river the airmid river flows along the border between the empire and the alliance you will have to cross one of the largest bridges upon that river the great bridge of myrddin
f√≥dlan is big its not as big as almyra is but its still pretty big
do you want to travel around f√≥dlan someday
travel i dont know  never thought about it i guess
do you want to go home to almyra
why do you think i would want to do that
greetings professor nothing to report young monica disappeared last year i thought she had simply run along home but it turns out she was kidnapped i cant believe it how awful it must have been for the poor thing they say her personality is completely changed but at least she seems more cheerful than before grateful to be alive perhaps
ah i see so you are jeralts child you so resemble your mother
did you know my mother
i did indeed i was acquainted with your parents ive been wanting to speak with you for a while now
who might you be
i am nothing more than a common monk i knew your parents once upon a time
ive been gone from the monastery for some time now because  well it matters not might i ask a favor do you mind terribly picking up some fresh flowers to place upon your mothers grave i am certain shed be deeply moved to receive a gift from you
gronder field is in the empire its actually part of my familys territory   house bergliez it is the largest field in all of f√≥dlan the grain it produces sustains the whole empire wait  i sure hope we dont destroy all that grain
it is considered the most suitable place for a large scale battle
professor if it were up to you how would you approach this battle
i would fight them head on
i would surprise them with clever schemes
that sounds like a certain someone we both know but as you wish well use whatever strategy you think is best if the black eagle house bands together we wont lose
our strength is superior so if we do lose it would be on your shoulders professor
if youre not confident you can do this just sit back and leave it to me
 the most you will do is make things worse youll just get in lady edelgards way
are you two about to fight haha count me in wait no i think we all need to calm down
we have no lack of opponents i am ready to go hunting for our enemies
hunting isnt exactly  well i guess theyre pretty similar actually
im just gonna hide in the fort and cheer everyone on there um is a fort right
sure but its deep in enemy territory how kind of you to offer to cut through for us
what no thats not what i meant ugh good work bernie 
this will be your first battle wont it flayn you dont seem nervous at all
haha i shall give it my all
our battle will begin shortly the flag of the black eagles will soon grace gronder field
so this is to be our battlefield gronder field are you feeling confident professor
very
excellent thats most reassuring
im not so sure
weve seen your power firsthand so we know better than anyone what youre capable of beyond that we believe in you if its not too big a burden i ask that you believe in us as well
we can win im sure of it after all its not as though weve spent the last half year sitting idle and im feeling stronger this moon as though i could conquer a thousand opponents all on my own
thats reassuring
you can depend on me i hope you know that
dont get carried away 
im only joking of course  but perhaps it isnt a laughing matter i beg your forgiveness i must practice levity so that i can provide a more enjoyable joke when the opportunity next presents itself after all i hear that telling jokes is a good way to calm the nerves before heading into battle still i find it quite difficult
well its about time for the battle to begin everyone brace yourselves
hmph all im worried about is finding someone worthy to cross swords with
weve prepared and trained a great deal we should be fine right
youre always so carefree mercie dont forget we need to try our hardest out there so we can win
this is our chance to show how hard weve been working lets do our best
if i emerge victorious in the lauded battle of the eagle and lion the ladies are sure to take notice ill have to go into hiding
ugh is that all you think about actually as long as you try your hardest frame it however you like
haha i shall give it my all
no matter the battle i will never falter
were counting on your guidance professor lets show the world what the blue lions are made of
so this is gronder field  hey teach not a bad place to wage war is it
how so
absolutely
i knew youd understand
plenty of places to hide and our pick of paths to advance through its the perfect battlefield for our tactics i have my eye on that low hill over there see it its the ideal spot to lure our enemies to and then surround them with fire
its risky
fire is unacceptable
gotcha teach i know i know we want all students to make it back to the monastery with you in command we cant lose the imperial princess and the crown prince dont stand a chance
professor claude what are you two talking about
what do you expect its claude i expect he was foisting more of his ill advised schemes on our poor professor
oh you have me all figured out lorenz you know me better than i know myself
win or lose its an honor just to participate in the legendary battle of the eagle and lion
weve got to win so we can show captain jeralt what were made of
yes im ready lets go
haha i shall give it my all
ill just stay quiet and follow along so i dont get in anyones way
that will not be acceptable marianne the whole point of this exercise is for each house to act as one
do your best i cant wait to see how well everyone does
all right sounds like hilda will be taking control of a central hill and watching the battle from there
its almost time come on teach the battle starts now
you all should know  i am not about to go easy on you today
as long as we can pull off the win it doesnt matter how
our victory must be absolute no matter what it may take
it is time
forward now
for honor
the battle of the eagle and lion a traditional contest of strength between the three houses has arrived it will take place at gronder field which lies in imperial territory
the battle of the eagle and lion is set to begin at long last everyone show off the results of your dedicated training
remember were not just fighting for honor theres a prize at stake
its almost time to begin steel yourselves everyone
the black eagles and blue lions are fighting  maybe we can sneak right past them
a stronghold for me to seize splendid
there goes lorenz acting on his own  guess weve got no choice but to capture the central hill and cover him
this could be our chance dedue cut through the golden deer
ingrid make use of your mobility circle back behind the black eagles
mobile force you move up as well circle around to the rear of the black eagles
if you intend to act do it now hubert head toward the golden deer
ferdinand circle around to the back of the blue lions
mobile force you move up as well circle around behind the blue lions
the black eagles and the golden deer are already in battle we should take this chance to break through the black eagles flank
i will draw the black eagles out your highness
yes and while you are doing so we will take control of the central hill
if you stand in my way i will cut you down until you have no blood left to bleed
 
what i was just trying to rally your spirits now to victory
hey princess heads up theres a rat right by your imperial feet 
bah i huh how dare you make a fool of me you will not rile me with such childish tactics
ah so the sheer terror in your eyes was  something else entirely my mistake anyway it was only a joke
you really hope to unsettle me with childish jokes it wont work you must stand and fight
so it is time to cross blades  i never imagined such a day would come to pass
if the empire and the kingdom go to war well be able to fight as much as we please
i am sorry but that is not something to joke about the thought of fighting you is troubling at best
in that case i wonder when youll be able to stomach facing me in battle  do you need a few moments
this is a great chance for me to find out if the sword of the creator really is all its cracked up to be on that note youd better not surrender too quickly
hey your royalness if you promise to let me have the prize ill let you take the honor of victory do we have a deal
enough of your foolishness i  wait a moment you are trying to anger me is that it
saw right through me did you well if theres no deal ill just have to win this thing fair and square
i will happily face you here and now do not hold back claude
how far can i push myself with you as my foe  this will be a great chance to test our mettle do not underestimate me professor or you will fail
im sorry but i must retreat  you should have no trouble winning dont give up
i hate to admit it but it seems this is as far as the black eagle house goes
sorry but its about time i make my exit  the rest of you please finish the job
i hate to say it but it seems were at a stalemate looks like the golden deer wont be winning this round 
i fear i cannot fight any longer im sorry everyone  please continue onward to victory
i suppose my training wasnt enough  the blue lions have no choice but to retreat
that is the end of this years battle of the eagle and lion and the winners are  the black eagles
thank you for your hard work everyone i daresay that prize is as good as ours
that is the end of this years battle of the eagle and lion and the winners are  the golden deer
a victory worthy of a feast we did so well theres no way we didnt secure that prize
that is the end of this years battle of the eagle and lion and the winners are  the blue lions
we won and judging by our performance im certain we have earned the prize as well
edelgard professor that was a spectacular battle you both fought exceptionally well
complete and utter defeat  i would hate to make an enemy of you two
no need to get carried away with praise i know you both feel we won by a paper thin margin and i wont deny it if we were to fight again theres no telling who would prevail what do you think professor
the blue lion house was very strong
i am honored to hear you say that still i must continue to train rigorously
the golden deer house was very strong
im honored and ill level with you   i think that margin is at least as wide as two sheets of paper i mean that
they were nothing
professor well i suppose its ok to let victory go to your head just this once
in any case i hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use
agreed i would hate to know a future in which im forced to cross swords with you
true although the battle of the eagle and lion was originally named after a war between the empire and the kingdom but thats all in the past im sure even the name will one day fade from the pages of history
i hope so
lets do our best to get along
how admirable teach on that note i have a proposition when we get back to garreg mach lets have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses and by a grand feast i mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall
it would be a fine opportunity to know each other better count me in
so be it lets plan to meet up on the night we return is that ok with you professor
im looking forward to it
well celebrate our victory
whats gotten into you today im not used to seeing you this excited
 seeing such a big smile on your face is a rare gift  it makes me feel like i can maybe relax a little too
well done your princeliness im certainly not in any hurry to get on your bad side
i assumed you would attack us head on i clearly need to rethink my opinion of you well done dimitri
you both deserve equal praise for a battle well fought all three houses did extremely well dont you agree professor
the black eagle house was very strong
not strong enough clearly if theres ever a next time know that i plan to wipe that smile from your face
the golden deer house was very strong
its an honor to hear that from a fighter such as yourself but theres no getting around it the blue lions were better prepared
they were nothing
it only seemed that way because of the caliber of your command even now we must not allow ourselves to become complacent
in any case i hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use
i wouldnt mind ill accept a challenge from either of you at any time heh im kidding of course
that is nothing to joke about the true battle of the eagle and lion is best left in the past in fact i wouldnt be surprised if they eventually change the name of this mock battle
i hope so
lets do our best to get along
how admirable teach on that note i have a proposition when we get back to garreg mach lets have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses and by a grand feast i mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall
you really value that kind of thing dont you well i suppose no harm can come from it count me in
i have no objections either and you professor
im looking forward to it
well celebrate our victory
oh well im not sure thats the point  uh professor was that a joke
you look so happy i love seeing you like this i suppose that look on your face is just another boon from this glorious day perhaps the best one of all
well done claude i see your schemes are not to be underestimated
yes i must wholeheartedly agree as ever i have proven to be no match for you
it is the utmost honor to receive praise from your royal   im kidding of course really though i was lucky to have teach on my side in all honesty you two made me work for it if i had to face you again theres no telling which way it would go what do you think teach how did the other houses fare
the blue lion house was very strong
i appreciate that still it is clear that i must continue to be rigorous in my training
the black eagle house was very strong
not strong enough clearly if theres ever a next time know that i plan to wipe that smile from your face
they were nothing
too true teach that just about sums it up oh im sorry thats probably too hard for the losers to hear isnt it
in any case i hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use
agreed i would hate to know a future in which im forced to cross swords with you
i wouldnt mind ill accept a challenge from either of you at any time heh im kidding of course
well now that the three way battle has ended in an alliance victory i daresay its time for some post battle reconciliation the victor has but one request hear me out  when we get back to garreg mach lets have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses and by a grand feast i mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall
hmph i accept your proposition please notify me once your preparations are complete
it seems i have no choice but to drown my sorrow at losing in overindulgence ill help you with the preparations
its not a feast if you dont eat too much leave it to the imperial princess to say such wonderful things
thats not exactly what i said but  ugh forget it laugh all you want
oh if you insist hahahaha hey teach looks like youre having a good time too seeing you smile like that means weve got no choice but to have a great time tonight lets get going
its finally over  there were way too many strangers at that feast
put your chin high bernie it was a chance for you to have growth
but  but everyone was acting so friendly it was overwhelming 
linhardt i wasnt done talking to you if those alliance guys came at it from here and those kingdom guys came from there 
i know i know wed have been able to take them all out at once i heard you im going to bed now
did anyone get the feeling that there were already couples forming thats not really fair is it i wanted to sneak off with someone too 
i was hoping for some tea after our meal anyway would you care to join me
i suppose i can settle for you just this once ferdie
until today i thought it would fall to me to command and guide our ranks all by myself but with you leading us ive gotten to experience what its like to fight alongside everyone  and ive realized  how happy it makes me fighting under your command the emperor doesnt take orders from anyone its their duty to stand alone and lead the entire empire but maybe its better to have someone to rely on  so that you can support and guide each other through the darkness
am i that someone
i am unfit to guide an emperor
i may be heir to the imperial throne but first and foremost im your grateful student that will never change even when i fulfill my destiny and become the emperor i told you long ago that i wished to enlist you in the service of the empire well i take it back now i wish only for your continued guidance during my eventual reign
dont just hide away in the corner professor youre the reason were celebrating
its because of you that ive had the courage to leave my room for a bit each day  im im so grateful professor
we were all just discussing how well you led us remarkable
 your guidance is without parallel professor  i have had practicing of that phrase
your trainings been top notch really
whatever would we do without you
i have had the opportunity to experience much please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more professor
i feel the same  you are something special my teacher
i had a wonderful time today professor as usual i was astonished by how much you ate in the name of celebration really though i must thank you again our victory in the battle of the eagle and lion was thanks in no small part to you
we all did our part
yes that is true but it was your instruction that allowed us to reach our full potential
i agree
thats the spirit theres nothing wrong with acknowledging your own strengths every now and then
i feel silly admitting this now but when you first came to lead our class you unnerved me you never smiled and you never showed anger either and yet you didnt appear to be suppressing your emotions they just werent there at first i thought perhaps you just didnt care for us but i soon concluded that wasnt the case at all for the longest time i just couldnt tell what you were thinking it was as though you had no humanity whatsoever 
that stings
and now
youre different now in the half year weve spent together ive seen the glow of humanity in your eyes and in your actions countless times i am truly grateful to have had the chance to spend this time with you professor
what are you two talking about how dare you get chummy without us
getting cozy are we mind if i cut in
thats enough sylvain
oh please i would love to join you as well i have so many things i wish to talk to you about professor
oh me too i have so much to tell you and i want to thank you too
honestly professor i was only able to achieve so much because you were with us
ashe is right youre irreplaceable to us professor
yes that without you the blue lions  well we wouldnt even be the blue lions at all except for the blue part because wed be sad
i suppose there are worse things than fighting at your side
i have had the opportunity to experience much please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more professor
haha as you can see you have our trust as well as our admiration i look forward to spending the rest of the year with you
as do i
good then lets give it our all this year anyhow  its getting late we had better return to our quarters and get some rest
ugh i cant believe our house leader ate so much he passed out i guess he should just sleep it off oh professor great work today
as long as we have you and claude the golden deer house is unstoppable
i am sure we did not require claude for our victory but it certainly would not have been possible without our professor
haha im so please to be in your class professor you truly bring out the best in us
lets keep fighting and winning
i knew the tactics you learned from the captain would be something else i better work harder to catch up
i have had the opportunity to experience much please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more professor
because of you i managed to get through the fight without feeling like a burden thank you professor
i hear lady rhea and seteth are singing your praises too
you all worked hard
youre always so modest
our opponents were strong too
well i certainly cant deny that
just wait until you see my true power
oh wow i dont doubt it
you really showed them teach i would really hate to be on your bad side
oh look claude has been revived
your tactics were ingenious and youve somehow mastered the power of the king of liberations relic you really are incredible though you can be a bit absentminded at times your mind is like a giant bowl with a tiny crack in it 
claude saying that only makes your own mind bowl seem tiny
how dare you my bowl is much bigger than teachs unfortunately it doesnt just have a crack the whole bottom of my bowl is missing
in other words you are the absentminded one not our professor
thats true he just admitted it
hehe
its unusual to hear you laughing marianne your smile is really cute
i agree you really dont know how beauti   eh  never mind
it feels so great to laugh and joke around like this doesnt it  hm well look at that someones having a secret rendezvous in the courtyard 
all joking aside im having trouble sizing you up teach the honest truth is that id hate to have you as an enemy if possible i wish for you to fight by my side if i could use the sword of the creator we wouldnt even be having this conversation i bet if i could use it you would trust me to  right that selflessness may be what i like best about you
you fought bravely during the battle of the eagle and lion
comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the great tree moon the students have grown significantly i suppose i should praise your efforts
i can only call your deeds during the battle of the eagle and lion quite versatile
comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the great tree moon the students have grown significantly it is clear that this is a result of your guidance
in appreciation of your efforts and to show our high hopes for the future of your students i award you with this
please continue to instruct your students as a model teacher
so youve made good use of all my power after all i would have been upset if you had failed at such an easy task
it pains me to assign such a disturbing mission to you during such a blessed moment in time  however next month your assignment will be to journey to remire village to investigate an abnormal occurrence there
remire village  if i recall youve been there with your father many times
an abnormal occurrence
i have yet to ascertain the details but it would seem the villages have been acting strangely i have already dispatched the knights to verify the authenticity of this information they should be back shortly i suggest you begin by finding out what they have discovered
i pray this is not a bad omen  may the goddess protect you all
/***EOF***/
when the warm winds blow from the sea to the south of adrestia residents of f√≥dlan know that the rainy season is upon them before the heavy rains take their toll young women hurry to pick the last of the white roses the ivory buds are woven into garlands and given as gifts to close friends or potential lovers
professor i have a new mission for your students
we have received reports that lord lonato has rallied troops against the holy church of seiros
who is lord lonato
why would he do that
lord lonato is a minor lord of the kingdom he has been showing hostility towards the church for some time now
a vanguard unit from the knights of seiros is already on its way to his stronghold castle gaspard lord lonatos army is nothing compared to the knights its quite possible the rebellion has already been suppressed
even so i would like for your class to travel with the knights rear guard to deal with the aftermath
war zones are unpredictable we do not expect you will have cause to battle but be prepared for the worst
excuse me you sent for me lady rhea
this is catherine she will be leading the knights whom you will be accompanying
nice to meet you weve heard a lot about you if you need anything just ask
she is one of our bravest knights and that is no small feat only an exceptional few have what it takes to join the knights of seiros this mission should prove useful in demonstrating to the students how foolish it would be to ever turn their blades on the church 
you have spent quite some time in here engaging in such idle chatter do you not know that we do not have a moment left to waste
i had forgotten
forgotten i dont believe that is the truth no it is more likely you were dreaming the whole day away you must try harder from now on
i should have listened more intently
you must try harder from now on
even within the knights of seiros catherine is the strongest by a large margin from what ive gathered why not seek her out as a sparring partner professor
lord lonato must know that his efforts are futile yet he cant help but fight if i were in that situation i would do whatever it took to ensure victory you can count on that
doubtless there are times when one must take up their blade even if theres no chance of winning but this  its downright senseless lord lonato knows better if he had enough allies to back his rebellion it would be a different matter 
allies
how so
ah my apologies i was just thinking aloud this whole situation is a bit too strange for my liking even with the necessary preparations in place there is always a chance that something unexpected will occur please be ready for anything professor
after faerghus lost its king there were many rebellions it is likely lord lonatos provocations are related how frustrating that i am too young to take the throne rendered powerless by age  if the throne is vacant much longer the kingdom will fall to ruin
first that bandit business and now a noble rebellion are we ever gonna do anything but find and subdue people well if were just going to tie up loose ends at least itll be pretty safe i dont mind stretching my legs for this one and if catherines going too theres a good chance well get a look at her relic in action
hey teach theres some minor noble rebelling in faerghus right he has no chance of winning i wonder what he hopes to achieve  huh are you going along to help sounds like an easy victory but good luck out there
something about this situation doesnt feel right why would a minor lord raise an army against a foe he cannot possibly hope to defeat
my central duty as a noble is to protect the commonfolk i abhor those like lord lonato who deliberately shatter the peace utterly disgraceful
he must have his reasons
i hope no one is hurt
you have a kind soul professor now i feel a little sheepish for showing anger and not empathy i apologize for my impetuousness
i heard about your classs assignment by the way good luck subduing those treasonous nobles
professor i feel i must speak to you about caspars eating habits ive never seen the likes of it he inhales entire plates of food in mere seconds
sounds unhealthy
hence my mentioning it to you good luck with him
he must have a healthy appetite
if that is a polite way of calling him a goat im inclined to agree
todays meal was delicious linhardt keeps bothering me about eating too fast says im gonna choke or something
its not safe to each so quickly
youre really gonna agree with that guy why is no one here on my side
when youre busy theres no alternative
absolutely i knew youd see things my way
‚ô™hm hm hm hm hm  ‚ô™ h huh um is someone there what do you want
professor about this months assignment  raising an army against the church really though it looks like we wont be fighting its still quite unsettling my understanding is that it will all be subdued rather quickly
are you going to fight alongside the knights of seiros hmm  let me know if you meet anyone i might be interested in ok
the plants of f√≥dlan are different ones than in brigid and people here are unknowing of the spirits who watch over the earth and bless it only the goddess is known is that factual
this flower is one that is eating insects is that factual too i am wondering who watches over the plants in f√≥dlan 
his highness is strong but on the front lines anything can happen losing him would be devastating for faerghus i hope the church understands that
best be on your guard
catherine hm her skill is impressive ill admit so is her sword but i think shes hiding something nobody knows anything about her past you should spar with her shes strong stronger than you are id bet
ngh  please professor there must be some mistake lonato would never raise arms against the church at least he never said anything to me about it
whats going to happen to lonato if hes killed i  i dont know how ill live with that
professor have you seen felix around i swear as soon as you take your eyes off him poof hes gone
i saw him at the training ground
ah of course hes there sorry for bothering you professor thanks
i saw him at the dining hall
ah right it is meal time sorry for bothering you professor thanks
dont you love looking after horses i do they repay your absolute love and trust with the same i wish girls were so easy to deal with 
ive heard whispers about lord lonato they say he is a very kind and gentle lord why would such a kind man suddenly raise an army oh professor you were working late last night werent you you shouldnt overdo it a ghost might rise up from the well to get you if you stay you too late or so im told
were going on a mission with the knights right i wonder if  oh  sorry its nothing i was just wondering if someone ive been searching for might be among them
youre looking for a knight
yes well maybe if hes here hes probably a knight though its also possible he became a monk 
i hope you find whomever youre looking for
thank you im definitely going to find him one of these days
to be honest ive felt a bit lost here at the monastery at a loss for what to do thankfully a sweet young girl reached out and offered help i believe shes seteths little sister
why does his highness take the side of the people of duscur i just dont understand it only four years ago they murdered our king and slaughtered the soldiers and knights who were with him all of whom were innocent even if he can forgive them i cant not ever what theyve done is against all codes of honor and ethics
we are truly blessed with how fertile the monastery grounds are every day theres something new to harvest
its a nobles duty to protect the commonfolk not to endanger them by rallying armies in such a feckless and improper manner abuse of that kind is no better than slavery a proper noble must guard the people from such a fate wouldnt you say
i agree
precisely why true nobility is well respected
we dont know all the details yet
there can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation let us put an end to this quickly
hey professor do you happen to have any food on you im starving no matter how much i eat before i train im always so hungry after my muscles must be going through a growth spurt
this place has so many breathtaking works of art i feel like im living in a museum each piece can teach us about styles and techniques from a thousand years ago
do you know a lot about art
im from a family of merchants so ive been able to see a lot of art but i wont pretend to be an expert
do you like art
oh yes very much im from a family of merchants so ive been able to see a lot of art
ah professor it would seem that a minor lord in faerghus is raising an army  this poses a threat obviously but not one for the kingdom for the church i mean faerghus doesnt even have a king at present theres something unsettling about this army you had better ensure were fully prepared
the monastery grounds are far too spread out feels like it takes hours to get from one area to another and no thats not because im getting lost im a fully capable mature person who never gets lost
oh hello professor  um was there something you needed
i came to see the horses
oh you like horses i like them too theyre such kind creatures
im just looking around
i see i wont bother you then 
professor your clothes are a bit dirty if you dont pay attention to your hygiene the girls wont like you i hate when my clothes get dirty thats one of the many reasons i find it best to train as little as possible
professor your clothes are a bit dirty id have expected you to be more careful seeing as how youre a professor and all i hate when my clothes get dirty thats one of the many reasons i find it best to train as little as possible
im studying here so i can be the best there is just like captain jeralt do you think ive got it in me to be a top tier mercenary professor
that depends on how hard you work
im going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here i can tell you that
you really want to bring the money in huh
i do though its about so much more than being rich its about honor
pointing a sword at the holy church of seiros is akin to pointing a sword at the goddess herself meting out appropriate punishments to the sinful  it is a sacred duty with which we have been entrusted as a member of the church yourself i hope that you will take that to heart
if you have a moment i would like to have a word it has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have been making advances towards flayn you wouldnt happen to know anything about that would you
not at all
actually 
if you do see anyone getting too close with flayn please inform me of it at once
if the flowers within the greenhouse are removed they will soon wilt and whither  is that not so professor i feel i can empathize with them  the flowers flowers that thrive despite their environment are truly inspiring are they not
past here is the holy mausoleum where the saints of the church of seiros slumber sorry but only a select few members of the church are allowed entry its open to the public on only one day of the year for the goddesss rite of rebirth
here to train you really are as hardworking as they say
thats an overstatement im just me
spoken like a true hard worker
thats right im a force of nature
huh maybe the gossips wrong hardworking people usually dont like to make a big fuss about it
what i desired fresh air
thats not like you
true 
the wind feels nice
hmph
castle gaspard eh ive been there once before many years ago  it was by request of the son of that family  christophe i think it was
im sorry but i must vent to someone professor youre familiar with manuelas slovenly behavior yes that woman she borrowed a book last week and returned it with stains of unknown origin on the cover and several pages either folded or torn just now she dropped a sandwich on the floor picked it up and kept eating when she saw my shock she said simply three second rule ugh
did you hear theres news of someone in the kingdom raising an army the kingdom the empire the alliance  they do love a good war dont they spilling the blood of young men and women and for what just to enjoy the horror of it
professor i heard that you may battle alongside catherine even among the knights she is something special‚Å† a holy knight who is able to wield a heros relic still she can be a mite difficult
hey professor hows it going making lots of coin id love to catch up but im super busy right now working for money you understand
greetings professor nothing to report have you talked with catherine yet if the knights are the cream of the crop shes the cream of the cream oh and that relic of hers i hear its nothing short of amazing
since were heading to castle gaspard that means well be passing through magdred way the road is well known for its beautiful surroundings depending on the time of year it can be incredibly foggy though when its like that you cant enjoy the lovely scenery  lucky for us it shouldnt be too foggy while were there not that well have time for sightseeing anyway
i hear that lord lonato served the king of faerghuss older brother when he was younger or something like that he already had status and prestige so why raise a rebellion eh i guess its none of my business
catherine has invited me to train with her how much do you think i should train before im ready to train with someone that strong
lord lonato  he used to stay at the monastery rather frequently he was such as pious man a true believer  such a terrible shame i wonder what changed him 
next month is when a very important ceremony will be taking place at the monastery pilgrims from all corners of f√≥dlan have already started to gather in anticipation i pray that you are able to nip this trouble in the bud as soon as possible
things we cant obtain here are likely obtainable by way of the underground are you unfamiliar with garreg machs underground the place is an absolute paradise for those who cant stay above ground
those abyssian idiots all they ever do is cause trouble wed best purge the entire underbelly of garreg mach
no matter how powerful our enemies may be there is no need to worry so long as were with catherine the mighty wielder of thunderbrand
thunderbrand
what are you talking about
you mean you dont know my weapon is called thunderbrand its one of the heros relics a long long time ago the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes which were passed down to their descendants its an honor to wield but im afraid there wont be any chance for that today our mission is to help clean up the aftermath not to fight
one must wonder why lord lonato would incite such a reckless rebellion
it all goes back to the tragedy of duscur 
ive heard of it
i remember that day well no one saw it coming
i dont know much about it
roughly four years ago the king of faerghus was murdered by the people of duscur i believe that about sums it up correct
to put it simply yes but theres more to that story they had accomplices within the kingdom as well lord lonatos son christophe was one of them and so he was handed over to the church for execution
the church executes criminals
speaking from the churchs perspective we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the kingdom which was in complete chaos
why was the king targeted
king lambert was attempting a major political reform needless to say he had many enemies
i have to say  its a real honor to accompany such a brave and distinguished knight none other than catherine wielder of thunderbrand
thunderbrand
you mean you dont know my weapon is called thunderbrand its one of the heros relics a long long time ago the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes which were passed down to their descendants its an honor to wield but im afraid there wont be any chance for that today our mission is to help clean up the aftermath not to fight
why would lonato incite such a reckless rebellion
you should know more about that than any of us ashe
well i dont lonato never mentioned anything of the like to me
he probably didnt want you getting caught up in his own personal vendetta
is ashe related to lord lonato
im lonatos adopted son he raised me as though i were his own blood he was always so kind i dont understand  i guess it has to do with christophe
what vendetta
how much do you know about the tragedy of duscur professor
ive heard of it
i dont know much about it
its when the king of the holy kingdom of faerghus was was murdered by the people of duscur it happened about four years ago 
its ok catherine please go on
right well lord lonatos son christophe was accused of being involved in that whole awful affair he was executed by the church
the church executes prisoners
speaking from the churchs perspective we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the kingdom which was in complete chaos
why was the king targeted
 
king lambert was attempting a major political reform needless to say he had many enemies
it really is an honor to accompany catherine wielder of thunderbrand i hear youre intimidating enough to silence the howling winds
thunderbrand
you mean you dont know my weapon is called thunderbrand its one of the heros relics a long long time ago the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes which were passed down to their descendants its an honor to wield but im afraid there wont be any chance for that today our mission is to help clean up the aftermath not to fight
why would lonato incite such a reckless rebellion he had to have known he had no chance of winning
it all goes back to the tragedy of duscur 
ive heard of it
i dont know much about it
you must be joking where have you been traveling that news of it didnt reach you
it happened about four years ago the king of the holy kingdom of faerghus was murdered by the people of duscur that about covers it right
to put it simply yes but theres more to that story they had accomplices within the kingdom as well lord lonatos son christophe was one of them and so he was handed over to the church for execution
the church executes criminals
speaking from the churchs perspective we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the kingdom which was in complete chaos
why was the king targeted
king lambert was attempting a major political reform needless to say he had many enemies
whatever the truth behind that incident may be lord lonato has harbored resentment to the church ever since well  to be more specific his grudge isnt only against the church its also against the one who turned christophe over to them 
report the enemy is approaching they cant be avoided their numbers are far greatly than we predicted they used the fog to slip past the knights perimeter
it looks like our mission just changed professor everyone prepare for battle
your house must help the knights of seiros suppress lord lonatos rebellion at castle gaspard though you are told not to expect combat the deep fog at magdred way sets you ill at ease 
with this fog its impossible to tell where the enemy might be or how many of them there are the enemy could be trying to surround us but they shouldnt have enough soldiers to form a tight circle take down anyone who breaks through the fog and lets push through
that smell  its fresh blood it seems the battle has already started within the fog
shouting from within the fog  it seems the knights are already battling
the conditions are the same for both sides  but were at a disadvantage for not knowing the terrain
proceed with caution wait for them to enter your field of view
you can earn a reward if your allies do not suffer heavy losses be careful not to let your allies flee
 lord lonato doesnt deserve such sadness and anger  now its your turn to suffer
  why lonato why did you drag so many others into this
you would think were just gonna do nothing while you try to kill our lord
the fog is lifting as a result of the dark mage being defeated it seems the fog was being caused by magic
i wont let you anywhere near lord lonato
 its you thunderstrike cassandra it was your wretched zealotry that killed my son
 the only name i answer to is catherine prepare to taste the blade of one who serves the goddess now you face a knight of seiros
 the fog has cleared theres nothing left to hide you or the filthy central church from the judgement of the goddess
lord lonato  please dont die 
im sorry but i dont believe lord lonato has the strength to carry on
i am sorry  but did you really think you would get away with this
 the nobles start the war but its the commoners who spill their blood first 
 you have been deceived by that witch  i will show you the truth
 you i will be the one to kill you no other
 you have lost all sense of justice  you want to fight me so be it ill send you to meet your goddess
 stand down ashe i must destroy these evil doers by any means necessary
 please surrender lonato whatever your reason for doing this we can still talk it out
 rhea is an infidel who has deceived the people and desecrated the goddess we have virtue and the goddess herself on our side
 even if all thats true dragging the townsfolk into it like this isnt right
 enough if that is how you feel prepare yourself im putting an end to this
i apologize your highness it is regrettable that we should cross swords like this
lonato i sympathize with your position i really do i have no wish to kill you but i am afraid you have left me no choice please forgive me
your highness  i cannot stop here for my child and for the people of f√≥dlan if you will not stand aside then i have no choice but to cut you down
  that vile woman  christophe  forgive me 
  lonato i 
 i never thought id see lonato meet this fate  well done everyone lets gather our troops and go
damn it it was all so pointless ive never seen so many people utterly heartbroken 
forcing innocent citizens to risk their lives  that man was not a noble but a monster
what could have pushed lord lonato to this point
everyone was a bit shaken by the militia fighting alongside our enemies
no use dwelling on it
that is the reality of battle
if only everyone could face reality so unflinchingly the commoners who allied themselves with lord lonato believed they were fighting for a just cause it would be disrespectful to consider them simply victims when they died for what they believed in still we have no choice but to eliminate those who cling to unreasonable ideas of justice even if our enemies are the gods themselves we must never lose sight of our goal
thats taking it a bit far
is it such a day may come whether you expect it or not you should be ready
agreed
im surprised to hear you say that
really im just like lonato i too will be the sort of ruler whos willing to risk the lives of my citizens in service of a higher cause its not possible to change the world without sacrifice dying for the greater good is not a death in vain
professor  im afraid this incident is far more serious than anticipated
why  why did this happen lonato was always such a kind man  everyone in the village was was so nice to me and i i killed them i killed them all i had to i know i had to  i know that but still  what does that make me
please dont beat yourself up ashe we did what had to be done
im im sorry i shouldnt be bothering you im im going to check on the town i hope my brother and sister are ok
that that was my first time killing civilians too  those who im sworn to protect
it was a necessary sacrifice
that is the reality of war
are you insane those werent knights or soldiers but fathers and sons we we shouldnt have killed them we should have found another way  i im sorry its not fair for me to blame you for the circumstance i know that if we hadnt done what we did even more civilian lives would have been lost at least my mind understands that but my heart  professor  those in power no matter the era always claim they fight for a just cause that they take life to protect it but  is it truly ok to take any life you please all in service of some implacable just cause lord lonato didnt take up arms out of a lust for power he simply believed his cause to be just whos to say it wasnt maybe we didnt have to cut him down like that maybe we could have reached a mutual understanding found a path of peace i i have to believe that perhaps the notion sounds laughable to you mere lip service to naive ideals but i cant believe otherwise
sorry to intrude but this incident may be more serious than anticipated
nice work teach still that fight left a foul taste in my mouth that aside did you see how catherine fought
shes incredible
agreed i thought the power of the heroes relics must be exaggerated but i was clearly wrong
im stronger
ha i love the confidence teach but youre no match for the heroes relics theyre on a whole different level
makes you wonder about that legend 
what legend
oh its nothing just the usual fanciful nonsense an ancient relic that once cut a mountain in half with a single swing thats what they say anyway but as amazing as thunderbrand is i dont think it fits that description apparently relics can harness tremendous power for those with a compatible crest though you can technically use one so long as you have any crest at all i dunno long story short id like to try cutting a mountain in half someday
ooh are you talking about relics youll be able to wield one soon claude i just know it after all youve already been selected as the next head of house riegan
easy there hilda i dont know how apt soon is my grandfather is still unbearably healthy oh is this news to you teach yours truly was recently recognized as a legitimate child of house riegan they possess one of the heroes relics too though ive yet to see it
just recently
i officially joined house riegan only last year before then i lived with my father
you havent seen it
i was raised by my father house riegan is on my mothers side of the family
when i learned that my mother was the daughter of an alliance noble i was so surprised i thought the whole world was pulling a fast one on me for a week
so that means your mother is duke riegans daughter right where is she now
i cant say my mothers currently living in a different world than the one she grew up in and has no desire to return home
um ok you sure have a lot of secrets dont you
im just keeping a promise to my parents make of that whatever you will in exchange for my so called secrecy im free to do as i please which is why i decided to see what the other side of my family was like thats how i found out about this strange crest i bear 
professor claude it sounds like the troops will be withdrawing soon we should return as well
we won we should be celebrating instead were heading back with heavy hearts 
whoa there whats the matter you look as sad as a kitten without any yarn if we hadnt done what we did the rebel army would have followed this road all the way to the monastery and they would have crushed all the little villages along the way we stopped that from happening you should be proud
sorry to intrude but this incident may be more serious than anticipated
i found this on lord lonato its a note that mentions a plan to assassinate lady rhea we cant tell who sent it so the source is suspect but the content is too disturbing to ignore we must report this to lady rhea right away i hope that its nothing 
i am glad to see that you have returned safely the goddess is gracious with her divine protection but it was not only her divine protection that shielded you was it you are just as skilled as i had hoped
my students deserve the praise
i am not so sure
i still have much to learn
there is no need for modesty
i heard some of the students were hesitant about fighting militia however we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers even if those sinners are civilians i pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens
our real concern is what catherine reported the secret message that was in lord lonatos possession it contained a deplorable plot to target the archbishop on the day of the goddesss rite of rebirth the plan seems unrealistic at best but a threat is a threat we must maintain constant vigilance to that end i would like for you and your students to help with security on the day of the ritual
you can count on us
that is most reassuring you have my gratitude
we wont let her down
that is most reassuring you have my gratitude
wont that endanger the students
even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best they should be fine so long as they have you on their side
the rite of rebirth is of paramount importance it is when the church of seiros and its believers unite to pray for the return of the goddess the archbishop and i will be confined to the goddess tower once the ritual begins of course the knights will be on high alert as well but there arent enough of them to keep watch on every corner of the monastery it is far from ideal to be forced to mobilize students but the gravity of this situation requires that we all bend to avoid breaking
while there is no need to fear for my safety we cannot turn a blind eye to those who would blaspheme so heinously
with any luck this will all be for naught still be on your guard
/***EOF***/
long ago the guardian seiros made an appearance during this moon she had been summoned by the goddess whose soul was suffering as the flames of war raged across f√≥dlan some believe that high in the sky above seiros the immaculate ones mighty wings are what powered the strong winds carrying the guardian and her forces into battle
youre here again  professor  youve been crying so even you cry sometimes oh  i suppose that was thoughtless of me to say
yes it was
long ago someone said the same to me
its fine
my teacher youre so blinded by grief that you cant see whats going on right in front of you
are you waiting for time to heal your wounds or have you curled up in a corner and lost the will to carry on
does it matter
it does youve lost yourself
how could you ask me something like that
its not like you to speak to me like that you know id never ask you a question without purpose
only you can truly understand your own sadness others can sympathize or even empathize but all anyone else can offer are the tears of an outsider looking in so i have no intention of crying for you or of standing still with you all i can do is promise to reach out my hand when the time comes for me to move forward
what do you mean
the mysterious organization that was carrying out experiments in remire village and the chapel  theyre up to something near garreg mach the archbishop has sent the knights to undertake a large scale investigation no information has surfaced yet but our enemies will soon be discovered when they are will you lead us into battle or will you just sit here with no thought for the future that is fast approaching my teacher  there is a choice to be made i hope you make the right one
my my she really is quite arrogant she spoke her mind without an ounce of reservation but she is right the time has come to stand again you already know what your answer is
oh thank you you saved me
if you were to die then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed preventing that was my only aim im afraid you must remain kronya there is something i need you to do
oh of course i am always happy to cooperate with solon leave it to me
how annoying
flame emperor  is she offending you unfortunately we cannot take our eyes off her so there is nothing to be done you are our greatest creation we used the defiled beasts blood as the fuel to your flame that you may burn even the gods now is the time to cleanse f√≥dlan of that power and bring forth our salvation
there will be no salvation for you and your kind those responsible for such gruesome deeds in duscur and enbarr
all so that you may acquire the strength you need all for a purpose 
what are you going at this hour ooh i know  you are eavesdropping i must admit that i approve
professor we must remain quiet 
i see  the flame emperor and monica and the mage who rescued monica
its time for revenge
not yet professor
what is that guys name
i dont know but if we keep listening we might be able to find out
an unexpected change to hear their plans patience patience
oh thank you you saved me
if you were to die then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed preventing that was my only aim im afraid you must remain kronya there is something i need you to do
oh of course i am always happy to cooperate with solon leave it to me
how annoying
flame emperor  is she offending you unfortunately we cannot take our eyes off her so there is nothing to be done you are our greatest creation we used the defiled beasts blood as the fuel to your flame that you may burn even the gods now is the time to cleanse f√≥dlan of that power and bring forth our salvation
there will be no salvation for you and your kind those responsible for such gruesome deeds in duscur and enbarr
all so that you may acquire the strength you need all for a purpose 
ive got you  finally 
wait
dont go out there
lets keep listening
if we dont act now well miss our chance
 hmm 
hmph even if someone has overhead us there is nothing they can do there have always been rats in the walls and there always will be
 
no  the dagger 
whats wrong
what about the dagger
it no never mind it couldnt possibly be so professor those are the ones we must destroy theyre the bastards who killed my family and jeralt for now lets return to the monastery and regroup as for the flame emperors dagger ill hold on to it for the time being
day 5 of the garland moon i picked some flowers for her and returned home the look of joy on her face at the sight of these flowers will be even more beautiful than the flowers themselves  yeesh that is enough his entries from before your birth are full of such romantic blatherings as that oh  it must be deeply moving you to hear such things but now is not the time for whimsy someone is here you do not wish for them to see you in this state so pull yourself together
i thought i might find you here teach not the type to wallow in solitude eh thats a relief let me tell you so  what were you reading is that jeralts 
diary
so it is
love letter
the contents are certainly bittersweet  but i think its jeralts diary
hey maybe this has some entries from when jeralt left the monastery
is that so  he was the captain of the knights but something made him leave the monastery in a hurry if it has something to do with your birth knowing what happened may get us closer to knowing what secrets the church is hiding  teach  would you mind letting me read that diary i know how important it is to you but im not asking lightly please allow me to borrow it
you may borrow it
im forever in your debt teach if youd refused i wouldve had to sneak in here in the dead of night i wasnt looking forward to that prospect anyway let me fill you in on whats been going on lately and not just as thanks for pointing me to that diary
i cant allow it
wait are you really saying im going to have to sneak in here in the dead of night to read it i know how important it is to you but im not asking lightly please allow me to borrow it
rhea dispatched the knights to various locations in a frantic search for the enemy theres a rumor that shes already secured some information something big is gonna happen soon that has me wondering  if you find out where the enemy is what will you do about it if you ask i  no scratch that all of us students would gladly lend a hand even if it means going against rheas wishes dont forget it now go everyones worried about you youd better show them youre in good spirits
if you must weep then weep i shall be here for you
thank you
well it would be ridiculous not to feel anything after something like that go on and let it out i am here
that wont be necessary
are you already past it you are unflappable i will give you that much in that case i will remain silently supportive you are right that we must keep moving ever onward
professor im so happy to see you youre finally returning to your old self to see the light in your eyes again is a gift it inspires me to carry on as well as you know the knights are searching furiously for any trace of the enemies who escaped ill inform you immediately if i learn anything relevant
what happened to jeralt  its terrible if theres anything i can do simply ask even if what you desire is revenge ill gladly lend you my power we cant let them get away with this
professor welcome back  i was  we all were   youve been on our minds know that your enemies are my enemies i will do all i can to help you find justice there is no one else i can  my strength is yours alone i will fight as you command  i will kill anyone should you ask it of me
im so sorry about what happened to jeralt  no of course my sorrow is nothing compared to yours the knights are even now searching for our enemies whereabouts they are to report back the moment they find something if you desire revenge professor you can count me in
hi teach i see the storm in your eyes has passed  youre looking much better ive been reading jeralts diary the baby he mentions  thats you isnt it i cant understand about half of whats written on here  but jeralt really cherished you that much is clear
i havent lost a parent yet so i cant even begin to understand how you must be feeling  but even while youre standing still the world keeps on moving i always find that oddly comforting
ive never been much for condolences how about a little logic instead the knights have spread out around garreg mach in search of jeralts murderers thus the monasterys fighting strength is for the moment at least depleted perhaps that was the enemys real objective we should be prepared for further confrontation
ive never been much for condolences
professor please lend us your ears ferdinand is saying impossible things
i do not see what is impossible about it all i said was that if you want to go back to brigid you probably can you are the empires guest so to speak they cannot afford for something bad to happen to you there would be a diplomatic incident someone close to us has turned up dead so one could argue that youre not safe here anymore
you were already told i am learning here from the academy what are you thinking professor
you do not have to leave if you do not wish it
you may return home if you please
i am not returning to home until i have grabbed my goal i will not be listening to the words of ferdinand
no look i did not mean to pressure you apologies for the misunderstanding
i slipped quietly into the vault and rummaged about looking for anything we might find useful there is a group of people who want to kill us after all what this is no time for asking permission i learned long ago that one can ask permission or forgiveness it is rarely useful to request the former still it appears that the knights have already taken everything useful there were crest related objects i thought might be worth studying so  there you go again with that stern look of course ill put them back when im done assuming they bear no additional use
im not even close to being strong enough i mean jeralt was so much stronger than me but even he  thats enough i cant dwell on the past theres no way to know what my future holds but i do know one thing whatever happens i have to make my own way in this world i have to keep pushing so i can grow even stronger
professor i um i brought some flowers for jeralt
thank you
its the least i can do sometimes i feel like all i do is run away 
youre out of your room 
hey sometimes i go out for uh walks 
anyway ill go lay them out
ive sung lyrics lamenting death many times on stage  but when something like this happens in real life  im lost i dont know what to say but i do know this much  sir jeralt must have been very proud to have you as his child
it is a shame what happened to jeralt i am sorry there are no words leave some flowers on his grave for me
dark expressions dont suit you professor but im  well im glad to see you out in the world again it seems this month will be a quiet one around here there arent many knights around to liven things up
most of the knights are gone seeking out the enemy
isnt that a bit much i agree its important but is it a good idea to neglect the safety of the monastery
what do you think professor
it would be a shame if we were invaded
i agree we can send some knights after our enemies but so many it makes the church seem reckless
youre worrying too much
hopefully the knights finish their business and hurry back i wouldnt mind having a few extra lances around
not just tomas but monica too we cant be sure who to trust anymore can we who are these people really what do they want
im so glad youre ok professor i was so worried
oh professor you must be starving mercie and i made some sweets for you we were thinking that if you were to eat something sweet it might help you feel better
thank you for the thought
baking sweets is my specialty im sure theyll do the trick
im fine
well of course you are and if you have sweets youll be even more fine
im so sorry  i never quite know what to say at times like these  just dont push yourself too hard too soon its ok to allow yourself to be sad right now losing someone dear to you  well each loss is unique but its a feeling i know very well that said  professor i 
there is no one here who has not heard tales of jeralts valor we have suffered a most dear loss i do not know what the enemys aim was but i do know this after what they have done we cannot suffer them to live if there is anything i can do to ensure that justice is brought swiftly you need only give the word
youve gotta keep yourself active during tough times professor even if it seems impossible thats how i got through when i lost my parents if you need help with anything just come and see me eating and training are my specialties
im scared i feel that i dont understand the world how could something like that happen to jeralt he was so strong
even though youre scared push through
youre inspiring professor ill do my best
what happens happens
i suppose but  please take care professor we cant afford to lose you too
im sure you will pull through this because youre so strong professor best to stay calm during such tumultuous and upsetting times we dont know the nature of our enemies if we underestimate them anything could happen
but if we dont defeat them 
i agree they must be defeated but i also feel we must approach this with prudence
we should be careful
yes i agree i dont want to lose you too professor
professor people are saying horrible things about marianne theyre saying shes friends with the bad guys if i hear someone say that ill 
leave it alone hilda it doesnt matter
just ignore it
of course thank you professor
well defeat the bad guys well show them
that would be the quickest way to resolve this come on marianne lets give it our all
ill say a prayer for jeralts soul theres not much else i can do 
professor it seems like youre holding up ok but  im worried about leonie she really loved jeralt i hope she can bounce back 
captain jeralts gone hes gone and wed only just reunited  im sorry im sorry im sure this is even harder on you but i just cant  i cant believe 
professor  how are you holding up i know how heavily grief weighs upon ones heart  i lost my mother some time ago it was  forgive me my moment of weakness even all these years later i cannot recall that time without feeling the pain as if it were brand new just know that i am praying for your mind and your heart to find peace
first tomas and now monica i do have a theory though i admit it is nothing more than speculation both tomas and monica have each gone missing at one time or another it was reported that when monica returned from her disappearance she began to act like a completely different person as if perhaps the real monica had been killed and replaced by an impostor thinking of it like that it is possible that this solon had been impersonating tomas for some time how they managed such a convincing change of appearance though i still do not understand
you have lost your father  now more than ever do i understand how very lucky i am that you were able to save me professor i deeply appreciate what you have done thank you if there is anything at all i can do in return please tell me ok
youve lost someone very dear to you  im so  you have my sympathy manuela and i can take on some of your workload this month we cant do all the teaching but at least we can lighten the load for you ive always seen strength in your eyes i know youll recover youre a very strong person
i have something rather uncomfortable to discuss its about the weapon that killed jeralt will you listen
ill listen
it was a dagger but i know enough to know it wasnt an ordinary dagger it wasnt made of iron or steel because  well because whatever it was the wound it left wasnt normal who could make a blade like that do you figure
i wont listen
i see  thats probably for the best
i wonder who they were 
oh goddess hear my prayer please receive this beloved person when the cold rain washes the body when the bird and wolf announce the dawn  receive them into your blue blood receive them into a twinkling star thats a mourning scripture from the church of seiros lady rhea taught it to me i pray that jeralt is happy in the next world
i heard jeralt passed away  my deepest condolences i knew him long before i ever even met you  he was always so much fun to be around  its such a loss 
professor  thank you for all you have done for us nothing to report today sobs
professor i know where the enemy is  where solon is theyre in a place called the sealed forest close to the monastery the archbishop is gathering the knights to begin a search shes doing so in secret behind our backs
why in secret
she must be afraid that a thirst for revenge will compel you to seek them out now that you know will you give us the order
no i will not allow it
this discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest it is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there they are the ones who took jeralt from you  i know how you must despise them but i must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now
you cant stop me
please professor do not act carelessly i ask that you leave this to us losing you so soon after losing jeralt would be unbearable
lady rhea our professor is not acting out of revenge sending us out there is the most strategic move we can make you cant deny it most of the knights are still far away not only does our professor wield a heros relic but there is no one here who is more powerful seteth and the few remaining knights cant leave the monastery unattended we have fought under our teachers command countless times we are the most effective army here and we are already prepared for battle we have no idea what the enemy is plotting we must act now
professor  do you agree with this strategy
understood i will give you the order destroy the enemy that is hiding in the sealed forest  you have the protection of the goddess on your side whatever happens you shall overcome
lets go my teacher whatever happens do not lose your conviction out there
professor have you heard they say weve finally located the enemy it seems theyre hiding in the sealed forest right near the monastery lady rhea has summoned all of the knights to return and take them down and all of this is being done in secret why to keep us no to keep you in the dark
why the secrecy
lady rhea likely assumed you wouldnt be able to stop yourself from confronting the enemy if you knew their location but that is not how this story ends is it professor  were at the ready order us to depart and well fight at your side
no i will not allow it
this discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest it is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there they are the ones who took jeralt from you  i know how you must despise them but i must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now
you cant stop me
please professor do not act carelessly i ask that you leave this to us losing you so soon after losing jeralt would be unbearable
lady rhea seteth please try to understand our reasoning before you refuse with most of the knights still far away we cannot afford for you two to leave the monastery undefended the enemys strength is yet unknown the only warriors who likely stand a chance are those who wield relics with all that in mind its obvious who should be dispatched is it not if the professor leaves we will go as well weve already made preparations and are ready to depart at a moments notice surely you must see that we cannot wait any longer for the knights to gather please  do what must be done and give us the order
professor  do you agree with this strategy
understood i will give you the order destroy the enemy that is hiding in the sealed forest  you have the protection of the goddess on your side whatever happens you shall overcome
no matter what enemy we face we will not fail i promise you that
teach tomas  i mean solon and his lackeys their whereabouts have been discovered apparently theyre lurking in the sealed forest not too far from the monastery rhea has called back all of the knights who were out searching to round them up seems like it could take some time for them to make it back here but she didnt ask for our help
why keep it a secret
perhaps to prevent you from running headfirst toward revenge its only natural that you would leap at the chance for it anyone would
no i will not allow it
this discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest it is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there they are the ones who took jeralt from you  i know how you must despise them but i must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now
you cant stop me
please professor do not act carelessly i ask that you leave this to us losing you so soon after losing jeralt would be unbearable
listen rhea erm lady rhea this move is the most strategic the military strategy im devising will soon echo across f√≥dlans history im sure of it just think about it most of the knights are still far away and we cant afford to have seteth and friends abandon the monastery so the only person who can take action now also happens to be our best commander its teach and wherever teach leads well follow and since youve taught us that this sort of thing is always a possibility were already prepared for battle we can buy the knights more time not for revenge but for a defensive attack on behalf of the monastery
professor  do you agree with this strategy
understood i will give you the order destroy the enemy that is hiding in the sealed forest  you have the protection of the goddess on your side whatever happens you shall overcome
we have our orders teach now all thats left is to pull out a miracle
we are now within the sealed forest we must not let our guard down
professor  well avenge jeralt for you no matter what
remember  it is a bad idea to get distracted by revenge
i have readiness our enemies will be taking we will take our enemies down
well its not like we have any other missions this month i suppose this is as good a way as any to spend our energy
linhardt spending energy we had better finish this fast before the pigs start flying everywhere
lower your voice the enemy could be close
it is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life
professor i know im the one who insisted we come here but dont doubt for a moment that the enemy is waiting for you
lady edelgard what are you saying
what other objective could they possibly have we have no clue what kind of trap is waiting for us please be careful my teacher we cant afford to lose you 
the enemy is strong but you will prevail you must
the sealed forest is up ahead stay alert
this is for captain jeralt i will not falter
it is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life
leave it to us professor ill give it my all
fighting tomas  it will be difficult thats for certain
i dont really love the idea of fighting people i know 
we dont have a choice even if its difficult an enemy is an enemy weve just got to get it over with
just kill them from behind as long as you dont see their faces you wont know if you know them
we wont know unless we see their face  yes i suppose that is true professor  i hope you know i meant what i told you before your enemy is my enemy and i will follow you until the end whatever that end may be
thats reassuring
lets do our best
yes right well fulfill our duty together weve come this far we cant stop now i hope you know that you can rely on us no matter who the enemy is we are prepared to cut them down
yes  no matter who they may be 
the sealed forest is up ahead visibility is awful there so everyone needs to be extra cautious
you seem to know a lot about it it is just a forest isnt it
have you been there too oh  never mind listen just like i told the archbishop this is not a war of vengeance its a riddle so to speak those guys are undoubtedly planning something terrible we need some kind of clue as to what the attack on the holy mausoleum that foul business in remire the demonic beasts at the chapel  it cant go on we need to figure out their objective and stop them from achieving it thats our mission
so we have our mission now we had better not fail
it is a difficult task but we will succeed
it is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life
an enemy whose objective you dont understand is a frightening prospect
were gonna destroy em its our mission

ill admit vengeance sounds pretty nice but dont forget that were here for information luckily we can easily find what were looking for while getting revenge for jeralt right teach
in the pursuit of justice for jeralt you and your students find yourselves deep in the sealed forest
look there demonic beasts i suppose they arent holding back
demonic beasts the enemy was always intending to lure us here

solon  stop this
the time has finally come to unleash the forbidden spell of zahras upon our enemies
please help me 
begone with you fell star
that could only have been magic what happened to our professor
they were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell an eternity wandering in a void of darkness never to return to this world  to think we almost had the sword of the creator 
youre lying our professor is alive i know it
thats right our professor is no ordinary human
it is hard to fathom that our professor would die in a place like this
it is possible that death has yet to find your friend but there are worse things than death drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape  overwhelmed with hopelessness  it must be torturous
youre already boasting a victory but know this  if you did use such devious tricks to stop our professor  i swear that you will regret it
i cannot help but agree with her this once even if our professor is trapped in darkness that is not the end of their story
i will not forgive such arrogance if you prefer it so you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead
what was that sorcery what happened to our professor
they were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell an eternity wandering in a void of darkness never to return to this world  to think we almost had the sword of the creator 
thats a lie theres no way the professor is really dead
thats right our professor is no ordinary human
i do not believe our professor has fallen
it is possible that death has yet to find your friend but there are worse things than death drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape overwhelmed with hopelessness  it must be torturous
we cannot abandon hope your highness our professor lives i know it
youre right we will save the professor but first lets destroy this fiend ill slice you into a thousand pieces as we watch with horror  you will know true pain before i finally allow you to die
how trite but if you wish for pain i shall oblige if you prefer it so you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead
wh what was that where did you go professor
they were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell an eternity wandering in a void of darkness never to return to this world  to think we almost had the sword of the creator 
i dont believe anything you say our professor is still alive
thats right our professor is no ordinary human
i refuse to believe that teach would die in a place like this
it is possible that death has yet to find your friend but there are worse things than death drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape overwhelmed with hopelessness  it must be torturous
hey all i hear is good news teach is still alive and if thats true then theres only one thing to do defeat you while we wait for teachs triumphant return
prepare yourself we will avenge our leader here and now
how trite but if you wish for pain i shall oblige if you prefer it so you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead
 
you fool
what were you thinking charging right into an enemys trap are you just a boulder that rolls down whatever hill its on no even a boulder has more sense
im sorry
apologizing wont make things right this darkness is terrifying
i can explain 
excuses wont help us this darkness is terrifying
as you and i are one  i too am trapped within this void but please consider this  this realm of darkness we are in is seperate from the world from which you came i mean that it would take a god to leave this place in time our hearts and minds will cease to be are you prepared to die
i am
how very brave of you to joke at times like these 
i am not
i thought as much i also do not wish to die and yet 
there is no other choice 
what choice
do you recall your fathers diary he said you were a child who never cried nor laughed i think i am the one to blame i must have been asleep but even then i feel i was a part of you i do not know how rhea managed it but she allowed me to exist inside of you the truth is i have always been with you it is within you that i found my power yet again the power of a goddess the power of the progenitor god
 
my name is sothis by now you must be well aware of what that means i am the one who watches over f√≥dlan and the creatures dwelling there i am sothis she who died then returned
i cant believe it
somehow i know it to be true
there is only one thing left to do to save us from this darkness of eternity i must now use the power of a god however i lack a body of my own and so i must relinquish all the power that i have to you the time has come for you and i to join as one and when that comes to pass then i shall disappear
disappear
i wont allow it
when i say disappear i do not mean that all i am will be no more my soul will join with yours and you and i will never be apart but i will no longer have a chance to speak with you i shall miss it so long have i been on this path with you through you i got to see and hear this world i even got to chastise you from time to time i may not have acted like a goddess but it was certainly fun for all that you have done  thank you im glad that it was you to whom my fate was bound
thank you for everything
now  we must pray for if we share this wish our spirits two will join as one  your wish is to return to the forest stop the enemy and rescue the little ones no need for words i know your heart as though it were my own 
your will and mine are now as one both sides of time are revealed to you and you alone
you know i am the beginning what shall you do
so the fell star consumes even the darkness itself 
professor  it is you right i knew that you would always come back to us id like to ask about your appearance but for now lets dispose of our enemies
what did you see in the darkness of zahras this should be impossible the only being that can withstand that darkness is  unless i dispose of you myself i may never have the chance to send you back there
but this is not the end  thales will carry out our mission somehow 
its over now professor about your appearance 
professor  that is you isnt it i am glad you are safe i was sure that you would return please tell me all that happened to you later for now its imperative that we kill the demon
what did you see in the darkness of zahras this should be impossible the only being that can withstand that darkness is  unless i dispose of you myself i may never have the chance to send you back there
but this is not the end  thales will carry out our mission somehow 
thales  does he also serve the flame emperor it cant be 
teach  you are teach right i always believed in you  i knew you could cut your way out of anything
what did you see in the darkness of zahras this should be impossible the only being that can withstand that darkness is  unless i dispose of you myself i may never have the chance to send you back there
but this is not the end  thales will carry out our mission somehow 
i guess this is still far from over 
i have no time to waste on the likes of you 
to think that i would lose to mere beasts
i am terrified by you  even though an emotion like fear has no place inside me that means you must be eliminated
so this is how it is  i cannot let you live
you stole the words from my mouth you lost the moment you failed to kill the professor
that hair and those eyes  you remind me of someone what happened to you
the goddess gifted me her power
the goddess i see  well im happy for you your weapon is called the sword of the creator after all its no wonder she looks favorably upon you just as it was with saint seiros no doubt  and just how will you use this new power professor
for the people of the world
heh that is so like you to say that
for my students
for us i see 
for myself
that is no answer you must use your power for something greater than yourself
tell me  if the world and your students included were to divide and go to war with each other what would you do in that scenario each side would represent both the world and your students who would you  
professor have you fallen asleep this must be a side effect of your recent changes i cant just leave you here 
i shouldnt ask hubert to carry you so i suppose it falls to me 
professor  im glad youre ok and you seem relatively unscathed im im so relieved whats more jeralts foe is dead though we took little satisfaction from it professor  i must ask what happened after we were separated you look different
the goddess gifted me her power
the goddess appeared and gave you her power its as though the legend of old has been made flesh its hard to grasp in all honestly but having seen you pierce the sky with my own eyes i find myself unable to doubt it
a legend of old
yes the legend of saint seiros it is said that she received a divine revelation from the goddess and was gifted with her power long ago the goddess dispatched seiros to defeat an evil king who went mad with power perhaps the goddess saw the goodness of seiros within you too and wished to help you in your quest to defeat evil hm if youre seiros granted power by the goddess then i suppose that makes me  ah never mind im getting carried away
professor whats wrong are you uh  are you asleep what is happening these days well it matters not we must get you help and fast
sorry professor but i have no choice but to carry you back
teach we won ill be honest when i lost sight of you i broke into a cold sweat but jeralts killer is dead alls well that ends well
thats true
true 
youre kidding right i understood putting it off while we were in battle but now that its over just go ahead and spit it out that hair those eyes that unfathomable power what happened out there
i will tell you 
you mean to tell me that an entity who claims to be the goddess was living inside your mind and its been that way since you were a baby and this goddess entrusted all of her goddess like power to you and then vanished 
its a difficult story to swallow teach but the way you look now  i guess ive got no choice but to believe it how could something like that happen there must be a clue in jeralts diary if you believe the diary theres a high possibility that rhea did something to you when you were born thats likely when all this began what in the world happened to you as a baby and what was rhea after
teach whats the matter did you trip or  wait are you sleeping this must be an effect of the goddesss power i wonder if teachs body can handle the strain 
think claude what now should i carry him on my back easier said than done 
 in times flow see the glow of flames ever burning bright  on the swift rivers drift broken memories alight 
professor you must remain still
where am i
what happened
everything is all right there is no need to worry those who are trying to harm you are far away
  how lovely it would be for this moment to last forever  i wish i could hold on to this time we have stolen  that you and i could create a world without end  i have heard whispers of what happened to you your appearance  you have received power from the goddess from the moment you took hold of the sword of the creator  i prayed that one day the radiant power of sothis which bathes f√≥dlan in its celestial light might reside within you but you are so much more than the light you are my  close your eyes dear one sleep just a while longer
i will be watching over you always always and forever

as you have already been notified your mission is to subdue some bandits our students have been learning about combat through study but this is a precious opportunity to provide them with practical experience the knights will support your mission and are prepared to offer their assistance if necessary in short this is no mock battle you must be prepared for anything you will receive a message from the knights when it is time to depart until then use your time wisely
the last time we fought bandits you saved me maybe i can return the favor this time
lets do our best
dont get careless
the knights are well aware of our enemys strength we can count of them to keep the battlefield under control for us it seems unlikely that we would lose still lets do all we can to prepare
this will be our first true battle im looking forward to fighting alongside you professor
as am i
im a bit concerned
during the mock battle your commands were thoughtful and thorough as was your strategy with you on our side im confident we will prevail it seems we have some time to spare before our departure lets use this opportunity to prepare as best we can
more bandits not very original teach
not interested
you need to focus
well as long as youre with us at least things wont be boring in fact  it may take a turn for the interesting and with that i take my leave to make my final preparations
you seem well are you adjusting to life at the monastery
i think so
oh i didnt expect that answer when we were mercenaries i handled everything outside of battle you didnt have much contact with people did you i thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you but i guess i was wrong to worry
not quite
well i didnt expect it would be easy on you when we were mercenaries i handled everything outside of battle you didnt have much contact with people did you i thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you it seems i was right to worry
by the way i heard about those bandits your first assignment is to take them out right thats fairly routine for you by now but dont forget its the first real taste of battle for those brats itll be tougher to sleep at night if you let one of your little pupils die so stay vigilant and lead them well i wish i could offer you my support but lady rhea wont allow it for now ill try to figure out what she wants from you i dont mind you settling into your life here but dont let your guard down ever
  a girls voice  what could it mean
for some students this will be their first time stepping onto a real battlefield its important that theyre mentally prepared as for me ha do i look green to you is there anything you wish to ask me about regarding spending your time at the monastery or battles
just as students have much to learn from other students professors can also share their knowledge with each other you should consider seeking instruction from professor hanneman or professor manuela i think youll find their insight quite interesting
which house a student is assigned to depends on where theyre from that said each professor has their own area of expertise so if a student is adamant about it it is possible to switch someone from one house to another pending your approval of course if you become closer with the students by partaking in the various activities around the monastery youll be able to talk to them about such things
youre quite powerful to have beaten us in the mock battle such a shame you arent leading our class 
we have only just arrived at the academy and were already being sent out to take care of bandits it is a noble mission but one that will likely require battle in practice there is little difference between a battle and a war even with the support of the knights of seiros we must still brace ourselves for the challenge do you have any other questions about life at the monastery or about battle
just as students receive guidance from professors professors may also guide each other if youre interested you should seek out professor hanneman or professor manuela
a students house is determined by their place of origin but naturally each individual has their own aptitudes and interests that said if a student so desires and their current professor consents they may transfer from one house to another if you get to know the students better through the activities at the monastery they may approach you about this
your performance in the mock battle was exceptional professor you have inspired me to follow your example and study even more diligently perhaps we could train together sometime i would love to test myself against your sword skills again
those bandits really didnt think things through did they they had to have known the knights would be after them the moment they entered the monasterys turf fine by me though im raring for some real combat experience any chance to grow is a good thing is there anything else you want to ask me teach about living at the monastery or combat anything like that
students arent the only ones who have something to learn from their professors professors can also learn from each other if you want to you should try trading knowledge with professor hanneman or professor manuela
the house a student belongs to is determined by where theyre from but it is possible for someone to switch to a different one of course thats only if the student very strongly wants to make the change and their professor is on board with it if you do a lot of different activities around the monastery youll get closer to students and they may ask you about it
i hear youve been tasked with hunting down bandits right meanwhile my class is stuck with a downright peaceful mission sounds like youll be fighting alongside the knights too dont let the monastery down teach
i fully accept the necessity of real battle from time to time but it is still a surprise to be tasked with punishing bandits without warning it is a rather different sort of mission it makes me wonder what the archbishop is planning 
ive heard your class is hunting thieves that mission is very different from the one we were given
do you know of the aegir family we have long held the position of prime minister in the empire the empires power lies with six noble families my family foremost among them the full explanation may be time consuming i can give you a moment to get ready if you would like to take notes
im not taking notes
im ready
all right i will list the six great noble families theres caspars father count bergliez the minister of military affairs then theres linhardts father count hevring the minister of domestic affairs beradettas father count varley is the minister of religious affairs huberts father marquis vestra is the minister of the imperial household finally we have duke gerth the minister of foreign affairs and my own father duke aegir the prime minister one day i will take his place as the prime minister of the empire i am more talented than anyone in my class   even edelgard i will lead the empire to a bright enlightened future
i look forward to that
that sounds like wishful thinking
there is nothing i cannot achieve
swimming through a sea of countless books tracking down that single sought after volume  its absolute bliss how do the poor fools who spend their days sharpening swords and polishing armor find any joy in life
hey there professor you here to check in on my training oh that reminds me i found this small cloth its kinda weird not really sure what it is but it works great for wiping up sweat
 
wh what is it im not doing anything
its not good to just do nothing
im not bothering anybody am i
hey whats this cake doing out here
cake oh come on  thats just cruel
oh professor  hello i was just looking for my  well its its like a pale blue cloth have you seen it
lets search for it
eh um  ok 
ill tell manuela
thank you so much
brigid has much more warmth than f√≥dlan even spring here has coolness and you professor which do you find is worst too hot or too cold weather
the cold
i have agreeance in brigid i am able to be wearing much lighter clothes
the heat
but you are wearing many things professor if you are not liking the heat you should be wearing lighter clothes
it is better if you do not approach me if you spend too much time around a man of duscur there will be rumors
for years the boar prince and i were inseparable i know him better than almost anyone else so let me give you some advice beneath all that princely polish hes an animal nothing more hes strong and skilled sure but dont place your trust in him as a human being take care he doesnt chew you up and spit you out
its thanks to my adoptive father lonato that a commoner like me is here at the academy he is the very model of chivalry someday im going to be just like him
professor youre the one taking out the bandits heh thats one way to start your career at the academy i didnt realize theyd order us to risk our lives here seems a bit extreme doesnt it
our first assignment is to take out some bandits did anyone tell lady rhea that peoples lives are at stake i lost my own brother to bandits   is something someone has said at some point im sure ok not my finest attempt at humor
the cathedral is nice and quiet its so relaxing  oh professor did you come to pray to the goddess
thats right
me too shall we pray together
i did not
no but shall we pray together while youre here
ive got to find out everyones likes and dislikes so i know what to cook who knows when it will be my turn at kitchen duty how about you professor do you like sweet or spicy food
sweet
ooh same ill definitely remember that
spicy
spicy ooh your tastes are so mature ill definitely remember that
felix sylvain and i have known each other since we were children his highness as well though i should warn you that both felix and sylvain are a bit challenging at times the moment i take my eyes off them theyre off causing all kinds of trouble its always been that way
now that youre all the way over here professor care to join me in some training after training i love tending to the horses or burying myself in a good pile of books ahh theres truly nothing better
it is the duty of every f√≥dlan noble to demonstrate piety toward seiros have you also come to offer your prayers to the goddess professor
sure
you dont sound terribly sure perhaps you are not of noble birth after all devotion is not as essential for a commoner
not exactly
i see the truth is i am not a particularly devoted believer either but it would be unbecoming for a noble like me to neglect his prayers wouldnt it
the next assignment is to track down bandits sounds like some training is in order tell me something professor when it comes to a one on one battle which is better strength or skill
strength
i knew it when its all said and done muscle always comes out on top
skill
you might be right but when its all said and done i still think muscle comes out on top
im so glad to be a student here if only because i get to use this library reading books from all the regions of f√≥dlan  i feel almost like im visiting those places myself
you should visit them in person
id like to i dont have many chances to travel 
you can learn so much from books
i agree theyre brimming with the knowledge and experience of our ancestors
there were way too many vegetables in todays meal the ratio of vegetables to sweets was completely skewed  oh hi professor were you just eavesdropping on me well everyone knows a plateful of sweets is far preferred to a plateful of vegetables regardless of age
um professor our next mission is to go after a group of bandits im not very confident im afraid ill just hold everyone else back i should probably stay behind for this one or help plan the attack instead
uh hello um if youll excuse me 
im bored maybe i should go into town  but that would be such a hassle oh hi professor im rather busy right now so do make it quick
you dont look busy to me
ah you can tell i suppose being a professor has taught you how to ferret out time wasters
if youre busy never mind
are you sure i thought youd found me out for a moment there 
professor hey do you know how old captain jeralt is
thats enough leonie if i dont know how could my child know
its not normal to forget your own age you know its kind of worrisome actually
by the time youre forgetting your own age youre past the point of caring
i guess if you put it that way youve got a point 
thank you for paying me a visit is there anything troubling you or is there perhaps something i can help you with
i wonder if the students are taking to me 
you seem to be getting along well with the students i would advise you to be confident in your abilities the rest will fall into place in time
about the teachings of seiros 
believers live their lives by her sacred wisdom please use the librarys vast resources to learn more
i can often be found here so if there is ever anything you need please do not hesitate to pay me a visit
inside the cathedral there is a chapel dedicated to the four saints do you know of them saint indech saint macuil saint cichol and 
saint cethleann who is your favorite professor
now that you are a member of the church be sure to familiarize yourself with our teachings and traditions
oh professor how are you today im just heading out for a mission ill be seeing you
good luck
i dont need luck this will be a piece of cake ill be back before you know it
be careful
what make you say that do you know something i dont are there supernatural elements at play ghosts ah oh forget it ill be going now
have we met
no sorry must be my imagination
you look bored care to duel
a duel
to the death
what i just wanted to spar 
excellent work guiding the students in the mock battle taking command like that simply splendid and bearing the unknown crests power yes im talking about you your talents are incredible and lady rheas insight as to your potential is doubly so
you know professor there are some things ill just never understand like the other night i went on a date with a dashing handsome strong young knight oh im a bit weak just remembering him anyway  do you know what that no good jerk said when we got back to my room he said what a mess im afraid to go in there can you believe it you know who cares about keeping everything neat and tidy not me thats who afraid to go in there some knight he is
do you know about the cardinals they are the ones who run the church their identities are a closely guarded secret 
that person sure does remind me of somebody but i cant figure out who oh do ya need me for something sorry but im really busy right now
hello there are you that new professor everyones talking about names anna im a merchant who slings wares all around f√≥dlan  and beyond i come in here all the time so im sure our paths will cross more hopefully much more
greetings professor nothing to report are you settled in here at the monastery yet make sure to have a good look around theres much to see like fish you do know about the pond behind the dining hall right you can fish there give it a try
we will accompany you on your assignment we dont want anything to happen to our precious students if any of you run into trouble well step in and help out
the knights of seiros are also known as the shining knights we are the sword and shield of the divine seiros there are many orders of knights in the world but we are the only one that has the honor of bearing the name seiros as a member of the church you should probably study up on the history of seiros and the knights
i hear the officers academy of the monastery was founded about two centuries ago the eastern region of f√≥dlan was being invaded by almyra and so the archbishop of the time took measures to prevent the border from being taken in order to ensure f√≥dlan would be safe from potential threats she deemed it necessary to raise a generation of excellence that is how the establishment was founded though its purpose has changed over the years
zanado the red canyon is a place of great significance to the church of seiros even members of the church are forbidden from entering without permission to go trampling around in there causing trouble  those bandits truly are morally reprehensible
brigid almyra duscur  even people from far off lands gather here at the academy word of advice professor there are those who dont think kindly of such people
perfect timing professor i just received word from the knights theyve located the bandits
it seems they have them cornered they are in zanado the red canyon
i cant wait to get started ill strike down those heinous thieves before they know what hit them
charge ahead if you must caspar just do not put the rest of us in danger
im going back i wont be of any help anyway and i dont want to get hurt
dont worry bern its just some bandits well have no trouble at all
eh dont get ahead of yourselves unfounded optimism isnt a great strategy lets just get this over with
there is nothing to get over we will work with each other to achieve our mission
you seem excited to get out there
im not sure about this 
its time professor give us our orders and lets move out
professor i just got word from the knights that the last of the thieves have been cornered
just as planned theyre in zanado the red canyon
we certainly cant allow those underhanded thieves to get away lets work together and do our best to take them down
it matters not who were up against they will not harm his highness
hmph were just fighting common thieves right i dont expect much of a challenge
arent you a spoilsport im actually quite excited myself who knows  there may even be some cute lady thieves
hmm well at any rate a real battle is a great opportunity for us to see how far weve come
true the mock battle was a success well be fine so long as we stay the course
so much excitement 
i hope everything turns out all right
perhaps we are a bit overly excited but remember that we have the knights on our side all should be well ah and speaking of the knights i heard that jeralt is once again one of the knights of seiros perhaps well have the good fortune of seeing you two fight side by side
this isnt a game
weve fought together many times
oh of course i apologize for letting my childish whims get the better of me in all honesty im a bit jealous my parents are no longer around
what do you mean
no longer around
they they died both of them im all that remains of them now  anyhow im sorry to bore you with such things id say its nearly time for us to depart eh professor
hey teach glad you could make it weve been waiting on you
it seems the knights have our foes cornered they are in zanado the red canyon
its bandit time that sounds like real knight work lets get to it
im itching to put my skills to the test as well we have to win so captain jeralt can see how much ive learned
i thought jeralt wasnt coming with us either way ill give it everything ive got
um  even if i go its not like id be of any use 
thats enough of that if we dont work together and give it our all we are doomed to fail
you can be pretty intense sometimes lysithea but i agree lets do our best
everyone is so eager
i wonder how we will do 
if we fight half as well as we chatter well be fine cmon teach lead the way
so we are taking children into battle are we i am not certain i will be able to sleep soundly after beholding something like that  i shall allow you to turn back the hands of time but know this power is not infinite
so this is the red canyon  a ruin of sorts by the look of it lets end this quickly the thieves must have been driven back be careful or the cornered mice might bite us
the red canyon  this is the first time i have ever been here its like walking through a ruin lets get this battle out of the way professor the thieves must have already been driven back
so this is the red canyon doesnt look red to me  anyway lets get things started teach looks like the thieves have been driven back thats what we last heard so no surprise there
the knights chased us all the way here
chief lets get out of here theres no way we can win against them
shut your dumb mouth where would we go at this point you cant be a thief if you fear death
professor i hear theres a back road to the west why dont we split up and attack from both the west and the front if we advance tactfully we can attack our enemy from both sides i leave the rest to you regardless we must cross the bridge first
regrettable but there was no other way
allow me to clean this up for you lady edelgard
these ruffians are no match for a noble like me
i i killed them what have i done the blood 
are all real battles this exciting come on lets get on to the next one
i dont care if theyre stealing can i go home
so is making us experience a real battle part of the churchs teachings
people and beasts are as one calm your heart and do not be worried about this killing
thank you for leading us professor though i suppose there was no way we could lose to a familiar foe in any case something about this canyon feels inexplicably strange
according to our information there is a back road to the west lets split up and approach from the west and the front if we advance cleverly we attack from both sides and gain the advantage ill leave the rest to you professor but before all else well need to cross the bridge
i know they are just thieves but this never gets easier for me 
finished already i was hoping for more of a challenge
if id hesitated  that wouldve been me
i had to do it dont hate me please
i cant relax here we need to prepare for our next battle
i did it see im a great fighter
i hope the goddess blesses them to rest in peace 
still whole and sound i hope 
we have defeated the thieves well follow the knights instructions for what to do next you led us well professor
i hear theres a back road to the west how about we split up and attack from there and from the front we may be able to corner the enemy by approaching from both sides in any case we need to cross the bridge first ill leave the details to you teach
we were taken by surprise last time but  i guess this is what we can expect when battling thieves
it is a nobles duty to guard the welfare of the people nothing personal
i was planning to just sit back and watch but hey i got one
im sorry  i didnt have a choice
this is my first real fight i guess im pretty strong
a precious opportunity to test my own strength i wont make waste of your deaths
please forgive me goddess and save their souls 
this is what ive trained for
those thieves ran out of luck when they entered this canyon they never had a chance your leadership was amazing teach lets leave the rest of the work to the knights
we stole this treasure its all ours theres not way were gonna give it up to some knights
damn theyre coming from the west too i cant stand these brats
sending these brats instead of the knights means theyve underestimated me big mistake
i should have never listened to that idiot  what a mistake 
y youre  it cant be the mercenary from before so what now youre pals with the knights ill kill you and your pesky brats
spoiled little noble just die like a good little rich kid
do you really think being born a commoner gives you the right to kill despicable
spoiled little noble just die like a good little rich kid
unfortunately for you i will not oblige you will regret all that you have done
spoiled little noble just die like a good little rich kid
being noble has nothing to do with who you are as a person or how hard your life is your logic is illogical
 
i remember this being a peaceful place 
since when has it been called the red canyon 
  
hmm  i wonder why it is that you recall this place  you must be weak of heart each time i speak it scares you so
im sorry
although the battle is at an end do not feel too at ease
you surprised me
although the battles at an end do not feel too at ease
im not scared
do you think you can lie to me it saddens me to know you wish to hide such things from me
well anyhow  i am quite fascinated by this place as far as i can tell this is your first time here 
still it feels familiar
how very odd i wonder if somehow my memories have  hmm
have you been here before sothis
here i daresay it would be impossible to have forgotten such as place as this
i must admit i am unsure beyond the name and this strange feeling of familiarity i cant seem to remember anything about this place and yet a great depth of emotion is tied to that sense of familiarity like joy and sorrow pain and love and all things in between  if i was somehow here before i wonder what took place 
professor i was wondering where you were  its about time we headed back to the monastery
professor we should return to the monastery soon were all ready for the journey
teach what are you doing here we should get back to the academy
it is time to depart but know that time reveals all things one day i will remember that which i have lost  oh by the way it seems youve earned my gratitude the thieves who came here are no more
why are you grateful
why are you 
i am not sure myself yet i am grateful all the same in any case  you must become accustomed to my voice if you fall down with shock each time i speak that just wont do
oh  you think youre standing strong of course you are it was a jest
on our way out i had the chance to observe the red canyon  did you notice anything professor
what are you talking about
oh i suppose it was only me then
i did
of course i expected as much
the area was covered in ruins each more curious than the last they did not match the architectural style of any era or culture within the empire or across all of f√≥dlan for that matter that can only mean one thing  the valleys civilization must have flourished and fallen in the distant past long before the empire was established who do you think lived there
our ancestors
a culture long since perished
subterranean beings
 heh its possible they werent even human
hmm perhaps their remnants still influence this world 
were finally back ill leave the report to lady rhea in your hands professor
huh  edelgard
does the black eagle house have a mission to see to remember on a real battlefield one can never tell whats to come you can never dismiss the possibility of a worst case scenario take care edelgard
theres no need to state the obvious dimitri but tell me  why the concern perhaps you doubt my abilities if so your lack of insight is disappointing
thats not what i meant if ive offended you i hope youll accept my apology
dont worry about it professor we must hurry everyones waiting on you
i suppose i should be off too try not to let her get to you dimitri i promise you theres no need for concern
hmm 
why are you so worried
ill tell you all about it some other time
puppy love
hahaha now thats a lark i had no idea you had a sense of humor professor ill tell you all about it some other time
hey teach on the way back you seemed transfixed by the canyon did something happen there
its nothing
nice try but you cant get anything past me you saw something or felt something im sure of it but hey if you dont want to share thats fine by me everyone has their secrets
actually 
it seemed familiar to you huh cant say the same maybe its a memory from when you were a child or from a past life anyway if you cant remember i guess there isnt really much more to be said
although ill admit there is something about that canyon that has me captivated as well how did zanado come to be called the red canyon nothing there was actually red 
so you have safely disposed of those bandits i pray that their souls find salvation but why did they target the students to begin with we must further investigate the true cause of all that took place until we know more i ask that you support the students and relieve them of any unnecessary worry
of course
i will do all that i can
good i have high expectations for you by the way how was your time in zanado legend has it in ancient times a goddess alighted upon this world in that very canyon for a goddess from heavens zanado could only have been a temporary haven
a goddess
a temporary haven
long ago the divine seiros received a revelation from the goddess a gift to help the lost the goddess is always watching over f√≥dlan from her kingdom above however in ancient times the goddess graced this world with her presence and offered salvation to the people here she is the mother of all life the arbiter of every soul
i didnt know
my father never told me
i see during your time here i pray that you come to devote yourself to the teachings of seiros
uh lady rhea i am sorry to interrupt there is something i must ask about in regard to those bandits 
as you wish we shall continue our discussion when next we meet
a goddess  i have no memory of her but then  i have no memory at all oh how bothersome it is as though i know and yet i dont perhaps zanado was my home back when the goddess walked the land if so  what does that make me now a ghost
that must be it
are you simple thats impossible i am most certainly alive
i dont know
hmm  no that cannot be i am most certainly alive
of course we also have the mystery of why im here with you is it somehow connected perhaps some past regret is stopping me from moving on and now im forced to stay with you instead  no thats not it i cant believe in such a meaningless existence i  i 
/***EOF***/
the ceaseless rains that satiate the verdant landscape of f√≥dlan are accompanied the fierce winds and mighty roars of thunder this abundance of rain sparkling as it falls against beams of emerging sunlight is a constant reminder to the people of f√≥dlan that nature is ever wild and unpredictable for when the rain finally does pause the clouds part to give way to a glorious rainbow
i have a new mission for you professor i would like for you to take your students into kingdom territory to eliminate some thieves
they stole a heros relic from house gautier of the holy kingdom of faerghus the lance of ruin their leaders name is miklan he is apparently a disowned son of house gautier
why was he disowned
i believe it had something to do with his lack of a crest such happenings are fairly common within the kingdom
the crestless cannot harness the goddesss power even if they possess a relic nonetheless they are still capable of simply wielding those weapons
why must the church eliminate him
this skirmish involves a holy relic and is therefore more than a single noble is capable of resolving
the heroes relics are immensely powerful weapons we must meet this threat with adequate force unfortunately most of the knights of seiros are away from the monastery purging the apostates of the western church so we are entrusting you with this mission after all you wield the sword of the creator which is more than capable of opposing any relic
the sword of the creator is a powerful weapon well beyond the other relics you have nothing to fear however to ensure that no harm comes to the students we will also send the monasterys most skilled individuals to aid you
i must remind you that you are expected to conduct yourself in a manner befitting the wielder of that holy sword also you should know that professor hanneman has been looking for you that is all
professor i heard about our mission for this month a thief with a heros relic is worrisome but with you at our side im certain we can handle him after all you have the sword of the creator it was allegedly wielded by nemesis the king of liberation if the legends are true you hold the power to stand against entire armies a band of thieves should be nothing even the most elite imperial forces or the knights of seiros could not hope to defeat you
why does it matter
im just marveling at the potential besides your power does not lie solely in the sword of the creator
it would never come to that
is that so even if those forces were to hurt someone precious to you can you say with full confidence that you would not turn your sword on them if that were to happen you know your power does not lie solely in the sword of the creator
you are stronger and more terrifying than you realize professor  when we leave the monastery will you still think of yourself as my teacher
what do you mean
if we left the monastery
never mind im being thoughtless with my words for now lets just focus on the problem at hand
i heard about our mission for this month so  we are to eradicate thieves in kingdom territory im sorry for dragging into the kingdoms petty squabbles this should not be your burden to bear but my own 
im happy to help
its just a job
thank you professor hearing you say that puts my mind at ease
hm
your highness ah its been ages
its been a long time two years if im not mistaken
indeed your highness youve grown so much in those years i hardly recognize you
whos this
a friend of yours
this is rodrigue an old friend of my fathers i believe ive mentioned him if you recall when my father died four years ago he looked after me as though i were his own son
 you flatter me your highness it was my honor to care for such a fine young man its nice to finally meet you professor my son felix has mentioned you on occasion
what brings you to the monastery rodrigue is it the thieves plaguing the kingdom
im afraid so this is not merely a problem for house gautier but for everyone the thieves have set up their headquarters in fraldarius territory and are mercilessly pillaging the villages of that area you have our full support in stopping those dastards i thank you for your help both of you
hey teach i gotta say i never wouldve guessed you were a descendant of the king of liberation you didnt forget did you that story i told you about a relic that could cut a mountain in half that relic was the sword of the creator the very same used by nemesis the king of liberation
what are you talking about
im not his descendant
dont be coy teach the sword of the creator could only be wielded by nemesis if you can use it too that can only mean you have that bloodlines crest
i dont understand
fine keep your secrets but just so you know i dont understand isnt gonna cut it here at the monastery speaking of professor hanneman has been looking for you he probably wants to examine your crest with those crazy instruments of his actually sounds amusing maybe ill tag along
if it isnt my little claude what has you so worked up
judith what are you doing here
thats lady judith to you boy i told you until youre in charge i expect you to address me with all due respect anyway im here to retrieve you duke riegans condition has taken a turn for the worse
are you saying the old mans on his death bed
no its not that bad but in the state hes in he wont be able to participate in the next roundtable conference he wants you to go in his stead i volunteered to play the messenger
well thanks for that oh and teach this is judith also known as the hero of house daphnel
so youre little claudes teacher are you how much trouble has he been giving you
plenty
not too much
if her nickname didnt give it away you should know that judith er lady judith is the leader of the famous house daphnel of the leicester alliance she used to be a big deal at the roundtable conferences but it seems of late shes been reduced to a mere 
you had better shut that mouth before i put my boot in it you tactless nuisance now come on lets get going sorry professor but i need to borrow the boy for a bit
i suppose well have to finish our chat later sorry teach but dont you worry ill be back in time for our next mission all right judith lets get going
its lady  ah i suppose you are the active leader for the time being fair enough boy fair enough
good of you to come professor ive heard much about you lately specifically that you were able to awaken the sword of the creators power thusly it seems the true nature of your crest has been uncovered i had of course seen your crest before however at first i failed to recognize its true nature eventually it dawned on me that what is visible is perhaps merely a small part of a greater whole in other words your crest is too significant to be detected when using normal instruments after this discovery i began researching crests that might fit that description which allowed for a temporary hypothesis however i could not be certain the crest my conclusions led me to was far too unusual a crest thought to have disappeared in this world in the millennium since the fall of nemesis the king of liberation the crest of flames that is what you possess
the crest of flames 
your ability to wield the sword of the creator has unequivocally proven my hypothesis a legendary power dormant since time immemorial and now resurrected  there can be no doubt that this ancient power resides within you
a stone a stone  i do not understand yet as i think of it the pounding in my chest grows faster still but is that me or is it you hmm 
for a heros relic to be stolen  its unheard of
and just last month the sword of the creator was almost stolen too
also quite unheard of what imprudence
for house gautier to invite us on to their land they must be desperate but at least well have the stalwart knights ready to stand around and watch us do all the work
say i hear that a knight of seiros named gilbert will be joining us for our mission this moon he is skilled which is surely a boon for us still  that was not very thoughtful of lady rhea
do you know him
ahh well  no i do not not really all i will say is that we have trained together a few times in the past
do you have history with him
no  its nothing in any case you should at least introduce yourself to him before we depart
house gautier is sylvains home it would be nice if you could check on him as well
i am sorry that the kingdoms unrest did not stop with lord lonato  professor  the heroes relics are incredibly powerful please be on your guard
oof this wasnt the first time ive taken part in an alliance roundtable conference but it was still exhausting theres not enough cooperation in that group especially from lorenzs father but at least my grandfather was surprisingly alert judging by that id say hes got at least five more years in him
hey teach i hear you were able to use the sword of the creator that means  what does that mean could it mean that youre a descendant of nemesis the king of liberation
the coffin of seiros in the holy mausoleum should have held her remains instead they say it held the sword of the creator what could it mean
swinging a sword about in the holy mausoleum the potential for damage is too great to imagine i sincerely hope the saints coffins were not damaged
they didnt
one mightve been scratched
were you using magic ive heard you werent but  ugh its torture not being able to go inside the holy mausoleum for an entire year
you and your class were at that fight in the holy mausoleum right i sincerely hope the holy artifacts are unscathed i admit i wish i couldve been there to see it all even if it does make me queasy but i was there too early id gone first thing in the morning at noon one of the monks chased me out saying id been there too long who were they to decide when ive been somewhere too long
i heard a relic was stolen if this had something to do with a family conflict i dont think i could choose a side
even if theres a clear guilty party
i think id be a pretty good judge of that
we cant allow a heros relic to be stolen
what if its some kind of powerful weapon i want one too
i know relics arent easy to come by but id still like to get my hands on one 
im gonna keep training until i can beat you
 im not secretly eating cake
i can sense it
hmm  ok whats bernie doing right now oh fine you got me but keep it a secret all right
ill take your word for it
youre getting pretty good at talking through the door professor
so you have a crest too eh professor does that mean youre descended from nobility youve certainly got the look for it  i sure do wish there were more nobles like you professor a teacher a mercenary and so very mysterious  how could a girl ever get enough
i have never had goings to the kingdoms north i hear the people of north are cold and have much loneliness professor i hear you have had work have worked as a mercenary in the kingdom did you find joy in this you cannot remember is that having possibility i have amazement 
i know lord rodrigue he paid repeated visits to his highness after the previous king was killed
the western church the central church they believe in the same goddess but oppose one another f√≥dlan is a complicated place
have you seen a man who looks like me hes middle aged and relatively tall
i have
i have not
if you get the chance tell him ive gone out ok
think of it the sword of the creator belonging to the ancient king nemesis you have to master it as soon as you can i cant wait to face off against such a legendary weapon
so the whole plan to attack the monastery was some plot devised by the western church that means they used lonato what right do they have to drag a good man like that into their schemes
theres going to be a big investigation into the western church soon i wish i could be a part of it i want to hear for myself why lonato had to die
im so sorry my older brother is causing you all this hassle professor dont misunderstand i always thought he was a piece of garbage but i never thought hed steal the relic i cant wait to see his face when he realizes im in the group that was sent to take him down
i cant believe my own brother is the leader of the bandits house gautier is my true home and his please professor he really is one of the worst people ive ever known but we still  we share the same blood were still family
isnt it strange saint seiross body was missing from her coffin but they found a sword in its place  do you think she moved from her coffin and left the sword behind
professor you looked like a natural wielding the sword of the creator its strange though isnt it the last owner of the sword was nemesis but i thought he didnt have any descendants 
hey professor did you happen to see that man i was looking for earlier i just spotted him by the dining hall but then he ran away
who is he to you
he  to be honest hes my father hes using a different name now but theres no mistaking it its him i know it is
i might have seen him
oh you saw him by the entrance to the monastery thank you professor
father  ive found you at last
professor if youre heading to the kingdom i would recommend taking a coat its chilly even at this time of year it also rains a fair bit dont get caught out there without protection or youre sure to catch a cold
wow lord rodrigue in the flesh  what is felix doing this is such a rare opportunity for him to see his family 
professor please leave sylvain alone for the time being the thing is the bandits leader who stole the relic is sylvains disinherited older brother
i have heard that someone from house gautier one of the kingdom of faerghuss noble families is causing some sort of commotion what a complete disgrace to the nobility
hey professor dont you think everyones making too big a fuss over these crests or heroes relics or whatever theyre called how important can that stuff really be
its very important
im not sure
personally i dont even care that i dont have a crest ill take muscles over crests any day heck ill take muscles over a hot meal actually 
dont you think professor hannemans been acting a bit strange maybe hes made some kind of big discovery
is it true that lady rhea entrusted the sword of the creator to you i can hardly even fathom you being capable of wielding something of such power just who are you anyway
aristocrats are fools  allowing their lives to be dictated by their crests though i suppose i am much the same in that regard 
some people are unhappy because they dont have the crest they want  and some are unhappy because they have a crest they never asked for
i thought school life would be peaceful and quiet with a sprinkle of drama to keep things interesting but since you arrived its been one thing after another is that just a coincidence i wonder
i believe so
oh i was just kidding anyway as i said before i do like having a little drama in my life
maybe maybe not
what do you mean i dont like the way you said that stop trying to spook me
captain jeralt was all furrowed brow earlier do you know whats got him so concerned if theres a problem i want to help any way i can
i dont know
ok i doubt theres anything i can do for him but i figured id ask anyway
why dont you ask him yourself
i did but he just dodged the question still its worrying to see him like that
you must be rather bewildered by the power that was hidden within however know that i believe in you i have no doubt that you will use that power justly you will most certainly fulfill the grand destiny that the goddess has seen fit to grant you
ah professor jeralt was looking for you
where is he
it seems he has gone off somewhere if he is not in his room then surely someone has seen him ask around
how are you managing the sword of the creator no problems i hope you have not left it lying somewhere unattended or anything foolish like that
no problems
im not quite used to it yet
you will need the swords power on your next mission i trust you will handle it without much issue
why is that fish so still wait  is it swimming sideways perhaps  perhaps it is resigned to its woeful fate of being plucked from the water and eaten  ah professor you are so outgoing with all of the students i would like to have more opportunities to connect with you though i am certain my brother would disapprove
you acquitted yourself honorably last month to think theyd go into the holy mausoleum and assault the goddess tower  i cannot imagine the western church is acting on its own someone must have been helping them as for the masked knight who escaped his days are numbered i hope we find him soon so i can kill him myself
hail professor if i may introduce myself i am gilbert my life has been spent as a dedicated knight i am to accompany you on your assignment i may have slowed a step in recent years but i pledge to you the full extent of my abilities
arent you too formal
i beg your pardon but such is my nature
its a pleasure to meet you
no professor the pleasure is all mine i assure you
mercedes  her face looks familiar 
oh my the crest of flames could it really  yes the actual crest of flames no that is quite enough i should compose myself i must remain objective in my research objective professional
excitement is understandable
i respect your self control
the scandal with the western church troubles me we cannot afford to let ourselves be swept along and yet 
its awful just awful what happened with the rite of rebirth the infirmary  well it was a mess things are finally calm again and so ive come here to unwind let me tell you i put all of my knowledge to use keeping those kids alive still the truth of it is that when someone faces death for the first time well they figure out who they are they learn if they can do it again we cant lose them professor not to battle or to cowardice if you can keep them going then i will too
i will protect them
i will try my best
the head of the western church holds the title of bishop thats not as distinguished as an archbishop such as lady rhea but it still comes with a fair amount of authority if someone in that position plotted an assassin i cannot help but think it must have been instigated by some outside force there are bishops in the eastern church as well but to speak frankly they do not have much impact they are under the influence of both the archbishop and the leicester alliance so their ability to voice grievances is quite limited
i hear about the things you did im so glad lady rheas safe i figure youre a great person after all professor
ive been hearing a lot about you lately word on the street is you wield some amazing sword if you ever want to sell it to me id pay top g just kidding sorta its uh not for sale is it
professor have you seen my son perchance i have need of him
he went out
is that so that is too bad
i believe hes in his quarters
is that so thank you professor
i must ask him not to distract you professor nor his highness from the matter at hand
i am rodrigue achille fraldarius i bear the great honor of serving as a lord in the kingdom of faerghus i have come in margrave gautiers stead to retrieve their stolen relic however  as i hear it a group of students is to attend to this matter i sincerely hope no harm comes to any of them
greetings professor nothing to report oh come to think of it last month there was something to report wasnt there thanks to you i hear that everything was resolved i never realized that bandits had entered  im not a great guard after all am i i hope you will forgive me one day
this weather is unfortunate those villagers were right when they said a storm was brewing but they were more afraid of an attack than they were of the storm lets end this quickly
the thieves have taken conand tower as their base  there it is in the distance
miklan must be more skilled than your average thief to have overtaken a place like that
this area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago thats when invasions from the north were at their peak back then this tower was built for both surveillance and defense it will be difficult to seize it
you know your history gilbert if i recall correctly youre from the kingdom arent you
i left my home long ago if you have any questions about the mission id be happy to answer them
what do you know about house gautier
what do you know about the leader of the thieves
house gautier has always placed great importance on whether or not someone bears a crest margrave gautier has two sons a crest never manifested for his eldest its not hard to imagine why he left and wound up in this sort of life
theres no reason that crests should have the power to dictate someones destiny dont you agree gilbert he was just another victim of cruel fate forsaken by the goddess who now demands his execution
it should be in our sights soon professor the abandoned tower those thieves are using as a base  conand tower
this area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago thats when invasions from the north were at their peak back then this tower was built for both surveillance and defense it will be difficult to seize it
youre very well informed gilbert please tell us more
well i  ah youre joking
professor did you see the local villages they were in rough shape no doubt because of the thief attacks theyre not going to make it through the winter in that condition if the thieves had taken up pillaging in order to survive that would be deplorable but understandable but this  this is something else entirely it looks as though they destroyed those villages purely for pleasure no matter what their reasons may be that sort of behavior cannot be allowed ever
dont bother losing your head over those lowlifes your highness its wasted effort
sylvain  the thieves leader the one who stole the relic word has it hes your older brother i know hes been disowned but 
he is no longer a member of house gautier or my brother hes nothing more than a common thief
are you sure about that it would be understandable to find this situation well regrettable to say the least
regrets heh you must be joking you know were far past the point of regret and it always falls on the younger brother to clean up the mistakes of their elders doesnt it
this rain threatens a coming storm we must hurry and begin our war council before the heavens let loose
say teach this must be the tower dont you think even for a tower its pretty er towering
its more like a fortress
it would prove difficult to attack
its a remnant of ancient wars  these thieves certainly found themselves a great place to nest i hear their leader miklan is a former noble it makes sense he would already know about this place
several hundred years ago this was an important stronghold for diffusing invasions from the north back then this tower was built for both surveillance and defense it will be difficult to seize it
gilbert isnt it you hail from the kingdom right no wonder youre so knowledgeable while were chatting so amicably  do you mind if i ask some questions
i dont mind if i can answer them i will
have you ever seen the lance of ruin
i have a long time ago it was an impressive if not eerily ominous weapon to behold according to margrave gautier miklan has used the lance to turn the tables on his pursuers
is that right then those without a crest can use it as well  interesting as far as i knew that wasnt possible and then we have the mythical sword of the creator which cant be used by anyone except teach crest or no crest maybe youre just that special teach or maybe theres something youre not telling us either way i expect big things from you in this battle
leave it to me
ha i love a good show of confidence ill do my best too you can count on it
im relying on you claude
are you now then why dont you hand over the sword of the creator for a bit then again it would just be a heavy blade in my hands theres no justice in this world teach
ugh the rain is really coming down now lets finish this quickly
a group of thieves led by a disowned son of house gautier has stolen a heros relic and begun to run amok seeking to neutralize this threat the church is sending your house there to settle the matter
the enemy is close by were almost to the top floor
they have nowhere left to flee so the situation is in our favor all we have to do is chase then down
they are merely thieves but they have a heros relic do not drop your guard
phew why did we have to climb so high before a battle at least its better than fighting in heavy rain
dont hold back for my sake my brother is going to pay for everything hes done
the captains in trouble hurry up you fools
enemies approach from the lower floor watch the rear flank
here we go attack them from both sides
its an ambush
so you think you can take the lance from me huh ill kill you  ill kill every last one of you
why have you come you crest bearing fool
im here for the lance of ruin miklan hand it over i dont want to humiliate you but i will
hmph hurry up and die already if not for you  if it hadnt been for you 
shut up im so tired of hearing that youve always blamed me for something that isnt my fault
not bad for your kind  a bunch of spoiled rotten children
what the hell
damn look at that  im outta here
hold on
no
graaaargh
what the miklan is that you
that form  oh my is this your first time fighting such a thing then listen well to what i say
such is the fate of one whose life is corrupted by a crest stone  how pitiable the least we can do is put an end to his suffering
so this is the power of a heros relic to create such a sinister beast  it has gone too far i fear all we can do now is put an end to it
how awful so the heroes relics are hiding such a terrible power within i cant even tell friend from foe anymore i feel for him but the best we can do now is finish this quickly
an evil power has caused them to grow quite large their life force is beyond a mortal like yourself you cannot win unless you fell them twice or even thrice
even if youve cornered one you cannot let your guard down those things are even worse when threatened
can you see that barrier it is surrounded by great power you must break through to fight that thing a strong attack or gambit might help to break through more quickly if you can break the barrier that power will have nowhere else to go and that will likely cause confusions for that thing it cannot counter while confused which means that is the best time to attack
if you break down all of their barriers not only will they be confused they will not be able to move for a short while without the power flowing around them they will not be able to restore their barriers you might even be able to get something from them
they have such might that they will not fear you alone but a battalion could prove useful on that front  attack them with a gambit to draw their attention and force them to target you
be on your guard when they have realized their full power the damaged caused at times like that is not contained to just one spot once they have charged some power ups their barriers will be restored you really must pay close attention to those things distract them with a gambit or just take them down before they can attack in any case think carefully before you act
but you should be conquering that thing instead of talking to me if youre out of questions get over there and fight
what is that its like watching a bad dream come to life
graaaargh
goddess  the beast is gone yet miklan and the lance remain
it is done lets retrieve the lance and depart at once
its over  lets retrieve the lance and leave this place
we defeated him somehow  lets grab the lance and return to the monastery
miklan my brother 
that man  his form was changed it was as though that lance was swallowing him whole upon that sight it makes sense that your students were upset i wonder if those relics truly hide such power yet even still that power seems familiar that form as well  as one who wields the sword of the creator  does that mean you possess that power too
professor you have returned the goddess is indeed generous with her divine protection i have already heard gilberts report about what happened see to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself people would lose faith in the nobles should rumors spread of one using a relic and transforming into a monster all regions of f√≥dlan would fall into chaos we must avoid that at all costs please ensure the students who accompanied you understand that as well have i made myself clear
yes of course
hm 
his transformation into a black beast was nothing short of divine punishment from the goddess punishment for someone arrogant and foolish enough to use a heros relic even though they were unworthy and unqualified
you knew
of course that is why we rushed to recover it sadly we did not arrive in time
will i share the same fate 
if someone without a crest were to wield the relic you possess they would likely meet the same fate as miklan you however have been chosen you are worthy of wielding the sword of the creator so there is no need to worry
the church will formally return the lance to house gautier if you would 
as you wish
you have my gratitude i can see that i was right to trust you with this please report back i will tell you of your new mission for the coming moon at that time
i will not
what is the meaning of this
ahem excuse me  lady rhea i am overjoyed and beyond grateful to you for recovering the relic of my family house gautier now may i please have that lance i have received direct approval from my father to take possession of it
as the next head of house gautier do you swear that you will never cause such a deplorable incident to transpire
on my familys name and on my brothers life i swear it
very well however i have one condition you must never allow another to wield this lance your brother clearly demonstrated what fate awaits those who break that restriction
yes i i will not soon forget
i assume the archbishop was pleased with your performance did you return the lance of ruin
i returned it
 no need to lie professor i saw sylvain earlier it was written all over his face
i did not return it
 im glad sylvain must be overjoyed as well
 theres no need to lie professor no one could have expected you to disobey the archbishop
i keep thinking about what gilbert told us 
about miklan
about house gautier
yes miklan was discarded by his family because he was born without a crest eventually he became a masterful thief and gathered enough ruffians to capture a fortress right or wrong he was a gifted leader he could have been a great asset to f√≥dlan what a waste its true that a crest can increase your magical abilities and allow you to wield the full might of a heros relic but one cannot measure a leaders worth based solely on whether or not they bear a crest there are plenty of talented people in this world without one
i completely agree
why is everyone obsessed with crests
people believe crests are blessings from the goddess that theyre necessary to maintain order in f√≥dlan but the people are wrong crests are to blame for this brutal irrational world we live in their power is granted only to a select few whom we elevate and allow to rule the world have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the crests do that and people will have no choice but to rise and fall by their own merits
lady edelgard i question whether you revealed too much to the professor
perhaps i did
it is true that our teacher possesses a rare talent even i cannot deny it the ability to wield the sword of the creator is concerning 
ive already explained this to you my power alone is insufficient thats why im borrowing power from those people if our teacher can wield it in my stead  i believe that would be for the best
its a risk a dangerous one you leave me no choice but to take matters into my own hands please excuse me
i cant hide from the truth i cant do all that i must on my own if all i can rely on is my own ambition my path wont be easy is it so risky to reach out my hand father  i swear i will not stop until i succeed my regret my grief my whole life ive thrown it all away into the darkness 
is your meeting over professor
you look troubled
are you weary
i was just thinking about something professor  the possession of relics and crests has been highly valued in faerghus since ancient times its far from uncommon for someone to lose their ability to lead their house because they dont bear a crest just like miklan it happened to my uncle as well the eldest child of the king and yet he never ascended to the throne all families whose bloodlines carry crests of the 10 elites are much the same but house gautier takes it a step further and absolutely requires an heir who possesses a crest
why are they so obsessed with it
why house gautier in particular
to that house the power of crests is a necessity not a luxury house gautier holds the most northern territory in the kingdom and they have fought with the people to the north for many years the head of that house is responsible for protecting that territory from fearsome invaders whom they keep at bay with the power of crests and relics in exchange for that responsibility they are granted special privileges within the kingdom
their crests grant them special privileges
in a way that said ability cannot be measured by the possession of a crest alone 
strength is strength with or without a crest
i believe the same ability cannot be measured by the possession of a crest alone
i believe that margrave gautier was wrong to disinherit miklan because he did not bear a crest still there is always a reason for why such customs stand the test of time imagine what this world would be like if no one placed any stock in crests  bloodlines that carry crests would dwindle the metaphorical blade used to oppose threats would eventually rest this same argument has been made time and time again across the years both sides are at once right and wrong
what do you believe dimitri
i believe those with crests and those without should acknowledge the others strengths and learn to respect each other based on personal merits and that doesnt apply only to crests the same holds true for lineage race faith ideologies  if we could just accept each other and make mutual concessions one step at a time  perhaps  who knows if thats even possible everyone has something that is unacceptable within them i certainly do and id wager you do as well i wonder which is best professor  to cut away that which is unacceptable or to find a way to accept it anyway 
nice work teach its thanks to you that we successfully completed our mission as for miklan  i wonder if he really believed he could wield a relic
hard to say
i bet he just wanted to get his hands on it even though he knew he couldnt use it
i doubt it
agreed he probably just wanted to get his hands on it even though he knew it was futile
though im sure he wasnt counting on turning into a monster like that  i wonder if that monster represents another aspect of the heroes relics what a strange and terrifying power
i dont know
it seems so
stories of misfortune have followed the heroes relics since ancient times
tomas youve caught me by surprise thats not easy to do though i suppose i shouldve expected to see our librarian in his library
i am sorry to intrude i simply heard you speaking of the heroes relics i can tell you more about them if youd like the story goes that nemesis was corrupted by evil because of the sword of the creator other heroes also lost themselves by continuing to use the relics transforming into black beasts with twisted souls there used to be a great many records regarding the dark history of the relics
used to be
they have been destroyed across all of f√≥dlan stripped from their shelves including those that resided at this very library
you make it sound like the church is covering up the truth but now that you mention it rhea was very specific about not wanting anyone to find out what happened at conand tower hey tomas  why are you telling us all this
it seemed like you were searching for answers about the relics what is a librarian if not a guide in the search for knowledge and not only have you been searching but you have been doing so through the night i would suggest you stop before the knights notice and that is enough meddling for today please excuse me
so ive been found out have i i suppose i do spend more time at the library than most students but i wont stop i cant afford to
what are you after
teach  you dont really expect me to tell you something so personal like that do you though i wouldnt mind sharing if you were to tell me some of your secrets in exchange 
i cant let this exchange pass without comment  if youre sharing secrets perhaps i can share one as well
are you sure you could survive that id say youre the least likely to share secrets out of everyone at the academy
heh heh coming from you ill take that as a compliment after all youre easily the student with the most secrets
im afraid you overestimate me my secrets dont amount to much but back to teach 
dont try to change the subject claude were talking about secrets yours who is your father and why did you appear so suddenly as if from nowhere duke riegans eldest son died in an accident having tragically lost other family members as well he was without an heir the alliance would undoubtedly have been shaken if house riegan had lost its position of leadership but then you showed up why did you return to house riegan what brought you to the monastery
i would like to hear this as well
he doesnt have have to answer to you
alas to be surrounded by women as lovely as flowers only to be pricked by their thorns
my dream in truth is a selfless dream but i require power to make it a reality when i learned about the power of my crest i knew i had a chance so im chasing that dream to the bitter end if need be i came to this monastery because i thought i might find someone useful someone to help me on my path so what do you think if you promise to help me achieve my dream no matter what ill promise to tell you anything
 i have my own dream to tend to i pray that yours does not interfere with mine
what about you teach
if its a noble dream 
that may be difficult
i see well now isnt the time to discuss this you are still my teach after all
professor you have done well to complete such a difficult task you have shown exceptional skill in leading your students i am forever grateful for the safe return of the heros relic just as i expected you have mastered the sword of the creator now then i shall tell you about your mission for the coming month 
 rhe  archbishop
seteth what troubles you
flayn is missing i cannot find her anywhere  professor have you seen flayn recently
i have not
i have searched everywhere where could she be
have you looked everywhere
i have searched every corner i can think of i could not find her anywhere
she may be in danger oh no  no no what am i to do
calm yourself seteth professor we shall continue our discussion another time
/***EOF***/
as the sun grows stronger and the nights grow ever shorter the blue sea star returns to the sky once more believed to be the goddesss home her followers look to the star and commence celebrations of her rebirth on the grounds of garreg mach monastery a grand ceremony is held in honor of this much anticipated event every true follower of the church of seiros is sure to be in attendance
our mission this month is to patrol and set up defenses to stop the assassination plot
i wonder if an assassination attempt is truly the goal of our enemy 
what do you mean
you must sense that somethings off about all of this
its a distraction
yes i think so too
a barely concealed secret message trying to distract us from whatevers really going on sloppy to say the least and while everyone is out searching for a phantom assassin theyll be free to accomplish their true goal with ease
the monastery houses many valuable weapons perhaps that is their aim
i hear the monastery has a treasure vault too seems like the sort of place a foe would like some alone time in
garreg mach is immense and not just above ground but below as well perhaps their aim lies beneath the monastery 
it seems to me that we should search the monastery for a clue as to what the enemy might be after of course we must never underestimate the need for preparedness in case a battle should ensue
a secret meeting professor oh we havent been introduced i am shamir
shamir is one of the knights of seiros and this young man is 
so our task for this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery to help put a stop to that assassination plot the knights will certainly have their hands full protecting lady rhea perhaps our enemy is counting on that 
what do you mean
your highness i am curious as to what you mean by that
i agree
please elaborate
why would lord lonato be carrying around a secret note with an assassination plot written on it isnt it possible he hoped to monopolize everyones attention with this alleged plot in order to distract from his true aim
maybe theyre after the treasure vault theres also lots of valuable stuff in the library and professor hannemans quarters
true the monastery undoubtedly houses many weapons that rival even the heroes relics
whatever their aim we cant allow any harm to come to the ladies of the monastery i mean what would i do with my spare time
you mean to say we should search the monastery try to find what the enemy is truly after
yes and we should be prepared to fight them as well should it come to that i wouldnt mind getting in some training just in case
a secret meeting professor oh we havent been introduced i am shamir
shamir is one of the knights of seiros and this young man here is 
ok  so our task this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery in support of the knights who are busy trying to stop an assassination plot heres the thing i dont think the bad guys are really trying to assassinate the archbishop
what do you mean
come on teach dont you think that secret note lord lonato was carrying around was just a little too obvious
its a distraction
precisely that secret note with the assassination plot on it  theres just no way that was real
people dont just carry around secret notes someone wanted us to find it
do you really think the assassination plot is just a distraction
oh yeah that makes complete sense but then what are they really after
if i knew that i wouldnt be so worried lets see  it probably involves somewhere that will be empty during the rite of rebirth yeah
since the ceremony is at the goddess tower it follows that everywhere else at the academy will be severely understaffed
do you think theyre after the churchs donation money i hear noble families tend to donate quite generously
my bets on the dining hall its a treasure trove of delicious food makes me angry just thinking about them getting their grubby hands on it
lets split up and look around ill keep an eye on the reception hall
you should get in some training if you have the time hilda theres a good chance well have to fight
uh well im not the only one who needs to train here its not right to single me out like that
a secret meeting professor oh we havent been introduced i am shamir
shamir is one of the knights of seiros and that little go getter there is 
i work for lady rhea and im shamirs apprentice oh the names cyril
you work for rhea
yep i help lady rhea with all kinds of stuff
shamirs apprentice
yep shes teaching me about the bow and the sword and all kinds of stuff
ive gotta protect lady rhea so thats why ive gotta learn all i can from shamir
cyril adores rhea that aside if you need anything ask
a heros relic 
do you know something
however could i know something still it is heavy on my mind
it represents great power
quite so
the stone within the sword  a glow of red  hm oh it is nothing
our enemys true target  what could it be the monastery has been around for nearly a millennium its only logical that there are secrets here wed better investigate would you mind asking around and seeing what you can dig up once youve uncovered some leads well regroup
we need more information is there anyone else you could talk to
hmm  theres a place that the church values above all others on the day of the rite it will be open to the public that will make it much easier than usual to access
the greenhouse
you must be joking
the holy mausoleum
precisely
the dining hall
you must be joking
we cant know for certain but its a distinct possibility that the holy mausoleum is our enemys target
oh have you been tasked with guarding the monastery as well such a stir over a single letter but i suppose the archbishops safety is too important to risk
if the enemys aim lies elsewhere we had better discern their true intent quickly as i see it our best option is to explore every inch of the monastery we should also speak to everyone here lets plan to compare notes once youve got a lead
hmm im afraid well need more information than that is there anyone else you could try speaking to
so  there is something that the church values above all else on the day of the rite it will be open to the public that will make gaining entry far easier than usual you know the place of which i speak 
the greenhouse
whatever would make you think that this is no time for games professor
the holy mausoleum
yes that is the most likely possibility
the dining hall
whatever would make you think that this is no time for games professor
we do not know their objective but there is a good chance that our enemy is planning to target the holy mausoleum
all this talk of assassination plots  it brings back dark memories i prefer to keep buried i doubt there is any correlation and yet  ah it is nothing i am sorry for allowing my mind to wander my focus should be solely on guarding the monastery right now
to figure out our foes intentions we need information lots of it or any at the least for now try going around the monastery and looking for suspicious locations you should also try chatting folks up to see if they know anything once weve got things narrowed down lets meet up and compare notes
hmm  we still dont have enough to go on teach lets try looking around a little more
hmm something the church values above all else  and on the day of the rite itll be open to the public making it easier than ever to get inside thats gotta be it right
the greenhouse
that would be a resounding no
the holy mausoleum
bullseye
the dining hall
that would be a resounding no
we dont know the enemys intentions not yet but our best bet is that their target will be the holy mausoleum
theres been talk of an attempt on rheas life weve been order to help the knights patrol could that possibly mean that rhea isnt beloved by everyone the world over
can you imagine the archbishop being murdered i prefer not to consider such a gruesome scenario
of course not
awfully calm arent you i wonder what it takes to rile you up
frightening thought
that easy to get under your skin is it
hmm  setting fire to the stables to distract everyone to cause a commotion it is the oldest trick in the book but i cannot shake the thought that our enemies may attempt it  i will stand guard and watch over the stable and the knights horses they are truly magnificent
so sleepy  too sleepy  i found an interesting book in the library got so caught up reading it i forgot to sleep  interesting discovery though the coffins of the four saints in the sanctum each have their crests carved into them ill need to find a way down there to get a look
oh hey professor i was just reading this letter from my father do you know him hes a pretty big deal in the empire he only writes to ask how my trainings going or how many monsters ive killed stuff like that
um  hi right now is um  well right nows ok i guess if you um want to chat a little
didnt i see you in the dining hall last night
hey i get hungry sometimes like anyone else what eating at night is bad for you theres no way thats true wait really
people die in every battle and it can be by sword or spear or magic but  but depending on who it is that died  depending on who died its different
what do you mean
its different if its someone you know who was lost 
i hope nothing bad happens this month
is it true you got caught in the fighting im so thankful you made it out alive i dont know what we would do if we lost you 
in brigid  assassinations are many i have also been the targeted back in the past
how frightening
im happy you survived
the goddess tower has an entrance of narrowness that is most good the windows are not the most good though a target of ease for snipers
fighting to stop a murdering is my specialness no my specialty i will show my best work
the monks declined my offer of assistance they said that no one from duscur is to be trusted especially now given the circumstances i cannot fault them
sending an assassin to the monastery hm hopefully its someone worth crossing blades with
i hope so too
it seems were cut from the same cloth
i hope we can avoid bloodshed
youre entitled to your opinion
lord lonatos rebellion may have been quelled but the unrest in faerghus isnt dying down anytime soon the boar prince should hurry up and claim the throne rather than letting old customs hold him back
i cant stop thinking about lonato  im sorry professor i know this isnt the time but  i just cant get past it
theres nothing to be done
pull yourself together
thank you no matter what happens i promise you ill do my part i checked on my brother and sister who were living in castle gaspard thankfully theyre all right i was worried because theyre both so young but the church in the castle town offered to take them in that much at least is a big relief
no classes on a festival day i thought id get to spend all day relaxing in the company of some lovely ladies but now this has happened hey professor i know theres talk of an assassination attempt but do you really think theyll do it on the day of the rite of rebirth i feel like security would be looser some other time is there some reason why it has to happen on that day
the monastery holds many treasures maybe the enemy is after one of those even so the idea of stealing from the church is just horrible 
i bought the ingredients for making some sweet treats i cant wait to eats huh oh i know it looks like im fooling around but im not im preparing for potential battle during my patrol by making sure i have plenty of food i can eat while walking smart huh
good thinking
i know once theyre ready i promise to share some with you
youre making patrol sweets
i just thought id be more alert if i had something sweet in my tummy oh wait was it spicy food that you liked professor
have you heard rumor has it that death himself has been appearing in garreg mach they say he appears every night and kidnaps folks i wonder what happens to them 
professor while the investigation is important dont forget to make time for your training if we have to battle and cannot win all will be lost we dont know who our enemy is so we must be prepared for anything
lady rhea lifts the spirits of all the people of f√≥dlan we cannot allow her to come to any harm
are we really just taking claudes word for it if so i doubt anything will come of this it is all probably just some sort of distasteful joke i find it highly unlikely that anyone would be foolish enough to barge in here and cause a disturbance
the goddesss rite of rebirth is the most significant ritual for the church of seiros could it be that someone has spread these rumors of an assassination plot merely with the intention to hinder the celebration
i bet the enemys using this assassination nonsense just to sneak in and raid the pantry what do you think professor
you may be right
oh im right all right my animal instinct is telling me that the enemy is after our best meats
i dont think so
you dont think so then dinners on you if it turns out i was right
the monasterys so big how can we narrow down the list of possible targets the only places i can think of are the vault and the library and  i guess thats it
with the whole monastery preparing for the goddesss rite of rebirth this month it feels like everyones a little on edge 
i dont know who to blame for all this commotion but its frankly a huge inconvenience with everyone stuck on guard duty our study and training time has been drastically reduced
some things are more important than that
yes yes i understand that but it doesnt change the fact that its a royal pain
i agree  its very inconvenient
indeed for now lets do all we can to find and dispose of our enemy
it seems there were forces opposing the church beyond lord lonato  i never thought such forces could exist in this world
it makes sense that the church has enemies
i dont understand what would they have against the church
we only know a small part of this world
i suppose that may be true 
hello im in charge of managing all records for the golden deer house oh but i dont have any information of note right now go ahead and continue your investigation and put a little extra effort into it please
did you know that on the last day of the rite the monasterys open to the general public its kinda fun it makes the place feel like a festival
seems like donations to the monastery arent actually kept here that means the enemy isnt likely to be interested in money we should turn our attention elsewhere then again i guess some of the plants in the greenhouse could sell for a lot but that cant really be it can it
hey did you hear a knight wielding a scythe is roaming around town at night if hes a villain id like to get the measure of him
hmm  might you have come looking for me because you were worried about my safety
i was worried
i am quite all right but your concern means a great deal
the enemy could have other objectives
i am aware of the possibility on the day of the ceremony i am trusting that you will not allow your attention to wander or wane
ive been in town procuring some supplies for flayn
did you encounter any danger
no but do not concern yourself for my safety i am very much stronger than i appear
what supplies
nothing out of the ordinary do not trouble yourself over it
professor  i am afraid i have acted a bit childishly toward my brother recently  given the circumstances i requested that he provide me with some candies  silly of me really the timing was improper and i regret it very much now oh but more importantly this place is off limits professor it is only open to the public on the day of the goddesss rite of rebirth
have you visited the goddess tower its a sacred place used for rituals and the like in general students arent allowed entry but as youd expect that rule just excites their curiosity some have even tried sneaking in well at least for this month that kind of behavior is totally unthinkable we have a lot more security what with the goddesss rite of rebirth coming up
youd best keep your distance in this nervous state i might just cut you down
please dont
i dare you to try
oh come on im only kidding
hey professor youre good looking you know that at the same time you look like someone who was born to fight i bet wed get along im also good looking and born to fight heh need any help with your class
feel free to call on me when a fights brewing thunderbrand and i will be there when you need us
you spend too much time roaming the monastery if youre looking for something try less aimless wandering
i was thinking about the enemys objective
do you even know who the enemy is you cant know why without knowing who
im not looking for anything
sure
its none of my business anyway im just here to take care of enemies who get too close
youre skilled why wont you battle me hmph
whats the matter youre running all over creation ah  you dont believe lady rhea is the real target do you even so the knights have their orders we cant abandon our duty to guard lady rhea the goddesss rite of rebirth is an important event for the church of seiros they say its the day when the goddess will return to walk among us not too likely if you ask me uh  best if you keep that to yourself
unbelievable what a terrifying story however an assassination attempt on lady rhea is doomed to fail pardon you think the goal may be different than simple assassination intriguing i suppose the priceless objects in this room could perhaps draw thieves however theres no one but me who could make use of them 
professor i hope youre well as for me i had a date with a splendid specimen of a knight but now hes suddenly not in the mood to see me again i blame all these rumors of a deathly figure showing up in town such an uproar must have beyond reason drawn his attention away from me
i hear you have fought alongside catherine i would wager that her power exceeded your expectations had you the chance to witness her relic thunderbrand glowing red  that glow is a sure sign that her blood contains a crest that harmonizes with that heros relic
excuse me professor i just wanted to let you know that lady rhea is always real concerned with you she expects great things i think please dont let her down ok
of course not
i hope youre not just saying that
well see 
ya know what im watching you
greetings professor nothing to report the goddesss rite of rebirth is this month right the monastery gates will be thrown wide open on that day ill be working as a guide i hope i get to guide some lovely ladies around  heh heh 
the goddesss home is in the sky she lives on a bright and shining star but in the spring you cant see that star that means she cant protect f√≥dlan thats why we all celebrate the day when her star returns to the sky thats the day of the rite of rebirth see see ive been studying i know just about everything
people seem to think that all the knights of seiros are equal but that isnt quite so there are many distinguishing ranks within the order for example there are squires who are training to become knights as well as full knights like myself oh and then we have the holy knights such as catherine those are the knights that can wield a heros relic
about 20 or so years ago there was a big fire in garreg mach on that day captain jeralt went missing everyone thought he was dead  it never occurred to me that he might actually have survived the truly strange part is that in all those years he hasnt changed a bit 
on the day of the rite the monastery will be open to the public including the holy mausoleum the holy mausoleum is where the tomb of the divine seiros lies there she slumbers eternally thats pretty much all that in there just an ancient coffin its sealed with a powerful magic to protect against would be grave robbers
have you heard of the war of the eagle and lion it was the battle that won the kingdom its independence from the empire even the church of seiros had no choice but to recognize the courage of loog the king of lions who emerged victorious the church awarded him a crown and the right to govern the faerghus region backing him in his bid to found the holy kingdom of faerghus in return loog agreed to make the church of seiros the religion of his territory and permitted them to publicly proselytize across the kingdom in the 400 years since the church and the kingdom have continued to maintain very close relations
something in the monastery that someone might go after theres so much here i couldnt possibly name just one even this here kitchen contains previous wares wine bottles from centuries past and the like i hear that stuff is fancy but not very drinkable i doubt anyone would go to the trouble of stealing it
it would be terrible if the greenhouse was targeted the plants in here are incredibly valuable this place contains the heart of garreg machs 995 year history so many beautiful flowers  plants that can save or end lives  they are all my precious children
i have heard talk of students wandering the monastery late at night they wouldnt happen to be from your class would they please keep your students in line professor kids these days 
do you know what this room is it is the churchs treasure vault i say treasure but i do not mean silver and gold and jewels it mostly contains weapons artifacts and the like anything that would cause too great a stir should it be stolen no the church knows better than to store anything too valuable in such an accessible location
there are numerous books in this library that you cannot find anywhere else but once you are here you can read them easily enough i doubt someone would go to the trouble of stealing one sometimes seteth will dispose of books that are deemed inappropriate for the monastery but thats about it in a way i suppose that makes those particular volumes more valuable  right
that boy who assists the archbishop  cyril i believe i hear hes originally from a foreign land to the east called almyra i know hes still only a child but i do wonder about his true intentions 
the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin are we going to move forward with our plan
i believe so how confident are you in our theory professor
were not wrong
no ones intuition is perfect its ridiculous not to have doubts
it could go either way
oh i dont like those odds at all 
im a little doubtful 
you have little doubts that is good we have no room for big doubts on this day
all that matters is how our enemy makes their move not how our teacher feels about our plan
you seem a mite too relaxed for my liking the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin while we are in the goddess tower we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense
may i let you in on something professor my brother can be a bit callous he told me that he was concerned about you and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin
that was said in jest flayn and in confidence please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble as a professor you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness
please excuse us everyone we shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded
a coffin how fascinating
hurry professor we must find a place to hide where we can guard the stairs to the holy mausoleum if the enemy moves as predicted we should be able to cut off their escape path and capture every last one of them
the goddesss rite of rebirth is finally here lets move ahead with our plan
leave it to me professor are you in as well
of course
weve narrowed down our objective kind of so lets show everyone that we can carry out our duties better than anyone
im not sure about this
oh dear our professor seems to lack confidence in our plan that is not very reassuring
im hungry
umm  oh well ill be sure to whip you up some tasty treats when this is all over
were counting on you professor
you seem a mite too relaxed for my liking the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin while we are in the goddess tower we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense
may i let you in on something professor my brother can be a bit callous he told me that he was concerned about you and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin
that was said in jest flayn and in confidence please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble as a professor you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness
please excuse us everyone we shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded
its time
all right lets stick to the plan and go hide where we can watch over the entrance to the holy mausoleum if anyone suspicious enters well follow them in and take them down got it
the rite of rebirth is finally underway time to see if our hunch was right
ugh i hope its not then we wouldnt have to fight anyone
our hunch is right
weve all come to this conclusion together im sure we got it right
we are mistaken
do you really believe that professor claude certainly looks confident
only the goddess knows
dear goddess  please protect us 
right or wrong the clock is ticking all we can do now is stick to the plan
you seem a mite too relaxed for my liking the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin while we are in the goddess tower we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense
may i let you in on something professor my brother can be a bit callous he told me that he was concerned about you and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin
that was said in jest flayn and in confidence please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble as a professor you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness
please excuse us everyone we shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded
seteth is way too overprotective he reminds me of my brother
come on teach i know a hidden spot where we can monitor the stairs that lead to the holy mausoleum if theres anyone down there theyll be trapped like the rats they are well just have to take them down without getting bitten
while the plot to assassinate the archbishop shakes the monastery to its core you suspect the enemy may have a different motivation anxiety abounds as the goddesss rite of rebirth commences
we were right unwanted gusts have come to visit
those central church dastards have spotted us  buy me some time while i open the seal on the casket
im on it
it is as we suspected the enemy is within
our enemy appears to be after the tomb of saint seiros in the back are they attempting to steal her bones it would be best to defeat them before the achieve their aim
look closely  there are contraptions of some sort on the floor we must pay attention to our enemies weapons and advance while attacking them from advantageous positions
death knight prove your strength and scatter these fools
i dont take commands or waste my time on weaklings
that knight is a powerful enemy  lets do all we can to avoid him
the enemy is after the casket of saint seiros do they intend to steal her bones we must defeat those enemies before they open the casket
but look closely at the ground  there are contraptions of some sort in place well have to look closely at the enemies weapons and advance while attacking them from the best positions possible
that knight looks like he has experience it would be foolish to challenge him recklessly
our guess was spot on looks like we have company
looks like the enemy is going after the casket in the back maybe theyre going after the saints bones weird id like to defeat them before they can finish the job
but did you notice look closely at the ground theres some kind of contraption on certain parts of the floor the smart move is to advance while finding the best fighting positions we can based on the enemys weaponry
im getting a really disturbing vibe from that guy  no one go near the evil looking knight ok
the reinforcements havent arrived if they approach from behind we can attack them from both sides 
its no use the seal is broken you cant  huh a sword
like moths to a flame 
i told you that if you fled i would not chase you but it seems you wish to die 
i didnt expect to encounter someone like you  how fortunate
youre too late the seal will be broken any minute now 
its no use the seal is broken you cant  huh a sword
theres no way around it  i accept your challenge
oh this will be fun 
oh my how frightening wont you please go easy on me
you  was this meeting preordained
hmm what do you mean
that sword is i see what a pleasant surprise
ugh he got away that sword  why is it  
thats the sword that was in the casket seems to be shimmering almost as though 
he got away  we have no choice but to let them go for now professor  the way that sword is glowing i wonder 
the jerk got away was that magic we cant even chase after him hey professor the way that sword is shining  do you think it could be 
is the intruder here oh  looks like you have this under control you round up any stragglers
will do
as all of you have committed a breach of faith the archbishop will now pass judgement
inciting a kingdom noble to rebel unlawful entry the attempted assassination of the archbishop an attack on the holy mausoleum it is unnecessary to go on followers of the western church
what we have nothing to do with the western church
you have already been identified please spare us your second rate theater
dishonoring a holy ceremony is worthy of death for a member of the church you are well past the hope of redemption if you have any grace remaining you will willingly offer your life as atonement for this crime
no this isnt what we were told would happen weve been deceived
its no use arguing whatever your excuse the punishment stands
may your souls find peace as they return to the goddess 
wait please the goddess would never forgive you for our execution
monster we know youve already slaughtered many of our fellow brethren like this
this concludes the investigation please remove these poor lost souls from my sight
thats that i suppose the assassination attempt the attack on the holy mausoleum  it was all the western churchs doing that masked knight who led the attack somehow managed to disappear without a trace
the church of seiros clearly isnt as unified as it would hope to appear it seems the bishop of the western church was always opposed to the church being ruled centrally from garreg mach perhaps they hope to remove the archbishop in order to completely strip the central church of its authority
the western church 
the central church
ugh thats right jeralt mentioned that you were raised without any exposure to the church in order to function more efficiently the church of seiros is split into several smaller entities the central church is the largest and leads the organization from garreg mach
the western church extends from castle gaspard where lord lonato rebelled into the far west they can be found just beyond the most renowned stronghold of the kingdom the fortress city of arianrhod
it seems the knights have been tasked with subduing the leaders of the western church we may be give an opportunity to help them with their mission
to think our own professor was born in f√≥dlan and yet knew nothing of the church i never imagined explaining something so basic to an instructor of mine youre something of a special case are you not
how strange that the archbishop would ask someone like that to lead her students theres clearly more to that decision than we know
lady rhea is pretty scary sometimes but to execute that whole group just like that it seems harsh even for her
if one of us does something bad i wonder what she would do to us
professor  do you agree with the archbishops actions
there you have it  it seems that the assassination attempt and the attack on the holy mausoleum were all the work of the western church as for the masked knight who led the attack  im afraid his whereabouts are yet unknown
it makes no sense that the western church would try such a thing
it just goes to show that the church of seiros is not completely united the church is led by those here in garreg mach and the western church doesnt have a strong voice on its governing council i imagine the western church has harbored some resentment towards the central church for a while now
the western church 
the central church
ah thats right jeralt did say that you grew up outside the influence of the church the church of seiros is split into a few branches across f√≥dlan the largest being the central church which is headquartered right here at garreg mach
the western church lies far to the west of castle gaspard where lord lonato held his rebellion its situated on the far side of the kingdoms most impressive fortress arianrhod i imagine the western churchs intention was to eliminate lady rhea and the central churchs authority along with her naturally the knights will be riding out to question the western churchs top officials or rather to punish them
when they do your highness we will likely be asked to carry out said punishment
indeed now i dont mean to be rude professor but i must say that your situation is rather unusual for someone to grow up in f√≥dlan and yet never have any contact with the church of seiros is its hard to believe
i wonder why the archbishop would hire someone like that as a professor 
so those people from the western church were  um lady rhea had them killed didnt she
well of course she did going against the teachings of seiros like that quite unforgivable
those who stray must be punished i suppose that said  professor i 
i suppose thats that the assassination attempt the attack on the holy mausoleum  looks like it was all a plot by the western church its just too bad that that masked knight who was leading the attack got away vanished without a trace
but why would the western church want to attack lady rhea
why take your pick of reasons relations with the western church arent exactly friendly
the western church 
what reasons
oh thats right jeralt mentioned that you grew up completely isolated from the church the church of seiros is split into a few different branches across f√≥dlan the central church is headquartered right here at garreg mach
then theres the western church far west from castle gaspard where lord lonato had his little rebellion is the fortress city of arianrhod its the strongest fortress in the kingdom on the other side of it is the headquarters of the western church
not too smart to bicker with people who worship the same goddess as you
the bishop of the western church must be pretty ambitious probably hopes to split off completely in which case hed need to weaken the central churchs influence killing rhea is certainly one way to do that to the shock of no one i hear the knights have been sent to subdue the leaders of the western church well probably get a chance to assist
youre an odd one arent you professor howd you make it this far in life without ever interacting with the church i cant believe someone like you exists in f√≥dlan its too strange
if you think thats weird consider the fact that rhea hired teach despite all that
so those guys they caught  they all got the axe right thats brutal
lady rhea can be rather intimidating at times in fact she can be downright terrifying
professor those who cannot be saved must be delivered to the goddess for judgement is that not so
there you are professor it seems lady rhea would like a word with you come with me
the archbishop lives not that i had ever placed much faith in those swine from the western church
i have news both good and bad the remains of seiros were not in the tomb however something else was the sword of the creator
ah the weapon wielded by that thief the king of liberation
thief hm at any rate it is now in the hands of the academys new professor i doubt you will be surprised to hear that the crest stone had already been removed from the sword when it was found
hmph as expected it would be foolish to keep both in the same location
theres more the professor was able to awaken the swords true power even without the crest stone the sword glowed red the professors crest is compatible there is no mistaking it
absurd using a relic without its crest stone should be impossible  the king of liberations bloodline should not even  hmm
they must be allowed to keep it for now i do not have enough information about the professor to act as for your request i assent the death knight is at your command use him well
good i believe i will enjoy this a great deal 
i cannot thank you enough for defeating those invaders in the holy mausoleum and especially for protecting the sword of the creator that sword is one of the heroes relics and the most precious artifact in the churchs possession it is also a weapon of terrifying power for now i will entrust the sword to you please use it wisely
lady rhea wait do you truly mean to give the sword of the creator to this stranger surely it is not the sort of thing that one hands over so readily even to someone who has the ability to wield it if someone like nemesis were to appear again all of f√≥dlan would be consumed by war
nemesis
nemesis the king of liberation he is an ancient king of mankind who was defeated by seiros over a thousand years ago when f√≥dlan was attacked by wicked gods it is said that the goddess gifted nemesis with the sword of the creator nemesis used that sword to defeat the wicked gods saving all of f√≥dlan henceforth he was dubbed the king of liberation however his power began to corrupt him until he himself turned to the darkness saint seiros was forced to destroy him lady rhea i beg you to reconsider given a little more time we could more accurately assess this strangers abilities
no i have faith seteth faith that our friend here will not be corrupted by wickedness since the death of nemesis none have been able to wield the sword of the creator now after all those long years of being sealed away it has returned and found a new master
i understand as you wish lady rhea there you have it professor see that you do not betray the trust the archbishop has seen fit to bestow upon you
the sword of the creator the king of liberation each tale is more confusing than the last and i really cant read that rhea at all  that sword is clearly precious  so why is she so keen to gift the thing to you
it certainly is strange
the sword chose me
is that a fact
i feel as though we have become entangled in a mystery  and there is one more thing that has been plaguing me the sword of the creator  it somehow feels distinct from other relics we have seen such as the one that  oh goodness what was her name ca  cat 
catherine
yes her
cat
what is wrong with that head of yours of course its not a cat her name is catherine
the sword of the creator differs from her thunderbrand in one key way it bears a hole where something should have been but is no more i despise not knowing what is going on it it frightens me and yet  i place my trust in you i must whatever comes to pass please swear to cut a path that is your own
the sword of the creator  pulled right from the legends i finally found it and yet it ended up in teachs hands could i even use it anyway damn it theres no telling whats to come
