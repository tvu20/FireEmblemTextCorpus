@Opening 
Claude's plan to call in Almyran forces succeeds, and the Alliance army captures Fort Merceus. Before they can celebrate their victory, javelins of light rain down from the sky and destroy the fort. Forced to temporary evacuate, the Alliance army regroups at Garreg Mach until it is ready to march on Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.

@Dialogue 
Claude: It's almost time to invade the Imperial capital. We still don't know where Rhea is, but if she's alive, she's likely in Enbarr. Hopefully we manage to find her without too much trouble.
Byleth: We need to save her quickly.
Claude: I know, but if we're not careful she'll just be whisked away again.
Byleth: I wonder if she's alive.
Claude: If the Empire has some reason to keep Rhea alive, then she's alive.
Claude: I'm sure you must be anxious to see her again.
Byleth: I need to see her again.
Claude: I understand. You need to see Rhea again so you can figure out who you really are.
Byleth: All I care about right now is saving her.
Claude: Well, if that's what you want, I'll do my best to make it happen.
Claude: But we're going up against Edelgard here... It won't be so simple.


Hilda: Our next stop is the Imperial capital. We've sure come a long way.
Raphael: What're you talking about? This is Garreg Mach! It's where we started.
Hilda: I didn't mean literally, Raphael. I was speaking symbolically!
Lorenz: My earnest desire to protect the Alliance has carried me this far. It will not fail me. I am sure the rest of you all have your own reasons to fight as well. Of course, I understand that the fight will not end until we defeat the Empire... And now the time has arrived at long last to march on the Imperial capital and defeat the emperor...
Hilda: It really gets you thinking, doesn't it? We all come from different places and have different goals and dreams. But thanks to those two, we were all able to come together and overcome all sorts of challenges.
Lysithea: You are referring to Claude and the professor, I assume. Even within our own odd group, those two are particularly unusual.
Hilda: Oh! So, you are aware that you're odd!
Lysithea: Well... That's... It was simply a figure of speech. I am speaking about Claude and the professor right now!
Marianne: They're like the wind and the trees...
Hilda: Huh? Claude and the professor are? What does that even mean, and who is which?
Marianne: Oh, um... I was just thinking that if we're the birds, then those two are like the trees and the wind. The professor is a great tree that kindly embraces us and watches over us as we perch on its branches... And Claude is like the wind, pushing us forward as we soar across the open sky...
Hilda: Hm. The metaphor about the professor is solid, but I think Claude just blows us around on a whim. Still, we owe him a lot.
Ignatz: I think that's beautiful, Marianne. I can really picture it. When the war is over, I'd love to paint a picture of those two. Oh! And of all the people we've fought with as well!
Leonie: You mean like a historical painting? I like that! Maybe our descendants will look at it a long, long time from now...
Lorenz: I must say, that piques my interest. I look forward to seeing how you portray my valiant efforts.
Leonie: When you put it that way, we may be witnessing one of the greatest events in Fódlan's history. It's a lot of pressure, but the sense of duty I feel is even stronger than the fear.
Raphael: I'm just happy to be here with all of you! I won't get scared, no matter what we face!
Hilda: We have our goal. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Let's get to work!

@Conversation 
Claude: My friend! The reinforcements the lords sent are finally gathering. Truth be told, Fort Merceus would've made for a better base of operation. But that weird pillar of light changes things. It's pretty scary, honestly... I wonder what it is...
Byleth: The rage of the goddess.
Claude: Well, that is how the legend goes in Ailell. If it really was the rage of the goddess, let's do our best not to enrage her even further.
Byleth: Some kind of magic. 
Claude: Makes sense. But whatever it was, I've never seen destructive power quite like it. I wonder where it came from...
Byleth: A natural phenomenon.
Claude: You think it's natural? What, the planet just up and decided to take a shot at the fort? I dunno, Teach.
Claude: Well, I guess pondering it is a waste of energy for now. Let's just get ready to move out. The capital is Edelgard's domain, so she has the advantage. It's going to be a tough battle.



Lorenz: I was taught from a young age to believe that the creed of Seiros was just the way of the world. To question it never even occurred to me. But Claude and Edelgard are different. They challenge the common wisdom. Even defy it. It is uncomfortable to discard familiar assumptions. But that is an essential quality of the visionary. Indeed, true greatness must lie beyond common sense. Hmm, that's good. I should write that down.



Raphael: We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?
Byleth: Mitreflanc Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Byleth: Mittlefrank Opera Company. 
Raphael: Ah, that's the one!
Byleth: Mildewplank Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Raphael: My little sis always goes on about how much she'd like to see 'em perform. I know we can't see a show, but do you think we could at least see the building?



Ignatz: We're about to put the finishing touches on this war. I wonder how Fódlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction. I can't wait to see it! On the other hand, I'm terrified of what the future might hold. Who knows if I'll survive the assault on the capital?



Lysithea: Invading the capital and smashing the Empire. I wonder if doing so could really end this war. Care to share your thoughts, Professor?
Byleth: I think it'll end the war.
Lysithea: You say that with such confidence. I want to believe that it's true.
Byleth: I don't know. 
Lysithea: Perhaps you feel similarly to me. The whole mess puts me on edge.
Lysithea: Although for now, better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand.



Marianne: If we can win this war, then Claude will be the king of Fódlan, and… Maybe he'll tear down the wall that separates Fódlan from the outside world.
Byleth: Perhaps he will. 
Byleth: Perhaps he won't.
Marianne: I know it's hard to imagine… But I really hope he does. It would be so much better if people could live together instead of apart. I might even be able to live an ordinary life in the world Claude envisions…



Hilda: Fighting in the capital! Ugh! And we're fighting against Edelgard! Double ugh! But with you leading us, Professor, I know we'll win. Yeah! Wahoo! Fighting! I'm a little scared, to be honest. I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine.



Leonie: We're finally going to the capital. This will be my chance to avenge Captain Jeralt. Once we smash the Empire, I'm sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace.
Byleth: I think you're right. 
Byleth: Who can say for sure?
Leonie: Monica killed Captain Jeralt for the Flame Emperor, and the Flame Emperor was Edelgard. I know that the future of all Fódlan rests on this battle. Nothing else is more important. But for me, this is personal. For Captain Jeralt's sake, I'm going to give it all I've got and more!



Ferdinand: Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild Fódlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor…



Linhardt: They used to call Enbarr the city of Seiros... To assault it, together with the knights, is surreal. If Seiros were alive today, I wonder what she might make of our war... In Enbarr, there was once a Southern Church, and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it. A hundred years ago, the Southern Church became entangled in an insurrection. Until five years ago, the Empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another.



Caspar: It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.
Byleth: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Hey, don't try and scare me!
Byleth: It sounds like you're scared. 
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!
Caspar: If he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault, we might lose. I better make my peace with that.


Bernadetta: Professor! My, um, my mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father. If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside.



Dorothea: The whole of the capital is going to be a battleground. The city has such a long heritage… Even so, perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once. But we can’t let the commonfolk get hurt. We should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town.



Petra: Five years ago...Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding.



Felix: The Death Knight is no ordinary knight. I will prey upon him. I will quench my blade's thirst with his blood. His focus is on fighting you, I'm sure. But mine will be the last face he sees.



Ashe: Those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in Fort Merceus. Think what might have happened if they'd have hit us during the battle at Gronder Field. Assuming it was the work of the Imperial army...



Sylvain: So Enbarr, the Capital of the Empire. It's finally time. I never thought I'd live this long. It's like any battle, really--stay calm, stay focused. Don't give in to your enemy or your own fear.
Byleth: You seem more serious than usual.
Sylvain: Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me... 
Byleth: We'll get through this together.  
Sylvain: Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?



Mercedes: It's been so long since I've been to the Imperial capital. I used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother. I never thought my return would be like this...



Annette: Enbarr… Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be returning like this. Of course, most of the nobles in the Empire make their home in the capital. In the Kingdom, all nobles live in their own domains. So if the capital is attacked, it doesn't necessarily affect them directly. What will happen to the Imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield?



Ingrid: Once this battle is over, what will become of Faerghus and Fódlan?
Byleth: Peace will reign. 
Ingrid: Peace, you say? It sounds so…foreign, so unattainable. But maybe, just maybe.
Byleth: What would you like to see happen?
Ingrid: My hope is for a world at peace. A world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past—the stuff of legends.
Ingrid: I believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new, better world. So the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil, the better. We must win, Professor. There is no alternative here. I won’t allow for anything else.



Seteth: Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. If we are able to save her, then I expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you. Are you prepared for that?
Byleth: I am. 
Seteth: Excellent.
Byleth: I don't think I'm ready yet.
Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready.
Seteth: The battle will soon be upon us. Let us both be at our best for what is to come.



Flayn: I was born in Enbarr. My mother and father met in a church there. Not too long after, I was brought into the world. I do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place. It is most regrettable.



Hanneman: Enbarr's streets are paved with unhappy memories, Professor. I've avoided the damned place ever since I abandoned my nobility. Swore never to return. Now here we are. To return in this manner... Well, I can't say it is something I ever imagined.



Manuela: In the opera, actors came and went all the time. But the people behind the scenes would stay forever. I'll bet I'd know a few of them now, even after all these years.




Alois: Here we are, facing the final battle with the Empire. It's been a long, difficult struggle. We have to get Lady Rhea back! And we have to crush the Empire, in the name of Captain Jeralt. I don't know what comes next. But we can sort out those details later.



Catherine: Looks like we're nearing the end of this struggle. I'm sure Lady Rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her.
Byleth: Probably. 
Catherine: I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Byleth: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings.
Catherine: Lady Rhea's not waiting for me, I know, no matter how much I might wish she were. She's waiting for you.



Shamir: Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. The final target was the capital. But they were countered at a port town, long before they reached their destination. I guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs, all things considered.



Cyril: Whenever I think about how we'll be seeing Lady Rhea real soon, I get happy and really get cleaning! We'll get there for sure, right? We'll see her again?
Byleth: We'll meet her for sure. 
Byleth: We don't know for sure.
Cyril: I got gotta believe Lady Rhea is waiting for us in the capital... We just have to find her.



Balthus: Nader the Undefeated… With a name like that, he's bound to put up a damn-good fight. Did you get a good look at Judith? She practically had hearts floating out of her eyeballs when she looked at Nader.
Byleth: She must be in love. 
Balthus: You saw it too? Heh, I know that look well. She's got it bad. Honestly, they'd make a cute couple.
Byleth: I'm not so sure about that.
Balthus: Pretty dense, aren't ya? Trust me, pal. No one's seen more heart-eyed women than this guy. She's got it bad.
Byleth: That's ridiculous.
Balthus: Pretty dense, aren't ya? Trust me, pal. No one's seen more heart-eyed women than this guy. She's got it bad.
Balthus: It makes all the sense. Even seasoned warriors aren't immune to love, pal.



Judith: That Nardel guy... or Nader, I suppose. It was all some trick, and we fell for it. Hmph. I don't think the nickname The Undefeated applies is he flees from us. Though... maybe he only got that name by running away. Can't be defeated if you run off, right?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Momentum's really picking up for this final battle, huh? Even I'm starting to feel tense! Me! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire. It's one of the sacred sites of the Seiros faith, so it's a pretty big deal. But hey, no need to worry about the monastery while you're fighting the final battle. I've got it covered! I'll defend it to my last!

@Opening 
After making preparations at Garreg Mach, the Alliance army marches to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. In response to the Alliance's movements, Emperor Edelgard orders her trusted retainer, Hubert, as well as the Death Knight, to the front lines to meet the Alliance army head-on. The two forces clash in the city streets.

Vastly outnumbered by Imperial forces, it becomes clear that a surprise attack, followed by a short and decisive battle, is the only path to victory. With this in mind, you stealthily approach Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.

@Intro 
Claude: There it is... Enbarr. The Imperial capital and the largest city in all of Fódlan.
Judith: It's not just big. This city was designed to protect the castle where the emperor lives. It's as though the city itself is a massive stronghold.
Byleth: And the citizens?
Byleth: What is the state of affairs in the town?
Claude: They surely noticed us approaching some time ago, and yet...
Shamir: Our scouts confirmed the citizens haven't been evacuated. They're being kept in town.
Claude: I've got to hand it to Her Imperial Majesty. Using her citizens as a shield to protect the castle takes some resolve.
Lysithea: I suspect those mages will be lurking within as well...
Shamir: Troops deployed to other areas are also returning.
Judith: If we don't conquer the city quickly, things will get complicated fast.
Byleth: I hope we find Rhea...
Seteth: We can't search until we conquer the city. Let's focus on the fight for now.
Cyril: Lady Rhea, please be safe.
Claude: We've kept the Empire waiting long enough. Onward!

@Battle
Claude: We were told Hubert would be leading the enemy forces, but the Death Knight's also with them. We'll have to take care of both of them, but we won't have time to mop up all the enemy units. We'll have to split up and take them on at the same time, or risk being overrun by their reinforcements.

Imperial Soldier: It's here! The Crest of Flames banner! There! On the other side of the canal!
Hubert: Uninvited guests, I see. Heh. Let's ensure they receive a warm welcome. Ready the artillery. Prepare to attack. Rocks, arrows, magic - rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave. Reinforcements will fly in shortly. Defend the heavy weapons until they arrive. 


Hubert: Our first wave of reinforcements is here. It will not be long until the next.
Claude: Reinforcements?! That was quick... We can't hang around or they'll just keep coming. We'll have to capture the artillery. We can turn them against their reinforcements...

Hubert: We have reinforcements coming in from another direction. Deploy them as soon as they arrive.

Claude: OK! Just Hubert left to deal with...
Hubert: We are taking heavy losses. We need more troops...

Claude: Well done, everyone! Now we can break through into Enbarr! We need to hurry up and attack the palace to block Edelgard's movements!

@Boss 
%Claude,Hubert 
Claude: It's over, lapdog. Your military rule is at its end.
Hubert: For every step you take along that path, our thorns will cut into your heels.
Claude: Ooh, that sounds painful. I'll have to wear thicker soles for the march.
Hubert: If your boots are too heavy, you won't be able to lift your feet. But enough prattle.

%Seteth,Death Knight
Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!
Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face.

%Flayn,Death Knight
Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!
Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again!

%Claude,Death Knight
Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up an Imperial general...
Death Knight: So, you wish to die.
Claude: Heh. As antisocial and unhinged as ever, I see.

%Mercedes,Death Knight
Mercedes: I came here to get you! Let's return together, Emile!
Death Knight: Leave! The place of your death is not here!

@End 
Claude: We've made it this far... Somehow. Edelgard is probably looking down on us from somewhere in that castle.
Leonie: I wonder if she's panicking or just smiling smugly...
Claude: From this point on, she'll be giving it her all too. Expect her to be tougher than the last time we fought. This battle will settle things once and for all. We'll attack as soon as everyone is ready.

Claude: Huh? Is that you, Dedue?!
Dedue: I heard the Alliance's army has entered the city. I've been searching for you ever since.
Byleth: How long have you been in Enbarr?
Dedue: I arrived not long after the battle at Gronder Field. I am here to kill Edelgard.
Byleth: What are you doing in Enbarr?
Dedue: I'm waiting for a chance to kill Edelgard. I have not yet been blessed with the opportunity.
Claude: Well, if you want to fight alongside us, we'd be more than happy to have you.

Dedue: We fight for different objectives. I swore to offer Edelgard's head to His Highness. But... Should I fail, I will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you. This is the information I have gathered during my time in hiding here. It includes details about the inside of the castle.

Claude: I appreciate this, but... What do you plan to do? Don't tell me you plan to do alone?
Dedue: I've done what I came here to do. Farewell.

Claude: Hey! Wait! He's gone. He's just as hard to understand as his liege was.
Claude: The time has finally come, my friend. Once we win this fight, the Empire will fall...
Byleth: What will become of Fódlan?
Claude: What will become of it? Well, that's for us to decide, isn't it?
Byleth: What will we do about Fódlan? 
Claude: The subject is heavy on my mind.
Claude: Odd as it sounds, I believe the forces responsible for destroying Fódlan are also responsible for protecting the livelihood of its citizens. Everything, even the land itself, has been harmed by the chaos of war. Restoring it will be no easy feat. To do that, the first thing we need to think about is a new ruling system for all of Fódlan.
Byleth: The Alliance lords could divide the territory.
Claude: No, I don't think that would work. The western half of the continent has little connection to the Alliance. Any attempt to force dominion on them would breed rebellion. The world would slide back into war once again.
Byleth: We could unify Fódlan as one nation.
Claude: As usual, we're on the same page. I was thinking the same thing.
Claude: Even if the Alliance lords and any remaining influential nobles were to divide up dominion of all of Fódlan... They would simply pursue their own interests. Another war would be inevitable. That's why there needs to be a powerful ruler who stands above them all and unifies Fódlan as one nation.
Byleth: You should be that ruler, Claude.
Claude: If it means I can lead Fódlan to a better future, I wouldn't mind that at all.
Byleth: We must search for a new ruler.
Claude: A new ruler, huh? I think I've got someone in mind.
Byleth: I should be that ruler.
Claude:  My friend... Do you really mean that?
Claude: My dreams await in a future where Fódlan is no longer ravaged by war. There are things I want to see with you some day. I'll keep thinking about the best way to achieve that goal. Whatever we decide to do, we can't do it until we defeat the Empire. Fódlan can't welcome a new dawn until we win the war. Let's prepare as best we can.@Opening 
Claiming the monastery at Garreg Mach as its home base, the Alliance army joins forces with the Knights of Seiros. Together, they begin to take up arms against the Adrestian Empire.

@Dialogue 
Claude: Good work, Hilda! You didn't do much manual labor, but you managed to rope the knights into helping us restore the monastery.
Hilda: Thanks, Claude, but all I did was piggyback on your scheme. I saw your eyes telling me to make some magic happen!

Alois: Thank you so much for your help with the restoration.
Hilda: Oh please, it was nothing! We're just doing our part as former students.
Catherine: I'm told you even routed the bandits. That job should have fallen to us. I'm sorry for the trouble.
Claude: Hey, don't think twice about it. We're all allies in the resistance against the Empire, right?
Catherine: The church is at war with the Empire, but let's be realistic. Wouldn't it be better for the Alliance to eventually submit?
Claude: The way I see it, the emperor wants to take over all of Fódlan and destroy the existing order of the world. I can't see her allowing the Alliance to continue to exist. We're in this just as deeply as you are. Actually… We were hoping to use this place as a base. The Empire begs to be meddled with, and we're first in line.
Alois: What? Why would you want to make your base here of all places?
Claude: Garreg Mach is situated in the center of Fódlan, both geographically and spiritually. We want to secure this location while the Empire is still overlooking it.
Catherine: I see. The Empire doesn't see this place as important at the moment because it's far from the front lines.
Claude: But if we simply decide that it's ours to occupy, that does nothing to inspire the hearts and minds of the people of Fódlan. Luckily, good ol' Teach has finally returned to us. If the Professor Rhea entrusted with the Sword of the Creator fights at our side… Well now. That's a just cause anyone could get behind. What's more, here we are, working alongside the legendary Knights of Seiros. It smacks of divine providence, doesn't it? Can you feel it?

Seteth: I have heard what you have to say, Claude. And you, Professor? Where do you stand?
Byleth: I will fight the Empire.
Seteth: Hm. On our own, we lack sufficient military strength. But with the help of the Alliance…
Byleth: I will find Rhea.
Seteth: Hm. We are at a relative standstill, but with the help of the Alliance…
Seteth: The archbishop said if anything should happen to her, that we should entrust the affairs of the church to you. If you intend to fight alongside the Alliance, then I will follow you as well. Is that acceptable, Claude?
Claude: Of course. I can't think of anything more reassuring than having both Teach and the knights on our side. Together, we'll stop the emperor and her reckless ambitions!

@Conversation 
Claude: Hey there, my friend. It's funny how the monastery was once in ruins, but now it's downright bustling. Thanks to a little promise five years ago, our buddies have all gathered, and even the knights have returned. It's like we were all just waiting for you to awaken. And now we're all going to band together against the Imperial army. You should go and talk to everyone, if you can. There may be some who are still on the fence.



Lorenz: I have written to my father to signal my intention to remain here. Not that I require his approval to do so. There is not much for me to gain by returning to Alliance territory now. But by staying, I will be able to influence the course of events directly, on the field of battle.
Byleth: Will you get along with the Alliance leader?
Lorenz: We will not be friends, but I will cooperate with him as much as is necessary to secure victory.
Byleth: Will you keep an eye on the Alliance leader? 
Lorenz: Naturally. Someone needs to make certain he does not lead the Alliance to ruin.



Raphael: Fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true, Professor! And don't worry about my little sis. Right now she's back home helping out with the family business. I kinda figured I was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her. But thanks to you and Claude, I get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight!



Ignatz: It's been fixed up quite a bit, but it's battle scars aren't so easily erased... To think that a glorious cathedral, with a thousand year history... would end up like this. I'll rebuild this place someday. This cathedral is the symbol of Fódlan. Maybe I should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old, while I still remember what it looked like...



Lysithea: I've grown weary and impatient - these past five years, my hands have been bound. But now, I can finally take action with a clear goal. I'm grateful to you and to everyone.
Byleth: I didn't do anything. 
Lysithea: Nonsense. Your presence steeled everyone's resolve.
Byleth: And that goal is?
Lysithea: Down with the Empire! Surely peace will soon follow if the Empire is overthrown. Then my parents can finally find peace themselves.



Marianne: Even with the church in shambles, we can still pray. The goddess will surely hear our prayers, but still... I hope the church can return to it's former beauty someday.



Hilda: I'm pretty headstrong, but Claude could give me a run for my money. I mean, he's dragged the knights into this. You ought to be careful, Professor.
Byleth: I'll be fine.
Hilda: I wonder if you've got a hidden headstrong side? You must be hiding it really well though.
Byleth: You too. 
Hilda: Don't worry about me. I'm here because I want to be. Also because being around my big brother feels like a real chore.



Leonie: It's not just for my village that I'm fighting alongside you here, you know. It's also that Captain Jeralt asked me, his first and greatest apprentice, to look out for you. Of course, it wouldn't be enough just to keep you alive. It's my duty to make sure you win too. So do your best, Professor. And count on me to watch your back.



Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more than a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor… Do you think I chose the wrong path?
Byleth: Not at all.
Byleth: We'll find out soon enough. 
Ferdinand: You are right…



Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather surprised how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon.



Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and Alliance. Then, I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!


Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite Solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?
Byleth: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!
Byleth: Hear What? 
Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good.



Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.



Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be… difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means the common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will…ah, will turn. I have certainty.



Felix: A country with no king has no future. That's why I made my way here. Professor, don't let me down.
Byleth: Country with no king?
Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough.
Byleth: Let's forge ahead. 
Felix: Yes, let's. Find me a worthy opponent to battle and I'll be content.



Sylvain: I'm the heir of House Gautier, and I'm fighting alongside a bunch of Alliance people? I can just imagine my father's face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me. I don't know how standing and fighting for Faerghus would have helped. Sorry, Professor. I don't regret my decisions. I'm just thinking out loud. And I'm hoping I haven't made a big mistake.



Mercedes: You're here, Professor, along with everyone from our old class. It's like we've gone back in time! When I think that I'll be around you again, all of my sorrows just drift away.
Byleth: Frankly, I don't feel too happy.
Mercedes: Hmm, I understand. Especially with Lady Rhea missing...It sounds like the Kingdom and Empire have been in a sorry state too. But we can't let that get us down!
Byleth: Let's do our best together.
Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back.
Mercedes: Let's work together for the common good, like we did five years ago!



Annette: Members of the knights tell me that Father left their ranks five years ago. They say he announced he was returning to the Kingdom, but nobody’s heard from him since. I haven’t received word that he went back to Mother… Where could he be… Where are you, Father…



Ingrid: Professor. I have a proposal. Why not go beyond the Knights of Seiros—instead, uniting with allies from all across Fódlan to fight for our cause? Looking back, it would have been best to ally with the Kingdom and join forces against the Empire. But now the Kingdom is not exactly… Well…



Seteth: Five long years, I've searched for you and the archbishop. It's a pleasure to see you again. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. 
Seteth: Thank you. I know the battles ahead will be dire, but we will support you with all our strength.
Byleth: We don't know what the future will bring.
Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down.



Flayn: Professor, I am so glad you are unharmed! No matter the path you walk, I will be with you every step of the way. Anything you ask of me, I shall see it through. You saved my life, and I am in your debt.



Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.
Byleth: We can talk about that. 
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Byleth: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!



Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though I suppose I haven't changed either, right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, Just the two of us, forever young. Oh, let me have my fun.



Alois: I'd given up on ever seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!
Byleth: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain! to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Byleth: Right, the Promise. 
Alois: That's right! I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!



Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea.
Byleth: That's fine. 
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Byleth: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs.



Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.



Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back. You gotta find her, Professor. You just gotta.



Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died as well in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again, I promise you that! Even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!


@Intro 
Claude: Everyone, listen up! I have a proposal. We are now building our forces in order to rise up against the Imperial army. But it wouldn't be smart for us to fight under the banner of the Alliance. That would only incite the lords who support the Empire. We've also combined forces with the Knights of Seiros. Therefore, I suggest that we operate under a new symbol. That's why I've prepared this...

Claude: You may recognize it as the Crest of Flames, which resides in Teach. The phantom Crest that has reappeared after more than 1,000 years. We're attempting our own miracle, so it seems like a suitable symbol for us. So... Until we welcome the dawn of a new age in Fódlan... Let's fight to the very end, as one, under the symbol of the Crest of Flames!
Hilda: Impressive, Claude. Forget restoring the monastery. You've somehow roped everyone into fighting back against the Empire!
Claude: If you recall, I never asked anyone to join us. If anything, we have Teach's achievements to thank. Now that you mention it, I guess I should express my gratitude.


Claude: Hey, friend. So this is where you've been. Without you, the knights never would have joined our cause. I could never pay you back for that.
Byleth: You're welcome.
Byleth: Let's do our best.
Claude: Just leave it to me, Teach. When this fight is over, I plan to see all of my dreams come to fruition, and yours as well.
Byleth: What are you dreams, Claude?
Claude: Well, for example... to bust open Fódlan's Throat. There's a massive fortress there, which is responsible for protecting the eastern border of the Alliance. I like to think of it as a lid on a bottle. The people of Fódlan only know a small part of the world. Their prejudices are born because they don't know what lies beyond their borders. And the opposite is true too. Those outside of Fódlan don't know about this place. Ignorance breeds discrimination. Whether you look inside the bottle or outside of it... If you really look, all you find are people who you can get along with, if you only try. That's why I wanna bust open that lid, which is keeping us locked inside. Or destroy the bottle entirely.
Byleth: Are you going to tell our allies about this?
Claude: I'll find the right time to bring it up. Even if I talked about it now, it doesn't seem realistic, does it? First we need to defeat the Empire and restore peace to... Huh?
Leonie: Professor! Claude! We're under attack!
Claude: I guess we'll have to cut our conversation short. What's going on, Leonie?
Leonie: It's a small group, but some Imperial troops are headed this way. It looks like they were stationed nearby.
Claude: I got to hand it to Edelgard. Nothing gets past that woman.
Byleth: We should proceed cautiously. 
Claude: As long as we don't let our guard down, there's no way they can defeat us.
Byleth: Let's take them down. 
Leonie: All right! I'll show you how much I've improved, Professor!
Claude: This will be our first battle alongside the Knights of Seiros. Let's kick off our new partnership with a magnificent victory!

@Opening
Though plans to resist the Empire are still being devised by the Alliance army, the Imperial army has already anticipated their next move. An Imperial vanguard, just outside Garreg Mach, led by General Randolph, begins to advance with the aim of toppling the monastery once again.

Fulfilling a promise made five years ago, your former students gather once more at the monastery, as do the knights. However, your joyful reunion is cut short...

@Battle 
Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!
Claude: So, the enemy intends to use their overwhelming numbers to defeat us. Let's fight fire with... actual fire.

Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
Claude: If they reach the interior, the enemy will take the monastery. Drive them back immediately!

Imperial Soldier: What? That strange battle flag is... But isn't our enemy the Church of Seiros?
Randolph: They didn't have enough soldiers with just the church, so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues. It doesn't matter what flag they fly. They're nothing more than a mob. We'll destroy them all!


Claude: Allied soldiers are making preparations for the plan. Protect them!

Claude: What? The fire attack unit was routed?! Damn it...my brilliant plan failed.
Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!

Claude: We're prepared for the fire attack. Now we just need to draw the enemy's attention. You can't defeat us with that many soldiers? The Imperial army is doomed without a capable general!
Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
Claude: Now!

Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!


Claude: If we let them escape, they'll come back to attack later. We have to take them out!


Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
Claude: Teach, look out! They're after your head!

@End 
Claude: Phew! Nice work. We won without much incident, thanks to all of you.
Knight of Seiros: I don't think the Empire will leave us alone now. What do you plan to do?
Claude: I intend to ask the Alliance lords to share some troops with us to bolster our forces.
Lorenz: I will speak plainly. No matter whom we beseech for reinforcements, our envoys will inevitably pass through Gloucester territory. My father is being cautious not to give the Empire a pretext to intervene. Therefore, he is unlikely to allow even envoys to pass through.
Byleth: Why not request reinforcements from the Kingdom?
Claude: Ah... I guess I haven't told you yet, Teach. The Kingdom isn't in a position to be sending anyone reinforcements. After losing King Lambert during the Tragedy of Duscur, a Regent had been handling it's politics. But then... There was a bloody coup. The Regent and Prince Dimitri both... Apparently the whole family was killed. All Blaiddyd territory, including the Kingdom capital, is being ruled by those who are cooperating with the Empire. The Kingdom is no more. It's not called the Faerghus Dukedom. The vast majority of the former Kingdom lords bent a knee to the overwhelming power of the Empire and the Dukedom, and now fall under their jurisdiction.
Claude: Some who formerly held power are continuing to resist, but it would be difficult for them to regain it.
Hilda: Oh, hey! I can think of one person who we can ask for reinforcements. Someone whose territory is really close, and who's on good terms with Claude...
Lysithea: Ah! The Hero of Daphnel, I presume?
Leonie: I've seen her before, and she does seem to be reliable.
Marianne: You're talking about Judith, right? I bet she would lend us a hand...
Byleth: She seems intimidating.
Byleth: She seems strong.
Claude: That's right, you've met her once before, Teach. She's a fearsome one-woman army. She did a lot for me, even before I was recognized as the heir to House Riegan. I don't like the idea of owing her more than I already do, but given the situation, sacrifices must be made. I'll reach out to her. As for the rest of you, prepare for our next battle.

Claude: Heya, Teach. How are you feeling? Does anything feel, um... strange at all?
Byleth: Nothing in particular.
Claude: Good. I still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes. But maybe that's not a concern now that you've spent five long years napping.
Byleth: I feel a bit sluggish.
Claude: Well, you were asleep for five whole years, after all. It'll probably take time to get you back to top form. Though I'm relieved to see you haven't lost a step as far as combat goes.
Claude: Your command bringing my schemes to life... That's just how we fight best.
Byleth: Any word from Judith?
Claude: Not yet, but there's no need to worry. That woman adores me. Once we've bolstered our forces, it'll finally be time to start taking decisive action. But I wonder... Do you really think Rhea is still alive?
Byleth: She's alive.
Claude: I think so too. It's hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret.
Byleth: I don't know.
Claude: There's no telling. But it's also hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret.
Claude: I wonder where she is and what she's doing...
Byleth: Do you hope she's alive?
Claude: All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her.
Byleth: Do you hope she's dead? 
Claude: That's a dangerous question, Teach. To be honest, I've given it a lot of thought. All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her.
Claude: About the true history of Crest Stones and Heroes' Relics... and the truth behind the legend of Seiros and Nemesis. She has secrets. Too many of them for my comfort. Considering the state of the world... it's suspicious. You must be curious about what was done to you and what her plans were for you, right? And you never did learn about your mother, did you? None of our doubts will ever be clear unless we hear these answers from Rhea herself. In that sense, I absolutely hope Rhea is still alive. But as far as Fódlan goes, I do wonder what a world without Rhea would look like.
Byleth: A world without Rhea?
Claude: The majority of people in Fódlan believe in the Seiros faith that Rhea preaches. That's why they accept the noble system as if it were the only option, and refuse to associate with those who believe in anything else. That closed-minded philosophy is the reason why Fódlan's Throat is locked tight. But if you remove the archbishop who strictly advocates that doctrine, that world view is no longer absolute. There's room for free thought. The leadership of the church would undoubtedly fall to you, and you would hold the power to change the shape of the faith. Of the world. Then, for the first time, people would truly be free to think for themselves. To decide what's right, and what's wrong. Honestly, I believe Edelgard is probably hoping to achieve something very similar. But her methods require too much bloodshed. That's not something the world can get behind. Anyway... The best thing we can do is find Rhea and hear what she has to say. Heh, oops... I guess I've been going on for a while now. Sorry about that. You should get some rest.@Opening 
The Alliance army successfully rendezvous with Judith in Ailell. With the addition of House Daphnel's forces, the time has come to invade Empire territory.

@Intro 
Claude: Preparations are complete. Now it's a game of patience. As they say, good things come to those who wait.
Lorenz: Care to elaborate on this plan of yours, Claude? Can we really do this without battling my father?
Claude: Pretty soon, Count Gloucester will need to gather his troops in the northern part of his territory.
Byleth: Against the Kingdom?
Claude: The Kingdom has experience constant infighting since the coup. They're out of the picture for now.
Byleth: Against Houses Riegan and Daphnel? 
Claude: You got it, Teach!
Judith: The combined forces of the Riegan and Daphnel houses will threaten the northern part of the Gloucester territory. Nardel, that retainer I mentioned, is going to draw their attention.
Claude: We'll take that opportunity to make our way through Gloucester territory and launch a surprise attack on the Great Bridge of Myrddin.
Lorenz: And...are you not concerned about the possibility that I may tip off my father?
Claude: The future of the Alliance rests on this battle. I'm certain you won't betray us.
Lorenz: Hmph. I will ensure our success.
Claude: I know you will. If we win this fight, then our next goal will be to topple Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. I said before that my plan was to meddle with the Empire, but I'm going to do you one better. We are going to defeat the Empire, once and for all. But to do that, we can't afford to slip up here. Bear that in mind and prepare yourselves for the coming battle.

@Conversation 
Claude: If our plan succeeds, we'll arrive at the Great Bridge of Myrddin unscathed. The important part is what happens next. We're evenly matched in terms of military power, more or less, so if we can just launch a surprise attack...
Byleth: We have the advantage.
Claude: I wouldn't be so sure. That bridge is almost like a fortress. The defense there is rock solid.
Byleth: It could go either way. 
Claude: Agreed. The bridge is basically a fortress, so the defense will be rock solid.
Byleth: We'll still be at a disadvantage.
Claude: I'll give you that the bridge is basically a fortress. I wouldn't say we're at a loss, but we certainly shouldn't rest easy.
Claude: But that's why you're here, Teach! No matter the odds, you're the wild card we need to win!



Lorenz: I would like to believe that I have always made my own decisions. Even so, I cannot deny that some small part of me has always been aware of my father's wishes. Now, here I am. Concealing our plan - Claude's plan - from his sight.
Byleth: Are you having second thoughts?
Lorenz: No. The strategy is sound, and I've consented to it.
Byleth: You're not reluctant, though, are you? 
Lorenz: Quite the contrary, honestly. I feel as though a fog has finally lifted from my eyes.
Lorenz: In this fight, I will finally stand upon my own two feet, independent of my father's influence.



Raphael: Thanks to all that food from Judith, I'm full for once! I've got so much energy! Let me at that Great Bridge of Myrddin! I'll bust it down myself! Oh, but then how do we cross?



Ignatz: The Great Bride of Myrddin isn't just a bridge. It has the features of a fortress. I believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the Adrestian Empire. In other words, it's even older than the monastery. So if we occupy the Great Bridge, we'll have to search it from top to bottom.



Lysithea: I'm sure you know this already, but House Ordelia is aligned with the Empire. They face the Empire from across a river, similar to the Gloucesters. Even so, I refuse to yield to the Empire a second time. The Empire did unthinkable things to my family. And to me. The only option here is winning. Professor, you must promise we will overcome the Empire.



Marianne: Legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged Ailell. I was reminded of that when I saw it... Um, Professor? Do you think those legends are true?
Byleth: It's likely.
Marianne: I think so too. I don't know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger, but...
Byleth: Yes, and it'll likely happen again. 
Marianne: Oh! I suppose you may be right. There's no way to be sure it won't...
Marianne: There's still so many things we don't understand in this world.



Hilda: It looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town. I guess they feel safe now that you and the Knights of Seiros have returned. Peddlers have become more common too, so there'll be food and supplies available. After being run-down for all those years, it's really becoming livable again!



Leonie: Things have gotten a lot more interesting since we've joined up with Judith, haven't they? Anyone who casually treats Claude like he's just some kid is not a person to be trifled with. I think Captain Jeralt would have liked her. I hope someday I can be as strong, kind, and levelheaded as her.



Ferdinand: What used to be Aegir territory lies far to the east of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, downstream of the Airmid River. For the sake of my family, I wish we could invade the Empire from there. But I do not have the power to advocate for that. Strategically, Myrddin is more important.
Byleth: Someday, we'll take it back. 
Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!
Byleth: Taking it back would be difficult.
Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!



Linhardt: Since I'm originally from the Empire, it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks. Fine by me. Honestly, I'd bet they're watching my every move to make sure I can be trusted.
Byleth: I'm sure they're not...
Linhardt: If I were leading the Alliance, it's what I would do.
Byleth: Probably. 
Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?



Caspar: The Airmid River separates the Empire and Alliance. It's the largest river in Fódlan. Sometimes it'll flood when there's lots of rain, but... At least the land gets some extra water!


Bernadetta: War isn't kind to you if you're a recluse. By the time you realize what's going on, you're already under attack. And if you're off by yourself, you can get killed with no one ever even finding out.
Byleth: Sounds like you're learning.
Byleth: Isn't that a little pessimistic? 
Bernadetta: Oh, that'd be awful—just terrible! OK, Professor, I get it. I know I'll have to come out.



Dorothea: We're going to invade the Empire...which means we'll be fighting people we know, won't we? If we're attacked by someone we know, or used to think of as a friend, it is permitted to run away?
Byleth: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
Byleth: I wouldn't blame you. 
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?



Petra: If we can suppress this Myrddin, we can invade into the Empire, right? I was in the Empire. Now I will be an enemy... I am having strange feelings. It is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy...



Felix: We can predict what the Empire will do. Faerghus is our real problem. The eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the Dukedom. But I've heard nothing about that conflict as of late. It's strange. I haven't heard much from my father either. I can't help but find this silence unsettling...



Ashe: It's thanks to you that I'm here now. I owe you, Professor. You saved my life. I swear I'll do all I can to repay that debt.



Sylvain: I had an encounter with Lord Gwendal... How many years ago was it? Back before the academy, I met this girl who I fell madly in love with...and her dad tried to kill me. I suppose he just tried to scare me, but I was sure I was going to die. Oh yeah, her dad? Lord Gwendal. Crazy, right? I never thought I'd seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle. I kind of don't know how to make sense of it.



Mercedes: Lady Rhea is in the Empire, isn't she? We should hurry up and find her. So many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried...I want to ease their minds as soon as possible, Professor. Let's work together to find her!



Annette: Next we face the Great Bridge of Myrddin... We actually crossed it a long time ago. Do you remember? It was five whole years ago!
Byleth: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? 
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies...
Byleth: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!
Annette: Everyone was still friends then. After the fighting, we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses. But now we're fighting the same people who were our friends back then... Even Ashe... I often wish we could go back to those peaceful days...



Ingrid: So, that was Judith. Just as I’d heard of her, she was an upstanding person. The same Daphnel blood runs through my veins, and yet I feel as though I am nothing like her. I am a phantom of what could be…
Byleth: You're actually quite alike. 
Ingrid:  You think so? Wow, thank you!
Byleth: True, you do differ.
Ingrid: If only I could be half of who she is.



Seteth: If Rhea really is in the Empire, then we must defeat the Imperial army by any means necessary. The people at large are just as concerned for Rhea's safety as we are. The sooner we can settle all our unease, the better.



Flayn: Judith is a wonderful person. So strong and confident, as well. Looking upon her, I am sharply reminded of my mother.
Byleth: Does she look similar?
Flayn: Not in the slightest. Rather, it is her way of being - her demeanor. Brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.
Byleth: Does she act similar? 
Flayn: Very much so! Both brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.
Flayn: I... lost my mother, long ago. I miss her desperately.



Hanneman: The battle at Ailell was a tactical marvel. You grow stronger with each passing day. Where does your talent end and your Crest's power begin? Are they one and the same, I wonder? Most intriguing. Yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions, given the situation. It is quite unfortunate I did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out. So much unknown. Now, I fear I will not have those answers even by conflict's end. So very frustrating.



Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for... someone to talk to?
Byleth: Yes. 
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Byleth: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me.
Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor.



Alois: So, Lady Rhea was in the Empire all this time. Glad as I am that Judith told us, I wish we had known this five years ago. We spent all that time spread out over Fódlan, searching for the archbishop and you. It was a mistake to abandon the monastery, to leave it in ruins. Now we're paying for that mistake.



Catherine: I'd heard of the Hero of Daphnel, but that was the first time I've met her in person. She's the head of a prestigious noble family? Just like Claude. The Alliance nobility is so... odd.
Byleth: You don't think she acts like a noble?
Byleth: Is it different in the Kingdom and Empire? 
Catherine: Kind of, but I don't mean that in a bad way. You won't find such big-hearted nobles elsewhere. Plus, Judith can drink with the best of 'em! A woman after my own heart.



Shamir: Five years ago, when the Imperial army attacked Garreg Mach, they moved with incredible speed. But in the middle of all that chaos, she still had operatives watching. The Hero of Daphnel's spy network is impressive. She shouldn't be taken lightly.



Cyril: Is it true Lady Rhea was dragged off by the Imperial army? I heard that was true. Why'd they take Lady Rhea? Professor... they didn't take her to kill her, did they?
Byleth: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?
Byleth: They probably haven't killed her.
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now.
Cyril: You gotta help her, Professor. I'm begging ya.



Judith: I don't know where he recruited that man, but Claude's got an eye for great talent. I'm talking about his retainer, Nardel. I've only spoken with him briefly, but he seems to have a fair amount of both brains and brawn, with the skills to match. But there's something about him I can't quite place... Like I've somehow heard of him before...



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I was talking to some of the Daphnel soldiers earlier, and it seems that Judith has a weakness. But they wouldn't tell me what it is! I got the feeling they didn't appreciate the question. Pardon me for being curious! That said, maybe keep this to yourself. Not that she terrifies me to my soul, but I'd hate to get on her bad side...

@Intro 
Lorenz: The Great Bridge of Myrddin is in sight. Beyond it, the Empire.

Cyril: Whaddya know. There aren't bridges that big in Almyra, that's for sure...
Lysithea: How unsettling. There are bridges in the southern part of Ordelia territory, but nothing like this.
Claude: It's the most strategic location in that area to move a large army across the Airmid River. The Empire will want to hold on to it at all costs, so expect tough defenses.
Byleth: Let's finish this quickly. 
Lysithea: You're right. The enemy's guard should be down, so let's end this quickly before they have a chance to retaliate.
Byleth: Let's proceed with caution. 
Ignatz: You're right. The defenses are pretty impenetrable. Let's make our move carefully.
Claude: You're in command, Teach. Do whatever it takes to win. Well, other than sacrificing the lives of our allies for the sake of victory. Try to avoid that. Let's get moving. We're counting on you, my friend.

@Opening 
Sights set on the Imperial capital, the Alliance army chooses to march through the territory of House Gloucester - supporters of the Empire. Under the command of Nardel, the retainer of House Riegan, the defensive forces of House Riegan and Daphnel draw out the Gloucester troops. Thus the Alliance army can continue its march towards the Great Bridge of Myrddin and cross the Airmid river, which separates the Alliance and the Empire.

After fending off the Empire, your forces decide it's time to advance. But first, you must capture the Great Bridge of Myrddin, a strategic crossing point over the Airmid River, which borders the Alliance and the Empire.

@Battle 
Ladislava: That symbol... It's an enemy raid! Stay calm and face them head-on. Send a messenger to Acheron immediately! If we're quick, we might be able to pull off a pincer attack!
Claude: They say the enemy general, Ladislava, is among Edelgard's most trusted. Let's see what she's got.

Claude: Our goal is to take down Ladislava and gain control of the bridge. Let's go!

Imperial Soldier: You think we'll let you take this bridge from us?
Claude: Whoa, new enemies from the central fortress? By the looks of it, that might not be all of them.


Ladislava: Acheron! Now's the time to show your loyalty to the Empire! Attack the enemy from behind!
Acheron: I've got to make my name known to her Majesty through distinguished service.
Claude: Acheron the Weathervane. He's of the Alliance. He's a minor noble who holds territory to the north of Myrddin. If he's gonna support the Empire, no need to hold back. He's nothing but a nuisance, even to the Alliance.

Claude: Looks like we can capture this fortress quickly if we take out the soldiers protecting it.
Imperial Soldier: Enemies approaching! Get the soldiers standing by to join the fight! We may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too. Protect the fortress!

Alliance General: We'll ally ourselves with the Imperial soldiers too!

Ferdinand: I will leave this area to the reinforcements, and then I will swing around to provide support from the south.

Claude: I'm glad we defeated them here... I doubt they're an enemy we could win against twice.

@Boss 
%Claude,Acheron
Acheron: The declining Alliance will be finished if I kill you. The Empire will herald the new age!
Claude: Only if you manage to kill me. Hm? What's that to the north? Looks like the home of another opportunistic noble is burning...
Acheron: That's... that's my castle! NO!
Claude: That's the declining Alliance at work, right there. Seems like you were facing the wrong way, Weathervane!

@End 
Claude: Well done, everyone. The Great Bridge of Myrddin is ours.
Leonie: I was prepared for bloodshed, but that was more than expected... I guess I'm still not used to this.
Ignatz: Even our enemies were fighting for their own cause. They held out without fleeing until the bitter end...
Byleth: You don't have to get used to it. 
Leonie: That is true. I wouldn't want to become the type of person who feels nothing when someone dies.
Byleth: We must overcome this. 
Ignatz: Yes... we can't afford to stall here.
Claude: Now it's on me to return to Alliance territory and convince those lords to join us. Lorenz, would you return home for the time being and lay the groundwork with your father?
Lorenz: Fine. After all, this is for the Alliance. Or rather, for all of Fódlan.
Claude: For those of you who live in Alliance territories, I ask that you return to your houses, and spread the word about the current situation. Until we finish our preparations, Judith and the knights will do everything in their power to defend the Great Bridge.
Judith: That's a casual way to dole out such a deadly mission, boy.
Claude: Do you object?
Judith: Just who do you think I am? I won't let the Empire pass this way, even if it costs me my life.
Claude: Too bad you're not allowed to die. Fight like your life depends on it, but flee if you're ever truly in danger.
Judith: A tall order, as always. I'll use my best discretion, Claude.
Seteth: We have no objections either. Go forth and secure us a sufficiently powerful army.
Raphael: I'll stay here too. The only ones I'd be going home to are my little sis and my grandpa.
Claude: Are you sure you don't want to see your sister? It may be a while before you can return home again.
Raphael: But if I see her, I may not want to come back. So I'll wait till I'm done here.
Byleth: What about me?
Byleth: I'll stay here too.
Claude: Actually, I'd like for you to come with me, Teach. To help negotiate with the lords. They're followers of the Church of Seiros, after all. It'll make things easier if we have someone there to speak on Rhea's behalf. All right, everyone. Let's meet back at the monastery next month. Good luck out there.

???: Is that you, kiddo?
Claude: I have returned, Nardel.
Nardel: Oh, ah, Master Claude. It's you. I mistook you for one of the local children. My apologies.
Claude: It seems you have adjusted to your work here. Our recent strategy was successful, thanks to you.
Nardel: I was a bit concerned when House Goneril's army intervened from the east.
Claude: Count Gloucester must have requested reinforcements from them.
Nardel: Yes, and they have that young general who won some acclaim from his battles in Almyra... Regardless, they showed no signs of seriously wishing to attack us, and merely fulfilled their obligations to House Gloucester.
Nardel: Now then... who is this lovely lady?
Claude: This is my professor, who I asked to join me at the roundtable conference. Teach, this is Nardel, that retainer Judith was talking about.
Byleth: Nice to meet you.
Nardel: Hm, how polite. I've heard good things about you from Master Claude.
Byleth: ...
Nardel: You'll make me blush if you keep staring like that. Though I suppose people like me are something of a rarity here.
Claude: As you can see, he wasn't born in Fódlan. Still, trust me when I say he is highly capable.
Nardel: True. In fact, my capability is my only redeeming quality. I hope you'll continue to look after Master Claude, Professor.@Opening 
It is Imperial Year 1185. Nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at Garreg Mach, and war continues to plague the lands of Fódlan. Fhirdiad has been captured. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in shambles. The Leicester Alliance is on the verge of collapse, fractured by two opposing factions–those who support the Adrestian Empire and its ruler, and those who seek her demise. Meanwhile, under Emperor Edelgard’s rule of law, the Adrestian Empire continues to expand its reach. The path to a new Fódlan, unified by Imperial strength, may yet be in sight.

@Cutscene 
Claude: Huh?

Claude: You overslept, Teach. Pretty rude to keep a fella waiting like that, wouldn't you say?

Claude: What's with that surprised look, my friend?

Claude: You didn't really think I'd given up — on you coming back, did you?

Claude: Can you feel it? A new dawn is finally here. Not just for us, though. No, for all of Fódlan.

@Dialogue
Claude: It's been five long years. Where have you been, Teach? You don't really expect me to believe that you've been napping this whole time, do you?
Byleth: I was sleeping.
Byleth: I don't remember.
Claude: That's a good one! Except… That's not your lying face. I guess I've got no choice but to believe you. You're not exactly normal to begin with, so it's not a huge stretch to imagine you sleeping for that long. Aaand this is where you say, just kidding. Right? If this is a rib, now's the time to fess up.
Byleth: It's the truth.
Claude: You must be insane. And yet… Fine. I believe you, OK? But that means you don't know anything that happened after your last battle, right?

Claude: I guess it's on me to catch you up. As you can see, Garreg Mach was crushed by the Empire and was never restored. The monastery is in ruins, and the town is in pretty bad shape too. Can you guess why?
Byleth: Rhea has been sleeping too?
Claude: Huh. It would seem that's one possible explanation, since you insist that's what you've been up to.
Byleth: Rhea has died?
Claude: Her body was never found, and the Empire never declared that she had been killed. So… No telling.
Claude: All we know for sure is that Rhea suddenly vanished during that battle five years ago. The Knights of Seiros have apparently been searching all over Fódlan for her… But the fact that this place is still in ruins tells me they still haven't found her.
Byleth: We must find her.
Claude: True. I've got a mountain of questions I'd like to ask her, after all.
Byleth: I'm worried.
Claude: Worried, huh? Well, for better or worse, Rhea was clearly fond of you.
Claude: But I'm not so sure whether it would be good for her to return as the archbishop… Rather, with her gone… Eh, never mind. This could be a dangerous conversation. Before we discuss the state of affairs in each territory… Are you hungry? You must be. It's not much, but I did bring some food with me. Let's eat up and go from there.

@Intro 
Claude: Phew! I. Am. Stuffed. Even the most humble of meals tastes great with the right company. By the way, Teach, do you remember the night before the ball? I know it was five years ago… But we promised that the Golden Deer House would reunite during the millennium festival. Today's the day we promised to meet up… but no one's here.
Byleth: It's still early.
Claude: True… There's still some daylight left.
Byleth: They must not like us.
Claude: Heh, you know everyone looked up to you, right? Or is this your way of telling me I was a lousy house leader?
Claude: Let's just wait a little longer. You never know… Maybe someone will show up after all. Hey, Teach… Just waiting around sounds boring, so why don't we get in some exercise. You know, help with digestion and stuff. You must be in bad shape if you've been sleeping for five years. It'll do you good to get your body moving again.
Byleth: You want to work out?
Byleth: You want to play a game?
Claude: Something like that. Look, if you come with me, you'll understand. Oh, and don't forget your weapons, OK? I want to make sure neither your leadership nor your skill with a blade have dulled.

@Opening 
In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Imperialist loyalist Cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of Blaiddyd to prevent further revolt. Prince Dimitri has been sentenced. Now, the backbone of the former Kingdom–Houses Gautier and Fraldarius–struggle to continue the resistance. Cornelia–operating out of the royal palace–has accepted the support of the Empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining Kingdom forces.

In the Leicester Alliance, House Riegan leads an anti-Imperial faction, while House Gloucester directs the Empire’s supporters. Despite the undeniable threat of fracture, the Alliance’s adept new leader, Claude, deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front.

In Enbarr, the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire, Emperor Edelgard fights to strengthen her regime. She has extended her reach to the Kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western Fódlan.

In the meantime, the Knights of Seiros have been dispatched to find Archbishop Rhea, who remains missing despite their searching. Left unattended, the monastery at Garreg Mach has fallen to ruin…and become a haven for thieves.

@Battle 
Claude: The thieves are here. Apparently they're trying to run off with treasures from the monastery.
Pallardó: What the… Intruders! Protect the goods!

Claude: This is gonna get expensive. Collect everything the thieves carried out!

Lorenz: The barbarity is even worse than the rumors. On my honor as a noble, I will expel these ruffians!
Ignatz: Today was supposed to be a happy day, but the monastery is in disrepair...
Hilda: Over there… Is that the professor? And the others?!
Leonie: Professor! You're alive! Guess we'd better handle this before I celebrate though, huh?
Claude: You finally made it! I guess virtue still exists in this crazy world after all.

Raphael: Is that the professor and everyone else? If they're fighting, I gotta go help!
Lysithea: Wow, it's you! Here I thought you were dead all this time.
Marianne: Could that be the Professor's…ghost?
Claude: Hey, you're late! Hurry up and help!

Claude: Hm, we could split into two groups. If we hit them from the north and south, we can trap their leader in a pincer attack.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Hilda
Hilda: Professor! Boy am I glad to see you. How did we end up in this situation?

%Byleth,Ignatz
Ignatz: Professor, it's been too long! I do want to chat, but first let's handle these criminals.

%Byleth,Leonie
Leonie: You've been alive all this time?! Where have you been hiding?! Never mind - talk later!

%Byleth,Lorenz
Lorenz: We have much to discuss. But first, let us dispense with the riffraff. It is a noble's duty, after all!

%Byleth,Lysithea
Lysithea: Ugh. The instant we arrive, we're neck deep in battle. We should've arrived late.

%Byleth,Marianne
Marianne: P-Professor? Is it really you?

%Byleth,Raphael
Raphael: Is that really you, Professor? It's been so long! I thought I'd never see you again!

@End 
Hilda: Ugh, I'm exhausted! What gives, Professor?
Lysithea: I was so excited to see everyone again, and then this happens…
Leonie: I'm still tired from the long journey. How did it come to this?
Ignatz: Let's all take a moment to catch our breath…
Hilda: If you've got the time to play with those guys, the least you could do is prepare some tea.
Byleth: Thanks for your help.
Claude: We were hoping someone would come to back us up when we started routing the bandits.
Byleth: Blame Claude.
Claude: Come on, those guys were thieves! We couldn't just let them get away.
Claude: It seems they've been taking advantage of the church's absence and doing whatever they please here.
Marianne: In any case, um… I'm glad that all of you are well.
Ignatz: That's the spirit, Marianne!
Raphael: That was fun! In fact, I wouldn't mind romping around some more!
Lorenz: So, you were alive this whole time, Professor. I am not surprised. In fact, that is why I came here.
Leonie: And it doesn't look like time has rusted your skills. That's a relief!
Claude: I'm just glad everyone's alive and well. On that note, let's move this reunion party somewhere else.



Claude: Now that we've dealt with those violent bandits, we could potentially use this place as our base of operations again.
Hilda: What could you possibly mean by that?
Claude: I'm talking about the Leicester Alliance taking over Garreg Mach Monastery. After all, it's right in the middle of Fódlan. It's a critical strategic location.
Lysithea: Are you suggesting that we fight back against the Empire?
Lorenz: Aren't you getting a bit ahead of yourself? The Alliance is in complete discord at present.
Claude: And as leader of the Imperial faction of the Alliance, isn't Count Gloucester, your father, the main cause of that discord?
Lorenz: I… Yes, that is true. It was inevitable. Our house's territory is close to Imperial land, after all. Had we not consented to vassalage under the Empire, they would have invaded immediately.
Claude: Naturally. And to be clear, I have no problem with your house maintaining its Imperial ties until we're sufficiently prepared to revolt. The Empire is the cause of the infighting. If we rid ourselves of them, the situation should resolve itself. That's why I'm thinking we should make this our base, raise up an army, and stir up some trouble for the Empire.
Raphael: Now you're talking! Sounds like fun!
Hilda: So then, Mr. Leader Man. Does this mean you intend to rope us into your little scheme?
Byleth: Leader Man?
Claude: Hm? Ah. My grandfather passed away. That means yours truly is officially the leader of the Alliance.
Lorenz: If we had a more reliable leader, perhaps the Alliance would not have been divided…
Claude: Think what you will. All I need to know is if you're in or you're out.
Leonie: I'm happy to lend a hand. I won't let those Imperial dogs set foot in Alliance territory! I couldn't bear it if my village got caught up in the chaos of war.
Raphael: I'll fight too! I've gotta protect my little sis!
Lysithea: I will join as well. After all, House Ordelia was once dragged into an Imperial revolt. It ruined us.
Lorenz: Ah, of course. I understand your motivation.
Ignatz: I'll fight too… It's time to take responsibility for my own future!
Marianne: I… I don't want to run anymore. I hope I'll be of use to everyone…
Ignatz: We can do anything if we work together, Marianne!
Hilda: What about you, Lorenz? Are you going to go back home to your scary father or what?
Lorenz: We cannot rely on Claude's scheming to lead us to victory. Therefore, I will remain. It is my duty to ensure Claude does not worsen the situation in the Alliance.
Claude: All of us are fighting for a different reason, but we share a common enemy. If we don't act, the Empire will crush us eventually. I say we stop them before they have the chance! So, Teach… Will you help as well?
Byleth: I'd rather search for Rhea than fight.
Claude: All the more reason to join us. Admit it. You're not going to be able to do much on your own.
Byleth: I'll give it some thought.
Claude: Please do. I'm counting on you. Even if your ultimate goal is to find Rhea, it would be better to stick with us as you search.
Claude: With you on our side, the church will join us as well. That makes fighting the Empire a moral cause, which means it will be easier to rally support. Above all, your knowledge and strength are indispensable if we hope to stand a chance against the Imperial army. Without you, my schemes are nothing. Just words. Please… Take all of that into consideration as you decide.
Hilda: You're really laying it all on the table, aren't you, Claude? Well, all that aside, this place is a mess. We can't very well make our base in a ruin! And repairing it sounds like a lot of work… I wonder if anyone would be willing to help us out with that?

Seteth: Can it be?! You were alive all this time?!
Flayn: Professor! It is so good to see you again. My brother and I were worried about you.
Alois: Ah, thank the goddess… I couldn't bear the thought of letting Jeralt down by not finding you.
Shamir: Guess you lucked out.
Catherine: We've been looking everywhere for you! But…I see Lady Rhea isn't with you. Damn.
Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor.
Claude: Cyril? Is that you? You've grown up, kid. Have you been looking for Rhea with the knights?
Cyril: Of course. Without Lady Rhea, I don't belong anywhere.
Claude: Cyril, that's not… Never mind. We'll figure it all out.
Manuela: Oh my, the Golden Deer House is together again at last. And all grown up! Well, for the most part.
Hanneman: I do regret that we were never able to hold a proper graduation for all of you students.
Byleth: Why are you here?
Byleth: How is the search for Rhea progressing?
Seteth: It has been five years since Lady Rhea disappeared. We have devoted all of our energies to finding her. However, without being able to set foot in Empire territory, we are at a standstill. We had hoped that perhaps the archbishop would return here on this day…that of the long-awaited millennium festival.
Claude: Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case. Though, I don't suppose you had very high hopes in that regard. Even if she were able to return here, with the monastery in ruins, I don't think she would have felt safe enough to do so. Right, Hilda?
Hilda: Yeah. This is an important location for the church. To think you've left it in such a state!
Byleth: The believers are mourning this destruction.
Byleth: It's a danger to the locals too.
Alois: That's true… Perhaps we've left it alone for too long. We've got to make things right!
Cyril: I can clean this place up like new! It's not fit for Lady Rhea like this.
Catherine: And leaving this place in ruins affects the safety of this area too.
Hanneman: Agreed. There is also a great deal of valuable literature here.
Ignatz: Then let's do it! If we all work together, we can restore the monastery to its original beauty!
Seteth: We will require the aid of skilled craftsmen too. I shall seek out any such individuals who are willing to return to Garreg Mach.
Hilda: Fantastic! I'll figure out how to split up the work and then we can get started!@Opening 
On the streets of the Imperial capital, Alliance forces crush Edelgard's army and take up the perimeter of the Imperial palace. The time has come to face Emperor Edelgard and to free Rhea from her clutches.

@Intro 
Claude: Is everyone ready? The objective of this battle is to defeat Edelgard and rescue Rhea. According to the information Dedue gave us, the throne room is directly north of the castle's main entrance. It's safe to assume that's where Edelgard is.
Byleth: I don't want to kill Edelgard.
Byleth: Is there no way to walk the same path as Edelgard?
Claude: She's a fellow student to all of us. If there's a path that we can walk together, that would be preferable. But that all depends on Edelgard. If she won't yield, then that's that. If showing pity would put my allies in danger, I will not hesitate to kill her. I ask that you and everyone here prepare yourselves to do the same.
Lysithea: Understood. I think I speak for everyone when I say that we are prepared.
Lorenz: The future of the Alliance – no, of Fódlan – is at stake. I have been prepared for this my whole life.
Leonie: Captain Jeralt taught me that indecisiveness is a weakness. One must cast aside their doubts before fighting.
Flayn: The lives of Lady Rhea and everyone here are more important than all else. I shall be prepared.
Raphael: You know what? I wouldn't be surprised if she took one look at my overstuffed muscles and surrendered in tears, then and there!
Ignatz: I really hope that Edelgard will yield...
Hilda: Edelgard is a stubborn one. I don't think she's likely to surrender.
Marianne: Goddess... Please protect us...
Cyril: I...I'll fight with all I got to save Lady Rhea!
Seteth: Rescuing Lady Rhea is my dearest wish. We must prevail, no matter what it takes.
Alois: In the name of the Knights of Seiros, we'll bring the hammer down on the Imperial army!
Judith: Satisfied yet, boy? Everyone made up their minds a long time ago.
Claude: OK. Let's get started. We're yours to command, my friend.
Byleth: Leave it to me.
Claude: Everyone, take your positions! The battle is upon us!

@Battle 
Edelgard: They've made it into the palace, but it's actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them. Defeating them all will turn the tide of war instantly. Taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option. Everyone! Prepare for a bitter struggle! Victory to the Adrestian Empire!
Claude: There are more enemies inside the palace than I thought. It's gonna take a lot to bring this situation under control. But, if we defeat Edelgard, then victory is ours! Everyone, let's go!

Claude: Our bashful little emperor has locked herself up behind the door of the throne room. The key should be around here somewhere. We need to find whoever's got it and take them out.

Petra: We must be protecting the throne room! You will not be getting past!
Dorothea: Stay back! I'll protect Edie with my life!
Claude: We'll have to take out one of them if we're going to advance... Petra seems like the shortest route...

Claude: I wonder how Dedue is doing... I hope I get to see him again.


Dedue: So close... Must press on...


Imperial Soldier: Infiltrators! Kill them!

Edelgard: I must confess I never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far. I don't mean to belittle your skills, Professor, but you've far surpassed my expectations. Inform the troops! Destroy anyone who sets foot in the throne room!

Claude: We should be able to get through to the throne room now...

Claude: This should give us a bit more freedom of movement. Now, how best to attack...

Claude: We did it! The enemy won't be able to send any more reinforcements now.
Edelgard: Clever tactic. It's going to be difficult to turn the tables now.

Dedue: I cannot vanquish her alone. So I will join you in this battle. But if I fall, leave me. My only wish is for Edelgard's head.

@Boss 
Edelgard: So you're another of the goddess's vanguard. You don't have a shred of self-awareness, do you? Come at me, so that I may put you out of your misery!

Edelgard: Professor... I suppose you think you can defeat me. Is that right? But I will never give up. Even if my arms and legs failed me, I would still find a way to move forward. I will smash that false goddess and her minion into the ground! I will fight to free this world from her vile grasp!

Edelgard: This has nothing do to with where you were born. That we are fighting now is only a result of the choices you've made. So I'm going to give that the response it deserves. I will crush you with everything I have!

Claude: Edelgard, give up! We don't want to kill you!
Edelgard: But... I must kill you. If I don't, the righteous world I dream of will never see the light. Come at me with everything you have. For one of us, this is the end!

%Claude,Edelgard
Edelgard: Your ideals, I understand they're not so far removed from my own. But without sufficient knowledge of this land's suffering, I can't entrust Fódlan to you!
Claude: Perhaps. I daresay it's true that I don't fully understand the history of Fódlan. Still, I've seen many things in my life. Don't worry. I'll finish the job for you.

%Flayn,Edelgard
Flayn: Edelgard! Please! Release Rhea... Release Fódlan!
Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people!

%Lysithea,Edelgard
Edelgard: Lysithea. You and I are so alike. We could have walked the same path.
Lysithea: We're alike? You don't mean to tell me... It can't be!
Edelgard: Yet now, we are at a crossroads. There's no turning back. Must we fight each other for the things we believe in?
Lysithea: That's exactly what's going to happen. And I will defeat you, Edelgard.

%Seteth,Edelgard
Seteth: Edelgard! Return Rhea! Release your grip on Fódlan!
Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people!

@Cutscene 
Edelgard: It looks as though... my path... will end here.

Edelgard: My teacher... claim your victory.

Edelgard: Strike me down. You must!

Edelgard: Even now... across this land, people are killing each other. If you do not act now, this conflict... will go on forever.

Edelgard: Your path... lies across my grave. It is time for you to find the courage to walk it.

Edelgard: If I must fall... let it be by your hand.

Edelgard: I wanted... to walk with you...

@End 
Claude: It's over. We were only able to beat her because of you.
Byleth:  ...
Claude: This wasn't the conclusion I had hoped for. Even though... I... Never mind. It's over now. The important thing is that we won.


Judith: Here, boy. A letter. An Imperial general asked me to give it to you.
Claude: A letter? Let's see it.

Claude: It looks like it's from... Hubert. Edelgard's vassal.
Hubert: If you are reading this letter, that means I have perished. As Her Majesty would never surrender to another, I can only assume she has fallen as well. It greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass... That said, as the survivors, I must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead. You must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark. I am sure you must recall Monica and Tomas. Their allies yet live. They hold deep resentment against the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and they are biding their time until they can exact revenge. If left to their own devices, it is certain they will eventually bring unimaginable calamity and suffering to the world. I detected their sorcery when you took Fort Merceus. I have deduced the location of their stronghold, Shambhala. You will find its whereabouts enclosed. There is no question that they are the enemies of everyone in Fódlan. Do not allow yourselves to forget that. Lastly... While I cannot say she is in good health, the archbishop resides in a secret chamber in the Imperial palace. I have shared the location of the entrance to that secret chamber with the person to whom I have entrusted this letter. I believe that Her Majesty will be victorious... Even still, I must plan for her defeat as well. If you wish to lead this world, I challenge you to rise to the occasion and surpass my estimation of you. Such is your obligation as the victors... and the only fitting tribute to all that Lady Edelgard sacrificed.
Claude: Hubert... To leave a letter like this behind... You were a better man than I believed you to be. So, Rhea is alive. And the fight isn't over yet. Those who slither in the dark... It sounds like Fódlan will never know peace unless we defeat them.

Claude: The allies of Monica and Tomas... Well, we knew about them already. I think it's safe to assume this is the same group who used Lysithea for their blood experiments. And they were also responsible for the javelins of light that destroyed the fortress. But who are these children of the goddess, who they supposedly resent? There's just not enough information here. I don't suppose there's any chance of his idea of a prank... If so, wow. Good one. Hubert... Rather than writing a letter, you should have just told us before we fought...
Byleth: Let's ask Rhea about it.
Claude: Right. We still don't know for sure if this letter is telling the truth. Let's go find out.

Rhea: You... You have come to save me... Is this... Is this a dream? I have longed to see you again... all this time... Is it truly you?

Rhea: Claude... I can see you have grown into a reliable young man... Thank you for supporting the professor, and for rescuing me. Surely the protection of the goddess has-
Claude: Wait, Rhea. What do you know about the children of the goddess?
Rhea: Children of... What is this about?
Claude: Forgive my bluntness. Someone from the Empire filled us in on a few things. I know it must be painful for us to ask you difficult questions after such an arduous confinement. But we have no choice. We must defeat a secret enemy... Those who slither in the dark. Do you know about them?
Rhea: Those who slither in the dark...
Claude: Apparently, they resent the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and are planning something big. Something terrible.
Rhea: ...
Claude: They use blood for their wicked magic and are capable of dropping javelins of light from the sky, which are powerful enough to crush a fortress. If you can think of anything at all, please tell us now. We need to know as much as possible about these enemies in order to stop them.
Rhea: ...
Claude: This is the critical moment that will determine whether or not Fódlan falls! Can't you see that the time for secrets has passed?!
Rhea: It is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of Fódlan since ancient times. I am sure you have heard the stories of a man named Nemesis...
Byleth: The King of Liberation...
Byleth: The wielder of the Sword of the Creator...
Claude: Nemesis, the King of Liberation. He's the hero to whom the goddess gave the Sword of the Creator.
Rhea: Nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits. He plundered the Holy Tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god. When Nemesis appeared in Zanado some time later, he already wielded the Sword of the Creator.
Byleth: In Zanado?
Claude: Zanado, the Red Canyon...
Byleth: How did he get the Sword of the Creator?
Claude: According to legend, the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods.
Rhea: I do not know how Nemesis obtained the sword, or why he appeared in Zanado. But he used that sword to massacre the people there. The children of the progenitor god. From their corpses he gained even more power, and brought war to Fódlan...
Claude: That's completely different from what the legends tell us about Nemesis.
Rhea: A mere bandit like Nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own...
Claude: Aha! So Nemesis had accomplices. And those accomplices must have been those who slither in the dark. They used Nemesis! And this time they used the Imperial army to once again bring war to Fódlan! I finally get it... And I even understand why Edelgard was associating with them. Just as they were trying to use the Empire, the Empire was trying to use them. Rhea, there's still a mountain of things I need to ask you. And I will. But I'll leave all of that for another day. You must be weak after living in confinement for so long. Please rest for a while. My friend... Let's prepare for battle. We need to strike Shambhala as soon as possible.
Rhea: You must not allow Fódlan's bloody history... the Red Canyon Tragedy... to repeat itself...

@Dialogue 
Claude: Hm. It occurred to me that we never got an answer from Rhea about the children of the goddess.
Byleth: Aren't they the people of Zanado?
Claude: She did say that the people of the Red Canyon were the children of the progenitor god, so I suppose so. But those evil guys continue to plot their revenge even after the Red Canyon Tragedy. Does that mean some of the children of the goddess, or their descendants, are still alive?
Byleth: Rhea?
Claude: Could be. She was talking about what happened in Zanado as if she was there herself.
Byleth: Flayn?
Claude: If there's something special about her blood, we can't rule out the possibility.
Byleth: Me?
Claude: Huh. Maybe? Though I get the feeling you're something else altogether.
Claude: What are these children anyway? And how are they connected to the goddess? Bah! I almost disappeared into the bottomless swamp that is my mind. I thought that after we defeated the Empire, I'd be able to see that sight I long to see..
Byleth: What sight is that?
Claude: I've told you about my dreams before... I want to break down the wall separating Fódlan from the outside world. The sight I want to see lies beyond that. Honestly, it's a trivial thing to fixate on. Just people, gathered in their towns. Living our their lives together. Sometimes laughing. Sometimes fighting. But the people living there aren't just citizens of Fódlan. They are people from Dagda, Brigid, and even Duscur and Sreng. There could be people who were born in Almyra or countries even farther east there too.. All of those people living together, like it's nothing special at all. That's the sight I long to see. It's so simple, but still so far away... But this is no time for complaining. We need to focus on capturing Shambhala. Let's hurry up and gather everyone together.

Judith: So... you mean to tell me that Fódlan will fall to ruin if we leave those guys be?
Hilda: Um, if this map is reliable, their base is just south of my family's territory.
Lorenz: This story is a bit much to believe... And yet...
Leonie: It does ring true somehow.
Claude: Remember Monica, the one who killed Jeralt? And the old man who was masquerading as Tomas? They were their allies. And the Flame Emperor and the Death Knight were merely their pawns.
Flayn: The people who were after my blood?!
Lysithea: They were also the ones who used me to conduct their blood experiments...
Claude: As awful as it sounds, they're seemingly fond of using blood in their secret techniques.
Hilda: Eww! That's really gross! I could never be friends with someone like that.
Claude: I believe they were also responsible for the javelin of light that destroyed Fort Merceus.
Judith: Hold up, boy. Do you really think that we can win against such powerful foes?
Claude: I don't know. But we have to try, don't we?
Byleth: This is for Fódlan's future.
Hilda: We've really taken on something big. I wonder if our names will go down in history.
Lorenz: My heroic name? Passed down to future generations? Haha! A worthy cause indeed.
Byleth: It's our responsibility as the victors.
Hilda: Since Edelgard can't do it, I guess it falls to us.
Claude: They were trying to use the Imperial army to plunge Fódlan into war, but we nipped that in the bud. Now we just need to tear our their roots. And I know we have what it takes to do it.@Opening 
Claude leverages his victory at the Battle of Gronder to secure reinforcements from Alliance lords. Meanwhile, the Imperial army continues to tighten its defenses at Fort Merceus in anticipation of an attack on the Imperial capital.

@Dialogue 
Judith: Our objective is Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. But our greatest obstacle lies before that.
Ignatz: And what's what?
Judith: Fort Merceus. If we can't pass through, we won't be able to reach Enbarr.
Leonie: Fort Merceus... the Impregnable Fortress, or so it's called.
Ignatz: If I recall correctly, it's sometimes referred to as the Stubborn Old General.
Lysithea: It is a massive fortress that was constructed to protect the Imperial capital.
Shamir: The Imperial army we defeated has withdrawn to Enbarr. Fort Merceus should be short on soldiers for now.
Byleth: We should attack quickly.
Judith: Yes, it would be good to finish up here before more enemy reinforcements arrive.
Byleth: We should be careful.
Judith: It would be best to take it before enemy reinforcements arrive. Still, there's a reason it's been called impregnable.
Judith: The only real question is what our fearless leader intends to do...

Claude: Sorry for the delay, everyone. Those mewling lords kept me from leaving for quite some time.
Judith: So? Were you able to secure additional reinforcements?
Claude: It's gonna have to wait until next month. It doesn't look like they can afford to keep supporting us at present.
Judith: Then what should we do about Fort Merceus? Do you plan on waiting around?
Claude: No. If we wait until next month, the enemy will have bolstered their defenses. That said, the prevailing theory is that you need triple your enemies' forces to take a fortress with a frontal assault.
Leonie: Right, that's what we were taught at the academy. And this is Fort Merceus we're talking about. It's renowned for its strong defenses.
Claude: Our current army isn't nearly strong enough. Hmm... What to do...
Judith: Whatever you do, just don't ask us to scale those huge walls. We'd end up dead when they hurl rocks down at us.
Hilda: Yeah, no thanks! If only someone would open up the gates for us from the inside.
Claude: Unfortunately we don't have any spies in there. Wait a minute... I've got it! We sneak in, stir up confusion, and open the gates ourselves to let our allies in.
Hilda: Right! That's what I was saying all along!
Ignatz: Right. Nice one, Hilda. But how do you propose we go about sneaking in?
Hilda: Disguises? If we dress up like Imperial soldiers, maybe they'll think we're allies and let us in!
Leonie: Do you really think they'd just open the gates for us? I'd be pretty dumbfounded if that worked.
Claude: No, no - she's on to something. It's a good idea, Hilda. We just need to refine it a bit, and we'll be in there before we know it.
Hilda: Really? Go me!
Lorenz: What is your definition of refining the idea? I know your go-to strategy is nausea-inducing poison, but...
Raphael: Urgh! I maybe ate too much. My stomach hurts...
Lorenz: Raphael... Why are you eating meat during a war council?!
Judith: So, fearless leader, I'm guessing you're going to keep the crucial parts of your scheme under wraps until the time comes, aren't you?
Claude: You know me so well, Judith. Whether we like it or not, this war puts a damper on all of our spirits. What's wrong with trying to have a little fun every now and again? Just leave the details to me.

@Conversation 
Claude: Each time we take a step forward, more blood is spilled… but by spilling that blood, we're able to take yet another step forward. War is always a cruel affair, but luckily we have each other to lean on. We've steeled our hearts. We won't be broken.
Byleth: I'm glad we have such reliable allies. 
Claude: I couldn't agree more. Without them, we could never have made it this far.
Byleth: I wonder if we're pushing them too hard.
Claude: If anyone's starting to feel the strain, I'm sure just hearing from you will reassure them. Please… do whatever you can to keep their morale up.
Claude: Oh, and about taking the fort… I'll need a tad more time to prepare our plan. It's called an impregnable fortress for a reason, after all. My contingencies need contingencies this time, or we might not pull it off.



Lorenz: Fort Merceus is old and strong. Its reputation for durability is equal to that of Arianrhod. Are we really going to leave this to Claude? With a plan concocted by Hilda, of all people?
Byleth: I'm uneasy too. 
Lorenz: I thought you might be, with how secretly that man devises his schemes.
Byleth: Have a little faith.
Lorenz: I would like to, but I am always troubled by how secretly that man devises his schemes.
Lorenz: Let us hope the end result is not too outlandish.



Raphael: You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If your muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired.
Byleth: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, how? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious...
Byleth: You can tell how your muscles are feeling? 
Raphael: Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!
Raphael: What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!



Ignatz: The battle at Gronder Field was gruesome, wasn't it? But perhaps it's irresponsible to look away - to close our eyes to the horrors of war.
Byleth: I agree.
Ignatz: As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.
Byleth: You don't have to force yourself. 
Ignatz: Thank you. But I think I do actually. As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.
Ignatz: May an age of peace rise from the ashes, so that all this sacrifice means something.



Lysithea: As I suspected, they seem to be supporting the Imperial army now. Thought I don't quite know who they are yet… Nor do I know what tricks they'll use against us next. We can't afford to let our guard down…



Marianne: I never used to care whether I lived or died… But after seeing so much death firsthand, I now realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little…



Hilda: I wonder how far we can get with this plan. Dressing up like Imperial soldiers to sneak in. Claude said it could use some refinement. Any ideas?
Byleth: We could dress you as the emperor. 
Hilda: Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!
Byleth: We could dress Claude as a woman.
Hilda: Claude, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be.
Hilda: On second thought, let's just stick to the plan as originally conceived. That seems safer.



Leonie: Claude takes care of the strategy, you direct the troops, and the rest of us focus on the fighting. As long as the system keeps working, we can win any battle, no matter the odds. That's what everyone's saying anyway. Hope you can keep up with our expectations, Professor.



Ferdinand: Dimitri, the late Prince of Faerghus. He despised the Empire with all his heart. He should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive.
Byleth: Leaders are people too.
Byleth: Leaders can't be emotional? 
Ferdinand: No. If a leader's emotions overcome them, others must step in to prevent poor decision-making. Why did his followers not intervene? His attendants? I used to call Edelgard my leader, and now she is running amok. I am duty-bound to stop her.



Linhardt: There's word that Claude has developed a rather interesting stratagem to capture the fortress. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? But there must be one or two gaps in its defenses...



Caspar: Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when a fortress was just a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days.


Bernadetta: It's always relaxing coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And assaulting that huge keep? That sounds hard. Oh, really hard! Don't you think it'll be hard?!
Byleth: It's going to be tough. 
Bernadetta: I knew you'd think so! I knew you-- Ow! Oh, ow. Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door.
Byleth: We'll be fine.
Bernadetta: Of course you'd say that. Why did I even bother asking?



Dorothea: So many people died in the battle at Gronder... And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think of war as theater, with the stage an entire continent.
Byleth: Though the actors die, the show goes on? 
Dorothea: Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must unaffected.
Byleth: It really doesn't seem like theater.
Dorothea: Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened.
Dorothea: Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play.



Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.
Byleth: Why's that?
Byleth: Because it's like hunting? 
Petra: Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey.
Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.



Felix: My relationship with the boar prince began even before I was born. He was always by my side. You might even say that, at one time, we were best friends.
Byleth: What do you mean, best friends?
Byleth: What happened?
Felix: I couldn't fathom the depth of his hatred for the Empire. So much anguish. Could I have saved him? Could I have stopped him?



Ashe: I've heard Dedue's passed on. Just like His Highness.
Byleth: We can't know that for certain.
Ashe: That's true. I did hear that his body was never found.
Byleth: Don't believe everything you hear. 
Ashe: You're right. I don't think anyone's found his body, so I guess he might still be out there.
Byleth: Dedue is dead?
Ashe: That's what I've heard, but no one's found his body.
Ashe: If, somehow, he's still alive...I hope we'll meet again.



Sylvain: Ya know, Professor, laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date. First, you get past her defenses...then you make your move.
Byleth: That's not the best analogy.
Sylvain: Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean. I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps...
Byleth: You might be right. 
Sylvain: Ha! I knew you'd get it, Professor.
Sylvain: Anyway, you know more about tactics than me, so I don't know why I'm offering you advice.



Mercedes: Oh, Goddess, hear my prayer. Please bless the deceased with peace everlasting...And may his soul rest in tranquility. You know, I used to see him praying quite often when I would come to the cathedral at night. I wonder who it was he prayed for back then...



Annette: After the battle at Gronder, some people claim they saw my father. They said he walked off the battlefield clutching… His Highness's dead body… So long as Father's alive, I don't need anything else. I just… I hope to see him again one day…



Ingrid: Among our prisoners of war, there were quite a few people who served His Highness. One of them stated that the Empire was involved with the Tragedy of Duscur. If this is true, His Highness's motives seem clear. I can't help but feel that perhaps I should have fought by his side…
Byleth: Why is that?
Ingrid: Because…I, too, lost someone to that tragedy—the most important person in my world.
Byleth: Are you having regrets? 
Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong.
Ingrid: Those of us still on this plane of existence will carry the torch. The inhumane actions of the Empire must not be repeated.



Seteth: Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. Whatever strategy you have in mind, I have faith that it will lead to victory.



Flayn: Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle… How inhuman war is - how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.



Hanneman: Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?
Byleth: The Silver Maiden.
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Byleth: Fódlan's Locket.
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat.
Byleth: The Stubborn Old General. 
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that.
Hanneman: Seems Fódlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose...



Manuela: Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all! And if I'm honest... sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived.



Alois: Hilda's quite a tactician! Disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in, undetected. A stroke of brilliance. With this strategy, we can really snatch victory from the jaws of...deceit!
Byleth: That's a good point.
Alois: Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? Deceit? Again?
Byleth: That's a bad pun. 
Alois: Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!



Catherine: I hardly recognize everyone... Their faces have changed so much. More experience in the eyes, and more pain. I'm glad that they're stronger, but I hate to think that they've all become hardened killers. Look after them, OK? Try to keep 'em on the straight-and-narrow.



Shamir: Please tell Claude not to give us any more ridiculous orders. I've reached out through all of my channels, but there are limits to these things. I'll have to recruit an entire town's worth of people if I ever plan on making enough Imperial uniforms.



Cyril: Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see.
Byleth: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful, at least.
Byleth: You could find our targets quicker than anyone. 
Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too.
Cyril: Thanks, Professor. I think I get it now. I'm gonna put my eyes to real good use.



Judith: Ah, Professor. I have a question for you… Have you heard of the Death Knight? I'm referring to that Imperial general who has been operating under that moniker.
Byleth: I've heard of him.
Judith: Nothing is certain yet, but I get the feeling we'll have to face him soon enough.
Byleth: I haven't heard of him.
Judith: Well now… I don't know very much myself. Only that he's caused a great deal of havoc in the west. Nothing is certain yet, but I get the feeling we'll have to face him soon enough.



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone...

@Intro 
Ignatz: I delivered our letter to Fort Merceus. I don't think they suspected anything.
Claude: I knew I was right to entrust that task to you. You've got that honest kind of face that makes it easy to fool people.
Ignatz: Is that meant to be a compliment?
Lysithea: What did you write in the letter?
Claude: I informed them that reinforcements were on the way. It would have been suspicious for troops to show up unannounced.
Hilda: So, the plan is...
Claude: We'll disguise ourselves as reinforcements from the Imperial capital and sneak in to Fort Merceus.
Hilda: Oh! You used my disguise plan after all!
Claude: We've also procured Imperial army uniforms.
Hilda: Ooh, good work. I knew this was the only way!
Claude: However... That alone wouldn't be enough.
Hilda: You did say the plan needed a little more refinement. Are you going to dress up like Edelgard, Claude?
Claude: I'm not sure that would accomplish much. In the letter, I included the name of the Imperial general leading the reinforcements. While we're heading to the fort, a separate army is going to attack us.
Marianne: We're going to be attacked?!
Claude: That's all just for show, though. It'll be our allies who are attacking us.
Hilda: Oh, I get it! We're going to make it look like the Alliance is attacking Imperial reinforcements!
Claude: Right. When the troops in the fortress panic and open up the gates... We're in.
Judith: I'd love nothing more than for this plan to work, but I've got some bad news for you. Apparently the notorious Death Knight has been placed in charge of defending Fort Merceus.

Marianne: The one who kidnapped Flayn...

Flayn: The Death Knight... I did not wish to ever think of him again.
Judith: He got some acclaim in the battle to subjugate western Faerghus. They say he holds the most military prowess in the Empire.
Claude: Even so, we've got Teach here to command us. All will be well. You have to trust us.
Judith: So your big plan is to just trust your professor? Really, boy?
Leonie: Under the professor's guidance, I'm sure we'll manage somehow. We're counting on the tactics you learned from Captain Jeralt!
Claude: Prepare yourselves, everyone. It's time.

Claude: Teach... This is for your ears only, but there's actually one more part to my plan. I had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but I have no choice.
Byleth: No choice?
Claude: Absolutely. We can't afford to hold anything back. Thanks to Edelgard's strength, the Imperial army is more unified than I would have expected. It was a painful realization, but after our battle at Gronder Field, it's clear that we can't win if we don't pull out all the stops. I also realized something else during that battle. There really is something special about you, Teach. The reason we were all able to keep our cool in the midst of the chaos was because we all trust in you. In your command and in your strength. Everyone here believes that we will win as long as we have you on our side. Our faith in you is borderline religious. You and I... We have what it takes to free Fódlan from the Empire's rule. I know in my heart that we'll make it through to witness the world after all the fighting has ceased.



Death Knight: That man/woman approaches...
Caspar: Who are you talking about? You don't mean that professor, do you?! Doesn't matter. No one could take this fortress.
Linhardt: Ugh, sounds like a bother... I'll be taking a nap about now.

Death Knight: Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours...

@Opening 
While waiting for reinforcements, the Alliance predicts the Empire will continue to fortify its defenses at Fort Merceus. Knowing this risk, Claude an a select few advance, hoping to gain entry to the fort through deception.

Fort Merceus, said to be impregnable, lies between you and Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Seizing the sturdy fortress will require a carefully devised strategy.

@Battle 
Imperial Soldier: General, reinforcements have arrived from the capital. They clashed with Alliance forces in the outskirts of the city, but should enter the fortress soon.
Death Knight: You let them in? Make haste and slaughter them all.
Imperial Soldier: Huh? Why?
Death Knight: They are enemies. Slaughter them all. I will not say it again.

Claude: We made it in. Professor, take control from the south. I have my own task to do from here. There are preparations to be made for our secret plan.

@Cutscene 
Nader: I see your skills haven't dulled yet, kiddo.
Claude: What did you expect?

Claude: Everyone, listen up! From now on, the Almyran forces will be fighting by our side!

Claude: We'll work as one! And we will bring down that fort together!

@Battle 
Claude: An impregnable fortress is a wide-open prairie once you get inside. From here, we'll attack from the north and south at once!
Nader: No different than a prairie, you say? Heh! You've got a strange head on your shoulders, kiddo
Claude: For Nader the Undefeated, this should be as easy as a walk in a meadow, right?
Nader: Heh. Well, goddess or death god or whoever they may be, let's crush them to dust.

Death Knight: The time of ruin draws near... But their slaughter must wait until next we meet...
Alliance Soldier: Report! The Death Knight has escaped the fortress!
Claude: He gave up too easily. Does he have some other plan? Let's deal with the remaining enemies and go after him, quickly!

Death Knight: The time is ripe.

Alliance Soldier: Report! The Death Knight is moving! It looks like they're abandoning the fortress and making an escape!
Claude: We need to put an end to this here and now. Come on, let's circle around and cut off his retreat.

@Boss 
%Claude,Death Knight
Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up an Imperial general...
Death Knight: So, you wish to die.
Claude: Heh. As antisocial and unhinged as ever, I see.

@End 
Nader: Hey, kiddo! What was with that... javelin of... light?
Claude: Javelin of light... That describes it pretty well. The fortress was supposedly impregnable, but look at it now.It's hard to imagine that the Empire would do something like that. But if not them, then who? And for what purpose? If they wanted to kill us, then why wait until now to use it?
Judith: We almost died just now... and without an answer to any of that. Speaking of unanswered questions, why is Nardel here? Care to explain? I get the feeling there's something you two are keeping from us.
Nader: I'll go ahead and see my subordinates off to Almyra, kiddo.
Claude: Wait, Nader! Are really going to just leave me here and run away?
Nader: I hope to see you again, Judith. And you too, Professor. I'll be praying for your safety!

Judith: Nader? Are you saying that Nardel is actually Nader the Unstoppable?!
Byleth: Unstoppable?
Claude: It's actually Nader the Undefeated. Almyrans love grand titles.
Judith: I knew he was no ordinary person, but to think he was the great hero of Almyra...
Hilda: Hey, um, can we really afford to be chatting right now? If another one of those javelins of light falls, we're all dead!
Lorenz: Claude. There are things I wish to ask you, but first we must hurry and withdraw.
Claude: Right you are. Come on, everyone! Let's hurry up and get out of here.

Lorenz: Claude. It is time for you to explain. Why are you so close with an Almyran general?
Claude: Well, he did quite a bit for me when I was younger.
Lorenz: When you were younger... So, before you joined House Riegan. How and where did you meet him? There aren't many opportunities to meet a general from Almyra in Fódlan...
Claude: If that's what you believe, it's only because that's what you've been led to believe. After all, we have Cyril here among our allies, and he was born in Almyra.
Cyril: Hey, now. Don't drag me into this.
Claude: There's a big, wide world outside of Fódlan, and it's overflowing with different places and cultures. You think interacting with outsiders is odd, but isn't avoiding contact with the outside world far more unnatural?
Lorenz: Don't change the subject, Claude. To the people of the Alliance, the Almyrans are-
Claude: It's true that there's a history of hostility, but why should that mean we're doomed to remain hostile forever? The Almyrans aren't monsters. Just look at Cyril! Does he look like a monster to you?
Cyril: Hey, what's that supposed to mean?
Claude: Right, Teach? What did you think when you met Nader?
Byleth: He's... interesting.
Byleth: He's a reliable general.
Claude: Ha! I'll tell him you said that. And I'm sure that if all of you got to know him, all of your preconceived notions would change too. I know you guys, and you aren't the type of people to reject someone without trying to get to know them.
Hilda: But... how did those Almyrans even get past Fódlan's Throat? I doubt my brother would just let them pass without saying anything...
Claude: About that... I actually made sure your brother met Nader in advance.
Lorenz: What?! Lord Holst met with an Almyran general?
Hilda: Oh, so that's why you were so interested in my brother. But wait, they're supposed to be bitter enemies! They've fought each other several times before!
Claude: I know. It was a big gamble. But rather than having me try to convince them myself, I knew it would be easier to just have them meet. They were taken aback at first, but sure enough, they hit it off. They were even drinking to their newfound brotherhood before parting.
Judith: It makes sense. If you take the greatest heroes away from the battlefield, of course they'll get along.
Hilda: Fighting one minute and drinking together the next... Men are so weird!
Claude: Ultimately, someone's bloodline has nothing to do with the friendships they forge. Relations between the Alliance and Almyra is a matter we'll tackle in the future. Still, I want to take this opportunity to make one thing clear to all of you. After we defeat the Empire, I intend to tear down the walls that separate Fódlan from the outside world. I want to let people and goods come and go freely, and in doing so, eradicate prejudices about the outside world.
Cyril: Huh?!
Lorenz: Would it even be possible to achieve such a thing? It directly contradicts the Seiros tenets.
Claude: Does it? I'm not so sure. I'm any case, I'm prepared for the inevitable protests and criticism. New ways of doing things are always met with resistance. During our time at the Officer's Academy, all of you overcame the barriers of birthplace, status, and ideology. Having gone through so much with all of you, I have no doubt that, in time, you'll understand.
Hilda: I guess there were a lot of different people there. People we wouldn't have met through the normal course of our lives.
Claude: Duscur once opposed the Kingdom, but there was someone from Duscur there. Brigid once invaded the Empire, but the Brigid princess was there. We ate at the same table as those people. Sure, sometimes we didn't get along. But other times, we helped each other out. Can we really draw a definitive line in the sand and say one group of people is all good, and another all bad? If I can realize my dream, Fódlan will be reborn. The old age will end and we'll welcome a new dawn.
Lorenz: But, if-
Judith: Save your objections for another day, Gloucester boy.
Lorenz: Ugh...
Judith: That said, there are more pressing matters to discuss. Our next step is to invade the Imperial capital, right?
Claude: That's right. I'm sure Edelgard is eagerly awaiting our arrival in Enbarr. Reinforcements from the Alliance lords should arrive soon. Let's make sure we're ready to greet them.@Opening 
With the destruction of Shambhala, the ambitions of those who slither in the dark are forever shattered. However, Rhea has suffered grievous injuries in the aftermath. Yet certain mysteries remain unsolved, so Claude and the others approach Rhea, who is now confined to her room due to her wounds.

@Dialogue 
Rhea: I am happy to see you two…
Claude: Sorry to interrupt your rest. But there are some things that we absolutely must ask you.
Rhea: It seems I do not have much time left. I do not intend to hide anything any longer.
Byleth: …
Claude: Rhea… I have to ask. You're the Immaculate One, aren't you? If what I'm thinking is correct, that's what the children of the goddess is referring to. In other words, you—
Rhea: I am the last child of the progenitor god. A long time ago, the progenitor god came from somewhere far away and descended upon this continent. She changed her form to resemble that of a human, and gave her own blood to birth her children. The progenitor god and her children shared knowledge and skills with the people of the land. Together, they built a prosperous civilization. But the humans turned their backs on the teachings of the progenitor god and engaged in senseless wars. Eventually people began to think of themselves as gods and challenged the progenitor god herself to battle. The land was scorched in the war that ensured and the majority of humans were annihilated. I believe that those who slither in the dark are the descendants of those who retreated beneath the ground during that time.
Claude: So they had been waiting all that time for their chance at revenge…
Rhea: It took the progenitor god an astonishing amount of time to revive the ravaged world. But eventually, the continent found peace again, and the progenitor god, having fulfilled her duty, fell into a long slumber in the Holy Tomb. The children who stayed behind built a settlement in Zanado to protect the Holy Tomb as they quietly lived out their lives. But then…Nemesis appeared, bringing tragedy along with him. Even now I cannot forget the sight…of that massive canyon, painted red with blood… I was never able to forgive those who proudly wielded weapons crafted from the corpses of my brethren. I was the only survivor of Zanado, and all I could do was wander across Fódlan clinging to my desperate desire for revenge. I called myself Seiros, fostered the founding of the Empire, and prepared to oppose Nemesis and his followers.
Claude: Unbelievable…
Rhea: I put Zanado behind me to gather the remaining children who were scattered across Fódlan… Finally, we killed Nemesis on the Tailtean Plains, and I took back the Sword of the Creator.
Claude: Let me get this straight… Saint Seiros…is you?! You're kidding me, right?

Knight of Seiros: Professor. Claude. There's something you need to hear right away…
Rhea: If you have something to report, do so at once. There is no need to let my presence worry you.
Knight of Seiros: As you wish… We're receiving a constant stream of express messengers from cities to the east. They claim that an unidentified military force is attacking and that there have already been a large number of casualties.
Claude: What?!
Knight of Seiros: The reports indicate that the cities and towns along the East Gronder Thoroughfare in the old Hrym territory have already been destroyed. Some villages were razed completely, leaving no survivors…
Claude: Damn it! Did they come from Shambhala? Could it be that there were some remnants of that wicked group hiding there?
Rhea: …

Knight of Seiros: I have a report! The unidentified military force has crossed the Great Bridge of Myrddin! Alliance forces met them in battle, but it seems they have already broken through!
Claude: They've already made it so far. Is Count Gloucester unharmed?
Hilda: The count is fine, but apparently my brother joined with reinforcements and was gravely injured…
Claude: You mean to tell me they easily got past a general as skilled as Holst?
Hilda: They say the enemy general has a weapon that resembles the Sword of the Creator. Even my brother was powerless to stop him…
Byleth: The Sword of the Creator?
Claude: That's not possible…
Knight of Seiros: The enemy forces are flying a banner bearing the Crest of Flames as they continue their march west along the Airmid River.
Rhea: …
Knight of Seiros: We believe they're marching toward Garreg Mach. We are preparing to meet them in battle.

Rhea: A weapon that resembles the Sword of the Creator… and banner bearing the Crest of Flames… There is only one explanation. The one leading the enemy force…is Nemesis himself.
Claude: Nemesis? That Nemesis? Do you really think the ancient King of Liberation has been brought back to life?
Rhea: Perhaps the seal was broken when Shambhala fell… An incredible power that we children cannot hope to match dwells within the blood of the progenitor god. Nemesis obtained that blood, so it would not surprise me if that were the case.
Claude: The blood of the progenitor god… That's right, he did take the remains from the Holy Tomb, didn't he…
Rhea: From the blood of the progenitor god, Sothis, he acquired the Crest of Flames. From her bones and heart, he crafted the Sword of the Creator.
Claude: The Sword of the Creator is made from her bones and heart?
Rhea: The heart of Sothis is the Crest Stone that was placed in the Sword of the Creator. The same is true of the Crests of the 10 Elites and the other Crest Stones… They were born of the blood and hearts of the progenitor god's children. Those who slither in the dark created them. Stole them. Sothis never gifted that power to the humans.
Claude: The Crests of the 10 Elites, the Crest Stones, and the Heroes' Relics… I can't believe those who slither in the dark made them all. And after that, Nemesis used the Sword of the Creator to massacre all of the progenitor god's children in Zanado… In other words, the citizens of Zanado were killed by weapons made from the remains of their brethren… How atrocious. But I don't get it… The Sword of the Creator that Teach wields doesn't have a Crest Stone. So how is Teach able to wield its full power?
Rhea: The Crest Stone of the progenitor god…dwells within your professor.
Claude: … 
Rhea: After I battled with Nemesis as Saint Seiros, I reclaimed the heart of Sothis. I wanted to use that heart to…resurrect her. Even though I had to do some…questionable things to achieve that goal, I wished to see Sothis…my mother…once more.
Byleth: You placed her heart in me?
Rhea: Yes. I believed that if I could resurrect my mother, I could regain all that had been lost…
Claude: So…that's the truth of it.
Rhea: I suspected that your body housed the consciousness of Sothis. Those suspicions were correct. And yet, she merely gave you her power and vanished… My dearest wish did not come true… But you did inherit the power of the progenitor god. Now, you must use that power to defeat Nemesis once and for all. Fódlan's blood-stained history…must end.

@Conversation 
Claude: Huh… What a magnificent tale! It's enough to make your head spin. Rhea's real identity is Saint Seiros, and the one who attacked us was Nemesis, the King of Liberation! On top of that, you've got the heart of the goddess in you! My flabber is completely gasted right now. But now isn't the time for standing around in disbelief. Nemesis has made it this far for a reason. If we aren't victorious, that's it for Fódlan's new dawn. The world will forever be shrouded in darkness… This is the final, FINAL battle. Finally. My friend… Please give it your all out there!



Lorenz: A sudden invasion from Nemesis has plunged the Alliance territories into complete disarray. Against such overwhelming strength, my father and his forces had no choice but to retreat.
Byleth: Wise decision. 
Byleth: I'm glad he's survived.
Lorenz: It was certainly prudent for him to avoid a fruitless death. But as things stand, he will not leave much of an impression on history. So that falls to me. I will do all that I can—for the future of Fódlan, and the glory of House Gloucester!



Raphael: Hey, Professor! Have you heard from Claude? He says he's gonna throw a feast if we win the next battle! Enough food to clean out the stores!
Byleth: That sounds great! 
Byleth: So what?
Raphael: So I'm super motivated to win! I'm gonna train every muscle I got! I'm coming for you, Nemesis! I'm coming for you, feast!



Ignatz: I got the gist of it from Claude. Those who slither in the dark… They seem to be descended from humans who were forced deep underground after the goddess defeated them.
Byleth: That's what I heard. 
Byleth: Is that right?
Ignatz: They were trying to wipe out the goddess and her followers in hopes of taking back the surface. That's why they called themselves saviors. To their mind, they were.



Lysithea: It seems there are some Shambhala loyalists in Nemesis's forces. As long as they're around, we can expect them to continue with their cruel experiments.
Byleth: We must win.
Byleth: Let's wipe them out, then. 
Lysithea: Yes. We have to. It's the only way to ensure nobody else will go through what I went through. We must obliterate them in the next battle. It's the only recompense for Edelgard's death.



Marianne: Just when we thought we'd made it to the end, another enemy approaches… Can we be sure this battle is the last one?
Byleth: I don't know.
Marianne: Of course, there's no way to really know what will happen.
Byleth: This is it, I think. 
Marianne: I think you're right.
Marianne: Just a little further to the end. Come on, Professor. We have to win!



Hilda: My big brother challenged Nemesis. He knew he couldn't win. He just did it so that his friends could escape. He emerged from the battle with a terrible injury. It's a miracle he didn't die.
Byleth: I'm glad he made it. 
Hilda: Yeah. Me too.
Byleth: That was so noble of him.
Hilda: Well, maybe he should have been a little less noble. When you're dead, you're dead.
Hilda: Dying to save someone else…seems to defeat the purpose. I wouldn't do it. He's alive, and in spite of myself, I'm really proud of him.



Leonie: So, we're defending Fódlan's future, huh? Kind of makes my mercenary ambitions feel pretty small. So I'll think about my promise to Captain Jeralt to protect you instead. That'll be my reason to fight.
Byleth: Thank you. 
Byleth: That works.
Leonie: If I can get you through this in one piece, that's just as good as defending Fódlan's future, isn't it? I just hope he's watching.



Ferdinand: The javelins of light that destroyed Fort Merceus… They are what destroyed Shambhala. They were trying to shroud the city in darkness. Perhaps they were planning to swallow us up in that same darkness. Maybe the javelins of light were a signal to Nemesis. To awaken him from his long slumber. What do you think, Professor?
Byleth: I think you're exactly right. 
Ferdinand: Yes, indeed. I have done some good pondering here.
Byleth: I think you're way off the mark.
Ferdinand: Oh! Really? Hm. Maybe I got a couple of things wrong, but I thought I was pretty close…
Ferdinand: If we keep up this momentum, we will be able to take down Nemesis and restore peace in Fódlan.



Linhardt: When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle.
Byleth: We're far from being safe ourselves. 
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our lives, Professor.
Byleth: It's a necessary sacrifice.
Linhardt: Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.
Byleth: It's better than dragging the war out.
Linhardt: I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good.



Caspar: Everyone in Fódlan's united, but the Whatstheirfaces in the Dark or whatever won't let up! Let's get rid of 'em right away!
Byleth: Let's do it. 
Caspar: We gotta get some training in so we can crush 'em!
Byleth: We can't let our guard down.
Caspar: I know that! Come on, let's go train so we can crush 'em!
Caspar: There's not a lot of time, but I'm afraid we won't win if we don't train!

Bernadetta: The King of Liberation? The Fell King? His name is Nemesis, right? And he was hidden away for over a thousand years. Wow, that's a really long time all to himself… But that doesn't make him worth admiring, no matter how much I envy him!
Byleth: You really envy him?
Byleth: You'd like to be shut away for a thousand years? 
Bernadetta: Um. Maybe. Is that a trick question?



Dorothea: I keep thinking the war is near its end, then it isn't... When can we finally put this dreadful war behind us?
Byleth: Let's end it with the next battle.
Dorothea: That would be wonderful. Imagine, the last moment of combat...then peace. It sounds like a fairy tale. I want to make this a world a place where there is no fighting, where children can grow up happy and safe.
Byleth: There can be no end to war. 
Dorothea: I suppose you're right... But we should still try our best to make the world a place where children can grow up happy and safe.



Petra: I can feel a weight in the air. It is different from before. I do not know this Nemesis person, except what I have been reading. But I am not of Fódlan. My knowledge of this person is very little. Even so, I feel that...I can understand it. I know that our enemy has great strength. I am...feeling great fear for this battle.
Byleth: Don't worry.
Petra: I have belief in you, Professor. Together, we will not be losing.
Byleth: I'm scared too. 
Petra: You have fear too? You do not look like you do... I have gratitude... I mean, I am grateful that you told me.



Felix: The Fell King Nemesis. Hmph. I imagine he'll be a worthy opponent. How many foes have tasted my blade? He will be an excellent finale. We will be victorious, Professor.
Byleth: Yes, we will!
Felix: Splendid. Let's do it.
Byleth: Calm down.
Felix: I'm perfectly calm, thank you.



Ashe: The King of Liberation wakes after a thousand-year slumber. Feels like I'm living a nightmare.
Byleth: I feel the same way. 
Ashe: You too? I hope you're not following my lead on this one, Professor!
Byleth: We must accept it.
Ashe: I know you're right, but it still doesn't feel real.
Ashe: Maybe this Nemesis who's attacking us isn't even the real thing. Either way, the damage and death he's causing are real enough. I will fight to protect those who need it.



Sylvain: Just when we think we're in the clear, the legendary Fell King resurrects. Who'd have thought it? Can you handle this getting any weirder? I don't know if I can.
Byleth: I can sympathize with you. 
Sylvain: I don't know how much of this Nemesis guy is a legend and how much is true, but I know this...
Byleth: No time for complaining.
Sylvain: I want to− I'm going to survive. I've spent this whole war afraid I'd die. Not anymore. I'm going to live.
Sylvain: I mean, I'll still fight like I want to die because that's worked so far, and why change at this late date, right?

Sylvain: And if I'm right and I don't die, would you go have dinner with me sometime?



Mercedes: We went through all that trouble to finish the war, and now we have to fight again? What does this Nemesis fellow have against Garreg Mach anyway?
Byleth: A vendetta... 
Mercedes: A vendetta against Garreg Mach? That doesn't make much sense at all.
Byleth: I have no idea...
Mercedes: Well, it doesn't make much sense to me either.
Mercedes: At any rate, I'll do what I can to defend the monastery and Lady Rhea.



Annette: Is Lady Rhea OK? She was quite weakened to start, and then she took all those heavy injuries… I don't want to imagine it, but what will happen if Lady Rhea passes away like this?
Byleth: We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.
Annette: I suppose you're right.
Byleth: I'm sure she'll be fine. 
Annette: Yes. I'm praying every day that she'll get as well as soon as possible.
Annette: Come what may, we should all combine our talents and defend the peace of Fódlan!



Ingrid: Shambhala is destroyed. But are they vanquished entirely, I wonder… Just as Kronya took Monica's form, perhaps there are some others living above ground.
Byleth: I don't know.
Byleth: Quite possibly. 
Ingrid: Once this battle is over, I still have much to see to. But right now, I should focus on the task at hand. On Nemesis. As long as Nemesis stands, both my future and the future of Fódlan hang in the balance.



Seteth: Before the monastery was completed, there was a massive battle on the Tailtean Plains. In that battle, the warrior Seiros defeated the Fell King Nemesis and reclaimed the bones and heart of Sothis. Those make up the divine sword that you wield, and the Crest that you bear. Now, Rhea…Seiros…lies helpless. The only one who can defeat this so-called King of Liberation is the inheritor of divine power. You have our full and unwavering support. Only you can do this. Please, save this world.



Flayn: Please keep quiet. Rhea is sleeping right now. She does not appear to be very well. I beg of you, please do everything you can to prevent an assault from Nemesis.



Hanneman: Shambhala… An underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess? Shame phenomena, driven by a source totally alien to the Crests that we understand. Most unsettling! Could it be magic? Some manner of technology? I would like to know the truth of it all. Very much so. I want to know their history, their knowledge. Why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy?
Byleth: Well, I don't know.
Hanneman: I intend to carry out multiple excavations around the city. There is so much to learn! Yet first we face battle with a king who has defied time. Hmm, yes. The excavations can wait, I think.



Manuela: Life can be tough, you know? But if you've got your friends to help you through, it can be a lot easier. Maybe you butt heads sometimes…but that's OK. That's how you build bonds, right? And I've got friends, Professor. Plenty of those. It's true love that seems to have passed me by.
Byleth: You should relax.
Manuela: Relax? I'm relaxed.
Byleth: There's still hope. 
Manuela: But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?
Byleth: Time to give up?
Manuela: Yeah… I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.
Manuela: At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!



Alois: We thought we'd taken down the mastermind of this war, and then the Fell King Nemesis shows up! Well, no matter what evil creatures we have to face, this old soul will keep defending Garreg Mach. Not only Garreg Mach. Also Lady Rhea. Also you. I think Jeralt would be saying the same kind of thing if he were here right now.



Catherine: I try not to think about what would happen if Lady Rhea were harmed. I can't bear the thought of it. I'm not sure why the Fell King Nemesis picked right now to come back to life. But it makes me angry, that's for sure! Let's kick him back down into the dirt, where he belongs.



Shamir: Ghosts rising up from the ancient ruins… Heh… No matter how hard we push back, they don't stop coming. They're persistent. I'll give them that.



Cyril: I hear some super strong and evil fellas are after Lady Rhea. She just barely made it back to Garreg Mach, and then this has to go and happen? I'll protect Lady Rhea as best I can, and you're gonna do the same thing, aren't ya, Professor? Yeah, I know you will! Cut 'em down, Professor! Get every last one of those guys!



Judith: Did you hear? Our enemy is Nemesis. Unbelievable. It sounds so crazy, but there's no laughing it off. We must make our move before they reach the monastery.



Gatekeeper: Professor! I just have to say thanks! For everything! I'm on high alert today, so don't you worry about a thing. This mysterious military force approaching Garreg Mach… Is it true that Nemesis is with them?! It was Nemesis who led the 10 Elites against Saint Seiros. It's the stuff of legend. But this time, he won't have the 10 Elites on his side. Right? He won't, right?!

@Opening 
A military force bearing the Crest of Flames on its banner marches west to Garreg Mach from Shambhala, attacking nearby cities along the way. Rhea informs the Alliance that the enemy's general is none other than the ancient Fell King Nemesis. And so the Alliance army prepares for their final battle, hoping to put an end to Fódlan's blood-stained history.

Shambhala has fallen, but a mysterious army has emerged from its ruins, bearing the Crest of Flames on its banner. Leading this force is Nemesis, the King of Liberation, presumed dead for a thousand years.

@Intro 
Claude: What's the plan, my friend?
Byleth: We will defeat Nemesis.
Claude: I thought you'd say that. And of course, I'll be joining you. What about the rest of you? Our enemy is a monster of legend. As always, there's not a shred of proof that we can win.
Lorenz: A foolish inquiry, Claude. I must finish what my father started…
Hilda: Started? Your father ran away before the battle even began.
Lorenz: I…well. All the more reason why I, as his heir, cannot flee now!
Hilda: I'm in. I need to get back at him for hurting my brother. I'm not going to let him get away with it!
Ignatz: Wow… Hilda's serious about this!
Lysithea: I too will fight until the end. I wish to protect Fódlan's future.
Leonie: I feel the same as Lysithea. It would hardly be fitting for Captain Jeralt's apprentice to bow out now. I'll show them everything he taught me.
Marianne: I…I will give it my all as well! For the professor, for Claude, and for all of you who helped make me as strong as I am now!
Raphael: I'm in too! And when we're done, I'm gonna eat tons of steak to celebrate!
Ignatz: This truly is the final battle… At this point, you shouldn't have to ask, Claude. You know we're with you.
Claude: I do know that, Ignatz. But I had to ask just to make sure.
Judith: Heh. Look at how reliable you kids have become. You've trained them well, Professor. This Nemesis guy should be arriving soon. Is everyone ready?
Claude: It's finally time.
Byleth: I won't let us lose.
Byleth: I won't let any of you die.
Byleth: Let's win this… Together!
Claude: I'm on board with that. Let's all make it through this alive. Let's defeat this dusty old King of Liberation and put an end to this history of lies. Once we've done that, there'll be nothing holding us back. A new and brighter age will begin. Let's go, my friend! Fódlan's new dawn awaits!

@Battle 
Claude: Nemesis is here…and with more soldiers than expected.
Hilda: A swamp, huh? But there’s something about it… It looks odd somehow.
Agarthan Soldier: Agh! Can’t…breathe…
Odesse: He should not have done that… Be careful. The water is poisonous to the living.
Claude: It looks like we’d better not get near that swamp… Try to avoid it during the fight!

Claude: Huh?! I think they’ve got some sort of magical link with Nemesis…
Marianne: Could the magic be protecting him?
Claude: Not sure, but we’d better take out his 10 commanders before taking him on.

Nemesis: Seiros! I will kill you! Do not get in my way!
Claude: So, that's Nemesis… You're a crusty old bastard, you know that?
Nemesis: All those who stand in my way…will be destroyed!
Raphael: Wah! Watch out, Claude! They're coming for us!


Claude: No effect!? So Nemesis is... invincible...

Claude: Nine more commanders remaining… We just killed number 10. These can’t be the 10 Elites, can they? Nah, not likely.
Hilda: Look! The swampland cleared! 

Lorenz: Professor! Claude! All the subordinates to Nemesis have been eliminated!
Claude: It took some doing, but now’s our chance to face off against Nemesis!

Claude: Agh! Demonic Beasts flying in from the south… Someone here must be able to summon them!
Lysithea: I sense an unusual presence. Someone may be hiding there.

Odesse: Argh... Thales!

Claude: Now he can’t call any more Demonic Beasts. Time to see off his allies.

Claude: Now he can’t call any more Demonic Beasts. And the remaining forces of Shambhala have been defeated too.

Ignatz: Whoa. The swampland vanished.

Hilda: Look! The swampland cleared!

@Boss 
%Claude,Riegan 
Claude: Hey… Can you speak?
Riegan: …
Claude: Just puppets controlled by Nemesis… Well, they’re the strongest puppets I’ve ever known.

@Boss
Nemesis: Feeble creature… Prepare to die!

%Byleth,Nemesis
Nemesis: That sword… You bear the Crest of Flames, just as I do!

@End 
Claude: That one seemed to work… We’re almost done! Let’s go, my friend.

@Cutscene 
Nemesis: You are a foolish child.
Claude: Tough talk from a guy who's lived too long. Allow me to fix that!
Nemesis: You are all pathetic weaklings! You lack the courage to challenge me in lone combat.
Claude: Yet we have the strength to scale the walls between us, to reach our hands in friendship, so we can open our true hearts to one another! 
Claude: That's how we win!
Claude: Future historians will refer to this day as the new dawn of Fódlan. Of that, I have no doubt.
Claude: It's up to you now Teach. As for my path...

@Narration 
A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fódlan. The ambitions of the Fell King Nemesis were crushed, averting what could have been the greatest crisis in the history of Fódlan. After 5 and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. Country, faith, history...All that had once formed the order of the world was wiped clean. The heroes whose very hands saved Fódlan from a dark fate commenced with the building of a new society. The leaders of this new unified Fódlan began their walk down a seemly endless path-one toward a world that would cherish differences in race and belief, one where all life would be valued equally. Those clung to the hope that their path would not end with Fódlan—that it would someday span the seas to Dagda and beyond the Throat to Almyra...@Opening 
Having repelled the Imperial vanguard, the Alliance army requests reinforcements from Judith, head of House Daphnel - the governing body in the northwestern regions of Alliance territory.

@Dialogue 
Raphael: What? Not enough left for seconds? I'm barely half full!
Cyril: Ya eat too much anyways, Raphael. Supplies are running low, so you're just gonna have to deal with it.
Ignatz: You've always been so level-headed, Cyril. Now that you've grown up, you're even more that way.
Cyril: Maybe it's just that the rest of you haven't grown enough. You could work harder at being reliable.
Raphael: I can't grow if I can't eat!
Hilda: I have some good news for my hungry friends... We got a reply from Judith!
Hilda: Mr. Leader Man has called a meeting about it. Hurry up, everyone!


Claude: We finally received a reply from Judith. The Hero of Daphnel has agreed to support us with soldiers and supplies.
Raphael: She's gonna give us food? She really is a hero!
Cyril: Maybe Raphael will simmer down now.
Claude: Now, regarding where we're going to receive the delivery...

Judith: As this is a request from none other than the leader of the Alliance, I wish that I could send troops at once. However... Openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the Alliance. Therefore, I will secretly gather troops in Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Will your group be able to receive the soldiers at this location? From there, it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the Alliance and the Kingdom.

Byleth: Ailell, the Valley of Torment...
Claude: Ailell is on the border between the Daphnel territory and the Kingdom. It'll make sense when we get there, but it's a peculiar region.
Marianne: I recall there being a scary legend about it...
Claude: In any case, if we use that valley, we shouldn't have to worry about being noticed by other Alliance lords.
Alliance Soldier: Ailell, the Valley of Torment...

@Conversation 
Claude: You know… I'd never have been recognized as the legitimate heir to House Riegan without Judith's recommendation… Feels like I'm digging myself deeper and deeper in debt to the Hero of Daphnel, but what do you do? It's all been worth it. After all, we need the Daphnel army for our next move. It's possible we'll have to deal with our enemy sooner than later. Be prepared, Teach.



Lorenz: The bridge that links Alliance and Empire lands is currently under the occupation of the Imperial army. In other words, the Empire can choose to invade the Alliance whenever they wish. I want you to understand that my father does not support the Empire to antagonize House Riegan. He does it to deprive them of an easy excuse to cross that bridge.



Raphael: Sharing her food with us for nothing in return? Judith really is a great person! She's more like a goddess than the goddess is!
Byleth: She is very much like a goddess. 
Raphael: I never met her, so I don't know for sure, but she must be beautiful and kind.
Byleth: I'm not sure about that.
Raphael: No? Well, she could be a demon for all I care, so long as she feeds me!



Ignatz: The Valley of Torment... I'd heard of it, but I never expected to go there. It's exciting! I wonder what the landscape is like.
Byleth: It sounds dangerous.
Ignatz: It probably is dangerous, but I still want to get there and see it as soon as I can.
Byleth: It sounds painful. 
Ignatz: Hm, that is an interesting point... The name does seem to suggest that.



Lysithea: Ailell, the Valley of Torment, lies on the border of three noble territories. The Kingdom's Fraldarius and Galatea families, and the Alliance's Daphnel family. In the Fraldarius lands to the north, the former Kingdom army and new duke's army are fighting.



Marianne: Valley of Torment... Valley of Torment...
Byleth: Something wrong? 
Marianne: I once read a book full of legends surrounding Ailell, but I can't seem to remember...
Byleth: Are you chanting some sort of curse?
Marianne: N-no... I'm trying to remember the legends surrounding Ailell...



Hilda: My big brother told me stories of Judith's bravery. With just one look, she tamed a runaway horse that nobody else had been able to touch. When an Almyran general provoked her, she talked him into a tearful apology. She's spectacular. I wish she'd fight alongside us.



Leonie: You're not a teacher anymore, and we're not your students, but everyone still calls you Professor. Is there something you'd rather be called?
Byleth: Professor is fine.
Leonie: Guess that's what we're used to, huh? All right.
Byleth: Call me by my name. 
Leonie: Oh? All right, then. I'll call you - ugh. Nope! Sorry, can't do it. Too weird.



Ferdinand: Some day we will take the Imperial capital. It is odd to think that I will be invading the very city that I once called home. Ah, that is still a ways off. I will prepare for our journey to Ailell.



Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. Have I never told you that? Huh. Oh well. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. Though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain...



Caspar: I didn't think we'd end up fighting Randolph... He's my uncle. Well, not by blood, so... I guess I can handle it.
Byleth: I'm still worried about you.
Byleth: You're very resolute. 
Caspar: Don't worry about me. I'm ready for anything.


Bernadetta: Ailell, the Valley of Torment? What kind of a name for a place is that? It sounds scary. Do I really have to go with you? Hey, um, here's an idea... Maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort!



Dorothea: Hey, Professor, thanks for your hard work again! Nothing to report today! Was I convincing? Was it like he was standing right in front of you? Some things are the same as they were five years ago, but I guess a lot more has changed...



Petra: Since the past, I have learned much of the language of Fódlan. But speaking the Fódlan language still gives me difficulty. I can understand, read, and write with nearly perfection now. But understanding and speaking are...fruits of a different color.
Byleth: That's part of your charm 
Petra: I have gratitude for you, Professor. I hope that I will have fluency one day.
Byleth: Everyone has a weak spot.
Petra: Yes. I will keep practicing more.



Felix: Some in Faerghus believe Dimitri is still alive. My father is one such eccentric. Hmph, they can't accept reality. Dimitri is dead. He's not coming back.



Sylvain: Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Aw, man... I really do not want to go there.
Byleth: Pull yourself together.
Sylvain: Professor, have you ever been to Ailell? If you had, you'd know.
Byleth: Why not? 
Sylvain: That place is crazy hot! For guys like me who grew up somewhere cold? Man... It's gonna be rough. Though, I guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay.



Mercedes: We may not be students anymore, but it's still important to read. We might even learn something that's useful for our next battle.
Byleth: Studying is important.
Mercedes: I couldn't agree more! I hope the Officers Academy reopens when the war is over.
Byleth: Training is important too.
Mercedes: I suppose that may be true. I always try my best at both.
Mercedes: It's a shame the monastery was ruined but...At least the books are still intact!



Annette: Professor, how do Claude and Judith know each other? I hear there are still quarrels within the Alliance… This generous offer of soldiers and supplies seems a little too good to be true. I mean, it’s also really impressive, but I’m just a little worried, I suppose…



Ingrid: My family, the Galateas, are an offshoot of the Daphnel family. The family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance. Despite blood relations, the families lived apart from one another, so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged. I’m not so much acquainted with Judith, the head of House Daphnel.



Seteth: Meeting reinforcements in the Valley of Torment seems an astute decision to me. In that land of oppressive heat, it is unlikely that we will be disturbed. It also means we will need to contend with those harsh conditions ourselves, however. Best ensure we are well prepared.



Flayn: It has been only five years, yet so much has changed. Half of the Kingdom has fallen to the Empire. Skirmishes are rife throughout the Alliance. Despite such tumult, we look upon the same sky, unchanged by the storm happening beneath it.
Byleth: Do you wish you could return to those days?
Flayn: Yes, it would be nice, I suppose. Things were... simpler then. Or so they seemed to be, at the time.
Byleth: It's true - it's just like it was all those years ago. 
Flayn: Indeed. I gazed up at the same sky with Mother and Father. It does not feel so long ago at all. Wait, but how would you know, Professor?



Hanneman: The monastery repairs have made solid progress. Most excellent news. When we first returned here, I was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place... But if we can get the cathedral rebuilt, we'll have it looking just like the old times soon enough.



Manuela: Hearing that an old student has died cuts me right to the heart... As this war with the Empire continues, we'll see more of it, Professor. We have a duty to fight alongside our former students. We taught them how to fight, after all. Now, let's help them win!



Alois: Even though we're getting reinforcements, we should still be prepared for the worst. Never shirk your training, no matter what. To practice, I'm going to chop something up with my sword. Unless you'd like to train together! Care to spar?



Catherine: I've heard people talk about the Hero of Daphnel. If the stories of her courage are true, no one will be able to stand against us. In different circumstances, I'd have wanted to try crossing swords with her. Right now we have to focus on getting to those reinforcements. Let's hope nothing goes wrong.



Shamir: There are enemy spies around. Remain vigilant. Capture anyone who seems suspicious.
Byleth: To kill them?
Shamir: What else would we do with them?
Byleth: All right, I will. 
Shamir: I'm glad you understand. I'm counting on you.



Cyril: Gotta clean out the storerooms, tend the flowers, do the washing, dust the library...
Byleth: That sounds like a lot of work.
Cyril: Well, it's my job, ya know? Gotta do your job.
Byleth: Do you need any help? 
Cyril: Nah, this is my job. Lady Rhea herself gave it do me.
Cyril: Even if Lady Rhea's not here right now, I still gotta do my duty.
Cyril: Like you. You gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing, yeah?



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is everyone setting out on a big campaign? Not exactly? Ah, so you're meeting up with the reinforcements. We'll, you can leave guarding this place to me! I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious!

@Opening 
In response to the Alliance Army's plea, Judith has agreed to provide soldiers. To meet up with reinforcements, the Alliance army sets out for Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Unbeknownst to Claude, something else awaits them there...

Your party travels to Ailell, the Valley of Torment, to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements. It should have been a safe march...

@Intro 
Hilda: Ugh, why is it so hot? I'm getting all sweaty!
Raphael: Don't be a wimp! Anything's worth it for more food supplies.
Leonie: Move over, Raphael. Somehow you make the heat even worse.
Ignatz: Let's stay calm, everyone. Once we meet up with Judith's soldiers, we can go right back home.
Marianne: Oh, I finally remembered! The legend goes that this valley was born from the wrath of the goddess...
Marianne: They say a pillar of light poured from the heavens and completely burned away the forest that used to be here...
Claude: So you're telling me the goddess, who is supposed to be benevolent, burned a forest to a crisp? Typical.
Marianne: That's what the legend would have us believe. But it's not recorded in any of the scriptures...
Claude: Either it's completely made up, or the goddess is some kind of monster.
Cyril: Huh? Is that...
Lorenz: The time for idle chatter is over, Claude. Look over there.
Claude: Ah, has someone come to greet us?
Byleth: Enemies?
Byleth: Allies?
Lorenz: That banner does not bear the Daphnel Crest.
Claude: If memory serves... That's the Crest of House Rowe, formerly lords of the Kingdom. They joined the Empire's side without hesitation during the coup. And now here they are, lying in wait for us.
Shamir: Damn... I thought we had disposed of all the spies...
Lorenz: House Rowe is mediocre and vulgar, but I hear their knights are powerful.
Hilda: What about the Daphnel soldiers? You don't think...
Byleth: I'm worried about Judith.
Claude: Judith will be fine. It would take a lot more than that to take her down.
Byleth: We need to break through their ranks.
Claude: We've already been spotted, so there's no time to come up with a brilliant plan.
Claude: Everyone, prepare for battle! I leave the command in your capable hands, my friend.

@Battle 
Gwendal: The Valley of Torment... Perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight. Only if that puny force of children is able to kill me, of course...
Claude: So, their general must be that stubborn-looking old man. He looks like he wouldn't even forgive a sobbing child. It's good we came armed for the occasion. Care to find Judith?

Claude: Flames are flaring everywhere and burning people where they stand... Ailell is a terrible place. Everyone, if you don't want to get burned to a crisp, watch your step!

Gwendal: The Crest of Flames? Ha! Quite full of themselves, aren't they?
Ashe: Just as I thought - the professor's army. But it's too late to back out now. In Lonato's place, I have to do my duty.

Judith: Oh, old Gwendal is here. And he doesn't look to be an ally...
Gwendal: Oh, the Hero of Daphnel is here! I'll expect more from her than the young ones...
Defeat Conditions: All of your units fall in battle, or Judith is defeated.

Kingdom Soldier: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!

@Battle-Talk 
%Claude,Judith
Judith: So, you're finally here, supreme leader. And something extra has tagged along.
Claude: Sorry, Judith. That rat got away.
Judith: Hey, don't worry. And here, you should have this. Perhaps it will come in handy.

@Boss 
Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!

Gwendal: Ah, so I have found a place to die... Young ones... I thank you...
Claude: That old man must have been struggling with the position he found himself in... It's time to gather ourselves and pull back our troops.

@End 
Judith: To think we'd get into a scrap here of all places. We're lucky we all made it out alive.
Byleth: I'm sorry for involving you in this.
Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long.
Byleth: I can see why they call you a hero.
Judith: Well, that's ancient history.
Judith: Anyway, long time no see, Professor! Are you still watching this boy's back?
Claude: Can you quit calling me a boy in front of everyone? I'm the leader of the Alliance now. It's not proper-
Judith: Not proper, is it? Says the leader who has neglected Alliance territory for years. If you're really the Master Tactician, you should go back to working quietly at whatever little desk you do your planning on.
Claude: Ugh, don't call me that either. Who even came up with that nickname?
Judith: It's a perfect title for a boy who loves crafty schemes as much as you do. You should be grateful to the professor. On your own, you'd look like a scoundrel of a leader.
Hilda: Haha! Claude's usually so flippant, but even he gets overwhelmed when Judith is around!
Lorenz: As expected from the leader of the prestigious House Daphnel. Her dignity if beyond compare, even if she is no longer one of the Five Great Lords.
Byleth: The Five Great Lords?
Byleth: The prestigious House Daphnel?
Lorenz: The five most influential lords of the Leicester Alliance. They hold the voting rights at the roundtable conferences. House Daphnel used to be included among their ranks, but division from within has hastened their decline. Their vote has since been passed to the emerging Margrave Edmund.
Judith: Thanks for the exposition, Gloucester boy.
Lorenz: Boy?! I will not-
Judith: Now to business. There were some unexpected interruptions, but I've brought soldiers and supplies, as promised.
Claude: Thanks, Judith. I'll gladly take them off your hands...
Judith: Hold your horses, boy. You're misunderstanding. These soldiers are precious to me. I made them what they are. I'm not about to loan them out to someone.
Claude: No? Then why did you come here?!
Judith: What I'm saying is that I'll be joining your army. You're going to fight the Empire with the Knights of Seiros, right? Fight for Lady Rhea? Not without me.
Claude: That's admirable and all, but we still don't know for sure if Rhea is in the-
Judith: Oh, she's there. A witness saw Lady Rhea being dragged off by the Imperial army after the battle five years ago.
Alois: Are you sure your source is reliable?!
Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
Alois: It seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the Empire.
Claude: But you're the leader of House Daphnel. Is it OK for you to leave your territory unattended?
Judith: And what about you? Is it OK for you to leave the Riegan territory unattended?
Claude: That's... I've left it in the hands of a reliable retainer and-
Judith: And I've asked that retainer to watch over Daphnel territory as well.
Claude: Wait, wait, wait... You just up and decided to get my retainer to do that without even asking me? No respect, this one...
Byleth: What retainer?
Judith: Oh? You haven't met him yet, Professor? His name is Nardel. He strikes me as a really special individual. And he's quite handsome too!
Claude: So that's your definition of handsome?
Judith: No objections, then? Good. That settles it. House Daphnel is now yours to command.
Claude: I'm sure you'd come along even if I refused. So be it. We'll be counting on you, Judith.

Claude: With Judith joining our forces, we've secured some more troops and supplies... albeit not many.
Judith: Hmph. I'm sorry it couldn't be more.
Claude: No, it's enough for the time being. We'll use them to secure even more troops and supplies.
Byleth: How so?
Byleth: You think we can do that?
Claude: The key to my plan is Count Gloucester, the leader of the pro-Empire faction in the Alliance.
Lorenz: You intend to sway my father to join the other side?
Claude: If Count Gloucester were to switch to the other side, that would basically unify the Alliance. Then we could utilize our full military force in the fight against the Empire.
Lorenz: You don't mean to ask me to persuade him, do you? That would be... quite impossible.
Claude: I don't plan on it. We'll just take his concerns out of the equation. The Airmid River flows along the border between Gloucester territory and the Empire, right? Of all the bridges that cross it, the Great Bridge of Myrddin is the only one near Gloucester territory large enough for an army. Currently, the Imperial army occupies it.
Lysithea: So, if we were to capture the bridge...
Claude: Count Gloucester would be freed from the threat of the Empire. Thanks to us.
Lysithea: But we have to pass through Gloucester territory to reach the Great Bridge of Myrddin, do we not?
Claude: Yes. And if we attempted it, naturally he would try to stop us.
Lorenz: I am sorry, but I must ask. Surely you do not plan to engage in combat with my father?
Claude: Don't worry. I want him as a future ally. What good would it do to waste both of our forces fighting?
Byleth: I take it you have a scheme?
Claude: Who do you think you're taking to, Teach? Preparations are in the works even now.
Byleth: So, we'll be sneaking through?
Claude: We can't be stealthy with so many people. But I have a scheme. Preparations are already in the works.
Judith: So the Master Tactician is finally going to show us his true power. I'm looking forward to it!
Claude: I'll do my best to live up to that name by making my scheme as impressive as possible.@Opening 
Immediately following Edelgard's defeat, the Alliance army discovers the existence of another adversary - a group operating behind the scenes within the Empire. Claude suspects that if the true enemy is left unchecked, disaster will befall Fódlan. And so he cuts short the celebration, and the troops head for Shambhala, where this foe resides.

@Dialogue 
Claude: I just don't get it...
Leonie: What is it, Claude?
Claude: Those javelins of light... They were trying to use it to kill us at Fort Merceus, right? But then why not drop it on Garreg Mach? They must have known for a while that we were here.

Rhea: It is not that they chose to refrain, but rather that they were unable to do so.
Claude: Rhea! How are you feeling?
Rhea: I am well enough... I cannot afford to rest while Fódlan is in danger.
Claude: What do you mean when you say they couldn't drop a javelin of light here?
Rhea: Once, a very long time ago, a massive ball of light fell upon this monastery. However, that light mysteriously changed course in mid-air and landed in Ailell instead.
Leonie: Ailell, the Valley of Torment... So that's what the wreckage of those javelins of light looks like.
Rhea: The Holy Tomb is not only the location of the progenitor god's eternal slumber, but also a sacred vessel for a power that repels evil. Supposedly, the progenitor god built the Holy Tomb herself to protect her children from the evil light.
Claude: So the children of the goddess gathered in Zanado because of its proximity to the monastery? But we've fought at distant locations many times.
Leonie: Despite that, the javelins of light only fell on Fort Merceus.
Judith: In his letter, Hubert said that he detected their magic when the fort fell. In other words, because they used a javelin of light, Hubert was able to pinpoint the location of their base.
Leonie: So they didn't use it before then because they didn't want us to know where their base is?
Claude: In any case, those javelins of light must be something they can't just use whenever they want. And they finally decided to use one at Merceus, where they were sure they'd be able to finish us off. It's only thanks to the whims of the Death Knight that we escaped with our lives. And no javelins of light have fallen since then.
Judith: It's possible that the enemy hasn't yet realized that we've learned the location of their base.
Claude: If so, their guard may be down, which makes this the perfect time for a surprise attack.
Rhea: I will accompany you.
Seteth: What?! No! That would be far too dangerous! Your long confinement weakened you greatly, did it not?
Rhea: Those people have opposed us since ancient times. I wish to learn the truth about them for myself.
Seteth: I... I understand. I will not stop you, but please take care not to overexert yourself.
Claude: We don't know exactly what we're up against here, but having you around is very reassuring, Rhea. Let's prepare to strike at Shambhala before they make their next move!

@Conversation 
Claude: We crushed the Empire at long last... But there's no time to bask in our victory. We must prepare for the coming battle. We knew there was a secret group behind the Imperial army all this time. Now, we have a chance to make the first move against them. We have Hubert to thank for that. It's also thanks to him that we were able to rescue Rhea. I still have plenty of questions I'd like to ask her.
Byleth: Are you going to see her?
Claude: Well, if we plan to have her march into battle with us again, we'd better let her recuperate.
Byleth: We should let her rest. 
Claude: Rhea is the only one who gets a break, though. Everyone else had better start preparing for battle.



Lorenz: A mysterious power, threatening the very future of Fódlan? Certainly we cannot give it leeway. In comparison to this, the internal power struggles in the Alliance are utterly trivial.
Byleth: Aren't you frightened? 
Lorenz: Fear will serve no purpose here. The only path to survival is victory.
Byleth: Do you think we can defeat it?
Lorenz: There is simply no option but victory! The alternative is unthinkable.
Lorenz: Perhaps I will have the opportunity to strike the decisive blow on the enemy commander. That would secure my place in history for certain!



Raphael: Wake up, eat, train, eat, train, eat, sleep. We gotta prepare for the assault, but that hasn't changed my routine!
Byleth: You're doing plenty. 
Byleth: Isn't there more you can do?
Raphael: All the training... and eating... I do is for the sake of Fódlan! Gotta stay strong... and fed... to keep it safe!



Ignatz: Our next opponent is an ally of Solon. Do you remember what Solon called us?
Byleth: Traitors?
Ignatz: No. He called us beasts.
Byleth: Beasts? 
Ignatz: That's right. He called us beasts.
Byleth: Insects?
Ignatz: No. He called us beasts.
Ignatz: Meanwhile, he refers to himself as the Savior. Who exactly is he saving?



Lysithea: Those who slither in the dark... It seems we'll finally discover their true form. I get the sense that they're in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child. I wouldn't be surprised if Edelgard was subjected to them too. There's no telling what their true motives are. But whatever their motives, what they have done is unforgivable. They must be exterminated.



Marianne: I thought the war would end with Edelgard's defeat... But that wasn't the case. This may be premature, but I'm feeling a little relieved. I have to consider what I'll do with myself and where I'll go when this war is finally over... I don't have an answer yet... Let's make sure the next battle puts an end to this war. That way we can all move forward!



Hilda: Shambhala it was called, right? Scary that it's so close to the House Goneril territories. Who'd have thought all those creeps were living right under my nose? I was hoping my big brother would help us in this next battle. But he says that I can represent House Goneril without his help. That I have it in me. I'm glad he recognizes that I have some ability. Still, I wish he wasn't leaving it all to me.



Leonie: These are Monica's people, aren't they? The ones who killed Captain Jeralt. Then this is my real opportunity for revenge. There's no way I can back down from this one.
Byleth: You're not scared? 
Leonie: No, I'm OK. Actually, I'm eager to get our there and fight. This is what I've been training for.
Byleth: I wonder if we can win.
Leonie: If we lose, it's the end for Fódlan. So we have to win, even if it kills us.



Ferdinand: The history of the Empire spans 1185 years. And just like that, it ends. But the Hresvelg legacy could live on... When Edelgard assumed power, there were no other rightful heirs. She said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by virtue of merit, not blood. And she truly meant what she said. At any rate, I feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart. Who knows if it can ever be filled?



Linhardt: As history proves, everything comes to an end eventually. I knew that all along, but it still came as a surprise. Those who slither in the dark... It's all so fascinating and strange. They must certainly have a long history of their own. And when they fall, that will come quickly too. Don't you think? Heh, that almost sounded like a prophecy there. Am I spooking you yet?



Caspar: He's dead... My father's dead... I'm OK though. Really. I was ready for it. He was a general in the Imperial army, after all. Minister of Military Affairs... He gave his own life so the Empire's soldiers wouldn't have to lose theirs. That's a fight that only he could take on. He was such a tough guy. This whole time I fought side by side with you and Claude... But did I ever get any stronger? Will I ever be as strong as my father?

Bernadetta: With Edelgard gone, maybe Fódlan will finally find some peace. That's all well and good, but, um... She was also the one to put my father under house arrest, so now he's been released, and he's taken charge of House Varley. I can't handle it! I can't deal with him! Please, you have to do something!
Byleth: How about we exile him? 
Byleth: We can put him back under arrest.
Bernadetta: Thank you so much!



Dorothea: So, the moment we defeat Edie, the nobles cozy up to the Alliance and church... That lot really does think only of themselves, and no one else. But then there's Count Bergliez. He used to be Minister of Military Affairs... He sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter... When I heard that... I don't know... that simple act of humanity... I couldn't help it. I burst into tears. You know Count Bergliez is Casper's father, right? I can't even imagine how Caspar must feel about it.



Petra: The Empire has broken in... in smithereens. Now it is possible for me to go back to Brigid. But... I cannot choose that choice. The time is still too soon for that. We must be stopping the evil for everyone in Fódlan. We will be fighting until the end of it!



Felix: I thought that after the Empire fell, the boar might finally be avenged... But something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows - an organization behind the Empire. We'll have to take care of them if the boar... if Dimitri is to rest in peace.



Ashe: We've all heard the legend of Nemesis, the King of Liberation. But now Lady Rhea is saying Nemesis was just some kind of thief. Those two descriptions are totally at odds. Which version's correct? I don't know what to think. But I guess that's the nature of history. I wonder what the generations that come after us will say about the battle we're about to fight.



Sylvain: This war might be over but not war in general. Human beings thrive on conflict. We can't get enough of it. I don't know when, but you know someday another war will begin.
Byleth: Even so... 
Sylvain: Heh heh... That's the way it is, right?
Byleth: You're probably right about that.
Sylvain: Yeah, but the fight is still worth it.
Sylvain: War may always come back but so will peace. And peace is what we fight for.



Mercedes: Lady Rhea still seems weak... but at least she's safe now. I'm praying that she'll be well as soon as possible. Goddess... I beg you... Protect Lady Rhea!



Annette: Finally, that awful war is over. Everyone lost something, and everyone had to make sacrifices... But maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now. Let's hurry to Shambhala, Professor! We have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war.



Ingrid: Is it really prudent to bring Lady Rhea on our upcoming expedition? It would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous, considering how long she was confined...
Byleth: It's her decision, ultimately. 
Byleth: I feel similarly.
Ingrid: There are still many in Fódlan who are seeking Lady Rhea's salvation.





Seteth: Rhea is sleeping right now. If it is not absolutely urgent, please do not disturb her rest. The long confinement took its toll on her health. Truthfully, she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all – to say nothing of a military expedition. To make matters worst, we are now facing a very old enemy. One that has conspired against us since time out of mind. Please proceed with caution. I have a bad feeling.



Flayn: I am so glad that Rhea is unharmed. My brother continues to worry about her, however. Of course, I am worried myself. I cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state... She should just leave things to you and Claude and get the rest she needs...



Hanneman: A mysterious organization, slithering in the dark of Fódlan... Like something out of a midnight tale. It appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the Empire. After the fall of Enbarr, they've remained well concealed... That said, I would keep an eye on Edelgard's uncle, Lord Arundel. Something about him sits ill with me.



Manuela: Professor! Most of the opera company fled, but they’re back in the capital now. I don’t know if everyone survived, but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival. They even asked if I’d consider making a return to the stage someday... I suspect I may refuse though. We’re at the dawn of something new. No reason to look backwards, eh?



Alois: You've done it. You did it. You crushed the Empire, and rescued Lady Rhea. I'm sure the captain is proud of you right now. As am I, of course! I'm as proud as if I'd done it myself!
Byleth: Let's not celebrate just yet. 
Byleth: We still have opponents left to fight.
Alois: Sorry. I didn't mean to overdo it. We still have Monica's group… Those who killed the captain. We'll knock 'em down so hard that they can't get back up!



Catherine: We rescued Lady Rhea! I can hardly express my joy. But now we know about a new foe, who intends to bring her harm. In time, we'll realize the peaceful world that Lady Rhea has always hoped for. I'll have to keep that in mind when I'm fighting.



Shamir: We saved Rhea and the Empire has crumbled. The Kingdom may as well be finished too. The reasons for me to remain in Fódlan are fading.
Byleth: Please, stay with us a little longer. 
Shamir: Of course. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.
Byleth: Is it time to bid farewell?
Shamir: That's a little hasty. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.



Cyril: Lady Rhea’s back! Lady Rhea’s back! I’m so happy! But... things aren’t gonna be like they used to be any time soon, are they? There’s still folks out there who want us all dead, and Lady Rhea still hasn’t regained her strength yet. Speaking of which, Professor, please don’t ask too much of her right now, OK?



Judith: The folks we're fighting next aren't normal humans, are they? It's that group who caused the javelin of light to fall, right? It just doesn't seem like something a human is capable of. I'm not prone to flinching, but I don't feel great about any of this...



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that. Everyone did sterling work! I really thought we'd know peace after the battle. But we're not quite there yet, huh?

@Intro 
Lysithea: Incredible… Who knew that there was such a vast space beneath the ground…
Judith: It's like an underground city. I've never seen buildings like these before.
Lysithea: It's like an ancient ruin… But not just because of its appearance.
Ignatz: I don't recall ever seeing architecture like this.
Lorenz: It is magnificent in a sense, but I could hardly call it beautiful, Even the air feels stagnant.
Claude: In any case, it seems like we need to go further. Let's look around and see if we can find some stairs.

Rhea: …
Byleth: Something on your mind?
Byleth: Are you not feeling well?
Rhea: No. It is simply… We must defeat those who slither in the dark, no matter what happens. But if my conjecture is correct, the one who they will wish to kill the most…

Rhea: Is you, dear child.
Byleth: Why me?
Rhea: They are aware that you can use the Sword of the Creator. Your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon Nemesis. That is why…I fear for you.
Byleth: That's not much to go on.
Rhea: Perhaps. Please forgive my errant thoughts. Once this battle is over… I will explain everything. I will tell you all I know about who you really are.

@Opening 
Though the flame of war is quenched, its embers endure. You travel deep underground to confront those who slither in the dark and bring lasting peace to Fódlan.

@Battle 
Thales: For thousands of years, we have existed underground, living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized. Here and now, that vengeance is finally within our grasp. There is but one thing left to do. Destroy them! Damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion, away from the world of the living!

Thales: Now is the time. Remove the binding spell of Titanus. Let their metal bodies be drenched in blood!
Claude: Hey, what are those big…things?
Rhea: Demonic Beasts… No, I think not. They appear to have no will of their own. Someone must be controlling them.
Thales: Initiate all that remain! We must advance our preparations!

Thales: Viskam has been activated? Increase output gradually, depending on the amount of magical energy charged. I don't care if we destroy Shambhala, as long as our goals are fulfilled!

Rhea: Those awful weapons have been stopped. They were being controlled from that facility!

Claude: Aw, those big things have gone to sleep on us. That will make moving around a lot easier. A dead end? Or perhaps... No, if we worry about every little detail, we won't get anywhere.

Thales: You!
Rhea: That is the leader of those who slither in the dark. We must go after him with all our might!

Claude: It seems someone is trying to remove something. We’d better capture them first!

@Boss 
Thales: You’re nothing but animals performing tricks in the hopes of pleasing the goddess. You will never see the sunlight again!

%Byleth,Thales
Thales: So you have shown yourself, Fell Star. Or, should I say…Sothis? I will spill every drop of blood in your body to fulfill the longstanding goal of the Agarthans!

%Seteth,Thales
Thales: Your eyes, hair, ears, and blood…We remember it all. We remember how you ruined us. How you stole our light and condemned us to eternal darkness! Now, suffer the wrath of the Agarthans!

%Claude,Thales
Thales: Ha. It is laughable that base animals such as you would bare fangs at the likes of us.
Claude: I may be a base animal, but I have strong allies. Do you think you can beat Teach and the Sword of the Creator?
Thales: The Sword of the Creator… The blade given to Nemesis. Who do you really think is superior?
Claude: There’s a big difference between the living and the dead. The fate of the future lies in the hands of the living!

@Cutscene 
Thales: You will never get to enjoy your victory.

Rhea: It can't be...

Thales: For all Agarthans... Let there be light!

Soldier: It's coming down!



Nemesis: Seiros...

@End 
Rhea: Ugh…
Cyril: Hang in there, Lady Rhea.
Catherine: Get her to her room, quickly!
Manuela: That's a serious injury… It's a miracle that she's even alive right now. I'll do what I can, but…

Marianne: Goddess… Please save Lady Rhea…
Hilda: All we can do now is pray…

Claude: Remember when this place was taken five years ago, and a pure White Beast appeared on the battlefield? I only caught a glimpse of it, but I didn't understand where it came from. There were rumors that the goddess sent it to protect the monastery… But now I know better. That beast was Rhea.
Byleth: She tried to save me…
Claude: Did you know Rhea's true identity?
Byleth: Looking back on it now, I suppose I did.
Claude: I once showed you a picture of a creature known as the Immaculate One. Seteth confiscated it, saying it must have been one of Tomas' personal possessions. The beast that appeared back then looked just like it. So Rhea is the Immaculate One. The book said it was a servant of the goddess, but wouldn't it make sense if beasts like that are actually children of the goddess?
Byleth: …
Claude: Rhea is in a grim state right now. It's possible she may not make it. But we have things we must ask her about. Once things calm down a little, let's go and see Rhea. Together. The truth can't be delayed any longer.@Opening 
Now in control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Alliance army invades the Imperial territories. In response, the Imperial army garrisons soldiers at Fort Merceus.

@Dialogue 
Claude: All of that went about as well as it could have. Each lord has agreed to provide us with soldiers and supplies.
Judith: I'm impressed you were able to convince all of those scattered nobles to help us. I thought they would quarrel about how much support they should each provide. That's what they usually do.
Claude: Well, Count Gloucester took the initiative in taking on responsibilities. I presume that was because you spoke with him in advance, Lorenz?
Lorenz: I merely explained the situation at hand, then my father simply followed your lead, Claude. It was because you had the professor there to represent Lady Rhea. My father is a pious follower of the Church of Seiros.
Claude: I don't doubt it. I wasn't under the delusion that it was my personal charm that unified everyone. Thanks for that, by the way. I hope you don't feel like I used you... because I sort of used you.
Byleth: Don't mention it.
Claude: I appreciate that. We don't have time to be picky about our methods. But be honest. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you?
Byleth: I'm not well pleased.
Claude: I understand. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you? You weren't even a follower of Seiros to being with, and somehow you've ended up as a representative of the church.
Claude: I realize that you might feel guilty about deceiving the believers for our cause...


Shamir: I have news. Our enemy is gathering troops at Fort Merceus. Their army is immense. Likely led by a renowned general. Or perhaps even...
Byleth: Edelgard?
Claude: Well now, that would be interesting. If we can defeat the emperor, then the Empire will collapse.
Byleth: The Flame Emperor?
Claude: Perhaps. But she's more than that now. She's the actual emperor. If we can defeat her, the Empire will collapse.
Judith: There's something else. An unidentified army has approached the Great Bridge of Myrddin. They passed through the Daphnel and Gloucester territories from the northwest with incredible speed. They're raising the banner of House Blaiddyd. Perhaps they are the remnants of the Faerghus royal family. From what we could tell, they posed no threat to the citizens of the Alliance, and so we refrained from engaging them in needless combat.
Claude: Maybe they hope to fight against the Empire to avenge their fallen prince. And what about the bridge itself?
Judith: Obviously we wouldn't let them pass without receiving envoys first. We thought they may try to force their way through. We considered firing warning arrows, but they left immediately, heading east.
Claude: Are they intending to use one of the bridges in Ordelia territory?
Judith: Most likely. But the Imperial army still controls those bridges. I can't imagine what they intend to do in the Empire, even if they do manage to break through...
Claude: I'm reluctant to ease up on our surveillance, but it would be difficult to track them there... For now, let's assume they're just troops belonging to the old Kingdom. In any case, we should proceed with caution. Soon, we'll be entering Empire territory ourselves. If our enemies are going to intercept us with an attack... It will probably be at Gronder Field... How fitting that it was the site of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion five years ago.

@Conversation 
Claude: We secured the win in our first skirmish, but the next battle is a different matter. The Empire will come after us with everything it's got. Even so, the ultimate victory will be ours. And I'm not just saying that! I've made ample preparations to ensure our victory. It's my rule to never leave victory to chance. You can't rely on the protection of the goddess. With your power and my schemes, I should be able to plot a direct course to victory.



Lorenz: House Gloucester has changed it's allegiance and joined the faction that is against the Empire. The Alliance will thus remain united. But thanks to this latest ploy, my father is more suspicious of Claude now than ever. If such a thing is possible. Ordinarily, I might credit his helpful posture towards us to his devout faith in the Church of Seiros. But it is clear to me now that this is nothing more than a shrewd calculation on his part. He is only thinking of his position. We are in the clear for now, but please bear in mind that the Alliance is never an entirely stable union.



Raphael: I gotta say, it's tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield.
Raphael: It's like when we were fighting before... I saw Lorenz and wasn't sure what to do with myself. 
Byleth: Everyone gets that feeling. 
Raphael: So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?
Byleth: You can run away if you want.
Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!
Raphael: Just because we're fighting someone doesn't mean we gotta hate 'em! That's probably the worst thing about war. Win or lose, I still get a bad taste in my mouth.



Ignatz: Thanks to our victory, I've been able to study the Great Bridge of Myrddin at my leisure. And you know what? It's an astounding structure. So much history there. Imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big. Over water, no less! I hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of Fódlan - a historical site, rather than a military checkpoint.



Lysithea: I trust you and Claude, but I feel uneasy. If we lose in the next battle, the Empire's army will likely come surging into Alliance territory. If that happens, my parents won't escape unharmed. They've raised their anti-Imperial flag, after all.
Byleth: I won't let that happen.
Lysithea: Thank you, Professor. I'll fight with all I've got too.
Byleth: We can't take back what we've done. 
Lysithea: You're right. I chose my path. I must press on. That's all anyone can do, really.
Lysithea: Speaking with you has eased my mind a bit. Just enough in fact, to put me in the mood for sweets.



Marianne: I've been praying to the goddess for Lorenz... We wouldn't have had to fight like that if things were different. 
Marianne: Um, I heard that some unidentified troops have appeared, but... Apparently they were flying the flag of the Faerghus royal family... Do you think it was Dimitri's ghost? His country was taken before he ever wore the crown. Surely he must regret that...



Hilda: Poor Lorenz. He and I weren't very close, but we were friends.
Hilda: Claude was saying that our next battle might be in Gronder Field. Is that right? Reminds me of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. But of course, that was a very different time. When it was over, all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery. And then we had a party. But we can never go back to that, can we?



Leonie: We might see Edelgard herself leading the enemy in the next battle. If they're coming out of Fort Merceus, our troops might even clash on Gronder Field. And those other troops on the march - who knows what they'll do, or what side they'll take? Not sure how we're supposed to form a strategy with so many unknowns.
Byleth: Don't worry. I can handle it. 
Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better.
Byleth: As long as you're here, I'll be fine.
Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?
Leonie: Anyways, we've come this far. Let's just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get.



Ferdinand: We captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but the fight has only just begun. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital, lies far to the south, beyond Gronder Field. And waiting on the way there is the entire Imperial army, with twice as many troops as us. We had better brace ourselves.



Linhardt: I seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead. If someone has passed, even someone dear to me, I could stand about and wail or get on with my life. While I'm at it, that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead? I don't understand that either. If I didn't like them when they were alive, then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here?



Caspar: After we cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in my father's territory. We actually crossed it five years ago for the Battle of Eagle and Lion. Remember? Ugh! This is terrifying! What am I gonna do? I gotta get a grip...
Byleth: Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral. 
Caspar: You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!
Byleth: I'll pray for your safety.
Caspar: Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!

Bernadetta: So the campaign continues, does it? Well, allow me, as a professional recluse with ten years of experience, to volunteer for, um...staying behind. Oh, who am I kidding? The fighting won't stop until we've defeated Edelgard, will it? Or until we lose, I guess. But there's not much use in thinking about that.



Dorothea: The Great Bridge of Myrddin was considerably better fortified than it was five years ago... The bridge was full of soldiers...and they all died.
Dorothea: And Ferdie was there. We killed Ferdie, Professor, he used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?



Petra: Nobles who are changing allegiance, again and again. I do not have understanding for that. How can you trust if treason comes with ease? How can you be calling yourself a noble? I do not have understanding of the reasoning...
Byleth: They're struggling for survival too.
Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal.
Byleth: For personal gain. 
Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?



Felix: So, the boar prince is dead. Decapitated, I hear. I haven't seen the severed head myself. Perhaps he's still alive and leading that army...
Byleth: Would you be able to fight him?
Felix: Don't patronize me. If his head is still attached to his body, I'll remedy that without hesitation.
Byleth: Don't get distracted. 
Felix: You're right. I can't let my emotions take hold.
Felix: Either way, a major battle awaits us. Try not to die. I'll be annoyed if you did.



Ashe: If we defeat the Imperial army at Gronder Field, what will our next objective be? I guess we won't have much choice but to try to take Fort Merceus, on the far side of Gronder Field. It's probably too soon for us to be thinking about that, isn't it? The battle just ahead of us is far from certain.



Sylvain: The time’s come to fight the Empire, huh? Wow, it’s shaping up to be quite the battle. And I’ve got no problem with that, but that mystery army really worries me. There’s no indication if they’re friend or foe… Who do you think they are, Professor?
Byleth: Remnants of the old Kingdom?
Sylvain: I suppose it’s possible. After all, His Highness is supposedly dead.
Byleth: Dimitri himself?
Sylvain: Heh, not unless he rose from the grave to secure revenge. That would mean… Actually, I have no idea what that would mean.
Sylvain: Well, whoever they are, I hope we can avoid fighting them.



Mercedes: So, we're finally going to set foot in the Empire...I'm starting to get a little nervous.
Mercedes: We already fought Ferdinand at the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but...
Mercedes: I guess there's a good chance we'll be fighting more old friends from here on out.



Annette: Claude seems filled with confidence, but I wonder if everything really will be OK… The Imperial army might be hiding the emperor, and the troops headed south might belong to the old Kingdom. I’ll be honest… I’m incredibly uneasy about all this. But at this point there’s…no option but to move forward.



Ingrid: I’ve cut all contact with my family since joining this fight. Were I to see soldiers of the Galatea Family amidst the host flying the royal family’s banner… I… Well. All chance of reconciliation with my father would end there. I do not know if that is the right path. But, the fact is, I’ve come this far. There’s no time for second guessing. Not anymore.



Seteth: Each time we press forward, our search for Rhea broadens to a wider area. I certainly hope we will find at least some clue, but I do suspect I already know where she is. If I am right, and she is in the Imperial capital, then we cannot save her until we topple the Empire.



Flayn: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Has it truly been five years since then? Can you recall whether it was before or after I joined your class, Professor?
Byleth: Before.
Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly.
Byleth: After. 
Flayn: I'm glad you have not forgotten.
Flayn: It was shortly after I joined your class - I remember it like it was yesterday.



Hanneman: When undertaking research, the usual methods is to form a hypothesis, then test it with experiments. Those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods, yet sometimes, they also unveil an exception. You seem to be that exception when it comes to my Crest research.
Byleth: Sorry about that. 
Byleth: I don't understand.
Hanneman: Worry not, Professor. Exceptions are what make my work interesting. Why don't the rules apply to you? I will find our eventually. I feel it is my destiny as a Crest scholar!



Manuela: I hear the next battle could be a big one, is that true? I miss the old days when, if someone got hurt, we'd rush them to the infirmary, and make them well... But on the battlefield, there's not enough time to help. People die. Professor, don't be one of those!



Alois: Word just reached me that the Empire has stationed soldiers in Fort Merceus. If they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort, we'll be in a difficult situation. I hear it's an impregnable keep, surrounded by high ramparts. Taking it would not be easy.



Catherine: Beyond the Great Bridge of Myrddin, it's all unfamiliar territory for us. We don't know where Lady Rhea is being held. We ought to investigate all potential locations thoroughly. The Knights of Seiros will handle the search. We'll report back if we learn anything.



Shamir: Reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory. If I don't come back, assume I'm dead.
Byleth: I know you won't get caught.
Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic.
Byleth: Understood. 
Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic.
Shamir: Don't waste your energy worrying about me.



Cyril: I gotta keep this place clean, and I mean properly clean, every day. Dust it, sweep it, everything. You never can tell when Lady Rhea might be back.



Judith: Since little Claude became their leader, the Alliance lords haven't been especially unified. Now, they're suddenly united for a common cause. As a result, the Empire hasn't been able to perform even one successful incursion... Rather, we're the ones who might get the jump on them. It's incredible. Magical, even. Maybe his strategic genius was simmering for those five years, and it returned to a full boil once you two were reunited. Or maybe he always knew he'd meet you again, and he was preparing for that this whole time...



Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I hear we're sending troops to Gronder Field next. Is that what's what? That whole area is in the territory of House Bergliez. It's famous as the main granary of Fódlan. If we could capture it, we probably wouldn't have to worry about food anymore! Bread for all!

@Intro 
Hilda: Gronder Field should be around here, right? But it's so foggy... Even if there were enemies here, we'd never know it.
Lysithea: I recall the terrain from the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, but without the ability to see the enemy's formation...
Claude: Our enemies are subject to the same conditions. We'll just have to wait for the fog to clear up.
Judith: Speaking of enemies, what do you think became of those unidentified troops? Any follow-up reports?
Claude: We haven't heard anything since. If they were headed this way... Well, I'd like to avoid being caught by surprise, but we can't make use of our scouts because of this fog. It's hard to predict this fight. There's no way to know what will happen.
Byleth: I'm worried.
Claude: We did everything we could to prepare. If we lose despite that, then we'll just have to accept it as fate and retreat.
Byleth: Let's try to stay calm. 
Claude: Of course. The morale of our allies would be crushed if we let them see us shaking in our boots.
Claude: Your guidance is going to be crucial, Teach. Now more than ever. Do whatever it takes to lead us to victory.

@Opening 
Departing from the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Alliance army marches south towards Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. An unknown military force begins their advance under the banner of the Kingdom, the Imperial army dispatches forces from Fort Merceus with the intention of interrupting them. The curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies, which will come to be known as the Battle at Gronder, held on the same plains that witnessed the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.

At Gronder Field, where the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was once held, the house leaders of five years ago have a fateful reunion...but this time, the contest between the Empire, the Kingdom, and the Alliance is no mock battle.

@Battle 
Dimitri: I will crush anyone who blocks my path.
Claude: Dimitri... He's alive. But he doesn't look interested in joining forces with us.
Edelgard: It would not be advantageous to take on both at once. We must stop the Kingdom and the Alliance from joining forces. I will create such chaotic warfare that they won't be able to tell who is friend and who is foe.


Edelgard: Mounted units, advance!



Imperial General: There are enemies in the central area... We need to head there immediately to protect it!

Petra: The center is in danger of being taken. We must be running to protect it!

Dimitri: The Imperial army is starting to crumble. We will step on the Empire right along with the Alliance troops. To the eternal flames with all of them!


Hubert: How kind of our enemies to fight one another. And open flanks as well? Generous.
Dimitri: If they're going to stand in our way, they must die. Smash them to pieces! It is time. Someone, take the central hill!

Edelgard: Those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives... in the crimson flames!


Edelgard: This is not as I planned, but there's nothing to be done. Burn the central hill!


Hubert: The central hill is up in smoke. Suppose I'll have to quench the flames - with the enemy's blood.


Claude: Even in an ugly battle like this, it's important not to lose heart. We have to take pride in our victory. We did it, Teach. Now we can move forward. To our victory!

@Boss 
Felix: Want to die? Step forward. I'll take you all.

Felix: Not here... Not like this...
Dimitri: Felix...

Ingrid: We all choose our paths and I've chosen mine. I fight for my lord, to the death!

Ingrid: Your Highness... I... failed you...
Dimitri: Ingrid...

Sylvain: Huh. I guess this is fate. Sorry, but I need you to please give up quietly, OK?

Sylvain: Heh, I'm not afraid... I figured it would end like this.
Dimitri: ...

Mercedes: Oh! I haven't seen you in so long! It's such a shame we have to meet like this...

Mercedes: I'm... I'm sorry, Dimitri... I can't seem to stay... on my feet.
Dimitri: Hmph...

Dedue: In the name of High Highness, you die here.

Dedue: I... can still fight, Your Highness.
Dimitri: Shut up and retreat. You must live, Dedue.

Dimitri: Are you trying to stop me too? Then I'll just have to kill you!

Dimitri: You're not worth it. Get out of my sight.

Dimitri: Where are you, Edelgard?! I will not stop until I kill you!

%Claude,Dimitri
Claude: Calm down, Dimitri! What does it achieve, us killing each other here?
Dimitri: Move, Claude. I have no time to exchange words with you.
Claude: It doesn't matter what I'm saying, does it? You aren't even listening. But I'm not gonna budge.

@End 
Claude: So... Edelgard retreated. I suppose she lives to be defeated another day.
Byleth: That's fine.
Claude: I suppose a win is a win, regardless of the circumstances.
Byleth: It was close.
Claude: Too close. But I suppose all that matters is that we won.
Claude: Some of our allies are injured, but can still fight. We'll just have to accept this outcome and press onward. Still, the battlefield looks awful. And I wonder what became of the Kingdom army. And Dimitri...

Hilda: I saw him.
Claude: Who? Dimitri?
Hilda: He was completely different from how I remember him. He looked like a crazed demon while he was fighting. He pursued Edelgard as she retreated, but he didn't get far before he collapsed. I saw him surrounded by Imperial troops and... pierced by their spears. I'll never forget it. He deserved a better end.
Claude: Dimitri... He went through so much to make it here, only for his efforts to be in vain.
Hilda: I can't even begin to understand what Dimitri must have been feeling, but... There must have been some other way. Why did he have to go like that?
Claude: And his vassal, Dedue... Did he fall as well?
Hilda: I don't know...

Dedue: Your Highness! Your ambitions are my own now! I... I will bring you Edelgard's head... I swear it!

Lysithea: Professor? Claude? May I have a moment of your time?
Claude: Lysithea, what are you doing up this late? Trouble sleeping?
Byleth: That's understandable.
Byleth: We all have nights like that.
Claude: Anyone would be shaken after such a brutal battle. If you're having trouble sleeping, you should drink some warm milk. That's a thing, right?
Lysithea: Must you treat me like a child, simply because I am awake a bit later than usual? Actually, I can hardly muster any indignation right now. I wanted to tell you that I noticed something odd during that battle.
Claude: What was it?
Lysithea: There were some strange mages among the ranks of the Imperial army. Did you notice them?
Byleth: The ones wearing masks?
Byleth: The ones dressed in black?
Lysithea: That's right. I have seen people dressed just like that before. It was a long time ago... House Ordelia was involved in a rebellion that took place within the Empire 18 years ago. After it was quelled, all of the key officials were caught and put to death. The Empire sent replacements, who they used to take control of House Ordelia. Among the people sent by the Empire were mages dressed in black, just like those we saw in battle.
Claude: If they're Imperial mages, it would make sense that they would wear the same clothing, right?
Lysithea: Yes, but the mages from back then and today... I do not believe they are from the Adrestian Empire.
Byleth: Are they Kingdom mages?
Byleth: Are they Alliance mages?
Lysithea: No. I got the impression that they were from somewhere else. Somewhere completely separate from Fódlan. There's more. Those mages imprisoned the children from my house, and performed horrible rituals on them. Blood experiments.
Claude: Lysithea... You can't mean... even you?
Lysithea: Yes. All of the others were deemed failures. They all died. And even I... It doesn't matter. The point is, that those monsters possess dreadful knowledge and power. I just thought you should know the sort of people who have allied with the Empire.
Claude: Blood experiments... Does that remind you of anything, Teach?
Byleth: The incident with Flayn...
Byleth: That incident with the Flame Emperor...
Claude: Exactly. There was that secret group who abducted Flayn and extracted her blood five years ago. The people involved back then were Tomas and Monica... Well, I suppose their true names were Solon and Kronya. So that eerie group has been slithering behind the scenes in the Empire for a while now... Lysithea... Thank you for sharing all of that with us. One day we will uncover the truth of who those people really are.

Claude: We've managed to invade Empire territory and emerge victorious in our first battle. I hope to maintain our momentum and push onward to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Unfortunately, we are not legendary heroes in a fairytale. Our stamina has limits. The longer we fight, the harder the fight will become. It will take immense effort to secure the supplies and soldier we need to prevail.
Judith: Boy, you better not be saying this is as far as we go.
Claude: Of course not. However, the road ahead leads deep into enemy territory. It will be a difficult journey, strewn with hardship. I can't guarantee that we'll make it out alive. If anyone wants to leave, now is the time to do it.
Lorenz: I shall accompany you to the very end. After all, someone must step up to take leadership should you fall.
Leonie: I'm coming. The future of my village depends on this. Besides... I have to protect the professor. For Captain Jeralt.
Raphael: I'm not going anywhere! Because of the Empire, my little sis can't live in peace!
Ignatz: We can't leave the future of Fódlan to others. I'm sure that everyone here feels the same.

Alois: The Knights of Seiros will keep fighting the Empire. We won't rest until we rescue Lady Rhea.
Cyril: I feel the same as the knights. I've gotta rescue Lady Rhea no matter what.
Hilda: So, what - we're all supposed to take turns saying we'll do our best until the very end? And what about you, Marianne? What will you do?
Marianne: I... I'll fight too!
Hilda: Fine, fine. I suppose I'll tag along too... Until the bitter end.
Claude: It's an honor to keep fighting alongside such stalwart allies. Right, Teach?
Byleth: I'd expect nothing less from my students.
Claude: Hey now, when you put it that way, it almost sounds like you're just praising yourself!
Byleth: You're a stalwart ally too, Claude.
Claude: I know I'm a great leader and all, but praising me isn't gonna get you anywhere.
Claude: All right. Now that I know where each of you stands, I'm going to return to Alliance territory for a while. I intend to report this victory to Alliance lords and draw out even more support from them. Our next battle will be even more challenging, so brace yourselves for that.
Hilda: Hmm... I should write to my brother. He'll want to hear about our victory.
Claude: Your brother, Lord Holst? How is he these days?
Hilda: Oh, he's doing great. I even got a letter from him before the last battle. He wanted to come and join our fight too.
Lorenz: What's this? Lord Holst, come here? That would be a most reassuring development.
Hilda: Sadly, it sounds like my father was against the idea. They wanted him to stay in case they need to fight the Almyrans.
Lorenz: Their logic is sound. Though it is vexing that the Alliance's greatest general cannot join us on the front lines.
Claude: We should be glad that Holst is staying behind. Almyra aside, there's also no guarantee that the Imperial forces won't try to launch a surprise attack from the old Kingdom territory.
Hilda: Um... If you have something you need to talk to my brother about, I'd be happy to send a letter.
Claude: No, that's OK. I'm just glad to hear he's doing well. Please send him my regards.
