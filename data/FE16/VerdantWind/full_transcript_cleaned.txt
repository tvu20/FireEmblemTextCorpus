claudes plan to call in almyran forces succeeds and the alliance army captures fort merceus before they can celebrate their victory javelins of light rain down from the sky and destroy the fort forced to temporary evacuate the alliance army regroups at garreg mach until it is ready to march on enbarr the imperial capital
its almost time to invade the imperial capital we still dont know where rhea is but if shes alive shes likely in enbarr hopefully we manage to find her without too much trouble
we need to save her quickly
i know but if were not careful shell just be whisked away again
i wonder if shes alive
if the empire has some reason to keep rhea alive then shes alive
im sure you must be anxious to see her again
i need to see her again
i understand you need to see rhea again so you can figure out who you really are
all i care about right now is saving her
well if thats what you want ill do my best to make it happen
but were going up against edelgard here  it wont be so simple
our next stop is the imperial capital weve sure come a long way
whatre you talking about this is garreg mach its where we started
i didnt mean literally raphael i was speaking symbolically
my earnest desire to protect the alliance has carried me this far it will not fail me i am sure the rest of you all have your own reasons to fight as well of course i understand that the fight will not end until we defeat the empire  and now the time has arrived at long last to march on the imperial capital and defeat the emperor 
it really gets you thinking doesnt it we all come from different places and have different goals and dreams but thanks to those two we were all able to come together and overcome all sorts of challenges
you are referring to claude and the professor i assume even within our own odd group those two are particularly unusual
oh so you are aware that youre odd
well  thats  it was simply a figure of speech i am speaking about claude and the professor right now
theyre like the wind and the trees 
huh claude and the professor are what does that even mean and who is which
oh um  i was just thinking that if were the birds then those two are like the trees and the wind the professor is a great tree that kindly embraces us and watches over us as we perch on its branches  and claude is like the wind pushing us forward as we soar across the open sky 
hm the metaphor about the professor is solid but i think claude just blows us around on a whim still we owe him a lot
i think thats beautiful marianne i can really picture it when the war is over id love to paint a picture of those two oh and of all the people weve fought with as well
you mean like a historical painting i like that maybe our descendants will look at it a long long time from now 
i must say that piques my interest i look forward to seeing how you portray my valiant efforts
when you put it that way we may be witnessing one of the greatest events in fódlans history its a lot of pressure but the sense of duty i feel is even stronger than the fear
im just happy to be here with all of you i wont get scared no matter what we face
we have our goal enbarr the imperial capital lets get to work
my friend the reinforcements the lords sent are finally gathering truth be told fort merceus wouldve made for a better base of operation but that weird pillar of light changes things its pretty scary honestly  i wonder what it is 
the rage of the goddess
well that is how the legend goes in ailell if it really was the rage of the goddess lets do our best not to enrage her even further
some kind of magic
makes sense but whatever it was ive never seen destructive power quite like it i wonder where it came from 
a natural phenomenon
you think its natural what the planet just up and decided to take a shot at the fort i dunno teach
well i guess pondering it is a waste of energy for now lets just get ready to move out the capital is edelgards domain so she has the advantage its going to be a tough battle
i was taught from a young age to believe that the creed of seiros was just the way of the world to question it never even occurred to me but claude and edelgard are different they challenge the common wisdom even defy it it is uncomfortable to discard familiar assumptions but that is an essential quality of the visionary indeed true greatness must lie beyond common sense hmm thats good i should write that down
were heading up to enbarr next i hope i make it back safe so i can tell my little sis about it i hear they got a neat opera house there where manuela used to perform what was it called again
mitreflanc opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
mittlefrank opera company
ah thats the one
mildewplank opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
my little sis always goes on about how much shed like to see em perform i know we cant see a show but do you think we could at least see the building
were about to put the finishing touches on this war i wonder how fódlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction i cant wait to see it on the other hand im terrified of what the future might hold who knows if ill survive the assault on the capital
invading the capital and smashing the empire i wonder if doing so could really end this war care to share your thoughts professor
i think itll end the war
you say that with such confidence i want to believe that its true
i dont know
perhaps you feel similarly to me the whole mess puts me on edge
although for now better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand
if we can win this war then claude will be the king of fódlan and  maybe hell tear down the wall that separates fódlan from the outside world
perhaps he will
perhaps he wont
i know its hard to imagine  but i really hope he does it would be so much better if people could live together instead of apart i might even be able to live an ordinary life in the world claude envisions 
fighting in the capital ugh and were fighting against edelgard double ugh but with you leading us professor i know well win yeah wahoo fighting im a little scared to be honest im just shouting to relieve the tension but ill be fine
were finally going to the capital this will be my chance to avenge captain jeralt once we smash the empire im sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace
i think youre right
who can say for sure
monica killed captain jeralt for the flame emperor and the flame emperor was edelgard i know that the future of all fódlan rests on this battle nothing else is more important but for me this is personal for captain jeralts sake im going to give it all ive got and more
professor at last the end is nigh i love the empire part of me wants it to survive but i know that is not reasonable the empires time has come what we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild fódlan and rule it as a single nation nonetheless it saddens me that we will not have an adrestian emperor 
they used to call enbarr the city of seiros  to assault it together with the knights is surreal if seiros were alive today i wonder what she might make of our war  in enbarr there was once a southern church and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it a hundred years ago the southern church became entangled in an insurrection until five years ago the empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another
its such a relief that weve made it this far without having to fight my father
youll have to face him at some point
hey dont try and scare me
it sounds like youre scared
you bet im scared the imperial army hasnt lost a single battle with my father on the field
if he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault we might lose i better make my peace with that
professor my um my mother might be in the city i dont have many good memories of her if im being honest but shes dearer to me than my father if you happen to see her please make sure shes not caught up in all the fighting shes only a civil servant so hopefully she takes a cue from her bernie and stays inside
the whole of the capital is going to be a battleground the city has such a long heritage  even so perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once but we cant let the commonfolk get hurt we should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town
five years ago edelgard said a thing to me brigid is a vassal of the empire but she also said i always have the freedom to be choosing whether i am with or not with her i will become the ruler of brigid so she said i must make my own path so now my path and her path will be colliding
the death knight is no ordinary knight i will prey upon him i will quench my blades thirst with his blood his focus is on fighting you im sure but mine will be the last face he sees
those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in fort merceus think what might have happened if theyd have hit us during the battle at gronder field assuming it was the work of the imperial army 
so enbarr the capital of the empire its finally time i never thought id live this long its like any battle really  stay calm stay focused dont give in to your enemy or your own fear
you seem more serious than usual
hey im always serious when im chasing girls or preparing for battle always serious thats me 
well get through this together
striking down the empire is my offering to his highness heh i left the kingdom  what am i saying
its been so long since ive been to the imperial capital i used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother i never thought my return would be like this 
enbarr  never in my wildest dreams did i imagine id be returning like this of course most of the nobles in the empire make their home in the capital in the kingdom all nobles live in their own domains so if the capital is attacked it doesnt necessarily affect them directly what will happen to the imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield
once this battle is over what will become of faerghus and fódlan
peace will reign
peace you say it sounds so foreign so unattainable but maybe just maybe
what would you like to see happen
my hope is for a world at peace a world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past the stuff of legends
i believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new better world so the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil the better we must win professor there is no alternative here i wont allow for anything else
rhea will be somewhere in the city i wonder if she can sense us coming if we are able to save her then i expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you are you prepared for that
i am
excellent
i dont think im ready yet
that is unfortunate well you must become ready
the battle will soon be upon us let us both be at our best for what is to come
i was born in enbarr my mother and father met in a church there not too long after i was brought into the world i do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place it is most regrettable
enbarrs streets are paved with unhappy memories professor ive avoided the damned place ever since i abandoned my nobility swore never to return now here we are to return in this manner  well i cant say it is something i ever imagined
in the opera actors came and went all the time but the people behind the scenes would stay forever ill bet id know a few of them now even after all these years
here we are facing the final battle with the empire its been a long difficult struggle we have to get lady rhea back and we have to crush the empire in the name of captain jeralt i dont know what comes next but we can sort out those details later
looks like were nearing the end of this struggle im sure lady rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her
probably
i was just kidding pay me no mind
i doubt it
oof  you dont mince your words try being a bit more mindful of other peoples feelings
lady rheas not waiting for me i know no matter how much i might wish she were shes waiting for you
ten years ago dagda and brigid attacked the empire from the west the final target was the capital but they were countered at a port town long before they reached their destination i guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs all things considered
whenever i think about how well be seeing lady rhea real soon i get happy and really get cleaning well get there for sure right well see her again
well meet her for sure
we dont know for sure
i got gotta believe lady rhea is waiting for us in the capital  we just have to find her
nader the undefeated  with a name like that hes bound to put up a damn good fight did you get a good look at judith she practically had hearts floating out of her eyeballs when she looked at nader
she must be in love
you saw it too heh i know that look well shes got it bad honestly theyd make a cute couple
im not so sure about that
pretty dense arent ya trust me pal no ones seen more heart eyed women than this guy shes got it bad
thats ridiculous
pretty dense arent ya trust me pal no ones seen more heart eyed women than this guy shes got it bad
it makes all the sense even seasoned warriors arent immune to love pal
that nardel guy  or nader i suppose it was all some trick and we fell for it hmph i dont think the nickname the undefeated applies is he flees from us though  maybe he only got that name by running away cant be defeated if you run off right
greetings professor nothing to report momentums really picking up for this final battle huh even im starting to feel tense me enbarrs history goes back 1400 years that even predates the founding of the empire its one of the sacred sites of the seiros faith so its a pretty big deal but hey no need to worry about the monastery while youre fighting the final battle ive got it covered ill defend it to my last
after making preparations at garreg mach the alliance army marches to enbarr the imperial capital in response to the alliances movements emperor edelgard orders her trusted retainer hubert as well as the death knight to the front lines to meet the alliance army head on the two forces clash in the city streets
vastly outnumbered by imperial forces it becomes clear that a surprise attack followed by a short and decisive battle is the only path to victory with this in mind you stealthily approach enbarr the imperial capital
there it is  enbarr the imperial capital and the largest city in all of fódlan
its not just big this city was designed to protect the castle where the emperor lives its as though the city itself is a massive stronghold
and the citizens
what is the state of affairs in the town
they surely noticed us approaching some time ago and yet 
our scouts confirmed the citizens havent been evacuated theyre being kept in town
ive got to hand it to her imperial majesty using her citizens as a shield to protect the castle takes some resolve
i suspect those mages will be lurking within as well 
troops deployed to other areas are also returning
if we dont conquer the city quickly things will get complicated fast
i hope we find rhea 
we cant search until we conquer the city lets focus on the fight for now
lady rhea please be safe
weve kept the empire waiting long enough onward
we were told hubert would be leading the enemy forces but the death knights also with them well have to take care of both of them but we wont have time to mop up all the enemy units well have to split up and take them on at the same time or risk being overrun by their reinforcements
its here the crest of flames banner there on the other side of the canal
uninvited guests i see heh lets ensure they receive a warm welcome ready the artillery prepare to attack rocks arrows magic   rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave reinforcements will fly in shortly defend the heavy weapons until they arrive
our first wave of reinforcements is here it will not be long until the next
reinforcements that was quick  we cant hang around or theyll just keep coming well have to capture the artillery we can turn them against their reinforcements 
we have reinforcements coming in from another direction deploy them as soon as they arrive
ok just hubert left to deal with 
we are taking heavy losses we need more troops 
well done everyone now we can break through into enbarr we need to hurry up and attack the palace to block edelgards movements
its over lapdog your military rule is at its end
for every step you take along that path our thorns will cut into your heels
ooh that sounds painful ill have to wear thicker soles for the march
if your boots are too heavy you wont be able to lift your feet but enough prattle
you will not escape death knight today you will be unmasked
my true identity has no value
i will be the judge of that once ive seen your face
so its you death knight remember me
you again here to lose more blood
never you will not lay a hand on me ever again
hey how longs it been five years whod have thought youd end up an imperial general 
so you wish to die
heh as antisocial and unhinged as ever i see
i came here to get you lets return together emile
leave the place of your death is not here
weve made it this far  somehow edelgard is probably looking down on us from somewhere in that castle
i wonder if shes panicking or just smiling smugly 
from this point on shell be giving it her all too expect her to be tougher than the last time we fought this battle will settle things once and for all well attack as soon as everyone is ready
huh is that you dedue
i heard the alliances army has entered the city ive been searching for you ever since
how long have you been in enbarr
i arrived not long after the battle at gronder field i am here to kill edelgard
what are you doing in enbarr
im waiting for a chance to kill edelgard i have not yet been blessed with the opportunity
well if you want to fight alongside us wed be more than happy to have you
we fight for different objectives i swore to offer edelgards head to his highness but  should i fail i will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you this is the information i have gathered during my time in hiding here it includes details about the inside of the castle
i appreciate this but  what do you plan to do dont tell me you plan to do alone
ive done what i came here to do farewell
hey wait hes gone hes just as hard to understand as his liege was
the time has finally come my friend once we win this fight the empire will fall 
what will become of fódlan
what will become of it well thats for us to decide isnt it
what will we do about fódlan
the subject is heavy on my mind
odd as it sounds i believe the forces responsible for destroying fódlan are also responsible for protecting the livelihood of its citizens everything even the land itself has been harmed by the chaos of war restoring it will be no easy feat to do that the first thing we need to think about is a new ruling system for all of fódlan
the alliance lords could divide the territory
no i dont think that would work the western half of the continent has little connection to the alliance any attempt to force dominion on them would breed rebellion the world would slide back into war once again
we could unify fódlan as one nation
as usual were on the same page i was thinking the same thing
even if the alliance lords and any remaining influential nobles were to divide up dominion of all of fódlan  they would simply pursue their own interests another war would be inevitable thats why there needs to be a powerful ruler who stands above them all and unifies fódlan as one nation
you should be that ruler claude
if it means i can lead fódlan to a better future i wouldnt mind that at all
we must search for a new ruler
a new ruler huh i think ive got someone in mind
i should be that ruler
 my friend  do you really mean that
my dreams await in a future where fódlan is no longer ravaged by war there are things i want to see with you some day ill keep thinking about the best way to achieve that goal whatever we decide to do we cant do it until we defeat the empire fódlan cant welcome a new dawn until we win the war lets prepare as best we can
/***EOF***/
claiming the monastery at garreg mach as its home base the alliance army joins forces with the knights of seiros together they begin to take up arms against the adrestian empire
good work hilda you didnt do much manual labor but you managed to rope the knights into helping us restore the monastery
thanks claude but all i did was piggyback on your scheme i saw your eyes telling me to make some magic happen
thank you so much for your help with the restoration
oh please it was nothing were just doing our part as former students
im told you even routed the bandits that job should have fallen to us im sorry for the trouble
hey dont think twice about it were all allies in the resistance against the empire right
the church is at war with the empire but lets be realistic wouldnt it be better for the alliance to eventually submit
the way i see it the emperor wants to take over all of fódlan and destroy the existing order of the world i cant see her allowing the alliance to continue to exist were in this just as deeply as you are actually  we were hoping to use this place as a base the empire begs to be meddled with and were first in line
what why would you want to make your base here of all places
garreg mach is situated in the center of fódlan both geographically and spiritually we want to secure this location while the empire is still overlooking it
i see the empire doesnt see this place as important at the moment because its far from the front lines
but if we simply decide that its ours to occupy that does nothing to inspire the hearts and minds of the people of fódlan luckily good ol teach has finally returned to us if the professor rhea entrusted with the sword of the creator fights at our side  well now thats a just cause anyone could get behind whats more here we are working alongside the legendary knights of seiros it smacks of divine providence doesnt it can you feel it
i have heard what you have to say claude and you professor where do you stand
i will fight the empire
hm on our own we lack sufficient military strength but with the help of the alliance 
i will find rhea
hm we are at a relative standstill but with the help of the alliance 
the archbishop said if anything should happen to her that we should entrust the affairs of the church to you if you intend to fight alongside the alliance then i will follow you as well is that acceptable claude
of course i cant think of anything more reassuring than having both teach and the knights on our side together well stop the emperor and her reckless ambitions
hey there my friend its funny how the monastery was once in ruins but now its downright bustling thanks to a little promise five years ago our buddies have all gathered and even the knights have returned its like we were all just waiting for you to awaken and now were all going to band together against the imperial army you should go and talk to everyone if you can there may be some who are still on the fence
i have written to my father to signal my intention to remain here not that i require his approval to do so there is not much for me to gain by returning to alliance territory now but by staying i will be able to influence the course of events directly on the field of battle
will you get along with the alliance leader
we will not be friends but i will cooperate with him as much as is necessary to secure victory
will you keep an eye on the alliance leader
naturally someone needs to make certain he does not lead the alliance to ruin
fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true professor and dont worry about my little sis right now shes back home helping out with the family business i kinda figured i was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her but thanks to you and claude i get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight
its been fixed up quite a bit but its battle scars arent so easily erased  to think that a glorious cathedral with a thousand year history  would end up like this ill rebuild this place someday this cathedral is the symbol of fódlan maybe i should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old while i still remember what it looked like 
ive grown weary and impatient   these past five years my hands have been bound but now i can finally take action with a clear goal im grateful to you and to everyone
i didnt do anything
nonsense your presence steeled everyones resolve
and that goal is
down with the empire surely peace will soon follow if the empire is overthrown then my parents can finally find peace themselves
even with the church in shambles we can still pray the goddess will surely hear our prayers but still  i hope the church can return to its former beauty someday
im pretty headstrong but claude could give me a run for my money i mean hes dragged the knights into this you ought to be careful professor
ill be fine
i wonder if youve got a hidden headstrong side you must be hiding it really well though
you too
dont worry about me im here because i want to be also because being around my big brother feels like a real chore
its not just for my village that im fighting alongside you here you know its also that captain jeralt asked me his first and greatest apprentice to look out for you of course it wouldnt be enough just to keep you alive its my duty to make sure you win too so do your best professor and count on me to watch your back
i have lost my dominion my nobility may seem like nothing more than a title but i will never lose my noble heart i will stop edelgard even if it costs me my life i have turned my blade against her now i cannot go back on that decision professor  do you think i chose the wrong path
not at all
well find out soon enough
you are right 
the promise was made five years ago but i must say im rather surprised how many of us managed to make it personally i only showed up because i hoped to see you again professor ive been with my family in the empire until recently i admit to feeling a little guilty betraying her majesty but only a little now that were all together again i suppose the fighting will begin soon
hey professor you wont believe what happened i figured i couldnt go back to the empire after garreg mach fell so i started drifting across the kingdom and alliance then i just happened to run into our old class so we came back to the monastery together
ah at last i return to my domain my lonely paradise my realm of exquisite solitude huh professor is that um is that you you um you didnt hear that just now did you
sorry
oh forget you heard anything
hear what
right you didnt well um good
laaa la laaa la laaa  professor oh my its so good to see you these days so many old friends seem to be disappearing but you  youre here its incredible to see you again after five years i have a feeling your name will go down in history
edelgard is controlling the empire she is putting the pressure on the kingdom and alliance empire and religion are at open war it will be  difficult for us at first but corrupt nobles are many that means the common people will rebel and be joining our side with you professor the battle tides will ah will turn i have certainty
a country with no king has no future thats why i made my way here professor dont let me down
country with no king
hmph youll understand soon enough
lets forge ahead
yes lets find me a worthy opponent to battle and ill be content
im the heir of house gautier and im fighting alongside a bunch of alliance people i can just imagine my fathers face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me i dont know how standing and fighting for faerghus would have helped sorry professor i dont regret my decisions im just thinking out loud and im hoping i havent made a big mistake
youre here professor along with everyone from our old class its like weve gone back in time when i think that ill be around you again all of my sorrows just drift away
frankly i dont feel too happy
hmm i understand especially with lady rhea missing it sounds like the kingdom and empire have been in a sorry state too but we cant let that get us down
lets do our best together
hmm yes ill at least try not to hold anyone back
lets work together for the common good like we did five years ago
members of the knights tell me that father left their ranks five years ago they say he announced he was returning to the kingdom but nobodys heard from him since i havent received word that he went back to mother  where could he be  where are you father 
professor i have a proposal why not go beyond the knights of seiros instead uniting with allies from all across fódlan to fight for our cause looking back it would have been best to ally with the kingdom and join forces against the empire but now the kingdom is not exactly  well 
five long years ive searched for you and the archbishop its a pleasure to see you again the church of seiros will follow you from now on but please do not abandon the search for lady rhea
well do whatever it takes to find her
thank you i know the battles ahead will be dire but we will support you with all our strength
we dont know what the future will bring
wherever she is rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you please do not let her down
professor i am so glad you are unharmed no matter the path you walk i will be with you every step of the way anything you ask of me i shall see it through you saved my life and i am in your debt
thankfully it appears the records and equipment i need for my research have not been damaged i am most curious though you say you were asleep for five whole years incredible perhaps this is another effect of your crest i do look forward to investigating you in greater detail
we can talk about that
wonderful news i am most excited to begin we must find the time of course
uh maybe later 
ill have to be content with observing you wherever you go then i cannot waste any opportunity
my professor you havent changed a bit at your age id expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years  though i suppose i havent changed either right thank you for noticing by the way ah just the two of us forever young oh let me have my fun
id given up on ever seeing you again where have you been hiding anyway now that were reunited in the land of the living i must fulfill my promise
what promise
the promise i made to the captain to keep you safe i cant believe youve forgotten how cold 
right the promise
thats right i promised the captain id protect you in his stead and now ill make good on my word
in lady rheas absence i will follow you thats what she would want me to do know that wherever you might lead us ill continue searching for lady rhea
thats fine
good because i will not budge on that point welcome back professor
sounds like a lot of trouble
i dont care how much trouble it is i will rescue lady rhea at all costs
im more of a mercenary than a knight these days i work to get paid i never was too attached to fódlan i was considering leaving soon  but i might change my mind if youre around
i dont know anything about rebuilding but i can sure do my best to clean up the mess im gonna keep lady rheas room spotless so she can use it right away whenever she gets back you gotta find her professor you just gotta
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report you know its such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again i almost died as well in the battle five years ago but i wont allow any enemies to get into this place again i promise you that even if the death knight shows up ill be sure to  well for now ill keep training so i can eventually feel confident that i can stop him
everyone listen up i have a proposal we are now building our forces in order to rise up against the imperial army but it wouldnt be smart for us to fight under the banner of the alliance that would only incite the lords who support the empire weve also combined forces with the knights of seiros therefore i suggest that we operate under a new symbol thats why ive prepared this 
you may recognize it as the crest of flames which resides in teach the phantom crest that has reappeared after more than 1000 years were attempting our own miracle so it seems like a suitable symbol for us so  until we welcome the dawn of a new age in fódlan  lets fight to the very end as one under the symbol of the crest of flames
impressive claude forget restoring the monastery youve somehow roped everyone into fighting back against the empire
if you recall i never asked anyone to join us if anything we have teachs achievements to thank now that you mention it i guess i should express my gratitude
hey friend so this is where youve been without you the knights never would have joined our cause i could never pay you back for that
youre welcome
lets do our best
just leave it to me teach when this fight is over i plan to see all of my dreams come to fruition and yours as well
what are you dreams claude
well for example  to bust open fódlans throat theres a massive fortress there which is responsible for protecting the eastern border of the alliance i like to think of it as a lid on a bottle the people of fódlan only know a small part of the world their prejudices are born because they dont know what lies beyond their borders and the opposite is true too those outside of fódlan dont know about this place ignorance breeds discrimination whether you look inside the bottle or outside of it  if you really look all you find are people who you can get along with if you only try thats why i wanna bust open that lid which is keeping us locked inside or destroy the bottle entirely
are you going to tell our allies about this
ill find the right time to bring it up even if i talked about it now it doesnt seem realistic does it first we need to defeat the empire and restore peace to  huh
professor claude were under attack
i guess well have to cut our conversation short whats going on leonie
its a small group but some imperial troops are headed this way it looks like they were stationed nearby
i got to hand it to edelgard nothing gets past that woman
we should proceed cautiously
as long as we dont let our guard down theres no way they can defeat us
lets take them down
all right ill show you how much ive improved professor
this will be our first battle alongside the knights of seiros lets kick off our new partnership with a magnificent victory
though plans to resist the empire are still being devised by the alliance army the imperial army has already anticipated their next move an imperial vanguard just outside garreg mach led by general randolph begins to advance with the aim of toppling the monastery once again
fulfilling a promise made five years ago your former students gather once more at the monastery as do the knights however your joyful reunion is cut short 
the knights of seiros are a powerful enemy but we have more soldiers well take them down all at once
so the enemy intends to use their overwhelming numbers to defeat us lets fight fire with  actual fire
report the enemy has entered the periphery of garreg mach
if they reach the interior the enemy will take the monastery drive them back immediately
what that strange battle flag is  but isnt our enemy the church of seiros
they didnt have enough soldiers with just the church so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues it doesnt matter what flag they fly theyre nothing more than a mob well destroy them all
allied soldiers are making preparations for the plan protect them
what the fire attack unit was routed damn it my brilliant plan failed
it looks like they were planning something but it failed
were prepared for the fire attack now we just need to draw the enemys attention you cant defeat us with that many soldiers the imperial army is doomed without a capable general
quiet dont think youll get away with mocking me attack make sure they never speak again
now
argh a fire attack  the damage is too great we cant fight anymore all units retreat ill take on our pursuers carry away the injured soldiers
if we let them escape theyll come back to attack later we have to take them out
a total loss  but we cant just return home like this 
teach look out theyre after your head
phew nice work we won without much incident thanks to all of you
i dont think the empire will leave us alone now what do you plan to do
i intend to ask the alliance lords to share some troops with us to bolster our forces
i will speak plainly no matter whom we beseech for reinforcements our envoys will inevitably pass through gloucester territory my father is being cautious not to give the empire a pretext to intervene therefore he is unlikely to allow even envoys to pass through
why not request reinforcements from the kingdom
ah  i guess i havent told you yet teach the kingdom isnt in a position to be sending anyone reinforcements after losing king lambert during the tragedy of duscur a regent had been handling its politics but then  there was a bloody coup the regent and prince dimitri both  apparently the whole family was killed all blaiddyd territory including the kingdom capital is being ruled by those who are cooperating with the empire the kingdom is no more its not called the faerghus dukedom the vast majority of the former kingdom lords bent a knee to the overwhelming power of the empire and the dukedom and now fall under their jurisdiction
some who formerly held power are continuing to resist but it would be difficult for them to regain it
oh hey i can think of one person who we can ask for reinforcements someone whose territory is really close and whos on good terms with claude 
ah the hero of daphnel i presume
ive seen her before and she does seem to be reliable
youre talking about judith right i bet she would lend us a hand 
she seems intimidating
she seems strong
thats right youve met her once before teach shes a fearsome one woman army she did a lot for me even before i was recognized as the heir to house riegan i dont like the idea of owing her more than i already do but given the situation sacrifices must be made ill reach out to her as for the rest of you prepare for our next battle
heya teach how are you feeling does anything feel um  strange at all
nothing in particular
good i still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes but maybe thats not a concern now that youve spent five long years napping
i feel a bit sluggish
well you were asleep for five whole years after all itll probably take time to get you back to top form though im relieved to see you havent lost a step as far as combat goes
your command bringing my schemes to life  thats just how we fight best
any word from judith
not yet but theres no need to worry that woman adores me once weve bolstered our forces itll finally be time to start taking decisive action but i wonder  do you really think rhea is still alive
shes alive
i think so too its hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret
i dont know
theres no telling but its also hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret
i wonder where she is and what shes doing 
do you hope shes alive
all i know is that i still have a lot of questions i need to ask her
do you hope shes dead
thats a dangerous question teach to be honest ive given it a lot of thought all i know is that i still have a lot of questions i need to ask her
about the true history of crest stones and heroes relics  and the truth behind the legend of seiros and nemesis she has secrets too many of them for my comfort considering the state of the world  its suspicious you must be curious about what was done to you and what her plans were for you right and you never did learn about your mother did you none of our doubts will ever be clear unless we hear these answers from rhea herself in that sense i absolutely hope rhea is still alive but as far as fódlan goes i do wonder what a world without rhea would look like
a world without rhea
the majority of people in fódlan believe in the seiros faith that rhea preaches thats why they accept the noble system as if it were the only option and refuse to associate with those who believe in anything else that closed minded philosophy is the reason why fódlans throat is locked tight but if you remove the archbishop who strictly advocates that doctrine that world view is no longer absolute theres room for free thought the leadership of the church would undoubtedly fall to you and you would hold the power to change the shape of the faith of the world then for the first time people would truly be free to think for themselves to decide whats right and whats wrong honestly i believe edelgard is probably hoping to achieve something very similar but her methods require too much bloodshed thats not something the world can get behind anyway  the best thing we can do is find rhea and hear what she has to say heh oops  i guess ive been going on for a while now sorry about that you should get some rest
/***EOF***/
the alliance army successfully rendezvous with judith in ailell with the addition of house daphnels forces the time has come to invade empire territory
preparations are complete now its a game of patience as they say good things come to those who wait
care to elaborate on this plan of yours claude can we really do this without battling my father
pretty soon count gloucester will need to gather his troops in the northern part of his territory
against the kingdom
the kingdom has experience constant infighting since the coup theyre out of the picture for now
against houses riegan and daphnel
you got it teach
the combined forces of the riegan and daphnel houses will threaten the northern part of the gloucester territory nardel that retainer i mentioned is going to draw their attention
well take that opportunity to make our way through gloucester territory and launch a surprise attack on the great bridge of myrddin
and are you not concerned about the possibility that i may tip off my father
the future of the alliance rests on this battle im certain you wont betray us
hmph i will ensure our success
i know you will if we win this fight then our next goal will be to topple enbarr the imperial capital i said before that my plan was to meddle with the empire but im going to do you one better we are going to defeat the empire once and for all but to do that we cant afford to slip up here bear that in mind and prepare yourselves for the coming battle
if our plan succeeds well arrive at the great bridge of myrddin unscathed the important part is what happens next were evenly matched in terms of military power more or less so if we can just launch a surprise attack 
we have the advantage
i wouldnt be so sure that bridge is almost like a fortress the defense there is rock solid
it could go either way
agreed the bridge is basically a fortress so the defense will be rock solid
well still be at a disadvantage
ill give you that the bridge is basically a fortress i wouldnt say were at a loss but we certainly shouldnt rest easy
but thats why youre here teach no matter the odds youre the wild card we need to win
i would like to believe that i have always made my own decisions even so i cannot deny that some small part of me has always been aware of my fathers wishes now here i am concealing our plan   claudes plan   from his sight
are you having second thoughts
no the strategy is sound and ive consented to it
youre not reluctant though are you
quite the contrary honestly i feel as though a fog has finally lifted from my eyes
in this fight i will finally stand upon my own two feet independent of my fathers influence
thanks to all that food from judith im full for once ive got so much energy let me at that great bridge of myrddin ill bust it down myself oh but then how do we cross
the great bride of myrddin isnt just a bridge it has the features of a fortress i believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the adrestian empire in other words its even older than the monastery so if we occupy the great bridge well have to search it from top to bottom
im sure you know this already but house ordelia is aligned with the empire they face the empire from across a river similar to the gloucesters even so i refuse to yield to the empire a second time the empire did unthinkable things to my family and to me the only option here is winning professor you must promise we will overcome the empire
legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged ailell i was reminded of that when i saw it  um professor do you think those legends are true
its likely
i think so too i dont know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger but 
yes and itll likely happen again
oh i suppose you may be right theres no way to be sure it wont 
theres still so many things we dont understand in this world
it looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town i guess they feel safe now that you and the knights of seiros have returned peddlers have become more common too so therell be food and supplies available after being run down for all those years its really becoming livable again
things have gotten a lot more interesting since weve joined up with judith havent they anyone who casually treats claude like hes just some kid is not a person to be trifled with i think captain jeralt would have liked her i hope someday i can be as strong kind and levelheaded as her
what used to be aegir territory lies far to the east of the great bridge of myrddin downstream of the airmid river for the sake of my family i wish we could invade the empire from there but i do not have the power to advocate for that strategically myrddin is more important
someday well take it back
thank you professor i will not give in not until i have restored my noble pride
taking it back would be difficult
yes i know it would be difficult but i will not give in
since im originally from the empire it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks fine by me honestly id bet theyre watching my every move to make sure i can be trusted
im sure theyre not 
if i were leading the alliance its what i would do
probably
i knew it war makes people crazy huh
the airmid river separates the empire and alliance its the largest river in fódlan sometimes itll flood when theres lots of rain but  at least the land gets some extra water
war isnt kind to you if youre a recluse by the time you realize whats going on youre already under attack and if youre off by yourself you can get killed with no one ever even finding out
sounds like youre learning
isnt that a little pessimistic
oh thatd be awful just terrible ok professor i get it i know ill have to come out
were going to invade the empire which means well be fighting people we know wont we if were attacked by someone we know or used to think of as a friend it is permitted to run away
no its not ok
makes sense a commander running away would be terrible for morale
i wouldnt blame you
really if something happens will you keep me safe
if we can suppress this myrddin we can invade into the empire right i was in the empire now i will be an enemy  i am having strange feelings it is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy 
we can predict what the empire will do faerghus is our real problem the eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the dukedom but ive heard nothing about that conflict as of late its strange i havent heard much from my father either i cant help but find this silence unsettling 
its thanks to you that im here now i owe you professor you saved my life i swear ill do all i can to repay that debt
i had an encounter with lord gwendal  how many years ago was it back before the academy i met this girl who i fell madly in love with and her dad tried to kill me i suppose he just tried to scare me but i was sure i was going to die oh yeah her dad lord gwendal crazy right i never thought id seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle i kind of dont know how to make sense of it
lady rhea is in the empire isnt she we should hurry up and find her so many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried i want to ease their minds as soon as possible professor lets work together to find her
next we face the great bridge of myrddin  we actually crossed it a long time ago do you remember it was five whole years ago
during the battle of the eagle and lion
it seems like so long ago doesnt it its odd how fast time flies 
when we went to remire village
what are you talking about professor it was on the way to the battle of the eagle and lion
everyone was still friends then after the fighting we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses but now were fighting the same people who were our friends back then  even ashe  i often wish we could go back to those peaceful days 
so that was judith just as id heard of her she was an upstanding person the same daphnel blood runs through my veins and yet i feel as though i am nothing like her i am a phantom of what could be 
youre actually quite alike
 you think so wow thank you
true you do differ
if only i could be half of who she is
if rhea really is in the empire then we must defeat the imperial army by any means necessary the people at large are just as concerned for rheas safety as we are the sooner we can settle all our unease the better
judith is a wonderful person so strong and confident as well looking upon her i am sharply reminded of my mother
does she look similar
not in the slightest rather it is her way of being   her demeanor brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
does she act similar
very much so both brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
i  lost my mother long ago i miss her desperately
the battle at ailell was a tactical marvel you grow stronger with each passing day where does your talent end and your crests power begin are they one and the same i wonder most intriguing yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions given the situation it is quite unfortunate i did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out so much unknown now i fear i will not have those answers even by conflicts end so very frustrating
oh hello there professor did you need something from me it doesnt look like youre wounded or anything you just looking for  someone to talk to
yes
i thought so well im here for you making you feel better is my top priority
no
come on now you dont have to be shy helping you feel better is important to me
whether its physical pain or worries of the heart you can come to me for anything professor
so lady rhea was in the empire all this time glad as i am that judith told us i wish we had known this five years ago we spent all that time spread out over fódlan searching for the archbishop and you it was a mistake to abandon the monastery to leave it in ruins now were paying for that mistake
id heard of the hero of daphnel but that was the first time ive met her in person shes the head of a prestigious noble family just like claude the alliance nobility is so  odd
you dont think she acts like a noble
is it different in the kingdom and empire
kind of but i dont mean that in a bad way you wont find such big hearted nobles elsewhere plus judith can drink with the best of em a woman after my own heart
five years ago when the imperial army attacked garreg mach they moved with incredible speed but in the middle of all that chaos she still had operatives watching the hero of daphnels spy network is impressive she shouldnt be taken lightly
is it true lady rhea was dragged off by the imperial army i heard that was true whyd they take lady rhea professor  they didnt take her to kill her did they
i dont think so
thats good we just gotta beat the imperial army and get her back right
they probably havent killed her
yeah good point if they did wed have heard about it by now
you gotta help her professor im begging ya
i dont know where he recruited that man but claudes got an eye for great talent im talking about his retainer nardel ive only spoken with him briefly but he seems to have a fair amount of both brains and brawn with the skills to match but theres something about him i cant quite place  like ive somehow heard of him before 
greetings professor nothing to report i was talking to some of the daphnel soldiers earlier and it seems that judith has a weakness but they wouldnt tell me what it is i got the feeling they didnt appreciate the question pardon me for being curious that said maybe keep this to yourself not that she terrifies me to my soul but id hate to get on her bad side 
the great bridge of myrddin is in sight beyond it the empire
whaddya know there arent bridges that big in almyra thats for sure 
how unsettling there are bridges in the southern part of ordelia territory but nothing like this
its the most strategic location in that area to move a large army across the airmid river the empire will want to hold on to it at all costs so expect tough defenses
lets finish this quickly
youre right the enemys guard should be down so lets end this quickly before they have a chance to retaliate
lets proceed with caution
youre right the defenses are pretty impenetrable lets make our move carefully
youre in command teach do whatever it takes to win well other than sacrificing the lives of our allies for the sake of victory try to avoid that lets get moving were counting on you my friend
sights set on the imperial capital the alliance army chooses to march through the territory of house gloucester   supporters of the empire under the command of nardel the retainer of house riegan the defensive forces of house riegan and daphnel draw out the gloucester troops thus the alliance army can continue its march towards the great bridge of myrddin and cross the airmid river which separates the alliance and the empire
after fending off the empire your forces decide its time to advance but first you must capture the great bridge of myrddin a strategic crossing point over the airmid river which borders the alliance and the empire
that symbol  its an enemy raid stay calm and face them head on send a messenger to acheron immediately if were quick we might be able to pull off a pincer attack
they say the enemy general ladislava is among edelgards most trusted lets see what shes got
our goal is to take down ladislava and gain control of the bridge lets go
you think well let you take this bridge from us
whoa new enemies from the central fortress by the looks of it that might not be all of them
acheron nows the time to show your loyalty to the empire attack the enemy from behind
ive got to make my name known to her majesty through distinguished service
acheron the weathervane hes of the alliance hes a minor noble who holds territory to the north of myrddin if hes gonna support the empire no need to hold back hes nothing but a nuisance even to the alliance
looks like we can capture this fortress quickly if we take out the soldiers protecting it
enemies approaching get the soldiers standing by to join the fight we may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too protect the fortress
well ally ourselves with the imperial soldiers too
i will leave this area to the reinforcements and then i will swing around to provide support from the south
im glad we defeated them here  i doubt theyre an enemy we could win against twice
the declining alliance will be finished if i kill you the empire will herald the new age
only if you manage to kill me hm whats that to the north looks like the home of another opportunistic noble is burning 
thats  thats my castle no
thats the declining alliance at work right there seems like you were facing the wrong way weathervane
well done everyone the great bridge of myrddin is ours
i was prepared for bloodshed but that was more than expected  i guess im still not used to this
even our enemies were fighting for their own cause they held out without fleeing until the bitter end 
you dont have to get used to it
that is true i wouldnt want to become the type of person who feels nothing when someone dies
we must overcome this
yes  we cant afford to stall here
now its on me to return to alliance territory and convince those lords to join us lorenz would you return home for the time being and lay the groundwork with your father
fine after all this is for the alliance or rather for all of fódlan
for those of you who live in alliance territories i ask that you return to your houses and spread the word about the current situation until we finish our preparations judith and the knights will do everything in their power to defend the great bridge
thats a casual way to dole out such a deadly mission boy
do you object
just who do you think i am i wont let the empire pass this way even if it costs me my life
too bad youre not allowed to die fight like your life depends on it but flee if youre ever truly in danger
a tall order as always ill use my best discretion claude
we have no objections either go forth and secure us a sufficiently powerful army
ill stay here too the only ones id be going home to are my little sis and my grandpa
are you sure you dont want to see your sister it may be a while before you can return home again
but if i see her i may not want to come back so ill wait till im done here
what about me
ill stay here too
actually id like for you to come with me teach to help negotiate with the lords theyre followers of the church of seiros after all itll make things easier if we have someone there to speak on rheas behalf all right everyone lets meet back at the monastery next month good luck out there
is that you kiddo
i have returned nardel
oh ah master claude its you i mistook you for one of the local children my apologies
it seems you have adjusted to your work here our recent strategy was successful thanks to you
i was a bit concerned when house gonerils army intervened from the east
count gloucester must have requested reinforcements from them
yes and they have that young general who won some acclaim from his battles in almyra  regardless they showed no signs of seriously wishing to attack us and merely fulfilled their obligations to house gloucester
now then  who is this lovely lady
this is my professor who i asked to join me at the roundtable conference teach this is nardel that retainer judith was talking about
nice to meet you
hm how polite ive heard good things about you from master claude
 
youll make me blush if you keep staring like that though i suppose people like me are something of a rarity here
as you can see he wasnt born in fódlan still trust me when i say he is highly capable
true in fact my capability is my only redeeming quality i hope youll continue to look after master claude professor
/***EOF***/
it is imperial year 1185 nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at garreg mach and war continues to plague the lands of fódlan fhirdiad has been captured the holy kingdom of faerghus is in shambles the leicester alliance is on the verge of collapse fractured by two opposing factions those who support the adrestian empire and its ruler and those who seek her demise meanwhile under emperor edelgards rule of law the adrestian empire continues to expand its reach the path to a new fódlan unified by imperial strength may yet be in sight
huh
you overslept teach pretty rude to keep a fella waiting like that wouldnt you say
whats with that surprised look my friend
you didnt really think id given up   on you coming back did you
can you feel it a new dawn is finally here not just for us though no for all of fódlan
its been five long years where have you been teach you dont really expect me to believe that youve been napping this whole time do you
i was sleeping
i dont remember
thats a good one except  thats not your lying face i guess ive got no choice but to believe you youre not exactly normal to begin with so its not a huge stretch to imagine you sleeping for that long aaand this is where you say just kidding right if this is a rib nows the time to fess up
its the truth
you must be insane and yet  fine i believe you ok but that means you dont know anything that happened after your last battle right
i guess its on me to catch you up as you can see garreg mach was crushed by the empire and was never restored the monastery is in ruins and the town is in pretty bad shape too can you guess why
rhea has been sleeping too
huh it would seem thats one possible explanation since you insist thats what youve been up to
rhea has died
her body was never found and the empire never declared that she had been killed so  no telling
all we know for sure is that rhea suddenly vanished during that battle five years ago the knights of seiros have apparently been searching all over fódlan for her  but the fact that this place is still in ruins tells me they still havent found her
we must find her
true ive got a mountain of questions id like to ask her after all
im worried
worried huh well for better or worse rhea was clearly fond of you
but im not so sure whether it would be good for her to return as the archbishop  rather with her gone  eh never mind this could be a dangerous conversation before we discuss the state of affairs in each territory  are you hungry you must be its not much but i did bring some food with me lets eat up and go from there
phew i am stuffed even the most humble of meals tastes great with the right company by the way teach do you remember the night before the ball i know it was five years ago  but we promised that the golden deer house would reunite during the millennium festival todays the day we promised to meet up  but no ones here
its still early
true  theres still some daylight left
they must not like us
heh you know everyone looked up to you right or is this your way of telling me i was a lousy house leader
lets just wait a little longer you never know  maybe someone will show up after all hey teach  just waiting around sounds boring so why dont we get in some exercise you know help with digestion and stuff you must be in bad shape if youve been sleeping for five years itll do you good to get your body moving again
you want to work out
you want to play a game
something like that look if you come with me youll understand oh and dont forget your weapons ok i want to make sure neither your leadership nor your skill with a blade have dulled
in the holy kingdom of faerghus imperialist loyalist cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of blaiddyd to prevent further revolt prince dimitri has been sentenced now the backbone of the former kingdom houses gautier and fraldarius struggle to continue the resistance cornelia operating out of the royal palace has accepted the support of the empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining kingdom forces
in the leicester alliance house riegan leads an anti imperial faction while house gloucester directs the empires supporters despite the undeniable threat of fracture the alliances adept new leader claude deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front
in enbarr the imperial capital of the adrestian empire emperor edelgard fights to strengthen her regime she has extended her reach to the kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western fódlan
in the meantime the knights of seiros have been dispatched to find archbishop rhea who remains missing despite their searching left unattended the monastery at garreg mach has fallen to ruin and become a haven for thieves
the thieves are here apparently theyre trying to run off with treasures from the monastery
what the  intruders protect the goods
this is gonna get expensive collect everything the thieves carried out
the barbarity is even worse than the rumors on my honor as a noble i will expel these ruffians
today was supposed to be a happy day but the monastery is in disrepair 
over there  is that the professor and the others
professor youre alive guess wed better handle this before i celebrate though huh
you finally made it i guess virtue still exists in this crazy world after all
is that the professor and everyone else if theyre fighting i gotta go help
wow its you here i thought you were dead all this time
could that be the professors ghost
hey youre late hurry up and help
hm we could split into two groups if we hit them from the north and south we can trap their leader in a pincer attack
professor boy am i glad to see you how did we end up in this situation
professor its been too long i do want to chat but first lets handle these criminals
youve been alive all this time where have you been hiding never mind   talk later
we have much to discuss but first let us dispense with the riffraff it is a nobles duty after all
ugh the instant we arrive were neck deep in battle we shouldve arrived late
p professor is it really you
is that really you professor its been so long i thought id never see you again
ugh im exhausted what gives professor
i was so excited to see everyone again and then this happens 
im still tired from the long journey how did it come to this
lets all take a moment to catch our breath 
if youve got the time to play with those guys the least you could do is prepare some tea
thanks for your help
we were hoping someone would come to back us up when we started routing the bandits
blame claude
come on those guys were thieves we couldnt just let them get away
it seems theyve been taking advantage of the churchs absence and doing whatever they please here
in any case um  im glad that all of you are well
thats the spirit marianne
that was fun in fact i wouldnt mind romping around some more
so you were alive this whole time professor i am not surprised in fact that is why i came here
and it doesnt look like time has rusted your skills thats a relief
im just glad everyones alive and well on that note lets move this reunion party somewhere else
now that weve dealt with those violent bandits we could potentially use this place as our base of operations again
what could you possibly mean by that
im talking about the leicester alliance taking over garreg mach monastery after all its right in the middle of fódlan its a critical strategic location
are you suggesting that we fight back against the empire
arent you getting a bit ahead of yourself the alliance is in complete discord at present
and as leader of the imperial faction of the alliance isnt count gloucester your father the main cause of that discord
i  yes that is true it was inevitable our houses territory is close to imperial land after all had we not consented to vassalage under the empire they would have invaded immediately
naturally and to be clear i have no problem with your house maintaining its imperial ties until were sufficiently prepared to revolt the empire is the cause of the infighting if we rid ourselves of them the situation should resolve itself thats why im thinking we should make this our base raise up an army and stir up some trouble for the empire
now youre talking sounds like fun
so then mr leader man does this mean you intend to rope us into your little scheme
leader man
hm ah my grandfather passed away that means yours truly is officially the leader of the alliance
if we had a more reliable leader perhaps the alliance would not have been divided 
think what you will all i need to know is if youre in or youre out
im happy to lend a hand i wont let those imperial dogs set foot in alliance territory i couldnt bear it if my village got caught up in the chaos of war
ill fight too ive gotta protect my little sis
i will join as well after all house ordelia was once dragged into an imperial revolt it ruined us
ah of course i understand your motivation
ill fight too  its time to take responsibility for my own future
i  i dont want to run anymore i hope ill be of use to everyone 
we can do anything if we work together marianne
what about you lorenz are you going to go back home to your scary father or what
we cannot rely on claudes scheming to lead us to victory therefore i will remain it is my duty to ensure claude does not worsen the situation in the alliance
all of us are fighting for a different reason but we share a common enemy if we dont act the empire will crush us eventually i say we stop them before they have the chance so teach  will you help as well
id rather search for rhea than fight
all the more reason to join us admit it youre not going to be able to do much on your own
ill give it some thought
please do im counting on you even if your ultimate goal is to find rhea it would be better to stick with us as you search
with you on our side the church will join us as well that makes fighting the empire a moral cause which means it will be easier to rally support above all your knowledge and strength are indispensable if we hope to stand a chance against the imperial army without you my schemes are nothing just words please  take all of that into consideration as you decide
youre really laying it all on the table arent you claude well all that aside this place is a mess we cant very well make our base in a ruin and repairing it sounds like a lot of work  i wonder if anyone would be willing to help us out with that
can it be you were alive all this time
professor it is so good to see you again my brother and i were worried about you
ah thank the goddess  i couldnt bear the thought of letting jeralt down by not finding you
guess you lucked out
weve been looking everywhere for you but i see lady rhea isnt with you damn
everyone was real worried about you professor
cyril is that you youve grown up kid have you been looking for rhea with the knights
of course without lady rhea i dont belong anywhere
cyril thats not  never mind well figure it all out
oh my the golden deer house is together again at last and all grown up well for the most part
i do regret that we were never able to hold a proper graduation for all of you students
why are you here
how is the search for rhea progressing
it has been five years since lady rhea disappeared we have devoted all of our energies to finding her however without being able to set foot in empire territory we are at a standstill we had hoped that perhaps the archbishop would return here on this day that of the long awaited millennium festival
unfortunately that doesnt seem to be the case though i dont suppose you had very high hopes in that regard even if she were able to return here with the monastery in ruins i dont think she would have felt safe enough to do so right hilda
yeah this is an important location for the church to think youve left it in such a state
the believers are mourning this destruction
its a danger to the locals too
thats true  perhaps weve left it alone for too long weve got to make things right
i can clean this place up like new its not fit for lady rhea like this
and leaving this place in ruins affects the safety of this area too
agreed there is also a great deal of valuable literature here
then lets do it if we all work together we can restore the monastery to its original beauty
we will require the aid of skilled craftsmen too i shall seek out any such individuals who are willing to return to garreg mach
fantastic ill figure out how to split up the work and then we can get started
/***EOF***/
on the streets of the imperial capital alliance forces crush edelgards army and take up the perimeter of the imperial palace the time has come to face emperor edelgard and to free rhea from her clutches
is everyone ready the objective of this battle is to defeat edelgard and rescue rhea according to the information dedue gave us the throne room is directly north of the castles main entrance its safe to assume thats where edelgard is
i dont want to kill edelgard
is there no way to walk the same path as edelgard
shes a fellow student to all of us if theres a path that we can walk together that would be preferable but that all depends on edelgard if she wont yield then thats that if showing pity would put my allies in danger i will not hesitate to kill her i ask that you and everyone here prepare yourselves to do the same
understood i think i speak for everyone when i say that we are prepared
the future of the alliance   no of fódlan   is at stake i have been prepared for this my whole life
captain jeralt taught me that indecisiveness is a weakness one must cast aside their doubts before fighting
the lives of lady rhea and everyone here are more important than all else i shall be prepared
you know what i wouldnt be surprised if she took one look at my overstuffed muscles and surrendered in tears then and there
i really hope that edelgard will yield 
edelgard is a stubborn one i dont think shes likely to surrender
goddess  please protect us 
i ill fight with all i got to save lady rhea
rescuing lady rhea is my dearest wish we must prevail no matter what it takes
in the name of the knights of seiros well bring the hammer down on the imperial army
satisfied yet boy everyone made up their minds a long time ago
ok lets get started were yours to command my friend
leave it to me
everyone take your positions the battle is upon us
theyve made it into the palace but its actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them defeating them all will turn the tide of war instantly taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option everyone prepare for a bitter struggle victory to the adrestian empire
there are more enemies inside the palace than i thought its gonna take a lot to bring this situation under control but if we defeat edelgard then victory is ours everyone lets go
our bashful little emperor has locked herself up behind the door of the throne room the key should be around here somewhere we need to find whoevers got it and take them out
we must be protecting the throne room you will not be getting past
stay back ill protect edie with my life
well have to take out one of them if were going to advance  petra seems like the shortest route 
i wonder how dedue is doing  i hope i get to see him again
so close  must press on 
infiltrators kill them
i must confess i never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far i dont mean to belittle your skills professor but youve far surpassed my expectations inform the troops destroy anyone who sets foot in the throne room
we should be able to get through to the throne room now 
this should give us a bit more freedom of movement now how best to attack 
we did it the enemy wont be able to send any more reinforcements now
clever tactic its going to be difficult to turn the tables now
i cannot vanquish her alone so i will join you in this battle but if i fall leave me my only wish is for edelgards head
so youre another of the goddesss vanguard you dont have a shred of self awareness do you come at me so that i may put you out of your misery
professor  i suppose you think you can defeat me is that right but i will never give up even if my arms and legs failed me i would still find a way to move forward i will smash that false goddess and her minion into the ground i will fight to free this world from her vile grasp
this has nothing do to with where you were born that we are fighting now is only a result of the choices youve made so im going to give that the response it deserves i will crush you with everything i have
edelgard give up we dont want to kill you
but  i must kill you if i dont the righteous world i dream of will never see the light come at me with everything you have for one of us this is the end
your ideals i understand theyre not so far removed from my own but without sufficient knowledge of this lands suffering i cant entrust fódlan to you
perhaps i daresay its true that i dont fully understand the history of fódlan still ive seen many things in my life dont worry ill finish the job for you
edelgard please release rhea  release fódlan
if you strike me down they will return i cannot permit what you desire you are a child of the goddess you must not be allowed power over the people
lysithea you and i are so alike we could have walked the same path
were alike you dont mean to tell me  it cant be
yet now we are at a crossroads theres no turning back must we fight each other for the things we believe in
thats exactly whats going to happen and i will defeat you edelgard
edelgard return rhea release your grip on fódlan
if you strike me down they will return i cannot permit what you desire you are a child of the goddess you must not be allowed power over the people
it looks as though  my path  will end here
my teacher  claim your victory
strike me down you must
even now  across this land people are killing each other if you do not act now this conflict  will go on forever
your path  lies across my grave it is time for you to find the courage to walk it
if i must fall  let it be by your hand
i wanted  to walk with you 
its over we were only able to beat her because of you
  
this wasnt the conclusion i had hoped for even though  i  never mind its over now the important thing is that we won
here boy a letter an imperial general asked me to give it to you
a letter lets see it
it looks like its from  hubert edelgards vassal
if you are reading this letter that means i have perished as her majesty would never surrender to another i can only assume she has fallen as well it greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass  that said as the survivors i must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead you must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark i am sure you must recall monica and tomas their allies yet live they hold deep resentment against the children of the goddess and the people of the world and they are biding their time until they can exact revenge if left to their own devices it is certain they will eventually bring unimaginable calamity and suffering to the world i detected their sorcery when you took fort merceus i have deduced the location of their stronghold shambhala you will find its whereabouts enclosed there is no question that they are the enemies of everyone in fódlan do not allow yourselves to forget that lastly  while i cannot say she is in good health the archbishop resides in a secret chamber in the imperial palace i have shared the location of the entrance to that secret chamber with the person to whom i have entrusted this letter i believe that her majesty will be victorious  even still i must plan for her defeat as well if you wish to lead this world i challenge you to rise to the occasion and surpass my estimation of you such is your obligation as the victors  and the only fitting tribute to all that lady edelgard sacrificed
hubert  to leave a letter like this behind  you were a better man than i believed you to be so rhea is alive and the fight isnt over yet those who slither in the dark  it sounds like fódlan will never know peace unless we defeat them
the allies of monica and tomas  well we knew about them already i think its safe to assume this is the same group who used lysithea for their blood experiments and they were also responsible for the javelins of light that destroyed the fortress but who are these children of the goddess who they supposedly resent theres just not enough information here i dont suppose theres any chance of his idea of a prank  if so wow good one hubert  rather than writing a letter you should have just told us before we fought 
lets ask rhea about it
right we still dont know for sure if this letter is telling the truth lets go find out
you  you have come to save me  is this  is this a dream i have longed to see you again  all this time  is it truly you
claude  i can see you have grown into a reliable young man  thank you for supporting the professor and for rescuing me surely the protection of the goddess has 
wait rhea what do you know about the children of the goddess
children of  what is this about
forgive my bluntness someone from the empire filled us in on a few things i know it must be painful for us to ask you difficult questions after such an arduous confinement but we have no choice we must defeat a secret enemy  those who slither in the dark do you know about them
those who slither in the dark 
apparently they resent the children of the goddess and the people of the world and are planning something big something terrible
 
they use blood for their wicked magic and are capable of dropping javelins of light from the sky which are powerful enough to crush a fortress if you can think of anything at all please tell us now we need to know as much as possible about these enemies in order to stop them
 
this is the critical moment that will determine whether or not fódlan falls cant you see that the time for secrets has passed
it is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of fódlan since ancient times i am sure you have heard the stories of a man named nemesis 
the king of liberation 
the wielder of the sword of the creator 
nemesis the king of liberation hes the hero to whom the goddess gave the sword of the creator
nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits he plundered the holy tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god when nemesis appeared in zanado some time later he already wielded the sword of the creator
in zanado
zanado the red canyon 
how did he get the sword of the creator
according to legend the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods
i do not know how nemesis obtained the sword or why he appeared in zanado but he used that sword to massacre the people there the children of the progenitor god from their corpses he gained even more power and brought war to fódlan 
thats completely different from what the legends tell us about nemesis
a mere bandit like nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own 
aha so nemesis had accomplices and those accomplices must have been those who slither in the dark they used nemesis and this time they used the imperial army to once again bring war to fódlan i finally get it  and i even understand why edelgard was associating with them just as they were trying to use the empire the empire was trying to use them rhea theres still a mountain of things i need to ask you and i will but ill leave all of that for another day you must be weak after living in confinement for so long please rest for a while my friend  lets prepare for battle we need to strike shambhala as soon as possible
you must not allow fódlans bloody history  the red canyon tragedy  to repeat itself 
hm it occurred to me that we never got an answer from rhea about the children of the goddess
arent they the people of zanado
she did say that the people of the red canyon were the children of the progenitor god so i suppose so but those evil guys continue to plot their revenge even after the red canyon tragedy does that mean some of the children of the goddess or their descendants are still alive
rhea
could be she was talking about what happened in zanado as if she was there herself
flayn
if theres something special about her blood we cant rule out the possibility
me
huh maybe though i get the feeling youre something else altogether
what are these children anyway and how are they connected to the goddess bah i almost disappeared into the bottomless swamp that is my mind i thought that after we defeated the empire id be able to see that sight i long to see
what sight is that
ive told you about my dreams before  i want to break down the wall separating fódlan from the outside world the sight i want to see lies beyond that honestly its a trivial thing to fixate on just people gathered in their towns living our their lives together sometimes laughing sometimes fighting but the people living there arent just citizens of fódlan they are people from dagda brigid and even duscur and sreng there could be people who were born in almyra or countries even farther east there too all of those people living together like its nothing special at all thats the sight i long to see its so simple but still so far away  but this is no time for complaining we need to focus on capturing shambhala lets hurry up and gather everyone together
so  you mean to tell me that fódlan will fall to ruin if we leave those guys be
um if this map is reliable their base is just south of my familys territory
this story is a bit much to believe  and yet 
it does ring true somehow
remember monica the one who killed jeralt and the old man who was masquerading as tomas they were their allies and the flame emperor and the death knight were merely their pawns
the people who were after my blood
they were also the ones who used me to conduct their blood experiments 
as awful as it sounds theyre seemingly fond of using blood in their secret techniques
eww thats really gross i could never be friends with someone like that
i believe they were also responsible for the javelin of light that destroyed fort merceus
hold up boy do you really think that we can win against such powerful foes
i dont know but we have to try dont we
this is for fódlans future
weve really taken on something big i wonder if our names will go down in history
my heroic name passed down to future generations haha a worthy cause indeed
its our responsibility as the victors
since edelgard cant do it i guess it falls to us
they were trying to use the imperial army to plunge fódlan into war but we nipped that in the bud now we just need to tear our their roots and i know we have what it takes to do it
/***EOF***/
claude leverages his victory at the battle of gronder to secure reinforcements from alliance lords meanwhile the imperial army continues to tighten its defenses at fort merceus in anticipation of an attack on the imperial capital
our objective is enbarr the imperial capital but our greatest obstacle lies before that
and whats what
fort merceus if we cant pass through we wont be able to reach enbarr
fort merceus  the impregnable fortress or so its called
if i recall correctly its sometimes referred to as the stubborn old general
it is a massive fortress that was constructed to protect the imperial capital
the imperial army we defeated has withdrawn to enbarr fort merceus should be short on soldiers for now
we should attack quickly
yes it would be good to finish up here before more enemy reinforcements arrive
we should be careful
it would be best to take it before enemy reinforcements arrive still theres a reason its been called impregnable
the only real question is what our fearless leader intends to do 
sorry for the delay everyone those mewling lords kept me from leaving for quite some time
so were you able to secure additional reinforcements
its gonna have to wait until next month it doesnt look like they can afford to keep supporting us at present
then what should we do about fort merceus do you plan on waiting around
no if we wait until next month the enemy will have bolstered their defenses that said the prevailing theory is that you need triple your enemies forces to take a fortress with a frontal assault
right thats what we were taught at the academy and this is fort merceus were talking about its renowned for its strong defenses
our current army isnt nearly strong enough hmm  what to do 
whatever you do just dont ask us to scale those huge walls wed end up dead when they hurl rocks down at us
yeah no thanks if only someone would open up the gates for us from the inside
unfortunately we dont have any spies in there wait a minute  ive got it we sneak in stir up confusion and open the gates ourselves to let our allies in
right thats what i was saying all along
right nice one hilda but how do you propose we go about sneaking in
disguises if we dress up like imperial soldiers maybe theyll think were allies and let us in
do you really think theyd just open the gates for us id be pretty dumbfounded if that worked
no no   shes on to something its a good idea hilda we just need to refine it a bit and well be in there before we know it
really go me
what is your definition of refining the idea i know your go to strategy is nausea inducing poison but 
urgh i maybe ate too much my stomach hurts 
raphael  why are you eating meat during a war council
so fearless leader im guessing youre going to keep the crucial parts of your scheme under wraps until the time comes arent you
you know me so well judith whether we like it or not this war puts a damper on all of our spirits whats wrong with trying to have a little fun every now and again just leave the details to me
each time we take a step forward more blood is spilled  but by spilling that blood were able to take yet another step forward war is always a cruel affair but luckily we have each other to lean on weve steeled our hearts we wont be broken
im glad we have such reliable allies
i couldnt agree more without them we could never have made it this far
i wonder if were pushing them too hard
if anyones starting to feel the strain im sure just hearing from you will reassure them please  do whatever you can to keep their morale up
oh and about taking the fort  ill need a tad more time to prepare our plan its called an impregnable fortress for a reason after all my contingencies need contingencies this time or we might not pull it off
fort merceus is old and strong its reputation for durability is equal to that of arianrhod are we really going to leave this to claude with a plan concocted by hilda of all people
im uneasy too
i thought you might be with how secretly that man devises his schemes
have a little faith
i would like to but i am always troubled by how secretly that man devises his schemes
let us hope the end result is not too outlandish
you know when you work your muscles and they start screaming that means you gotta be nice to them if your muscles are hungry you gotta feed them and let them rest when theyre tired
i dont see how youd do that
whaddya mean how you just gotta eat and sleep its pretty obvious 
you can tell how your muscles are feeling
of course if my muscles hurt then i hurt if theyre hungry well then im hungry too
whats with the confused face professor you look like you dont get a word im saying
the battle at gronder field was gruesome wasnt it but perhaps its irresponsible to look away   to close our eyes to the horrors of war
i agree
as survivors we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain we must see the tragic foundations upon which well build our future
you dont have to force yourself
thank you but i think i do actually as survivors we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain we must see the tragic foundations upon which well build our future
may an age of peace rise from the ashes so that all this sacrifice means something
as i suspected they seem to be supporting the imperial army now thought i dont quite know who they are yet  nor do i know what tricks theyll use against us next we cant afford to let our guard down 
i never used to care whether i lived or died  but after seeing so much death firsthand i now realize how precious life truly is im ashamed of how arrogant i was to think that death could mean so little 
i wonder how far we can get with this plan dressing up like imperial soldiers to sneak in claude said it could use some refinement any ideas
we could dress you as the emperor
dress me as edelgard but we look nothing alike
we could dress claude as a woman
claude dressed as a woman i dont understand what the point of that would be
on second thought lets just stick to the plan as originally conceived that seems safer
claude takes care of the strategy you direct the troops and the rest of us focus on the fighting as long as the system keeps working we can win any battle no matter the odds thats what everyones saying anyway hope you can keep up with our expectations professor
dimitri the late prince of faerghus he despised the empire with all his heart he should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive
leaders are people too
leaders cant be emotional
no if a leaders emotions overcome them others must step in to prevent poor decision making why did his followers not intervene his attendants i used to call edelgard my leader and now she is running amok i am duty bound to stop her
theres word that claude has developed a rather interesting stratagem to capture the fortress you know fort merceuss nickname i assume the stubborn old general but there must be one or two gaps in its defenses 
fort merceus is next huh ah the memories its a huge stronghold in my fathers domain the towns completely surrounded by high walls i used to run around there when i was a kid  way back when a fortress was just a playground for me yeah those were the days
its always relaxing coming back here but its hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon and assaulting that huge keep that sounds hard oh really hard dont you think itll be hard
its going to be tough
i knew youd think so i knew you   ow oh ow cant believe i tried to hug you through the door
well be fine
of course youd say that why did i even bother asking
so many people died in the battle at gronder  and here we are preparing for the next battle as if nothing happened the day before its almost easier to think of war as theater with the stage an entire continent
though the actors die the show goes on
something like that if an accident happens on stage the next days performance must unaffected
it really doesnt seem like theater
even if an accident happens on stage the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened
everyone just pretends like everything is fine  focusing on their role in the play
i have excitement in my heart for secret tactics i enjoy attacks that are surprising
whys that
because its like hunting
yes hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey
surprise attacks are safe with friends fewer injuries
my relationship with the boar prince began even before i was born he was always by my side you might even say that at one time we were best friends
what do you mean best friends
what happened
i couldnt fathom the depth of his hatred for the empire so much anguish could i have saved him could i have stopped him
ive heard dedues passed on just like his highness
we cant know that for certain
thats true i did hear that his body was never found
dont believe everything you hear
youre right i dont think anyones found his body so i guess he might still be out there
dedue is dead
thats what ive heard but no ones found his body
if somehow hes still alive i hope well meet again
ya know professor laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date first you get past her defenses then you make your move
thats not the best analogy
trust me i know what im talking about im a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing girls i mean ive never actually you know captured any keeps 
you might be right
ha i knew youd get it professor
anyway you know more about tactics than me so i dont know why im offering you advice
oh goddess hear my prayer please bless the deceased with peace everlasting and may his soul rest in tranquility you know i used to see him praying quite often when i would come to the cathedral at night i wonder who it was he prayed for back then 
after the battle at gronder some people claim they saw my father they said he walked off the battlefield clutching  his highnesss dead body  so long as fathers alive i dont need anything else i just  i hope to see him again one day 
among our prisoners of war there were quite a few people who served his highness one of them stated that the empire was involved with the tragedy of duscur if this is true his highnesss motives seem clear i cant help but feel that perhaps i should have fought by his side 
why is that
because i too lost someone to that tragedy the most important person in my world
are you having regrets
no not anymore i am where i belong
those of us still on this plane of existence will carry the torch the inhumane actions of the empire must not be repeated
fort merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the imperial capital enbarr we cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort but once we have it the city should be almost entirely at our mercy whatever strategy you have in mind i have faith that it will lead to victory
standing face to face with those whom i went to school with on the field of battle  how inhuman war is   how horrifying my heart feels shattered it is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior
fort merceus is the empires single most fortified military installation utterly impregnable they say i wonder do you happen to know the nickname given to fort merceus
the silver maiden
no im afraid that name refers to the fortress city of arianrhod
fódlans locket
that one is a fortress that stands at fódlans throat
the stubborn old general
indeed a very good answer but of course youd know that
seems fódlans give everyone and everything a nickname why you were called the ashen demon myself i have been called the father of crestology which is a nickname as well as a title i suppose 
each step closer to enbarr im reminded of another part of my past riches and poverty glory and failure that city has it all and if im honest  sometimes i miss it thats how the past works though isnt it its always a different story than what you really lived
hildas quite a tactician disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in undetected a stroke of brilliance with this strategy we can really snatch victory from the jaws of deceit
thats a good point
yes  with you leading our fighters ive no doubt the empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit get it deceit again
thats a bad pun
ah rats youve seen through my cunning punning
i hardly recognize everyone  their faces have changed so much more experience in the eyes and more pain im glad that theyre stronger but i hate to think that theyve all become hardened killers look after them ok try to keep em on the straight and narrow
please tell claude not to give us any more ridiculous orders ive reached out through all of my channels but there are limits to these things ill have to recruit an entire towns worth of people if i ever plan on making enough imperial uniforms
guess what i noticed i can see further than most other people can see but i cant figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly since i cant shoot what i see
you could detect enemy movements in advance
i suppose i could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away thats kinda useful at least
you could find our targets quicker than anyone
yeah i suppose it could be real useful for finding lady rhea too
thanks professor i think i get it now im gonna put my eyes to real good use
ah professor i have a question for you  have you heard of the death knight im referring to that imperial general who has been operating under that moniker
ive heard of him
nothing is certain yet but i get the feeling well have to face him soon enough
i havent heard of him
well now  i dont know very much myself only that hes caused a great deal of havoc in the west nothing is certain yet but i get the feeling well have to face him soon enough
greetings professor nothing to report is it true that well be assaulting fort merceus next that doesnt sound like the brightest idea  ive heard that its built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies not to tell you how to do your job but dont do it im not ready to say my final good byes to everyone 
i delivered our letter to fort merceus i dont think they suspected anything
i knew i was right to entrust that task to you youve got that honest kind of face that makes it easy to fool people
is that meant to be a compliment
what did you write in the letter
i informed them that reinforcements were on the way it would have been suspicious for troops to show up unannounced
so the plan is 
well disguise ourselves as reinforcements from the imperial capital and sneak in to fort merceus
oh you used my disguise plan after all
weve also procured imperial army uniforms
ooh good work i knew this was the only way
however  that alone wouldnt be enough
you did say the plan needed a little more refinement are you going to dress up like edelgard claude
im not sure that would accomplish much in the letter i included the name of the imperial general leading the reinforcements while were heading to the fort a separate army is going to attack us
were going to be attacked
thats all just for show though itll be our allies who are attacking us
oh i get it were going to make it look like the alliance is attacking imperial reinforcements
right when the troops in the fortress panic and open up the gates  were in
id love nothing more than for this plan to work but ive got some bad news for you apparently the notorious death knight has been placed in charge of defending fort merceus
the one who kidnapped flayn 
the death knight  i did not wish to ever think of him again
he got some acclaim in the battle to subjugate western faerghus they say he holds the most military prowess in the empire
even so weve got teach here to command us all will be well you have to trust us
so your big plan is to just trust your professor really boy
under the professors guidance im sure well manage somehow were counting on the tactics you learned from captain jeralt
prepare yourselves everyone its time
teach  this is for your ears only but theres actually one more part to my plan i had hoped it wouldnt come to this but i have no choice
no choice
absolutely we cant afford to hold anything back thanks to edelgards strength the imperial army is more unified than i would have expected it was a painful realization but after our battle at gronder field its clear that we cant win if we dont pull out all the stops i also realized something else during that battle there really is something special about you teach the reason we were all able to keep our cool in the midst of the chaos was because we all trust in you in your command and in your strength everyone here believes that we will win as long as we have you on our side our faith in you is borderline religious you and i  we have what it takes to free fódlan from the empires rule i know in my heart that well make it through to witness the world after all the fighting has ceased
that manwoman approaches 
who are you talking about you dont mean that professor do you doesnt matter no one could take this fortress
ugh sounds like a bother  ill be taking a nap about now
will deaths scythe claim you  or will i fall to that sword of yours 
while waiting for reinforcements the alliance predicts the empire will continue to fortify its defenses at fort merceus knowing this risk claude an a select few advance hoping to gain entry to the fort through deception
fort merceus said to be impregnable lies between you and enbarr the imperial capital seizing the sturdy fortress will require a carefully devised strategy
general reinforcements have arrived from the capital they clashed with alliance forces in the outskirts of the city but should enter the fortress soon
you let them in make haste and slaughter them all
huh why
they are enemies slaughter them all i will not say it again
we made it in professor take control from the south i have my own task to do from here there are preparations to be made for our secret plan
i see your skills havent dulled yet kiddo
what did you expect
everyone listen up from now on the almyran forces will be fighting by our side
well work as one and we will bring down that fort together
an impregnable fortress is a wide open prairie once you get inside from here well attack from the north and south at once
no different than a prairie you say heh youve got a strange head on your shoulders kiddo
for nader the undefeated this should be as easy as a walk in a meadow right
heh well goddess or death god or whoever they may be lets crush them to dust
the time of ruin draws near  but their slaughter must wait until next we meet 
report the death knight has escaped the fortress
he gave up too easily does he have some other plan lets deal with the remaining enemies and go after him quickly
the time is ripe
report the death knight is moving it looks like theyre abandoning the fortress and making an escape
we need to put an end to this here and now come on lets circle around and cut off his retreat
hey how longs it been five years whod have thought youd end up an imperial general 
so you wish to die
heh as antisocial and unhinged as ever i see
hey kiddo what was with that  javelin of  light
javelin of light  that describes it pretty well the fortress was supposedly impregnable but look at it nowits hard to imagine that the empire would do something like that but if not them then who and for what purpose if they wanted to kill us then why wait until now to use it
we almost died just now  and without an answer to any of that speaking of unanswered questions why is nardel here care to explain i get the feeling theres something you two are keeping from us
ill go ahead and see my subordinates off to almyra kiddo
wait nader are really going to just leave me here and run away
i hope to see you again judith and you too professor ill be praying for your safety
nader are you saying that nardel is actually nader the unstoppable
unstoppable
its actually nader the undefeated almyrans love grand titles
i knew he was no ordinary person but to think he was the great hero of almyra 
hey um can we really afford to be chatting right now if another one of those javelins of light falls were all dead
claude there are things i wish to ask you but first we must hurry and withdraw
right you are come on everyone lets hurry up and get out of here
claude it is time for you to explain why are you so close with an almyran general
well he did quite a bit for me when i was younger
when you were younger  so before you joined house riegan how and where did you meet him there arent many opportunities to meet a general from almyra in fódlan 
if thats what you believe its only because thats what youve been led to believe after all we have cyril here among our allies and he was born in almyra
hey now dont drag me into this
theres a big wide world outside of fódlan and its overflowing with different places and cultures you think interacting with outsiders is odd but isnt avoiding contact with the outside world far more unnatural
dont change the subject claude to the people of the alliance the almyrans are 
its true that theres a history of hostility but why should that mean were doomed to remain hostile forever the almyrans arent monsters just look at cyril does he look like a monster to you
hey whats that supposed to mean
right teach what did you think when you met nader
hes  interesting
hes a reliable general
ha ill tell him you said that and im sure that if all of you got to know him all of your preconceived notions would change too i know you guys and you arent the type of people to reject someone without trying to get to know them
but  how did those almyrans even get past fódlans throat i doubt my brother would just let them pass without saying anything 
about that  i actually made sure your brother met nader in advance
what lord holst met with an almyran general
oh so thats why you were so interested in my brother but wait theyre supposed to be bitter enemies theyve fought each other several times before
i know it was a big gamble but rather than having me try to convince them myself i knew it would be easier to just have them meet they were taken aback at first but sure enough they hit it off they were even drinking to their newfound brotherhood before parting
it makes sense if you take the greatest heroes away from the battlefield of course theyll get along
fighting one minute and drinking together the next  men are so weird
ultimately someones bloodline has nothing to do with the friendships they forge relations between the alliance and almyra is a matter well tackle in the future still i want to take this opportunity to make one thing clear to all of you after we defeat the empire i intend to tear down the walls that separate fódlan from the outside world i want to let people and goods come and go freely and in doing so eradicate prejudices about the outside world
huh
would it even be possible to achieve such a thing it directly contradicts the seiros tenets
does it im not so sure im any case im prepared for the inevitable protests and criticism new ways of doing things are always met with resistance during our time at the officers academy all of you overcame the barriers of birthplace status and ideology having gone through so much with all of you i have no doubt that in time youll understand
i guess there were a lot of different people there people we wouldnt have met through the normal course of our lives
duscur once opposed the kingdom but there was someone from duscur there brigid once invaded the empire but the brigid princess was there we ate at the same table as those people sure sometimes we didnt get along but other times we helped each other out can we really draw a definitive line in the sand and say one group of people is all good and another all bad if i can realize my dream fódlan will be reborn the old age will end and well welcome a new dawn
but if 
save your objections for another day gloucester boy
ugh 
that said there are more pressing matters to discuss our next step is to invade the imperial capital right
thats right im sure edelgard is eagerly awaiting our arrival in enbarr reinforcements from the alliance lords should arrive soon lets make sure were ready to greet them

with the destruction of shambhala the ambitions of those who slither in the dark are forever shattered however rhea has suffered grievous injuries in the aftermath yet certain mysteries remain unsolved so claude and the others approach rhea who is now confined to her room due to her wounds
i am happy to see you two 
sorry to interrupt your rest but there are some things that we absolutely must ask you
it seems i do not have much time left i do not intend to hide anything any longer
 
rhea  i have to ask youre the immaculate one arent you if what im thinking is correct thats what the children of the goddess is referring to in other words you 
i am the last child of the progenitor god a long time ago the progenitor god came from somewhere far away and descended upon this continent she changed her form to resemble that of a human and gave her own blood to birth her children the progenitor god and her children shared knowledge and skills with the people of the land together they built a prosperous civilization but the humans turned their backs on the teachings of the progenitor god and engaged in senseless wars eventually people began to think of themselves as gods and challenged the progenitor god herself to battle the land was scorched in the war that ensured and the majority of humans were annihilated i believe that those who slither in the dark are the descendants of those who retreated beneath the ground during that time
so they had been waiting all that time for their chance at revenge 
it took the progenitor god an astonishing amount of time to revive the ravaged world but eventually the continent found peace again and the progenitor god having fulfilled her duty fell into a long slumber in the holy tomb the children who stayed behind built a settlement in zanado to protect the holy tomb as they quietly lived out their lives but then nemesis appeared bringing tragedy along with him even now i cannot forget the sight of that massive canyon painted red with blood  i was never able to forgive those who proudly wielded weapons crafted from the corpses of my brethren i was the only survivor of zanado and all i could do was wander across fódlan clinging to my desperate desire for revenge i called myself seiros fostered the founding of the empire and prepared to oppose nemesis and his followers
unbelievable 
i put zanado behind me to gather the remaining children who were scattered across fódlan  finally we killed nemesis on the tailtean plains and i took back the sword of the creator
let me get this straight  saint seiros is you youre kidding me right
professor claude theres something you need to hear right away 
if you have something to report do so at once there is no need to let my presence worry you
as you wish  were receiving a constant stream of express messengers from cities to the east they claim that an unidentified military force is attacking and that there have already been a large number of casualties
what
the reports indicate that the cities and towns along the east gronder thoroughfare in the old hrym territory have already been destroyed some villages were razed completely leaving no survivors 
damn it did they come from shambhala could it be that there were some remnants of that wicked group hiding there
 
i have a report the unidentified military force has crossed the great bridge of myrddin alliance forces met them in battle but it seems they have already broken through
theyve already made it so far is count gloucester unharmed
the count is fine but apparently my brother joined with reinforcements and was gravely injured 
you mean to tell me they easily got past a general as skilled as holst
they say the enemy general has a weapon that resembles the sword of the creator even my brother was powerless to stop him 
the sword of the creator
thats not possible 
the enemy forces are flying a banner bearing the crest of flames as they continue their march west along the airmid river
 
we believe theyre marching toward garreg mach we are preparing to meet them in battle
a weapon that resembles the sword of the creator  and banner bearing the crest of flames  there is only one explanation the one leading the enemy force is nemesis himself
nemesis that nemesis do you really think the ancient king of liberation has been brought back to life
perhaps the seal was broken when shambhala fell  an incredible power that we children cannot hope to match dwells within the blood of the progenitor god nemesis obtained that blood so it would not surprise me if that were the case
the blood of the progenitor god  thats right he did take the remains from the holy tomb didnt he 
from the blood of the progenitor god sothis he acquired the crest of flames from her bones and heart he crafted the sword of the creator
the sword of the creator is made from her bones and heart
the heart of sothis is the crest stone that was placed in the sword of the creator the same is true of the crests of the 10 elites and the other crest stones  they were born of the blood and hearts of the progenitor gods children those who slither in the dark created them stole them sothis never gifted that power to the humans
the crests of the 10 elites the crest stones and the heroes relics  i cant believe those who slither in the dark made them all and after that nemesis used the sword of the creator to massacre all of the progenitor gods children in zanado  in other words the citizens of zanado were killed by weapons made from the remains of their brethren  how atrocious but i dont get it  the sword of the creator that teach wields doesnt have a crest stone so how is teach able to wield its full power
the crest stone of the progenitor god dwells within your professor
 
after i battled with nemesis as saint seiros i reclaimed the heart of sothis i wanted to use that heart to resurrect her even though i had to do some questionable things to achieve that goal i wished to see sothis my mother once more
you placed her heart in me
yes i believed that if i could resurrect my mother i could regain all that had been lost 
so thats the truth of it
i suspected that your body housed the consciousness of sothis those suspicions were correct and yet she merely gave you her power and vanished  my dearest wish did not come true  but you did inherit the power of the progenitor god now you must use that power to defeat nemesis once and for all fódlans blood stained history must end
huh  what a magnificent tale its enough to make your head spin rheas real identity is saint seiros and the one who attacked us was nemesis the king of liberation on top of that youve got the heart of the goddess in you my flabber is completely gasted right now but now isnt the time for standing around in disbelief nemesis has made it this far for a reason if we arent victorious thats it for fódlans new dawn the world will forever be shrouded in darkness  this is the final final battle finally my friend  please give it your all out there
a sudden invasion from nemesis has plunged the alliance territories into complete disarray against such overwhelming strength my father and his forces had no choice but to retreat
wise decision
im glad hes survived
it was certainly prudent for him to avoid a fruitless death but as things stand he will not leave much of an impression on history so that falls to me i will do all that i can for the future of fódlan and the glory of house gloucester
hey professor have you heard from claude he says hes gonna throw a feast if we win the next battle enough food to clean out the stores
that sounds great
so what
so im super motivated to win im gonna train every muscle i got im coming for you nemesis im coming for you feast
i got the gist of it from claude those who slither in the dark  they seem to be descended from humans who were forced deep underground after the goddess defeated them
thats what i heard
is that right
they were trying to wipe out the goddess and her followers in hopes of taking back the surface thats why they called themselves saviors to their mind they were
it seems there are some shambhala loyalists in nemesiss forces as long as theyre around we can expect them to continue with their cruel experiments
we must win
lets wipe them out then
yes we have to its the only way to ensure nobody else will go through what i went through we must obliterate them in the next battle its the only recompense for edelgards death
just when we thought wed made it to the end another enemy approaches  can we be sure this battle is the last one
i dont know
of course theres no way to really know what will happen
this is it i think
i think youre right
just a little further to the end come on professor we have to win
my big brother challenged nemesis he knew he couldnt win he just did it so that his friends could escape he emerged from the battle with a terrible injury its a miracle he didnt die
im glad he made it
yeah me too
that was so noble of him
well maybe he should have been a little less noble when youre dead youre dead
dying to save someone else seems to defeat the purpose i wouldnt do it hes alive and in spite of myself im really proud of him
so were defending fódlans future huh kind of makes my mercenary ambitions feel pretty small so ill think about my promise to captain jeralt to protect you instead thatll be my reason to fight
thank you
that works
if i can get you through this in one piece thats just as good as defending fódlans future isnt it i just hope hes watching
the javelins of light that destroyed fort merceus  they are what destroyed shambhala they were trying to shroud the city in darkness perhaps they were planning to swallow us up in that same darkness maybe the javelins of light were a signal to nemesis to awaken him from his long slumber what do you think professor
i think youre exactly right
yes indeed i have done some good pondering here
i think youre way off the mark
oh really hm maybe i got a couple of things wrong but i thought i was pretty close 
if we keep up this momentum we will be able to take down nemesis and restore peace in fódlan
when you think of it as one approaches the end of a war the sacrifices only grow larger dont they the winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow  while those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor neither side will give i only wish wed consider those who lose their lives in that struggle
were far from being safe ourselves
yes exactly my point lets be careful to ensure we dont lose our lives professor
its a necessary sacrifice
perhaps but that doesnt make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice
its better than dragging the war out
i can appreciate that but just because a choice is better does not mean that its good
everyone in fódlans united but the whatstheirfaces in the dark or whatever wont let up lets get rid of em right away
lets do it
we gotta get some training in so we can crush em
we cant let our guard down
i know that come on lets go train so we can crush em
theres not a lot of time but im afraid we wont win if we dont train
the king of liberation the fell king his name is nemesis right and he was hidden away for over a thousand years wow thats a really long time all to himself  but that doesnt make him worth admiring no matter how much i envy him
you really envy him
youd like to be shut away for a thousand years
um maybe is that a trick question
i keep thinking the war is near its end then it isnt  when can we finally put this dreadful war behind us
lets end it with the next battle
that would be wonderful imagine the last moment of combat then peace it sounds like a fairy tale i want to make this a world a place where there is no fighting where children can grow up happy and safe
there can be no end to war
i suppose youre right  but we should still try our best to make the world a place where children can grow up happy and safe
i can feel a weight in the air it is different from before i do not know this nemesis person except what i have been reading but i am not of fódlan my knowledge of this person is very little even so i feel that i can understand it i know that our enemy has great strength i am feeling great fear for this battle
dont worry
i have belief in you professor together we will not be losing
im scared too
you have fear too you do not look like you do  i have gratitude  i mean i am grateful that you told me
the fell king nemesis hmph i imagine hell be a worthy opponent how many foes have tasted my blade he will be an excellent finale we will be victorious professor
yes we will
splendid lets do it
calm down
im perfectly calm thank you
the king of liberation wakes after a thousand year slumber feels like im living a nightmare
i feel the same way
you too i hope youre not following my lead on this one professor
we must accept it
i know youre right but it still doesnt feel real
maybe this nemesis whos attacking us isnt even the real thing either way the damage and death hes causing are real enough i will fight to protect those who need it
just when we think were in the clear the legendary fell king resurrects whod have thought it can you handle this getting any weirder i dont know if i can
i can sympathize with you
i dont know how much of this nemesis guy is a legend and how much is true but i know this 
no time for complaining
i want to− im going to survive ive spent this whole war afraid id die not anymore im going to live
i mean ill still fight like i want to die because thats worked so far and why change at this late date right
and if im right and i dont die would you go have dinner with me sometime
we went through all that trouble to finish the war and now we have to fight again what does this nemesis fellow have against garreg mach anyway
a vendetta 
a vendetta against garreg mach that doesnt make much sense at all
i have no idea 
well it doesnt make much sense to me either
at any rate ill do what i can to defend the monastery and lady rhea
is lady rhea ok she was quite weakened to start and then she took all those heavy injuries  i dont want to imagine it but what will happen if lady rhea passes away like this
well cross that bridge if we come to it
i suppose youre right
im sure shell be fine
yes im praying every day that shell get as well as soon as possible
come what may we should all combine our talents and defend the peace of fódlan
shambhala is destroyed but are they vanquished entirely i wonder  just as kronya took monicas form perhaps there are some others living above ground
i dont know
quite possibly
once this battle is over i still have much to see to but right now i should focus on the task at hand on nemesis as long as nemesis stands both my future and the future of fódlan hang in the balance
before the monastery was completed there was a massive battle on the tailtean plains in that battle the warrior seiros defeated the fell king nemesis and reclaimed the bones and heart of sothis those make up the divine sword that you wield and the crest that you bear now rhea seiros lies helpless the only one who can defeat this so called king of liberation is the inheritor of divine power you have our full and unwavering support only you can do this please save this world
please keep quiet rhea is sleeping right now she does not appear to be very well i beg of you please do everything you can to prevent an assault from nemesis
shambhala  an underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess shame phenomena driven by a source totally alien to the crests that we understand most unsettling could it be magic some manner of technology i would like to know the truth of it all very much so i want to know their history their knowledge why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy
well i dont know
i intend to carry out multiple excavations around the city there is so much to learn yet first we face battle with a king who has defied time hmm yes the excavations can wait i think
life can be tough you know but if youve got your friends to help you through it can be a lot easier maybe you butt heads sometimes but thats ok thats how you build bonds right and ive got friends professor plenty of those its true love that seems to have passed me by
you should relax
relax im relaxed
theres still hope
but where is my true love to be found where is my ray of hope
time to give up
yeah  im starting to figure thats the most realistic option
at this point im just hoping you stay single too then at least we can share each others misery
we thought wed taken down the mastermind of this war and then the fell king nemesis shows up well no matter what evil creatures we have to face this old soul will keep defending garreg mach not only garreg mach also lady rhea also you i think jeralt would be saying the same kind of thing if he were here right now
i try not to think about what would happen if lady rhea were harmed i cant bear the thought of it im not sure why the fell king nemesis picked right now to come back to life but it makes me angry thats for sure lets kick him back down into the dirt where he belongs
ghosts rising up from the ancient ruins  heh  no matter how hard we push back they dont stop coming theyre persistent ill give them that
i hear some super strong and evil fellas are after lady rhea she just barely made it back to garreg mach and then this has to go and happen ill protect lady rhea as best i can and youre gonna do the same thing arent ya professor yeah i know you will cut em down professor get every last one of those guys
did you hear our enemy is nemesis unbelievable it sounds so crazy but theres no laughing it off we must make our move before they reach the monastery
professor i just have to say thanks for everything im on high alert today so dont you worry about a thing this mysterious military force approaching garreg mach  is it true that nemesis is with them it was nemesis who led the 10 elites against saint seiros its the stuff of legend but this time he wont have the 10 elites on his side right he wont right
a military force bearing the crest of flames on its banner marches west to garreg mach from shambhala attacking nearby cities along the way rhea informs the alliance that the enemys general is none other than the ancient fell king nemesis and so the alliance army prepares for their final battle hoping to put an end to fódlans blood stained history
shambhala has fallen but a mysterious army has emerged from its ruins bearing the crest of flames on its banner leading this force is nemesis the king of liberation presumed dead for a thousand years
whats the plan my friend
we will defeat nemesis
i thought youd say that and of course ill be joining you what about the rest of you our enemy is a monster of legend as always theres not a shred of proof that we can win
a foolish inquiry claude i must finish what my father started 
started your father ran away before the battle even began
i well all the more reason why i as his heir cannot flee now
im in i need to get back at him for hurting my brother im not going to let him get away with it
wow  hildas serious about this
i too will fight until the end i wish to protect fódlans future
i feel the same as lysithea it would hardly be fitting for captain jeralts apprentice to bow out now ill show them everything he taught me
i i will give it my all as well for the professor for claude and for all of you who helped make me as strong as i am now
im in too and when were done im gonna eat tons of steak to celebrate
this truly is the final battle  at this point you shouldnt have to ask claude you know were with you
i do know that ignatz but i had to ask just to make sure
heh look at how reliable you kids have become youve trained them well professor this nemesis guy should be arriving soon is everyone ready
its finally time
i wont let us lose
i wont let any of you die
lets win this  together
im on board with that lets all make it through this alive lets defeat this dusty old king of liberation and put an end to this history of lies once weve done that therell be nothing holding us back a new and brighter age will begin lets go my friend fódlans new dawn awaits
nemesis is here and with more soldiers than expected
a swamp huh but theres something about it  it looks odd somehow
agh cant breathe 
he should not have done that  be careful the water is poisonous to the living
it looks like wed better not get near that swamp  try to avoid it during the fight
huh i think theyve got some sort of magical link with nemesis 
could the magic be protecting him
not sure but wed better take out his 10 commanders before taking him on
seiros i will kill you do not get in my way
so thats nemesis  youre a crusty old bastard you know that
all those who stand in my way will be destroyed
wah watch out claude theyre coming for us
no effect so nemesis is  invincible 
nine more commanders remaining  we just killed number 10 these cant be the 10 elites can they nah not likely
look the swampland cleared
professor claude all the subordinates to nemesis have been eliminated
it took some doing but nows our chance to face off against nemesis
agh demonic beasts flying in from the south  someone here must be able to summon them
i sense an unusual presence someone may be hiding there
argh  thales
now he cant call any more demonic beasts time to see off his allies
now he cant call any more demonic beasts and the remaining forces of shambhala have been defeated too
whoa the swampland vanished
look the swampland cleared
hey  can you speak
 
just puppets controlled by nemesis  well theyre the strongest puppets ive ever known
feeble creature  prepare to die
that sword  you bear the crest of flames just as i do
that one seemed to work  were almost done lets go my friend
you are a foolish child
tough talk from a guy whos lived too long allow me to fix that
you are all pathetic weaklings you lack the courage to challenge me in lone combat
yet we have the strength to scale the walls between us to reach our hands in friendship so we can open our true hearts to one another
thats how we win
future historians will refer to this day as the new dawn of fódlan of that i have no doubt
its up to you now teach as for my path 
a rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for fódlan the ambitions of the fell king nemesis were crushed averting what could have been the greatest crisis in the history of fódlan after 5 and a half years of war a new age was set to begin country faith history all that had once formed the order of the world was wiped clean the heroes whose very hands saved fódlan from a dark fate commenced with the building of a new society the leaders of this new unified fódlan began their walk down a seemly endless path one toward a world that would cherish differences in race and belief one where all life would be valued equally those clung to the hope that their path would not end with fódlan that it would someday span the seas to dagda and beyond the throat to almyra 
/***EOF***/
having repelled the imperial vanguard the alliance army requests reinforcements from judith head of house daphnel   the governing body in the northwestern regions of alliance territory
what not enough left for seconds im barely half full
ya eat too much anyways raphael supplies are running low so youre just gonna have to deal with it
youve always been so level headed cyril now that youve grown up youre even more that way
maybe its just that the rest of you havent grown enough you could work harder at being reliable
i cant grow if i cant eat
i have some good news for my hungry friends  we got a reply from judith
mr leader man has called a meeting about it hurry up everyone
we finally received a reply from judith the hero of daphnel has agreed to support us with soldiers and supplies
shes gonna give us food she really is a hero
maybe raphael will simmer down now
now regarding where were going to receive the delivery 
as this is a request from none other than the leader of the alliance i wish that i could send troops at once however  openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the alliance therefore i will secretly gather troops in ailell the valley of torment will your group be able to receive the soldiers at this location from there it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the alliance and the kingdom
ailell the valley of torment 
ailell is on the border between the daphnel territory and the kingdom itll make sense when we get there but its a peculiar region
i recall there being a scary legend about it 
in any case if we use that valley we shouldnt have to worry about being noticed by other alliance lords
ailell the valley of torment 
you know  id never have been recognized as the legitimate heir to house riegan without judiths recommendation  feels like im digging myself deeper and deeper in debt to the hero of daphnel but what do you do its all been worth it after all we need the daphnel army for our next move its possible well have to deal with our enemy sooner than later be prepared teach
the bridge that links alliance and empire lands is currently under the occupation of the imperial army in other words the empire can choose to invade the alliance whenever they wish i want you to understand that my father does not support the empire to antagonize house riegan he does it to deprive them of an easy excuse to cross that bridge
sharing her food with us for nothing in return judith really is a great person shes more like a goddess than the goddess is
she is very much like a goddess
i never met her so i dont know for sure but she must be beautiful and kind
im not sure about that
no well she could be a demon for all i care so long as she feeds me
the valley of torment  id heard of it but i never expected to go there its exciting i wonder what the landscape is like
it sounds dangerous
it probably is dangerous but i still want to get there and see it as soon as i can
it sounds painful
hm that is an interesting point  the name does seem to suggest that
ailell the valley of torment lies on the border of three noble territories the kingdoms fraldarius and galatea families and the alliances daphnel family in the fraldarius lands to the north the former kingdom army and new dukes army are fighting
valley of torment  valley of torment 
something wrong
i once read a book full of legends surrounding ailell but i cant seem to remember 
are you chanting some sort of curse
n no  im trying to remember the legends surrounding ailell 
my big brother told me stories of judiths bravery with just one look she tamed a runaway horse that nobody else had been able to touch when an almyran general provoked her she talked him into a tearful apology shes spectacular i wish shed fight alongside us
youre not a teacher anymore and were not your students but everyone still calls you professor is there something youd rather be called
professor is fine
guess thats what were used to huh all right
call me by my name
oh all right then ill call you   ugh nope sorry cant do it too weird
some day we will take the imperial capital it is odd to think that i will be invading the very city that i once called home ah that is still a ways off i will prepare for our journey to ailell
i never do get used to the sight of blood it always makes me feel as if i might faint have i never told you that huh oh well i hope this war ends soon i dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain 
i didnt think wed end up fighting randolph  hes my uncle well not by blood so  i guess i can handle it
im still worried about you
youre very resolute
dont worry about me im ready for anything
ailell the valley of torment what kind of a name for a place is that it sounds scary do i really have to go with you hey um heres an idea  maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort
hey professor thanks for your hard work again nothing to report today was i convincing was it like he was standing right in front of you some things are the same as they were five years ago but i guess a lot more has changed 
since the past i have learned much of the language of fódlan but speaking the fódlan language still gives me difficulty i can understand read and write with nearly perfection now but understanding and speaking are fruits of a different color
thats part of your charm
i have gratitude for you professor i hope that i will have fluency one day
everyone has a weak spot
yes i will keep practicing more
some in faerghus believe dimitri is still alive my father is one such eccentric hmph they cant accept reality dimitri is dead hes not coming back
ailell the valley of torment aw man  i really do not want to go there
pull yourself together
professor have you ever been to ailell if you had youd know
why not
that place is crazy hot for guys like me who grew up somewhere cold man  its gonna be rough though i guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay
we may not be students anymore but its still important to read we might even learn something thats useful for our next battle
studying is important
i couldnt agree more i hope the officers academy reopens when the war is over
training is important too
i suppose that may be true i always try my best at both
its a shame the monastery was ruined but at least the books are still intact
professor how do claude and judith know each other i hear there are still quarrels within the alliance  this generous offer of soldiers and supplies seems a little too good to be true i mean its also really impressive but im just a little worried i suppose 
my family the galateas are an offshoot of the daphnel family the family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance despite blood relations the families lived apart from one another so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged im not so much acquainted with judith the head of house daphnel
meeting reinforcements in the valley of torment seems an astute decision to me in that land of oppressive heat it is unlikely that we will be disturbed it also means we will need to contend with those harsh conditions ourselves however best ensure we are well prepared
it has been only five years yet so much has changed half of the kingdom has fallen to the empire skirmishes are rife throughout the alliance despite such tumult we look upon the same sky unchanged by the storm happening beneath it
do you wish you could return to those days
yes it would be nice i suppose things were  simpler then or so they seemed to be at the time
its true   its just like it was all those years ago
indeed i gazed up at the same sky with mother and father it does not feel so long ago at all wait but how would you know professor
the monastery repairs have made solid progress most excellent news when we first returned here i was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place  but if we can get the cathedral rebuilt well have it looking just like the old times soon enough
hearing that an old student has died cuts me right to the heart  as this war with the empire continues well see more of it professor we have a duty to fight alongside our former students we taught them how to fight after all now lets help them win
even though were getting reinforcements we should still be prepared for the worst never shirk your training no matter what to practice im going to chop something up with my sword unless youd like to train together care to spar
ive heard people talk about the hero of daphnel if the stories of her courage are true no one will be able to stand against us in different circumstances id have wanted to try crossing swords with her right now we have to focus on getting to those reinforcements lets hope nothing goes wrong
there are enemy spies around remain vigilant capture anyone who seems suspicious
to kill them
what else would we do with them
all right i will
im glad you understand im counting on you
gotta clean out the storerooms tend the flowers do the washing dust the library 
that sounds like a lot of work
well its my job ya know gotta do your job
do you need any help
nah this is my job lady rhea herself gave it do me
even if lady rheas not here right now i still gotta do my duty
like you you gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing yeah
greetings professor nothing to report is everyone setting out on a big campaign not exactly ah so youre meeting up with the reinforcements well you can leave guarding this place to me ill keep an eye out for anything suspicious
in response to the alliance armys plea judith has agreed to provide soldiers to meet up with reinforcements the alliance army sets out for ailell the valley of torment unbeknownst to claude something else awaits them there 
your party travels to ailell the valley of torment to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements it should have been a safe march 
ugh why is it so hot im getting all sweaty
dont be a wimp anythings worth it for more food supplies
move over raphael somehow you make the heat even worse
lets stay calm everyone once we meet up with judiths soldiers we can go right back home
oh i finally remembered the legend goes that this valley was born from the wrath of the goddess 
they say a pillar of light poured from the heavens and completely burned away the forest that used to be here 
so youre telling me the goddess who is supposed to be benevolent burned a forest to a crisp typical
thats what the legend would have us believe but its not recorded in any of the scriptures 
either its completely made up or the goddess is some kind of monster
huh is that 
the time for idle chatter is over claude look over there
ah has someone come to greet us
enemies
allies
that banner does not bear the daphnel crest
if memory serves  thats the crest of house rowe formerly lords of the kingdom they joined the empires side without hesitation during the coup and now here they are lying in wait for us
damn  i thought we had disposed of all the spies 
house rowe is mediocre and vulgar but i hear their knights are powerful
what about the daphnel soldiers you dont think 
im worried about judith
judith will be fine it would take a lot more than that to take her down
we need to break through their ranks
weve already been spotted so theres no time to come up with a brilliant plan
everyone prepare for battle i leave the command in your capable hands my friend
the valley of torment  perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight only if that puny force of children is able to kill me of course 
so their general must be that stubborn looking old man he looks like he wouldnt even forgive a sobbing child its good we came armed for the occasion care to find judith
flames are flaring everywhere and burning people where they stand  ailell is a terrible place everyone if you dont want to get burned to a crisp watch your step
the crest of flames ha quite full of themselves arent they
just as i thought   the professors army but its too late to back out now in lonatos place i have to do my duty
oh old gwendal is here and he doesnt look to be an ally 
oh the hero of daphnel is here ill expect more from her than the young ones 
all of your units fall in battle or judith is defeated
here we go attack them from both sides
so youre finally here supreme leader and something extra has tagged along
sorry judith that rat got away
hey dont worry and here you should have this perhaps it will come in handy
does a whelp like you really expect to kill me i am gwendal the gray lion a knight by the hand of count rowe do your worst
ah so i have found a place to die  young ones  i thank you 
that old man must have been struggling with the position he found himself in  its time to gather ourselves and pull back our troops
to think wed get into a scrap here of all places were lucky we all made it out alive
im sorry for involving you in this
dont worry about it in this day and age its a miracle ive been unscathed this long
i can see why they call you a hero
well thats ancient history
anyway long time no see professor are you still watching this boys back
can you quit calling me a boy in front of everyone im the leader of the alliance now its not proper 
not proper is it says the leader who has neglected alliance territory for years if youre really the master tactician you should go back to working quietly at whatever little desk you do your planning on
ugh dont call me that either who even came up with that nickname
its a perfect title for a boy who loves crafty schemes as much as you do you should be grateful to the professor on your own youd look like a scoundrel of a leader
haha claudes usually so flippant but even he gets overwhelmed when judith is around
as expected from the leader of the prestigious house daphnel her dignity if beyond compare even if she is no longer one of the five great lords
the five great lords
the prestigious house daphnel
the five most influential lords of the leicester alliance they hold the voting rights at the roundtable conferences house daphnel used to be included among their ranks but division from within has hastened their decline their vote has since been passed to the emerging margrave edmund
thanks for the exposition gloucester boy
boy i will not 
now to business there were some unexpected interruptions but ive brought soldiers and supplies as promised
thanks judith ill gladly take them off your hands 
hold your horses boy youre misunderstanding these soldiers are precious to me i made them what they are im not about to loan them out to someone
no then why did you come here
what im saying is that ill be joining your army youre going to fight the empire with the knights of seiros right fight for lady rhea not without me
thats admirable and all but we still dont know for sure if rhea is in the 
oh shes there a witness saw lady rhea being dragged off by the imperial army after the battle five years ago
are you sure your source is reliable
one of my own saw it happen im certain
it seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the empire
but youre the leader of house daphnel is it ok for you to leave your territory unattended
and what about you is it ok for you to leave the riegan territory unattended
thats  ive left it in the hands of a reliable retainer and 
and ive asked that retainer to watch over daphnel territory as well
wait wait wait  you just up and decided to get my retainer to do that without even asking me no respect this one 
what retainer
oh you havent met him yet professor his name is nardel he strikes me as a really special individual and hes quite handsome too
so thats your definition of handsome
no objections then good that settles it house daphnel is now yours to command
im sure youd come along even if i refused so be it well be counting on you judith
with judith joining our forces weve secured some more troops and supplies  albeit not many
hmph im sorry it couldnt be more
no its enough for the time being well use them to secure even more troops and supplies
how so
you think we can do that
the key to my plan is count gloucester the leader of the pro empire faction in the alliance
you intend to sway my father to join the other side
if count gloucester were to switch to the other side that would basically unify the alliance then we could utilize our full military force in the fight against the empire
you dont mean to ask me to persuade him do you that would be  quite impossible
i dont plan on it well just take his concerns out of the equation the airmid river flows along the border between gloucester territory and the empire right of all the bridges that cross it the great bridge of myrddin is the only one near gloucester territory large enough for an army currently the imperial army occupies it
so if we were to capture the bridge 
count gloucester would be freed from the threat of the empire thanks to us
but we have to pass through gloucester territory to reach the great bridge of myrddin do we not
yes and if we attempted it naturally he would try to stop us
i am sorry but i must ask surely you do not plan to engage in combat with my father
dont worry i want him as a future ally what good would it do to waste both of our forces fighting
i take it you have a scheme
who do you think youre taking to teach preparations are in the works even now
so well be sneaking through
we cant be stealthy with so many people but i have a scheme preparations are already in the works
so the master tactician is finally going to show us his true power im looking forward to it
ill do my best to live up to that name by making my scheme as impressive as possible
/***EOF***/
immediately following edelgards defeat the alliance army discovers the existence of another adversary   a group operating behind the scenes within the empire claude suspects that if the true enemy is left unchecked disaster will befall fódlan and so he cuts short the celebration and the troops head for shambhala where this foe resides
i just dont get it 
what is it claude
those javelins of light  they were trying to use it to kill us at fort merceus right but then why not drop it on garreg mach they must have known for a while that we were here
it is not that they chose to refrain but rather that they were unable to do so
rhea how are you feeling
i am well enough  i cannot afford to rest while fódlan is in danger
what do you mean when you say they couldnt drop a javelin of light here
once a very long time ago a massive ball of light fell upon this monastery however that light mysteriously changed course in mid air and landed in ailell instead
ailell the valley of torment  so thats what the wreckage of those javelins of light looks like
the holy tomb is not only the location of the progenitor gods eternal slumber but also a sacred vessel for a power that repels evil supposedly the progenitor god built the holy tomb herself to protect her children from the evil light
so the children of the goddess gathered in zanado because of its proximity to the monastery but weve fought at distant locations many times
despite that the javelins of light only fell on fort merceus
in his letter hubert said that he detected their magic when the fort fell in other words because they used a javelin of light hubert was able to pinpoint the location of their base
so they didnt use it before then because they didnt want us to know where their base is
in any case those javelins of light must be something they cant just use whenever they want and they finally decided to use one at merceus where they were sure theyd be able to finish us off its only thanks to the whims of the death knight that we escaped with our lives and no javelins of light have fallen since then
its possible that the enemy hasnt yet realized that weve learned the location of their base
if so their guard may be down which makes this the perfect time for a surprise attack
i will accompany you
what no that would be far too dangerous your long confinement weakened you greatly did it not
those people have opposed us since ancient times i wish to learn the truth about them for myself
i  i understand i will not stop you but please take care not to overexert yourself
we dont know exactly what were up against here but having you around is very reassuring rhea lets prepare to strike at shambhala before they make their next move
we crushed the empire at long last  but theres no time to bask in our victory we must prepare for the coming battle we knew there was a secret group behind the imperial army all this time now we have a chance to make the first move against them we have hubert to thank for that its also thanks to him that we were able to rescue rhea i still have plenty of questions id like to ask her
are you going to see her
well if we plan to have her march into battle with us again wed better let her recuperate
we should let her rest
rhea is the only one who gets a break though everyone else had better start preparing for battle
a mysterious power threatening the very future of fódlan certainly we cannot give it leeway in comparison to this the internal power struggles in the alliance are utterly trivial
arent you frightened
fear will serve no purpose here the only path to survival is victory
do you think we can defeat it
there is simply no option but victory the alternative is unthinkable
perhaps i will have the opportunity to strike the decisive blow on the enemy commander that would secure my place in history for certain
wake up eat train eat train eat sleep we gotta prepare for the assault but that hasnt changed my routine
youre doing plenty
isnt there more you can do
all the training  and eating  i do is for the sake of fódlan gotta stay strong  and fed  to keep it safe
our next opponent is an ally of solon do you remember what solon called us
traitors
no he called us beasts
beasts
thats right he called us beasts
insects
no he called us beasts
meanwhile he refers to himself as the savior who exactly is he saving
those who slither in the dark  it seems well finally discover their true form i get the sense that theyre in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child i wouldnt be surprised if edelgard was subjected to them too theres no telling what their true motives are but whatever their motives what they have done is unforgivable they must be exterminated
i thought the war would end with edelgards defeat  but that wasnt the case this may be premature but im feeling a little relieved i have to consider what ill do with myself and where ill go when this war is finally over  i dont have an answer yet  lets make sure the next battle puts an end to this war that way we can all move forward
shambhala it was called right scary that its so close to the house goneril territories whod have thought all those creeps were living right under my nose i was hoping my big brother would help us in this next battle but he says that i can represent house goneril without his help that i have it in me im glad he recognizes that i have some ability still i wish he wasnt leaving it all to me
these are monicas people arent they the ones who killed captain jeralt then this is my real opportunity for revenge theres no way i can back down from this one
youre not scared
no im ok actually im eager to get our there and fight this is what ive been training for
i wonder if we can win
if we lose its the end for fódlan so we have to win even if it kills us
the history of the empire spans 1185 years and just like that it ends but the hresvelg legacy could live on  when edelgard assumed power there were no other rightful heirs she said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by virtue of merit not blood and she truly meant what she said at any rate i feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart who knows if it can ever be filled
as history proves everything comes to an end eventually i knew that all along but it still came as a surprise those who slither in the dark  its all so fascinating and strange they must certainly have a long history of their own and when they fall that will come quickly too dont you think heh that almost sounded like a prophecy there am i spooking you yet
hes dead  my fathers dead  im ok though really i was ready for it he was a general in the imperial army after all minister of military affairs  he gave his own life so the empires soldiers wouldnt have to lose theirs thats a fight that only he could take on he was such a tough guy this whole time i fought side by side with you and claude  but did i ever get any stronger will i ever be as strong as my father
with edelgard gone maybe fódlan will finally find some peace thats all well and good but um  she was also the one to put my father under house arrest so now hes been released and hes taken charge of house varley i cant handle it i cant deal with him please you have to do something
how about we exile him
we can put him back under arrest
thank you so much
so the moment we defeat edie the nobles cozy up to the alliance and church  that lot really does think only of themselves and no one else but then theres count bergliez he used to be minister of military affairs  he sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter  when i heard that  i dont know  that simple act of humanity  i couldnt help it i burst into tears you know count bergliez is caspers father right i cant even imagine how caspar must feel about it
the empire has broken in  in smithereens now it is possible for me to go back to brigid but  i cannot choose that choice the time is still too soon for that we must be stopping the evil for everyone in fódlan we will be fighting until the end of it
i thought that after the empire fell the boar might finally be avenged  but something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows   an organization behind the empire well have to take care of them if the boar  if dimitri is to rest in peace
weve all heard the legend of nemesis the king of liberation but now lady rhea is saying nemesis was just some kind of thief those two descriptions are totally at odds which versions correct i dont know what to think but i guess thats the nature of history i wonder what the generations that come after us will say about the battle were about to fight
this war might be over but not war in general human beings thrive on conflict we cant get enough of it i dont know when but you know someday another war will begin
even so 
heh heh  thats the way it is right
youre probably right about that
yeah but the fight is still worth it
war may always come back but so will peace and peace is what we fight for
lady rhea still seems weak  but at least shes safe now im praying that shell be well as soon as possible goddess  i beg you  protect lady rhea
finally that awful war is over everyone lost something and everyone had to make sacrifices  but maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now lets hurry to shambhala professor we have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war
is it really prudent to bring lady rhea on our upcoming expedition it would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous considering how long she was confined 
its her decision ultimately
i feel similarly
there are still many in fódlan who are seeking lady rheas salvation
rhea is sleeping right now if it is not absolutely urgent please do not disturb her rest the long confinement took its toll on her health truthfully she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all   to say nothing of a military expedition to make matters worst we are now facing a very old enemy one that has conspired against us since time out of mind please proceed with caution i have a bad feeling
i am so glad that rhea is unharmed my brother continues to worry about her however of course i am worried myself i cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state  she should just leave things to you and claude and get the rest she needs 
a mysterious organization slithering in the dark of fódlan  like something out of a midnight tale it appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the empire after the fall of enbarr theyve remained well concealed  that said i would keep an eye on edelgards uncle lord arundel something about him sits ill with me
professor most of the opera company fled but theyre back in the capital now i dont know if everyone survived but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival they even asked if id consider making a return to the stage someday  i suspect i may refuse though were at the dawn of something new no reason to look backwards eh
youve done it you did it you crushed the empire and rescued lady rhea im sure the captain is proud of you right now as am i of course im as proud as if id done it myself
lets not celebrate just yet
we still have opponents left to fight
sorry i didnt mean to overdo it we still have monicas group  those who killed the captain well knock em down so hard that they cant get back up
we rescued lady rhea i can hardly express my joy but now we know about a new foe who intends to bring her harm in time well realize the peaceful world that lady rhea has always hoped for ill have to keep that in mind when im fighting
we saved rhea and the empire has crumbled the kingdom may as well be finished too the reasons for me to remain in fódlan are fading
please stay with us a little longer
of course ive come this far may as well see it through to the end
is it time to bid farewell
thats a little hasty ive come this far may as well see it through to the end
lady rheas back lady rheas back im so happy but  things arent gonna be like they used to be any time soon are they theres still folks out there who want us all dead and lady rhea still hasnt regained her strength yet speaking of which professor please dont ask too much of her right now ok
the folks were fighting next arent normal humans are they its that group who caused the javelin of light to fall right it just doesnt seem like something a human is capable of im not prone to flinching but i dont feel great about any of this 
greetings professor nothing to report i can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that everyone did sterling work i really thought wed know peace after the battle but were not quite there yet huh
incredible  who knew that there was such a vast space beneath the ground 
its like an underground city ive never seen buildings like these before
its like an ancient ruin  but not just because of its appearance
i dont recall ever seeing architecture like this
it is magnificent in a sense but i could hardly call it beautiful even the air feels stagnant
in any case it seems like we need to go further lets look around and see if we can find some stairs
 
something on your mind
are you not feeling well
no it is simply  we must defeat those who slither in the dark no matter what happens but if my conjecture is correct the one who they will wish to kill the most 
is you dear child
why me
they are aware that you can use the sword of the creator your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon nemesis that is why i fear for you
thats not much to go on
perhaps please forgive my errant thoughts once this battle is over  i will explain everything i will tell you all i know about who you really are
though the flame of war is quenched its embers endure you travel deep underground to confront those who slither in the dark and bring lasting peace to fódlan
for thousands of years we have existed underground living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized here and now that vengeance is finally within our grasp there is but one thing left to do destroy them damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion away from the world of the living
now is the time remove the binding spell of titanus let their metal bodies be drenched in blood
hey what are those big things
demonic beasts  no i think not they appear to have no will of their own someone must be controlling them
initiate all that remain we must advance our preparations
viskam has been activated increase output gradually depending on the amount of magical energy charged i dont care if we destroy shambhala as long as our goals are fulfilled
those awful weapons have been stopped they were being controlled from that facility
aw those big things have gone to sleep on us that will make moving around a lot easier a dead end or perhaps  no if we worry about every little detail we wont get anywhere
you
that is the leader of those who slither in the dark we must go after him with all our might
it seems someone is trying to remove something wed better capture them first
youre nothing but animals performing tricks in the hopes of pleasing the goddess you will never see the sunlight again
so you have shown yourself fell star or should i say sothis i will spill every drop of blood in your body to fulfill the longstanding goal of the agarthans
your eyes hair ears and blood we remember it all we remember how you ruined us how you stole our light and condemned us to eternal darkness now suffer the wrath of the agarthans
ha it is laughable that base animals such as you would bare fangs at the likes of us
i may be a base animal but i have strong allies do you think you can beat teach and the sword of the creator
the sword of the creator  the blade given to nemesis who do you really think is superior
theres a big difference between the living and the dead the fate of the future lies in the hands of the living
you will never get to enjoy your victory
it cant be 
for all agarthans  let there be light
its coming down
seiros 
ugh 
hang in there lady rhea
get her to her room quickly
thats a serious injury  its a miracle that shes even alive right now ill do what i can but 
goddess  please save lady rhea 
all we can do now is pray 
remember when this place was taken five years ago and a pure white beast appeared on the battlefield i only caught a glimpse of it but i didnt understand where it came from there were rumors that the goddess sent it to protect the monastery  but now i know better that beast was rhea
she tried to save me 
did you know rheas true identity
looking back on it now i suppose i did
i once showed you a picture of a creature known as the immaculate one seteth confiscated it saying it must have been one of tomas personal possessions the beast that appeared back then looked just like it so rhea is the immaculate one the book said it was a servant of the goddess but wouldnt it make sense if beasts like that are actually children of the goddess
 
rhea is in a grim state right now its possible she may not make it but we have things we must ask her about once things calm down a little lets go and see rhea together the truth cant be delayed any longer
/***EOF***/
now in control of the great bridge of myrddin the alliance army invades the imperial territories in response the imperial army garrisons soldiers at fort merceus
all of that went about as well as it could have each lord has agreed to provide us with soldiers and supplies
im impressed you were able to convince all of those scattered nobles to help us i thought they would quarrel about how much support they should each provide thats what they usually do
well count gloucester took the initiative in taking on responsibilities i presume that was because you spoke with him in advance lorenz
i merely explained the situation at hand then my father simply followed your lead claude it was because you had the professor there to represent lady rhea my father is a pious follower of the church of seiros
i dont doubt it i wasnt under the delusion that it was my personal charm that unified everyone thanks for that by the way i hope you dont feel like i used you  because i sort of used you
dont mention it
i appreciate that we dont have time to be picky about our methods but be honest youre having a hard time adjusting to your new role arent you
im not well pleased
i understand youre having a hard time adjusting to your new role arent you you werent even a follower of seiros to being with and somehow youve ended up as a representative of the church
i realize that you might feel guilty about deceiving the believers for our cause 
i have news our enemy is gathering troops at fort merceus their army is immense likely led by a renowned general or perhaps even 
edelgard
well now that would be interesting if we can defeat the emperor then the empire will collapse
the flame emperor
perhaps but shes more than that now shes the actual emperor if we can defeat her the empire will collapse
theres something else an unidentified army has approached the great bridge of myrddin they passed through the daphnel and gloucester territories from the northwest with incredible speed theyre raising the banner of house blaiddyd perhaps they are the remnants of the faerghus royal family from what we could tell they posed no threat to the citizens of the alliance and so we refrained from engaging them in needless combat
maybe they hope to fight against the empire to avenge their fallen prince and what about the bridge itself
obviously we wouldnt let them pass without receiving envoys first we thought they may try to force their way through we considered firing warning arrows but they left immediately heading east
are they intending to use one of the bridges in ordelia territory
most likely but the imperial army still controls those bridges i cant imagine what they intend to do in the empire even if they do manage to break through 
im reluctant to ease up on our surveillance but it would be difficult to track them there  for now lets assume theyre just troops belonging to the old kingdom in any case we should proceed with caution soon well be entering empire territory ourselves if our enemies are going to intercept us with an attack  it will probably be at gronder field  how fitting that it was the site of the battle of the eagle and lion five years ago
we secured the win in our first skirmish but the next battle is a different matter the empire will come after us with everything its got even so the ultimate victory will be ours and im not just saying that ive made ample preparations to ensure our victory its my rule to never leave victory to chance you cant rely on the protection of the goddess with your power and my schemes i should be able to plot a direct course to victory
house gloucester has changed its allegiance and joined the faction that is against the empire the alliance will thus remain united but thanks to this latest ploy my father is more suspicious of claude now than ever if such a thing is possible ordinarily i might credit his helpful posture towards us to his devout faith in the church of seiros but it is clear to me now that this is nothing more than a shrewd calculation on his part he is only thinking of his position we are in the clear for now but please bear in mind that the alliance is never an entirely stable union
i gotta say its tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield
its like when we were fighting before  i saw lorenz and wasnt sure what to do with myself
everyone gets that feeling
so you cant avoid it huh how did everything get so messed up
you can run away if you want
hey come on even i know we cant do that
just because were fighting someone doesnt mean we gotta hate em thats probably the worst thing about war win or lose i still get a bad taste in my mouth
thanks to our victory ive been able to study the great bridge of myrddin at my leisure and you know what its an astounding structure so much history there imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big over water no less i hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of fódlan   a historical site rather than a military checkpoint
i trust you and claude but i feel uneasy if we lose in the next battle the empires army will likely come surging into alliance territory if that happens my parents wont escape unharmed theyve raised their anti imperial flag after all
i wont let that happen
thank you professor ill fight with all ive got too
we cant take back what weve done
youre right i chose my path i must press on thats all anyone can do really
speaking with you has eased my mind a bit just enough in fact to put me in the mood for sweets
ive been praying to the goddess for lorenz  we wouldnt have had to fight like that if things were different
um i heard that some unidentified troops have appeared but  apparently they were flying the flag of the faerghus royal family  do you think it was dimitris ghost his country was taken before he ever wore the crown surely he must regret that 
poor lorenz he and i werent very close but we were friends
claude was saying that our next battle might be in gronder field is that right reminds me of the battle of the eagle and lion but of course that was a very different time when it was over all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery and then we had a party but we can never go back to that can we
we might see edelgard herself leading the enemy in the next battle if theyre coming out of fort merceus our troops might even clash on gronder field and those other troops on the march   who knows what theyll do or what side theyll take not sure how were supposed to form a strategy with so many unknowns
dont worry i can handle it
i dont know why youre so confident but it does somehow make me feel better
as long as youre here ill be fine
hey how come you only ever flatter me in times like these what am i supposed to make of that
anyways weve come this far lets just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get
we captured the great bridge of myrddin but the fight has only just begun enbarr the imperial capital lies far to the south beyond gronder field and waiting on the way there is the entire imperial army with twice as many troops as us we had better brace ourselves
i seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead if someone has passed even someone dear to me i could stand about and wail or get on with my life while im at it that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead i dont understand that either if i didnt like them when they were alive then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here
after we cross the great bridge of myrddin well be in my fathers territory we actually crossed it five years ago for the battle of eagle and lion remember ugh this is terrifying what am i gonna do i gotta get a grip 
dont worry ill arrange for your funeral
you think well meet him on the battlefield and hell kill me the front lines cover a long stretch of land you know we might not even run into him
ill pray for your safety
oh no no no you should pray we dont run into him at all the front lines cover a long stretch of land you know
so the campaign continues does it well allow me as a professional recluse with ten years of experience to volunteer for um staying behind oh who am i kidding the fighting wont stop until weve defeated edelgard will it or until we lose i guess but theres not much use in thinking about that
the great bridge of myrddin was considerably better fortified than it was five years ago  the bridge was full of soldiers and they all died
and ferdie was there we killed ferdie professor he used to be our friend do you remember those days
nobles who are changing allegiance again and again i do not have understanding for that how can you trust if treason comes with ease how can you be calling yourself a noble i do not have understanding of the reasoning 
theyre struggling for survival too
surviving is more difficult without trust there must be some other goal
for personal gain
survival has more importance than that are they not knowing this
so the boar prince is dead decapitated i hear i havent seen the severed head myself perhaps hes still alive and leading that army 
would you be able to fight him
dont patronize me if his head is still attached to his body ill remedy that without hesitation
dont get distracted
youre right i cant let my emotions take hold
either way a major battle awaits us try not to die ill be annoyed if you did
if we defeat the imperial army at gronder field what will our next objective be i guess we wont have much choice but to try to take fort merceus on the far side of gronder field its probably too soon for us to be thinking about that isnt it the battle just ahead of us is far from certain
the times come to fight the empire huh wow its shaping up to be quite the battle and ive got no problem with that but that mystery army really worries me theres no indication if theyre friend or foe  who do you think they are professor
remnants of the old kingdom
i suppose its possible after all his highness is supposedly dead
dimitri himself
heh not unless he rose from the grave to secure revenge that would mean  actually i have no idea what that would mean
well whoever they are i hope we can avoid fighting them
so were finally going to set foot in the empire im starting to get a little nervous
we already fought ferdinand at the great bridge of myrddin but 
i guess theres a good chance well be fighting more old friends from here on out
claude seems filled with confidence but i wonder if everything really will be ok  the imperial army might be hiding the emperor and the troops headed south might belong to the old kingdom ill be honest  im incredibly uneasy about all this but at this point theres no option but to move forward
ive cut all contact with my family since joining this fight were i to see soldiers of the galatea family amidst the host flying the royal familys banner  i  well all chance of reconciliation with my father would end there i do not know if that is the right path but the fact is ive come this far theres no time for second guessing not anymore
each time we press forward our search for rhea broadens to a wider area i certainly hope we will find at least some clue but i do suspect i already know where she is if i am right and she is in the imperial capital then we cannot save her until we topple the empire
the battle of the eagle and lion has it truly been five years since then can you recall whether it was before or after i joined your class professor
before
that is not at all the case professor your memory serves you poorly
after
im glad you have not forgotten
it was shortly after i joined your class   i remember it like it was yesterday
when undertaking research the usual methods is to form a hypothesis then test it with experiments those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods yet sometimes they also unveil an exception you seem to be that exception when it comes to my crest research
sorry about that
i dont understand
worry not professor exceptions are what make my work interesting why dont the rules apply to you i will find our eventually i feel it is my destiny as a crest scholar
i hear the next battle could be a big one is that true i miss the old days when if someone got hurt wed rush them to the infirmary and make them well  but on the battlefield theres not enough time to help people die professor dont be one of those
word just reached me that the empire has stationed soldiers in fort merceus if they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort well be in a difficult situation i hear its an impregnable keep surrounded by high ramparts taking it would not be easy
beyond the great bridge of myrddin its all unfamiliar territory for us we dont know where lady rhea is being held we ought to investigate all potential locations thoroughly the knights of seiros will handle the search well report back if we learn anything
reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory if i dont come back assume im dead
i know you wont get caught
im glad you think so highly of me but we have to be realistic
understood
good we have to be realistic
dont waste your energy worrying about me
i gotta keep this place clean and i mean properly clean every day dust it sweep it everything you never can tell when lady rhea might be back
since little claude became their leader the alliance lords havent been especially unified now theyre suddenly united for a common cause as a result the empire hasnt been able to perform even one successful incursion  rather were the ones who might get the jump on them its incredible magical even maybe his strategic genius was simmering for those five years and it returned to a full boil once you two were reunited or maybe he always knew hed meet you again and he was preparing for that this whole time 
greetings professor nothing to report i hear were sending troops to gronder field next is that whats what that whole area is in the territory of house bergliez its famous as the main granary of fódlan if we could capture it we probably wouldnt have to worry about food anymore bread for all
gronder field should be around here right but its so foggy  even if there were enemies here wed never know it
i recall the terrain from the battle of the eagle and lion but without the ability to see the enemys formation 
our enemies are subject to the same conditions well just have to wait for the fog to clear up
speaking of enemies what do you think became of those unidentified troops any follow up reports
we havent heard anything since if they were headed this way  well id like to avoid being caught by surprise but we cant make use of our scouts because of this fog its hard to predict this fight theres no way to know what will happen
im worried
we did everything we could to prepare if we lose despite that then well just have to accept it as fate and retreat
lets try to stay calm
of course the morale of our allies would be crushed if we let them see us shaking in our boots
your guidance is going to be crucial teach now more than ever do whatever it takes to lead us to victory
departing from the great bridge of myrddin the alliance army marches south towards enbarr the imperial capital an unknown military force begins their advance under the banner of the kingdom the imperial army dispatches forces from fort merceus with the intention of interrupting them the curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies which will come to be known as the battle at gronder held on the same plains that witnessed the battle of the eagle and lion
at gronder field where the battle of the eagle and lion was once held the house leaders of five years ago have a fateful reunion but this time the contest between the empire the kingdom and the alliance is no mock battle
i will crush anyone who blocks my path
dimitri  hes alive but he doesnt look interested in joining forces with us
it would not be advantageous to take on both at once we must stop the kingdom and the alliance from joining forces i will create such chaotic warfare that they wont be able to tell who is friend and who is foe
mounted units advance
there are enemies in the central area  we need to head there immediately to protect it
the center is in danger of being taken we must be running to protect it
the imperial army is starting to crumble we will step on the empire right along with the alliance troops to the eternal flames with all of them
how kind of our enemies to fight one another and open flanks as well generous
if theyre going to stand in our way they must die smash them to pieces it is time someone take the central hill
those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives  in the crimson flames
this is not as i planned but theres nothing to be done burn the central hill
the central hill is up in smoke suppose ill have to quench the flames   with the enemys blood
even in an ugly battle like this its important not to lose heart we have to take pride in our victory we did it teach now we can move forward to our victory
want to die step forward ill take you all
not here  not like this 
felix 
we all choose our paths and ive chosen mine i fight for my lord to the death
your highness  i  failed you 
ingrid 
huh i guess this is fate sorry but i need you to please give up quietly ok
heh im not afraid  i figured it would end like this
 
oh i havent seen you in so long its such a shame we have to meet like this 
im  im sorry dimitri  i cant seem to stay  on my feet
hmph 
in the name of high highness you die here
i  can still fight your highness
shut up and retreat you must live dedue
are you trying to stop me too then ill just have to kill you
youre not worth it get out of my sight
where are you edelgard i will not stop until i kill you
calm down dimitri what does it achieve us killing each other here
move claude i have no time to exchange words with you
it doesnt matter what im saying does it you arent even listening but im not gonna budge
so  edelgard retreated i suppose she lives to be defeated another day
thats fine
i suppose a win is a win regardless of the circumstances
it was close
too close but i suppose all that matters is that we won
some of our allies are injured but can still fight well just have to accept this outcome and press onward still the battlefield looks awful and i wonder what became of the kingdom army and dimitri 
i saw him
who dimitri
he was completely different from how i remember him he looked like a crazed demon while he was fighting he pursued edelgard as she retreated but he didnt get far before he collapsed i saw him surrounded by imperial troops and  pierced by their spears ill never forget it he deserved a better end
dimitri  he went through so much to make it here only for his efforts to be in vain
i cant even begin to understand what dimitri must have been feeling but  there must have been some other way why did he have to go like that
and his vassal dedue  did he fall as well
i dont know 
your highness your ambitions are my own now i  i will bring you edelgards head  i swear it
professor claude may i have a moment of your time
lysithea what are you doing up this late trouble sleeping
thats understandable
we all have nights like that
anyone would be shaken after such a brutal battle if youre having trouble sleeping you should drink some warm milk thats a thing right
must you treat me like a child simply because i am awake a bit later than usual actually i can hardly muster any indignation right now i wanted to tell you that i noticed something odd during that battle
what was it
there were some strange mages among the ranks of the imperial army did you notice them
the ones wearing masks
the ones dressed in black
thats right i have seen people dressed just like that before it was a long time ago  house ordelia was involved in a rebellion that took place within the empire 18 years ago after it was quelled all of the key officials were caught and put to death the empire sent replacements who they used to take control of house ordelia among the people sent by the empire were mages dressed in black just like those we saw in battle
if theyre imperial mages it would make sense that they would wear the same clothing right
yes but the mages from back then and today  i do not believe they are from the adrestian empire
are they kingdom mages
are they alliance mages
no i got the impression that they were from somewhere else somewhere completely separate from fódlan theres more those mages imprisoned the children from my house and performed horrible rituals on them blood experiments
lysithea  you cant mean  even you
yes all of the others were deemed failures they all died and even i  it doesnt matter the point is that those monsters possess dreadful knowledge and power i just thought you should know the sort of people who have allied with the empire
blood experiments  does that remind you of anything teach
the incident with flayn 
that incident with the flame emperor 
exactly there was that secret group who abducted flayn and extracted her blood five years ago the people involved back then were tomas and monica  well i suppose their true names were solon and kronya so that eerie group has been slithering behind the scenes in the empire for a while now  lysithea  thank you for sharing all of that with us one day we will uncover the truth of who those people really are
weve managed to invade empire territory and emerge victorious in our first battle i hope to maintain our momentum and push onward to enbarr the imperial capital unfortunately we are not legendary heroes in a fairytale our stamina has limits the longer we fight the harder the fight will become it will take immense effort to secure the supplies and soldier we need to prevail
boy you better not be saying this is as far as we go
of course not however the road ahead leads deep into enemy territory it will be a difficult journey strewn with hardship i cant guarantee that well make it out alive if anyone wants to leave now is the time to do it
i shall accompany you to the very end after all someone must step up to take leadership should you fall
im coming the future of my village depends on this besides  i have to protect the professor for captain jeralt
im not going anywhere because of the empire my little sis cant live in peace
we cant leave the future of fódlan to others im sure that everyone here feels the same
the knights of seiros will keep fighting the empire we wont rest until we rescue lady rhea
i feel the same as the knights ive gotta rescue lady rhea no matter what
so what   were all supposed to take turns saying well do our best until the very end and what about you marianne what will you do
i  ill fight too
fine fine i suppose ill tag along too  until the bitter end
its an honor to keep fighting alongside such stalwart allies right teach
id expect nothing less from my students
hey now when you put it that way it almost sounds like youre just praising yourself
youre a stalwart ally too claude
i know im a great leader and all but praising me isnt gonna get you anywhere
all right now that i know where each of you stands im going to return to alliance territory for a while i intend to report this victory to alliance lords and draw out even more support from them our next battle will be even more challenging so brace yourselves for that
hmm  i should write to my brother hell want to hear about our victory
your brother lord holst how is he these days
oh hes doing great i even got a letter from him before the last battle he wanted to come and join our fight too
whats this lord holst come here that would be a most reassuring development
sadly it sounds like my father was against the idea they wanted him to stay in case they need to fight the almyrans
their logic is sound though it is vexing that the alliances greatest general cannot join us on the front lines
we should be glad that holst is staying behind almyra aside theres also no guarantee that the imperial forces wont try to launch a surprise attack from the old kingdom territory
um  if you have something you need to talk to my brother about id be happy to send a letter
no thats ok im just glad to hear hes doing well please send him my regards
