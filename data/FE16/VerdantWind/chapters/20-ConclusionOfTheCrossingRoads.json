As Her Majesty would never surrender to another, I can only assume she has fallen as well. It greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass... That said, as the survivors, I must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead. You must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark. I am sure you must recall Monica and Tomas. Their allies yet live. They hold deep resentment against the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and they are biding their time until they can exact revenge. If left to their own devices, it is certain they will eventually bring unimaginable calamity and suffering to the world. I detected their sorcery when you took Fort Merceus. I have deduced the location of their stronghold, Shambhala. You will find its whereabouts enclosed. There is no question that they are the enemies of everyone in F\u00f3dlan. Do not allow yourselves to forget that. Lastly... While I cannot say she is in good health, the archbishop resides in a secret chamber in the Imperial palace. I have shared the location of the entrance to that secret chamber with the person to whom I have entrusted this letter. I believe that Her Majesty will be victorious... Even still, I must plan for her defeat as well. If you wish to lead this world, I challenge you to rise to the occasion and surpass my estimation of you. Such is your obligation as the victors... and the only fitting tribute to all that Lady Edelgard sacrificed."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Hubert... To leave a letter like this behind... You were a better man than I believed you to be. So, Rhea is alive. And the fight isn't over yet. Those who slither in the dark... It sounds like F\u00f3dlan will never know peace unless we defeat them."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "The allies of Monica and Tomas... Well, we knew about them already. I think it's safe to assume this is the same group who used Lysithea for their blood experiments. And they were also responsible for the javelins of light that destroyed the fortress. But who are these children of the goddess, who they supposedly resent? There's just not enough information here. I don't suppose there's any chance of his idea of a prank... If so, wow. Good one. Hubert... Rather than writing a letter, you should have just told us before we fought..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Let's ask Rhea about it."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Right. We still don't know for sure if this letter is telling the truth. Let's go find out."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "You... You have come to save me... Is this... Is this a dream? I have longed to see you again... all this time... Is it truly you?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Claude... I can see you have grown into a reliable young man... Thank you for supporting the professor, and for rescuing me. Surely the protection of the goddess has-"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Wait, Rhea. What do you know about the children of the goddess?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Children of... What is this about?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Forgive my bluntness. Someone from the Empire filled us in on a few things. I know it must be painful for us to ask you difficult questions after such an arduous confinement. But we have no choice. We must defeat a secret enemy... Those who slither in the dark. Do you know about them?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Those who slither in the dark..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Apparently, they resent the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and are planning something big. Something terrible."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "They use blood for their wicked magic and are capable of dropping javelins of light from the sky, which are powerful enough to crush a fortress. If you can think of anything at all, please tell us now. We need to know as much as possible about these enemies in order to stop them."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "This is the critical moment that will determine whether or not F\u00f3dlan falls! Can't you see that the time for secrets has passed?!"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "It is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of F\u00f3dlan since ancient times. I am sure you have heard the stories of a man named Nemesis..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The King of Liberation..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The wielder of the Sword of the Creator..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Nemesis, the King of Liberation. He's the hero to whom the goddess gave the Sword of the Creator."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits. He plundered the Holy Tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god. When Nemesis appeared in Zanado some time later, he already wielded the Sword of the Creator."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "In Zanado?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Zanado, the Red Canyon..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "How did he get the Sword of the Creator?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "According to legend, the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "I do not know how Nemesis obtained the sword, or why he appeared in Zanado. But he used that sword to massacre the people there. The children of the progenitor god. From their corpses he gained even more power, and brought war to F\u00f3dlan..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "That's completely different from what the legends tell us about Nemesis."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "A mere bandit like Nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Aha! So Nemesis had accomplices. And those accomplices must have been those who slither in the dark. They used Nemesis! And this time they used the Imperial army to once again bring war to F\u00f3dlan! I finally get it... And I even understand why Edelgard was associating with them. Just as they were trying to use the Empire, the Empire was trying to use them. Rhea, there's still a mountain of things I need to ask you. And I will. But I'll leave all of that for another day. You must be weak after living in confinement for so long. Please rest for a while. My friend... Let's prepare for battle. We need to strike Shambhala as soon as possible."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "You must not allow F\u00f3dlan's bloody history... the Red Canyon Tragedy... to repeat itself..."}], "dialogue": [{"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Hm. It occurred to me that we never got an answer from Rhea about the children of the goddess."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Aren't they the people of Zanado?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "She did say that the people of the Red Canyon were the children of the progenitor god, so I suppose so. But those evil guys continue to plot their revenge even after the Red Canyon Tragedy. Does that mean some of the children of the goddess, or their descendants, are still alive?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Rhea?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Could be. She was talking about what happened in Zanado as if she was there herself."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Flayn?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "If there's something special about her blood, we can't rule out the possibility."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Me?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Huh. Maybe? Though I get the feeling you're something else altogether."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "What are these children anyway? And how are they connected to the goddess? Bah! I almost disappeared into the bottomless swamp that is my mind. I thought that after we defeated the Empire, I'd be able to see that sight I long to see.."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What sight is that?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I've told you about my dreams before... I want to break down the wall separating F\u00f3dlan from the outside world. The sight I want to see lies beyond that. Honestly, it's a trivial thing to fixate on. Just people, gathered in their towns. Living our their lives together. Sometimes laughing. Sometimes fighting. But the people living there aren't just citizens of F\u00f3dlan. They are people from Dagda, Brigid, and even Duscur and Sreng. There could be people who were born in Almyra or countries even farther east there too.. All of those people living together, like it's nothing special at all. That's the sight I long to see. It's so simple, but still so far away... But this is no time for complaining. We need to focus on capturing Shambhala. Let's hurry up and gather everyone together."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "So... you mean to tell me that F\u00f3dlan will fall to ruin if we leave those guys be?"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Um, if this map is reliable, their base is just south of my family's territory."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "This story is a bit much to believe... And yet..."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "It does ring true somehow."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Remember Monica, the one who killed Jeralt? And the old man who was masquerading as Tomas? They were their allies. And the Flame Emperor and the Death Knight were merely their pawns."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "The people who were after my blood?!"}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "They were also the ones who used me to conduct their blood experiments..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "As awful as it sounds, they're seemingly fond of using blood in their secret techniques."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Eww! That's really gross! I could never be friends with someone like that."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I believe they were also responsible for the javelin of light that destroyed Fort Merceus."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "Hold up, boy. Do you really think that we can win against such powerful foes?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I don't know. But we have to try, don't we?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "This is for F\u00f3dlan's future."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "We've really taken on something big. I wonder if our names will go down in history."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "My heroic name? Passed down to future generations? Haha! A worthy cause indeed."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's our responsibility as the victors."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Since Edelgard can't do it, I guess it falls to us."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "They were trying to use the Imperial army to plunge F\u00f3dlan into war, but we nipped that in the bud. Now we just need to tear our their roots. And I know we have what it takes to do it."}]}
