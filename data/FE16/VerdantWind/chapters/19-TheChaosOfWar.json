What does that even mean, and who is which?"}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Oh, um... I was just thinking that if we're the birds, then those two are like the trees and the wind.

It's going to be a tough battle."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "I was taught from a young age to believe that the creed of Seiros was just the way of the world. To question it never even occurred to me. But Claude and Edelgard are different. They challenge the common wisdom. Even defy it. It is uncomfortable to discard familiar assumptions.

I should write that down."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it!

I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "We're finally going to the capital. This will be my chance to avenge Captain Jeralt.

But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild F\u00f3dlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "They used to call Enbarr the city of Seiros... To assault it, together with the knights, is surreal. If Seiros were alive today, I wonder what she might make of our war... In Enbarr, there was once a Southern Church, and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it. A hundred years ago, the Southern Church became entangled in an insurrection.

I better make my peace with that."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "Professor! My, um, my mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father. If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "The whole of the capital is going to be a battleground. The city has such a long heritage\u2026 Even so, perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once. But we can\u2019t let the commonfolk get hurt. We should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Five years ago...Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire.

So now, my path and her path will be colliding."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "The Death Knight is no ordinary knight. I will prey upon him. I will quench my blade's thirst with his blood. His focus is on fighting you, I'm sure. But mine will be the last face he sees."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in Fort Merceus.

Assuming it was the work of the Imperial army..."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "So Enbarr, the Capital of the Empire. It's finally time. I never thought I'd live this long.

I never thought my return would be like this..."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Enbarr\u2026 Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be returning like this. Of course, most of the nobles in the Empire make their home in the capital. In the Kingdom, all nobles live in their own domains. So if the capital is attacked, it doesn't necessarily affect them directly. What will happen to the Imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield?"}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Once this battle is over, what will become of Faerghus and F\u00f3dlan?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Peace will reign."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Peace, you say?

She's waiting for you."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. The final target was the capital.

Even I'm starting to feel tense! Me! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire.
