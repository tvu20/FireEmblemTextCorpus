Those mewling lords kept me from leaving for quite some time."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "So? Were you able to secure additional reinforcements?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "It's gonna have to wait until next month. It doesn't look like they can afford to keep supporting us at present."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "Then what should we do about Fort Merceus? Do you plan on waiting around?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "No. If we wait until next month, the enemy will have bolstered their defenses. That said, the prevailing theory is that you need triple your enemies' forces to take a fortress with a frontal assault."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Right, that's what we were taught at the academy. And this is Fort Merceus we're talking about. It's renowned for its strong defenses."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Our current army isn't nearly strong enough. Hmm... What to do..."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "Whatever you do, just don't ask us to scale those huge walls.

You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You can tell how your muscles are feeling?"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Of course!

You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "The battle at Gronder Field was gruesome, wasn't it?

That seems safer."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Claude takes care of the strategy, you direct the troops, and the rest of us focus on the fighting.

Why did his followers not intervene? His attendants? I used to call Edelgard my leader, and now she is running amok. I am duty-bound to stop her."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "There's word that Claude has developed a rather interesting stratagem to capture the fortress.

Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid...

Why did I even bother asking?"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "So many people died in the battle at Gronder... And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think of war as theater, with the stage an entire continent."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Though the actors die, the show goes on?"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must unaffected."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It really doesn't seem like theater."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why's that?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Because it's like hunting?"}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "My relationship with the boar prince began even before I was born. He was always by my side. You might even say that, at one time, we were best friends."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What do you mean, best friends?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What happened?"}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "I couldn't fathom the depth of his hatred for the Empire.

Just like His Highness."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We can't know that for certain."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "That's true. I did hear that his body was never found."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Don't believe everything you hear."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "You're right.

A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Seems F\u00f3dlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose..."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all! And if I'm honest... sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Hilda's quite a tactician! Disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in, undetected. A stroke of brilliance. With this strategy, we can really snatch victory from the jaws of...deceit!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's a good point."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? Deceit? Again?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's a bad pun."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "I hardly recognize everyone... Their faces have changed so much. More experience in the eyes, and more pain.

Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea...

Thanks to Edelgard's strength, the Imperial army is more unified than I would have expected. It was a painful realization, but after our battle at Gronder Field, it's clear that we can't win if we don't pull out all the stops. I also realized something else during that battle. There really is something special about you, Teach. The reason we were all able to keep our cool in the midst of the chaos was because we all trust in you. In your command and in your strength. Everyone here believes that we will win as long as we have you on our side. Our faith in you is borderline religious. You and I... We have what it takes to free F\u00f3dlan from the Empire's rule.

Are really going to just leave me here and run away?"}, {"speaker": "Nader", "line": "I hope to see you again, Judith. And you too, Professor. I'll be praying for your safety!"}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "Nader? Are you saying that Nardel is actually Nader the Unstoppable?!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Unstoppable?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "It's actually Nader the Undefeated. Almyrans love grand titles."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "I knew he was no ordinary person, but to think he was the great hero of Almyra..."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Hey, um, can we really afford to be chatting right now? If another one of those javelins of light falls, we're all dead!"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Claude. There are things I wish to ask you, but first we must hurry and withdraw."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Right you are. Come on, everyone! Let's hurry up and get out of here."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Claude. It is time for you to explain. Why are you so close with an Almyran general?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Well, he did quite a bit for me when I was younger."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "When you were younger... So, before you joined House Riegan. How and where did you meet him? There aren't many opportunities to meet a general from Almyra in F\u00f3dlan..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "If that's what you believe, it's only because that's what you've been led to believe. After all, we have Cyril here among our allies, and he was born in Almyra."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Hey, now. Don't drag me into this."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "There's a big, wide world outside of F\u00f3dlan, and it's overflowing with different places and cultures. You think interacting with outsiders is odd, but isn't avoiding contact with the outside world far more unnatural?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Don't change the subject, Claude. To the people of the Alliance, the Almyrans are-"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "It's true that there's a history of hostility, but why should that mean we're doomed to remain hostile forever? The Almyrans aren't monsters. Just look at Cyril! Does he look like a monster to you?"}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Right, Teach? What did you think when you met Nader?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He's... interesting."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He's a reliable general."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Ha! I'll tell him you said that. And I'm sure that if all of you got to know him, all of your preconceived notions would change too. I know you guys, and you aren't the type of people to reject someone without trying to get to know them."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "But... how did those Almyrans even get past F\u00f3dlan's Throat? I doubt my brother would just let them pass without saying anything..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "About that... I actually made sure your brother met Nader in advance."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "What?! Lord Holst met with an Almyran general?"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Oh, so that's why you were so interested in my brother. But wait, they're supposed to be bitter enemies! They've fought each other several times before!"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I know. It was a big gamble. But rather than having me try to convince them myself, I knew it would be easier to just have them meet. They were taken aback at first, but sure enough, they hit it off. They were even drinking to their newfound brotherhood before parting."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "It makes sense. If you take the greatest heroes away from the battlefield, of course they'll get along."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Fighting one minute and drinking together the next... Men are so weird!"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Ultimately, someone's bloodline has nothing to do with the friendships they forge. Relations between the Alliance and Almyra is a matter we'll tackle in the future. Still, I want to take this opportunity to make one thing clear to all of you. After we defeat the Empire, I intend to tear down the walls that separate F\u00f3dlan from the outside world. I want to let people and goods come and go freely, and in doing so, eradicate prejudices about the outside world."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Huh?!"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Would it even be possible to achieve such a thing? It directly contradicts the Seiros tenets."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Does it? I'm not so sure. I'm any case, I'm prepared for the inevitable protests and criticism. New ways of doing things are always met with resistance. During our time at the Officer's Academy, all of you overcame the barriers of birthplace, status, and ideology. Having gone through so much with all of you, I have no doubt that, in time, you'll understand."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "I guess there were a lot of different people there. People we wouldn't have met through the normal course of our lives."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Duscur once opposed the Kingdom, but there was someone from Duscur there. Brigid once invaded the Empire, but the Brigid princess was there. We ate at the same table as those people. Sure, sometimes we didn't get along. But other times, we helped each other out. Can we really draw a definitive line in the sand and say one group of people is all good, and another all bad? If I can realize my dream, F\u00f3dlan will be reborn. The old age will end and we'll welcome a new dawn."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "But, if-"}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "Save your objections for another day, Gloucester boy."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Ugh..."}, {"speaker": "Judith", "line": "That said, there are more pressing matters to discuss. Our next step is to invade the Imperial capital, right?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "That's right. I'm sure Edelgard is eagerly awaiting our arrival in Enbarr. Reinforcements from the Alliance lords should arrive soon. Let's make sure we're ready to greet them."}]}
