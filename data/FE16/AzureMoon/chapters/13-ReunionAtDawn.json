Watch as the Kingdom you love falls to ashes."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "It was soon after announced that his sentence had been carried out. With His Highness\u2019s death, the royal bloodline of House Blaiddyd was erased from this world. True to her word, all we could do was watch as she tore the Kingdom apart before our eyes. Since the execution and the prince\u2019s corpse were concealed from the public, there have always been those who believed His Highness was still alive\u2026 As for myself, I only began to hope three years ago, when I chanced upon some compelling rumors\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What rumors?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "An Imperial platoon attacked without warning.

I imagine it will not be a quick or easy conversation. I pray that he is of a mind to speak of such things. I am certain that my words will\u2026 Never mind. What must be done, must be done. I would wager that you are weary after the day\u2019s events. Perhaps you should take this opportunity to get some rest."}]}
