You have no idea what you're talking about. Death is the end. No matter how much lingering regret a person has, after death, they are powerless. They cannot even wish for revenge, much less seek it out. Hatred. Regret. Those burdens fall on the shoulders of those who are left behind. And so I must continue down this path! I already told you as much! It is far too late to stop."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You're wrong."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "There must be another way."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Do not waste your breath with some nonsense about how I should move on with my life for their sake.

They will not loose their hold on me so easily."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "But you seem to have all the answers... So tell me, professor. Please, tell me... How do I silence their desperate pleas? How do I... How do I save them?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Ever since that day nine years ago... I have lived only to avenge the fallen.

I am once again in your debt."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "As powerful as our knights are, we're outnumbered. By a long shot. This won't be easy. It's crazy to attempt this. I guess I'm crazy to go along with it."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "If we defeat the Imperial army at Gronder Field, what will our next objective be? I guess we won't have much choice but to try to take Fort Merceus, on the far side of Gronder Field. It's probably too soon for us to be thinking about that, isn't it? The battle just ahead of us is far from certain."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Say we do manage to take down Edelgard here... What do you think His Highness will do next?

I'm starting to get a little nervous. I guess there's a good chance we'll be fighting more old friends from here on out."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "The thought of fighting people who were once our friends...it makes my heart heavy.

I'm having a hard time with it."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "It did often seem strange to me at the academy that we were studying with all these people from all over the world. But I feel like I've finally started to understand the real reason behind it.

Enbarr, the Imperial Capital, lies far to the south, beyond Gronder Field. And waiting for us on the way there is the entire Imperial army, with twice as many troops as us. We had better brace ourselves."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "I seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead. If someone has passed, even someone dear to me, I could stand about and wail or get on with my life. While I'm at it, that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead? I don't understand that either. If I didn't like them when they were alive, then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here?"}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "After we cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in my father's territory. We actually crossed it five years ago for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Remember? Ugh! This is terrifying! What am I gonna do? I gotta get a grip..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'll pray for your safety."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!"}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "So the campaign continues, does it? Well, allow me, as a professional recluse with ten years of experience, to volunteer for, um...staying behind. Oh, who am I kidding? The fighting won't stop until we've defeated Edelgard, will it? Or until we lose, I guess. But there's not much use in thinking about that."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "The Great Bridge of Myrddin was considerably better fortified that it was five years ago... The bridge was full of soldiers...and they all died.  And Ferdie was there. We killed Ferdie, Professor, he used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?"}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Nobles who are changing allegiance, again and again. I do not have understanding for that. How can you trust if treason comes with ease? How can you be calling yourself a noble? I do not have understanding of the reasoning..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "They're struggling for survival too."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "For personal gain."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "So, Claude and my father have made peace. That is to be expected. They both prioritize their own interests above all else. So long as those interests are in alignment, they will continue to cooperate. And based on that reasoning, one might infer that the Alliance should be also willing to work with the Kingdom's military. I highly doubt Claude would refuse to assist us, if we were to ask."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "I gotta say, it's tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Everyone gets that feeling."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You can run away if you want."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Just because we're fighting someone doesn't mean we gotta hate 'em! That's probably the worst thing about war. Win or lose, I still get a bad taste in my mouth."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Thanks to our victory, I've been able to study the Great Bridge of Myrddin at my leisure. And you know what? It's an astounding structure. So much history there. Imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big. Over water, no less! I hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of F\u00f3dlan--a historical site, rather than a military checkpoint."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I'm glad you're the one giving orders on the battlefield, Professor. I don't think we should trust Dimitri with that task... Although it's thanks to his obsession that we're wasting no time, taking the shortest route to defeating the Empire. I just can't see a bright future for this army, fighting as we are under the banner of a prince possessed. Even if we do succeed in defeating the Empire, I wonder what will become of F\u00f3dlan. I apologize. Whenever I'm with you, I speak more openly than I should. Please keep this between us."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "The situation in the Alliance has changed so much, but I haven't heard a word from my adoptive father... Do you think he's forgotten about me?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm sure he's just busy."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "If that's the case, I hope he gets even busier."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm sure that's not the case."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "I'm not overly concerned about him..."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "I'd actually be happier if he really did forget about me. Everything would be so much easier..."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "I heard the next battle might take us to Gronder Field. Is that right? Reminds me of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. But of course, that was a very different time. When it was over, all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery. And then we had a party. But we can never go back to that, can we?"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I heard Edelgard is going to be leading her forces personally in the next battle. Seems pretty reckless to charge right into this one. I'm not sure I like our chances. What do you think?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Don't worry. I can handle it."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "As long as you're here, I'll be fine."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Anyway, we've come this far. Let's just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Each time we press forward, our search for Rhea broadens to a wider area. I certainly hope we will find at least some clue, but I do suspect I already know where she is. If I am right, and she is in the Imperial capital, then we cannot save her until we topple the Empire."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "The Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Has it truly been five years since then? Can you recall whether it was before or after I joined your class, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Before."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "After."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "I am glad you have not forgotten."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "It was shortly after I joined your class--I remember it like it was yesterday."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "When undertaking research, the usual method is to form a hypothesis, then test it with experiments. Those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods, yet sometimes, they also unveil an exception. You seem to be that exception when it comes to my Crest research."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Sorry about that."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't understand."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Worry not, Professor. Exceptions are what make my work interesting. Why don't the rules apply to you? I will find out, eventually. I feel it is my destiny as a Crest scholar!"}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "I hear the next battle could be a big one, is that true? I miss the old days when, if someone got hurt, we'd rush them to the infirmary and make them well... But on the battlefield, there's not enough time to help. People die. Professor, don't be one of those!"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Catherine will surely be able to convince Count Charon. All that remains is to wait for a response from the Alliance side... For now, there are preparations to be made for the coming battle."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Catherine has successfully convinced Count Charon. However... The knights we sent to the Alliance have yet to return."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Word just reached me that the Empire has stationed soldiers in Fort Merceus. If they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort, we'll be in a difficult situation. I hear it's an impregnable keep, surrounded by high ramparts. Taking it would not be easy."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Hey, Professor. It\u2019s been a while... Well, actually not that long. If you\u2019re here about the reinforcements, no need to worry. I\u2019ve sorted everything out with my father. If the Alliance agrees to chip in as well, we might have a real chance at victory."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory. If I don't come back, assume I'm dead."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I know you won't get caught."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Understood."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Good. We have to be realistic."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Don't waste your energy worrying about me."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "I gotta keep this place clean, and I mean properly clean, every day. Dust it, sweep it, everything. You never can tell when Lady Rhea might be back."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "Hm? Oh, it's you, Professor. Sorry, I was a little lost in thought there. About all that has happened, and all that is to come... I'm sure the battles ahead will not be easy, but please take good care of His Highness."}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I hear we're sending troops to Gronder Field next. Is that what's what? That whole area is in the territory of House Bergliez. It's famous as the main granary of F\u00f3dlan. If we could capture it, we probably wouldn't have to worry about food anymore! Bread for all!"}], "intro": [{"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "There's quite a bit of fog settling in. We won't be able to advance our troops very far in this."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "We won't be able to move at all until the fog lifts, no matter which path we take. We'll have to be patient and wait it out. ... Gilbert. No... Gustave. I would like to take this opportunity to speak with you about something. It's about the Tragedy of Duscur. There's something about it I just can't wrap my head around."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "I'm listening."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "I lost a son in Duscur that day. I exhausted every last resource I had to investigate what took place there. I was startled to find that...there wasn't a single shred of evidence to suggest that Lady Patricia's carriage had been attacked."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Go on..."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "Apart from His Highness, whose injuries left him on the verge of death, everyone else present at the time was slaughtered. Of all the victims, only the corpse of Lady Patricia, His Majesty's second wife, was never found. Isn't that right?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Hmm... Surely that means she was abducted. There was no evidence of an attack, suggesting they threatened her but did not kill her..."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "But what reason would they have to take her? Would it not have been better to kill her?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Perhaps she had some value as a diplomatic pawn."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "Nonsense. In the many years since that day, has Lady Patricia ever been used thus?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "No... Not as far as I know. Then perhaps she was used for some political gain within the Empire."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "Now that her daughter is the emperor, what reason would she have to keep hiding her existence?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "It is possible she passed away after returning to the Empire..."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "Gustave, I know this is hard for you to hear, but just consider what it would mean if Lady Patricia was involved with that incident..."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Silence, Rodrigue. I will not allow you to tarnish her memory like that."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "I do not mean to imply that she arranged His Majesty's murder or anything of the like. But Gustave...

Gilbert! Please, hurry!"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "To kill like this...is inhuman."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "This is one of the knights who was dispatched to the leader of the Alliance.

It's difficult to say for sure who was behind this."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe it was the Empire..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Yes. I would not hesitate to believe them capable of this."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "Whatever the truth is, the other knights we dispatched are in serious danger. It's best to assume that joining with the Alliance is out of the question now."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Even with Count Charon's support, this makes our situation grim..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I never expected the Alliance to help us.
