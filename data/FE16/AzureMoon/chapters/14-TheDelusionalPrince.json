The major houses of Fraldarius, Gautier, Charon, and my own family, Galatea, remain loyal... But the lords of the minor domains in the west have almost entirely defected.

I'm sure we can take back the Kingdom's lands."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more than a title. But I will never lose my noble heart.

Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and the Alliance.

My realm of exquisite solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um.

She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means that common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "The Alliance is such a mess. How are we supposed to know where's safe and where's not? I should probably just move my little sis and grandpa to Garreg Mach. At least I could keep working on becoming a proper knight without having to worry about them! I gotta find them a house once things calm down a bit!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Oh, Professor! Seeing everyone together again, it's like I'm in a dream. I feel like it's time for me to forge my own path and find my own place in this world."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What about your family? Are they OK?"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Yes. They're in the Alliance, but they're merchants, so they have the means to escape if need be."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "How does your father feel about all this?"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "I sent him a letter. I'm still waiting on a reply, but I don't think he'd object to my being here. It'll be valuable for him, having someone outside the Alliance to keep him abreast of new information."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I should probably keep things to myself, but in all honesty... What matters to me, more than anything, is ensuring a peaceful, quiet future for my parents. I don't care about the Kingdom. I simply want to remove the threat of the Empire. Because of this, Dimitri's fixation on Edelgard is convenient to me. I fight for my own reasons and no others."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Professor... Is there any reason for me to remain here? I want to be useful, of course, but I'm not sure anyone needs me."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Then why did you stay?"}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "That was my adoptive father's decision.

So is Dimitri, honestly. If not for you arriving, Professor, I'd be heading home about now. Though staying here is still more appealing than living with my big brother."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I'm so glad I found you here, Professor. Now I don't have to worry about what to do with myself. Captain Jeralt told me to look out for you, after all. So now my purpose is clear.

You saved my life, and I am in your debt."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We can talk about that."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Uh, maybe later..."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years...

Oh, let me have my fun."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "We have given a proper burial to the Imperial soldiers kills in the monastery. The ones who were sent to investigate the thieves.

How could you be so reckless?"}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "I'd given up on seeing you again. Where have you been hiding?

I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to F\u00f3dlan.

I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died as well in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again.

I don't care if she's the emperor. It's no different than killing anyone else. So I beg you...all of you... Do not worry about my resolve. Please, Father... And you too, Stepmother... Do not gaze at me with that look in your eyes... I will bring you her head soon. And when I do, you may finally rest in peace. I know it...
