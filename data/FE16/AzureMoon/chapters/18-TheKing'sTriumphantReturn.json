There is no apology I could offer that would be sufficient."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Hmph. And how do you intend to make up for my father's death?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Felix... I realize words alone are not enough to repent, but I fear they are all I have."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "I\u2019m not after more empty words. I want you to speak through your actions."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "... I know that no amount of regret can ever bring back the lives we have lost. I... I know that well.

I wish to do the right thing from now on."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "That is why I have made a decision... I intend to take back the kingdom capital.

That's the only way I can atone for my sins."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Your highness... If we can win back Fhirdiad, it will give us the advantage in our war against the Empire. As one who has served the royal family for ages, know that your words bring me great joy. And pride. That said, I must point out that if we make for Fhirdiad, the Emperor's head will slip further out of reach. Can you live with that?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I still hold hatred in my heart for her and for the ones responsible for the tragedy... That, I will carry with me until death."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "But... my life is my own. It belongs to no one else, and it is high time that I started living for what I believe in.

Now, it's time to go to the Kingdom capital. I hope that you will lend me your strength once again."}, {"speaker": "Dedue", "line": "Everyone is saying His Highness is back to his old self, but I do not think that is accurate. What he was until recently is what he had been for as long as I've known him. So tortured by his compassion for the fallen that it had driven him mad. He has always been too kind to be king. He has always felt too much for the weak and the dead. That is exactly why I look up to him."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "He'll need to excel as a leader, if he's to make up for my old man's death. Though if my father could see Dimitri now, he'd be glad to have made the sacrifice. Don't you dare tell anyone I said that."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I was born and raised in Faerghus, but I've never actually been to Fhirdiad.

I'll check with His Highness."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "I don't feel like I can just forget all the awful stuff he's done... But if His Highness is owning up to his past, and trying to move forward... I figure I can give him that chance. We've been friends since we were kids. I'm gonna be there for him all the way to the end."}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "I agree that we should head for Fhirdiad, but let's not forget our search for Lady Rhea!

We're preparing for battle!"}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "It's just... when I think of us finally saving everyone in Fhirdiad, it makes me a little happy. OK, maybe a lot happy. The Kingdom capital is under the tight control of Cornelia, who was ennobled by the Empire. Judging by what we heard from Lord Rodrigue, it sounds like she's a tyrant. But all of that ends soon. Let's get there quickly!"}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "We buried Lord Rodrigue's body ourselves. There wasn't a time to do things properly. It pains me that I was unable to take him home to his territory. Once this war is over, I'd like to hold a proper funeral for him. For now, we need to focus on taking back Fhirdiad. All will be well eventually. I know we can win."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "Dimitri hated the Empire with a fiery passion. At Gronder, driven by fury, he sent many good knights to their doom... Now he appears to be freed from that hatred. If he can make thoughtful decisions, unswayed by his emotions, he may make a fine king someday."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Kings are only human."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "No, they are not. A king must strive to be a king first and a human second."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Kings can't have feelings?"}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "No, they cannot. Kingly judgment has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "There are stories of Heroes' relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today. So many, in fact, that I'm led to wonder if those Relics are nothing more than legends. Especially since we know of relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 F\u00f3dlan Elites."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "Can you believe it, Professor? Dimitri actually apologized to me! Remember that awful business between him and my uncle Randoph? He just came by and said he was sorry for all of that. That was behind us so far as I was concerned, but even so... It seem like he's changed for the better."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "It's always so peaceful coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And now we're headed to the Kingdom? That sounds hard! Oh, really hard!

Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We'll be fine."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "Of course you'd say that! Why'd I even ask?!"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "So many people died in the battle at Gronder... And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think of war as theater, with the stage an entire continent."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Though the actors die, the show goes on?"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must unaffected."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It really doesn't seem like theater."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Taking back the land of home has the most importance. That is why I am fighting...all for my land of home. Actually, there is more... I am also fighting for you and for everyone here."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "It seems we will soon set food in Fhirdiad. I used to live there, you know. Though that was before my time in the Officers Academy."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Were you a hostage?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "No, of course not. There is a school of magic there, which I was enrolled in for a time."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Were you a traveler?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "That's right I was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Trouble within the Kingdom forced me to return to Alliance lands. There was much I had yet to learn."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If your muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't see how you'd do that."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Whaddya mean, how? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You can tell how your muscles are feeling?"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "The battle at Gronder Field was gruesome, wasn't it? But perhaps it's irresponsible to look away\u2014to close our eyes to the horrors of war."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I agree."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You don't have to force yourself."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Thank you. But I think I do actually. As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "May an age of peace rise from the ashes, so that all this sacrifice means something."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I'm relieved the the prince seems to have finally come to his senses.

But now I think we're starting to see a sliver of hope for the future of F\u00f3dlan."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "I never used to care whether I lived or died... But after seeing so much death firsthand, I now realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little..."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Fhirdiad huh? I've always wanted to go there. But I rather be visiting for fun, and during a warmer season. And going into battle? Not exactly an appealing prospect! Heh, I'm just teasing. I'll do what I can to help. I'm just so relieved that Dimitri is his old self again."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Dimitri's completely changed. Or maybe I should say he's finally back to normal. Either way, I'm glad he's come around to the idea of retaking Fhirdiad. With our current troops, there's no way we could handle the Imperial capital. We wouldn't even get past Fort Merceus."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "It seems we are headed for the Kingdom capital this month. The Church of Seiros stands ready to lend its aid to you and Dimitri. It may be a roundabout route, but I believe this path will still eventually take us to Rhea. Besides\u2014saving the people of Faerghus is just what she would want us to do."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle... How inhuman is\u2014how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.s"}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "There's a school of sorcery in Fhirdiad, which is staffed by the top minds of magical research. The study of Crests and sorcery should not be separate. I've always thought I should pay them a visit someday. I never imagined I might end up invading the place with an army though. Not how I imagined it at all."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "Fighting with three different groups in the mix was as confusing as it was difficult to survive. Enemies and allies dying one of top of the other... What an absolute mess, huh? If only I had my infirmary out in Gronder, maybe I could have saved a few more lives."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "I am very grateful to you. I could never have achieved this on my own. This is all thanks to you and Lord Rodrigue. This month, we will invade Fhirdiad by way of the Fraldarius domain. Leave the negotiations with House Fraldarius to me. You make ready for the actual battle. It is a tricky business, but we are taking our first steps forward."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "The emperor was wounded at Gronder Field. What do you think is going on in the Empire now? The Leicester Alliance has really suffered a blow as well. Who knows what will become of them? From now on, we have to pay close attention to how the rest of F\u00f3dlan is doing."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "If we're headed to the Kingdom capital, that means we're further away from rescuing Lady Rhea. But it can't be helped, can it? Perhaps some people will question this decision, but I trust your judgement. Lady Rhea would want us to help in Fhirdiad. She'd scold us if we rescued her and left innocent people suffering."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "So we're turning around and heading for the Kingdom capital? Ridiculous. Tell him to cease this nonsense. Isn't there a saying in F\u00f3dlan. Something those with power knowing how to use it? If he's not careful, the goddess will send her saints to smite him. Not that I believe that..."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't see figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You could detect enemy movements in advance."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful, at least."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You could find our targets quicker than anyone."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Thanks, Professor. I think I get it now. I'm gonna put my eyes to real good use."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "A class reunion on the battlefield? That's...bleak. That must have been so hard on everyone. You gotta keep looking after them all. I mean, they still look to you for guidance, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Fhirdiad is a city with a long history that goes back to before Faerghus gained its independence. I'd like to visit that place at least once before I die, but I'm afraid I have my own work to attend to. It's hard being so dedicated! Ah well. I'll go there for some leisurely sightseeing once F\u00f3dlan knows peace!"}], "intro": [{"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Fhirdiad... It has been a lifetime since I was last here. Five years ago, in fact. On the day before my execution, when Dedue helped me escape from prison. I killed soldiers from my homeland, stole weapons from their corpses, and made my escape, soaked in their blood. To think this is how I would return to the city of my birth, after all that has happened..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You have Rodrigue to thank."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Yes, Rodrigue gave his life to show me the way back to this path.

If not for you or Rodrigue, I would still be lost..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I am glad to have you at my side. From the bottom of my heart...I am forever grateful. Let's win this, Professor. Let's all make it out alive and celebrate our victory."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Your Highness. The path to the castle has been cleared.

Listen well! This battle is for all that the Empire stole from us. It is a fight to reclaim the days of peace we once enjoyed. I give you but two commands\u2014stay alive, and follow your heart.

Heh, so stubborn. It must run in your family."}, {"speaker": "Dukedom General", "line": "Cornelia! The city is overrun with insurrection. It seems to be in response to our enemy's arrival. If we do nothing, our army may suffer damages. We should suppress the citizens immediately."}, {"speaker": "Cornelia", "line": "The people are rebelling? Ha! Let them do as they please. Or are you saying you have enough soldiers to divide our forces? Quite bold of you, with our enemy's most elite soldiers at our doorstep."}, {"speaker": "Dukedom General", "line": "But... What are you suggesting?"}, {"speaker": "Cornelia", "line": "The city is going to be a battlefield anyway. Kill all who oppose us, even if they are members of the general populace. Go on now.

Well then! we had better active the Viskam!"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "That should stop the supply of magic.

No, what I am referring to is far more valuable."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "How should I put this... Perhaps it is most accurate to say that...you taught me how to live. If you and I had not reunited on that fateful day, I am certain I would have died a fruitless death on the battlefield. I would have foolishly challenged a horde of foes and, in doing so, needlessly sacrificed the lives of my friends and myself. But now, I have returned to my rightful place. I stuffle with what to say, when I know well that words are not enough to express my gratitude. You save me from the darkness...and guided me back to the light. Thank you, Professor. With all that I am, I thank you."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Are you happy?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "That...is a hard question to answer. I still do not believe I deserve happiness.

It was an obligation I felt I had inherited from those who died. I believed my life belonged to those who lost their own in Duscur. But what I now seek is something else entirely... I can say that with confidence."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "But I digress... For tonight, our only focus should be to bask in our victory. After that we must prepare for our battle with the Empire. To start, we must absorb the Kingdom knights taken by the Dukedom into our own forces and reshuffle our troops. The lords will need help purge our territory of Imperial forces, and I will use my authority as king to gather forces from various regions... And we'll have to ask the merchants to lend us the fund we require... Oh, and we must request delivery of supplies at once..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That sounds like a lot of work."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Heh...

I am well aware."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I believe we have spoken of this before... Everyone has something they simply cannot accept. As for Edelgard, I am certain she will never be able to accept the Church of Seiros. I believe that is why she seeks to destroy it. She is looking to revolutionize the world. In her mind, for the better. But even if she manages to birth a new world... it would be at the cost of... I wish to end this war through acceptance, not annihilation.
