@Opening 
Arianrhod, the Fortress City, lies on what was once the border between the Kingdom and the Empire and is a valuable strategic asset. Dimitri intends to reclaim it.

@Intro 
Dimitri: Thank you. you may leave now.
Byleth: Did something happen?
Byleth: Was the report worrying?
Dimitri: Not really... There is just a problem I must now clean up. Do you know of Arianrhod? It is a fortress that also goes by the name of the Silver Maiden.
Byleth: I've heard of it.
Dimitri: Yes, I had thought I might have mentioned it before. It is a fortress city that is lauded as the strongest in the Kingdom.
Byleth: This is the first I'm hearing of it.
Dimitri: Is that so? Arianrhod is a fortress city, lauded as the strongest in the Kingdom.
Dimitri: The land around Arianrhod was once entrusted to Count Rowe... When he turned to the Empire, the Silver Maiden went with him. Now, one after another the lords of each region are leaving the Empire at the call of the eastern lords... But I am sure the Empire has no plans to relinquish the Fortress City, given its strategic position on the front lines of their war with the Kingdom. Unless we can take back Arianrhod, the Kingdom will continually be attacked at its weakest points. I was thinking that we need to deal with it soon, and that we need to investigate the status of the enemy's force, but...
Byleth: Is there a problem?
Dimitri: I am afraid so. We confirmed that troops departed the Imperial capital, headed for Arianrhod. If they are followed by a second and third batch of reinforcements, then the difficulty of taking back Arianrhod will increase exponentially. But, that does not mean we are entirely without recourse. I am just at a loss as to when the soldiers will arrive.
Byleth: Let's go. 
Dimitri: Right away? You never cease to amaze. Your answers always bring me joy. OK. Let's gather everyone immediately. We'll begin the war council for the departing troops.
Byleth: Not yet. 
Dimitri: Indeed, I realized that was out of the blue. You have your own worries. Please accept my apologies. Though I do hope to deal with this sooner than later... If possible, I would like to ask you to take the lead. Speak with me again if you change your mind.

@Battle 
Hubert: It seems we are just in time. Any later, and Arianrhod may have been lost. Her Majesty was right to send me here.
Dimitri: Hubert. So, you have come here in command of extra troops from the Imperial capital... I had hoped to take the fort while it was poorly defended, but now... Well, there is nothing to be done. We must defeat him and then take Arianrhod.

Dimitri: If I remember correctly, there should be devices somewhere that let you deactivate the traps. However... Arianrhod has been in Imperial hands for a while now. They may have changed how things work. But there's no point in dawdling. Let's just make a point to disable any devices we come across.

Hanneman: So what if they disable some old contraptions? It's no loss to us. The city's defenses are under my exclusive control. 
Imperial General: No luck, buddy. All the city's defenses are under my control! 
Dimitri: So, the system has been modified. The person operating the traps must be elsewhere...

Dimitri: Surprise reinforcements... We must defeat them.

Dimitri: That should take care of the traps.

Dimitri: Good. We've cut them off from their reinforcements.

Hubert: I suppose you thought defeating the troops outside the castle first would demoralize the ones within. Not such a bad idea, honestly. But you failed to account for me. 

@Boss 
Hanneman: For the sake of Edelgard, I shall take the liberty of helping.

%Byleth,Hanneman
Hanneman: In the end, I may not have gleaned your secret. Yet, even if I die, someone will follow my work, and another after that. Such is the way of scholarship.

@Boss
Hanneman: If I die for this new Empire...then I have no...regrets.
Dimitri: Professor Hanneman... That should take care of the traps.

Manuela: I'd hate to kill someone I know...but I have no choice.

%Byleth,Manuela
Manuela: Oh dear, Professor. Fate can be so cruel. Spilling the blood of your students with your own hands... How can you carry on after that?

%Dimitri,Manuela
Manuela: You've grown into a fine, handsome man, Dimitri. Bit of a shame you've also become a violent beast. Men like you make the Silver Maiden cry.
Dimitri: Oh? I suppose it is a shame, Professor Manuela. Perhaps I should have appeared before you holding a bouquet of flowers, rather than the weapon that will end your life.

@Boss
Manuela: So, the Silver Maiden...will be my last stage? Heh... You know, that's...that's not too bad.
Dimitri: Professor Manuela... At least we have stopped the reinforcements.

Hubert: Arianrhod is a crucial asset to the Empire. You will not pry it from our grasp.

Hubert: That's as far as I go... I'll withdraw... for now.

%Byleth,Hubert
Hubert: First Gronder Field, and now here. You certainly have a talent for getting in our way.

@End 
Dimitri: The Empire troops are withdrawing... This is it. We failed to get Hubert, but at least we recaptured Arianrhod. Let's clean up the wreckage and return to Garreg Mach. Well done, everyone! The day is ours!

Dimitri: Oh... It's you.
Byleth: Are you tired?
Byleth: A rare sight...
Dimitri: I think all of this work is just catching up with me. Just pretend that yawn never happened. By the way, I wanted to thank you for your help with the Arianrhod campaign the other day. You were exceptional. Your leadership was key in taking back Arianrhod safely.
Byleth: We all contributed.
Dimitri: Indeed, everyone gave their all for victory. I am always being saved by those around me, it seems.
Byleth: We got lucky.
Dimitri: Do not be so modest.
Dimitri: It seems that after taking back Arianrhod, many things are changing within the Kingdom. Specifically, the lesser lords of the land surrounding Arianrhod have pledged vassalage to the Kingdom. The knights they possess may now be added to the Kingdom's army. And if that happens, I would like to leave them in your capable hands. Also... Ah, my apologies. Here I am, simply throwing one report after another at you.
Byleth: Aren't you overdoing it?
Dimitri: Perhaps. It is certainly true that I have been stuck in my quarters lately, dealing with more official business and other such tasks than ever before. But that is something I have been putting off for far too long. Though it is exhausting, filling in the blanks of five years and several months must be done. I am going to tackle them all, one at a time. That is one small part of my atonement. So, Professor... I have been doing all of the talking, but I assume you came here for a reason.
Byleth: I thought we could all celebrate our victory.
Dimitri: A victory celebration, you say?
Byleth: I intend to steal you away to the victory celebration.
Dimitri: Steal me away? That seems rather unnecessary... Hmm... A victory celebration, you say?
Dimitri: You know, this reminds me of that time I dragged you to the dining hall. Do you recall?
Byleth: I do.
Byleth: When was that?
Dimitri: If memory serves, that was after the mock battle between the houses... It was a wonderful time. We had just finished our mission, and we were invited to join in the celebration... You know, every once in a while, I do long to be part of the group as well. But do you think that it is really acceptable? For someone like me to quietly join in the merriment?
Byleth: Everyone's waiting for you.
Byleth: You're thinking about it too much.
Dimitri: You really think so? Well, if you insist... Thank you, Professor. Now then, let's go. Together.

@Opening 
The Alliance has requested aid from the monastery, but the Knights of Seiros are low on personnel. Alois and Shamir decide that the students will have to suffice...

@Intro 
Shamir: ...And that is our situation.
Alois: But with so few knights, we'll surely--

Alois: Ah, Professor! Excellent timing.
Byleth: What's going on?
Shamir: Alois. You're not going to suggest we send students, are you?
Alois: I am, actually. Do you have a problem with that?
Shamir: I do. We can't send them out on a knight's mission without Rhea's blessing.
Alois: I'm sure I can get the go-ahead. I'll just say the students have a...new field training opportunity, or something like that. Besides, we'll be there. We're not going to let them get killed by pirates.
Byleth: What's this about pirates?
Byleth: What are you talking about?
Shamir: There are pirates causing havoc in the port of Derdriu, at the center of House Riegan's territory.
Alois: The Merchants' Association sent a request via the Eastern Church, asking for protection.
Byleth: The Eastern Church?
Shamir: You haven't heard of the Eastern Church? I suppose that's because they don't have much of a presence.
Alois: The Eastern Church controls eastern Fódlan. They don't have a standing army like we do. So, for incidents like this, they customarily ask for help from the Central Church.
Shamir: I imagine they want to contribute to make their presence known in the Alliance.
Alois: Be that as it may, we knights are quite busy. We don't have personnel to spare. Therefore, we're enlisting your help!
Shamir: You should have some experience dealing with pirates from your mercenary days, right?
Byleth: I may.
Byleth: I don't remember.
Shamir: The students have dealt with pirates, so this shouldn't be a problem for them.
Alois: Come with us, won't you? Think of it as a training exercise. The Merchants' Association will reward us handsomely!
Byleth: Let's go. 
Shamir: We don't have time to lose. Let's take care of this quickly.
Byleth: I don't know if I should. 
Alois: We're not leaving right away. Think on it.
Shamir: If you wish to join us, let me know.

@Battle 
Pirate Captain: Tremble before us! We are the great navy of Almyra! Resist and we'll burn this town to the ground!
Alois: The Almyran Navy... This is going to be tougher than I expected.
If Claude is deployed:

Claude: Huh? Sure, those look like Almyran ships, but I guarantee you they're just common pirates.
Shamir: They're obviously bluffing, but it seems to be working on the merchants. Shall we?
Merchant: It's the knights! Please, save us! We'll reward you handsomely!
Merchant: It would be a disaster if they attacked our shops. Please, don't let them into town!
Alois: We've got you. Leave it to the Knights of Seiros!

Pirate: Hahaha! Smash up the houses and trash the shops! Swipe anything that's not nailed down!
Merchant: Aah! If they attack the town, we won't even be able to pay the knights their reward...
Alois: That's not good. The pirates have got into town. We have to beat them, quick.

Shamir: The town is under attack. We have to move quickly.

Merchant: If the town gets damaged any further, we won't have much to offer as a reward...
Alois: Who cares about the reward? We're trying to protect the people!

Pirate: We are the ruthless barbarians of Almyra! Resist and pay the price!
Merchant: Oh dear... My wares! I'll be ruined! Please, do something quickly!

Alois: We are the Knights of Seiros, and we will not tolerate your violent villainy!

@Boss 
%Claude,Pirate Captain
Claude: How could you commit such crimes in the name of Almyra? It's because of two-bit miscreants like you that Almyrans suffer so much hate!
Pirate Captain: Sh-shut up! Say what you will, we're the real navy of Almyra!

%Alois,Pirate Captain
Alois: You're in charge of this sorry band, huh? We'll punish you in the name of the goddess!
Pirate Captain: Quiet, you! Time for a counter attack!

%Shamir,Pirate Captain
Shamir: Hate us all you want. We're just doing our job.
Pirate Captain: Idle prattle! You think you can beat us?

@End 
Claude: Ugh, what a pain that guy was. If you're going to pose as an Almyran, at least fight like one!

Alois: Well, that's over with. They were a lot more trouble than I expected.
Merchant: Thank you so much! Here's your reward. Please, take it.

Alois: Well, we got rid of them, but the town's not looking too pretty.
Merchant: Thank you. It's not much, but please take this as a reward.

Alois: Good gracious, I didn't expect it to become such a large-scale battle.
Shamir: It seems they caused the merchants unnecessary confusion by disguising themselves as Almyrans.
Alois: We taught the pirates a lesson though. That should calm them down a bit. I know this was more than you signed up for, but you really saved us!
Byleth: It was an interesting experience.
Byleth: It was good training. 
Shamir: Thanks for your help. This can't be how you were expecting your day to go.
Alois: Patient and understanding, just like Captain Jeralt. We owe you a token of our appreciation, I think. Take the reward from the Merchants' Association. Share it with your students, if you like.
Byleth: Really?
Byleth: I can't accept this.
Shamir: Take it. We'll collect our reward from the Eastern Church. Besides, Alois could never keep it for himself.
Alois: Of course not! We knights serve as the sword and shield of Saint Seiros herself. We pride ourselves on our integrity! We reject all rewards that are not perfectly legitimate!
Shamir: In other words, he's a coward who would feel guilty and lose sleep over it.
Alois: Hmph.
Shamir: That's also one of his many merits.
Alois: Shamir, you don't mince words. Though it does seem like you've learned how to show a little respect.
Shamir: Must've learned that from you.
Alois: I don't remember teaching you that. Anyway, Professor, keep the compensation. I'd say you've earned it. Those merchants really needed your help. For all the buying and selling they do, they're not so good at trading blows!
Shamir: ...
Alois: Get it, trading blows? They... And merchants, they... Oh, forget it.
Shamir: We have to prepare for our next mission. Until next time, Professor.

@Opening 
Annette and Gilbert hope to acquire the Hero's Relic of House Dominic from Annette's uncle, Baron Dominic.

@Intro 
Gilbert: Professor, do you have a moment?
Byleth: Of course.
Gilbert: I would hear your opinion on our situation. Given our current fighting power, what sort of challenge do you expect we pose to the Empire? Do we have any hope of victory?
Byleth: Our preparations are lacking.
Byleth: The probability of victory is low.
Gilbert: So, we agree. However, in order to strengthen our forces, we--

Annette: Aaaargh! Ugh, why would anyone put a barrel here?!

Annette: Ow, that really smarts... Oh. Hello, Father.
Byleth: Father?
Gilbert: ... Another stupendous fall.
Annette: As though you care about my well-being. Anyway... Professor, I'm heading out for a bit.
Byleth: Where are you going?
Annette: I was thinking of going to visit my uncle.
Gilbert: To see my brother? Why is that, Annette?
Annette: I wanna ask him to entrust me with the Hero's Relic of House Dominic. The fight from here on out is gonna be tough. I need to do whatever I can to get stronger. The best thing we can do, as far as I can tell, is to have another Hero's Relic at our disposal.
Gilbert: You are not wrong, yet it will not be easy.
Byleth: Why's that?
Gilbert: Under pressure from Cornelia, House Dominic is maintaining a pro-Imperial stance. That makes us his enemy. Brother or no, he will not hand over a Hero's Relic to us.
Annette: But he's not a bad person... And we'll never know unless we ask, right? And Mother might be there too...
Gilbert: The Dominic region is, at present, enemy territory. There is no guarantee you can see them safely.
Annette: Fine. Be that way. It's not like I was planning to ask for your help, anyway. Professor, don't worry about me. I'll be back soon, and with a Relic, no less!
Gilbert: Annette! Wait! She never listens. So frustrating. However, if she were able to retrieve the Hero's Relic, it would prove a great boon to our forces. Perhaps I should prepare myself for the worst. I shall travel with Annette to see my brother. Professor, might I ask you to take on a task for me? It is entirely possible that we shall be captured in the Dominic region. In anticipation of that... I would ask that you wait outside the region, with an army at your command.
Byleth: Of course. 
Gilbert: I cannot say with confidence that we will be able to bring back the Hero's Relic without issue. While it pains me to ask this favor of you, I must also thank you for accepting.
Byleth: I need some time... 
Gilbert: I should be able to slow Annette's departure for a short while, at the least. Please join us when you can.

@Battle 
Annette: Uncle, I beg you! Please give me the Hero's Relic!
Baron Dominic: Even in this land, the Empire's eye shines bright. To hand over such a weapon to you, our enemy, is unthinkable...
Gilbert: We are well aware. Brother, I beg you. For the sake of the Kingdom's revival...
Baron Dominic: I cannot. If it becomes known that I gave you aid, my lands will be annexed in a bitter instant.
Gilbert: Then we must relent. Annette, there is nothing for us here. We should go.
Baron Dominic: No. Letting you simply leave will invite accusations of collusion. I must take you as my hostages.
Gilbert: So... It has come to pass after all.
Baron Dominic: Annette, live here with me. You needn't return to that helpless band of rebels without a glimmer of hope for victory.
Annette: You're wrong! That will never happen, Uncle!
Baron Dominic: Your mother is also here in this land. Do not dismiss my proposition so readily...

Annette: We can't afford to stay here. Father, we have to run!
Gilbert: Be calm, Annette. I assumed something like this would happen. If we do not come back, the professor will come to get us. We need but wait and keep faith...

Kingdom Soldier: Our allies are being held in that stronghold in the southeast! Please, rescue them quickly! 

Baron Dominic: Ha! Right to the last, you hope to strike me down. In that case, I will also lay my cards on the table and commit all my resources to this fight!
Gilbert: Reinforcements?! That will make life more difficult. 

Annette: Oh, thank goodness! Let's run, Father!
Gilbert: Annette, go. I will acquire the Hero's Relic, even if it means crossing blades with my brother.
Annette: I couldn't possibly leave you to do it alone! Father, please let me go with you!
Baron Dominic: Even if you must do it by force, bring me Annette! 

@Character-Falls 
Annette: Gah... Leave me be!
Baron Dominic: It's for your own good. You must understand, Annette.

Gilbert: I am soldier enough to admit I have lost this battle. Brother, I will lay down arms...

@Boss 
Baron Dominic: I have my own reason for not giving up. And the less I speak of it, the better...

%Gilbert,Baron Dominic
Gilbert: My brother, I beg you...the Relic!
Baron Dominic: I do not wish to repeat myself! If you want it that badly, slay me and claim it for your own

%Annette,Baron Dominic
Baron Dominic: I have no wish to enact violence on you, Annette. Listen to me and do as I say.
Annette: I will not listen! I can't and I won't! There is somewhere I must return to!

@End 
Baron Dominic: So...this is it. I fought well, in the end. I doubt Cornelia will think I cooperated with you. Take the Hero's Relic and go. And in return...promise to restore the Kingdom.
Gilbert: Brother... I thank you.
Baron Dominic: And don't worry about your wife. Whatever happens, I swear I will protect her. When all of this is over, you had better return to her. Make sure victory is yours...Gustave.
Gilbert: You have my word.

Gilbert: I cannot tell you how grateful we are for your assistance.
Annette: I don't know what would have happened if not for you... And thanks to you, I got this!
Gilbert: The Magic hammer, Crusher... The Hero's Relic of House Dominic. My brother would not surrender such a Relic without a fight... I hope you understand.
Byleth: I understand.
Byleth: Of course.
Gilbert: House Dominic is one of the ten great bloodlines. Yet within the Kingdom, we are mere feudal lords. With the Empire growing in strength, Dominic must kneel. To do otherwise would be suicide. The western lords, and other rulers, are in the same situation. They all comply, albeit reluctantly. If we defeat the Empire, I hope the Kingdom will rise once more, under the banner of a legitimate king.
Annette: I hope so too. That's why we can't give up!
Gilbert: To that end, Professor, we will require your help. I hope we can continue depending on you.
Byleth: I'll do what I can.
Byleth: You can count on me.
Annette: Don't worry! We won't make you do all the hard work by yourself. I'll give it my all too! Speaking of... I'm gonna get straight to training!

Annette: Gaaaaaah! Why would someone put a dumb wooden box here?!
Gilbert: And please, look after my daughter as well.

@Opening 
Something is attacking people in the forests of Margrave Edmund's territory, and a Crest scholar blames Marianne.

@Intro 
???: There’s no reason to feign ignorance. I know all about you!
Marianne: Wh-what are you talking about?
???: Just come here!

Marianne: Professor! Help!
???: Don’t interfere. Just hand the girl over to me.
Byleth: Never.
???: I’m telling you this for your own good. You’re putting yourself in danger by associating with her.
Marianne: ...
???: Do you know of the Wandering Beast stalking in the wood in the Edmund territory? It is said that it attacks people every night and drags them off to feast. The true identity of the Wandering Beast... Is that girl right there!
Marianne: No! I would never...
Byleth: Get out of here!
???: No matter. I’ll get the evidence I need...

Marianne: My apologies for you getting involved in that...
Byleth: What happened?
Marianne: In truth, that man has been following me ever since my father disappeared... He’s a Crest scholar.
Byleth: Why is he following you?
Marianne: The Crest that my father bore and was passed down to me... It was... Maurice’s Crest.
Byleth: Maurice’s Crest?
Marianne: Yes. It’s also known as...the Crest of the Beast... It’s said there were once 12 heroes who saved Fódlan. There was the King of Liberation, Nemesis...the 10 Elites, and finally...Maurice. One day, Maurice suddenly transformed into a hideous beast and slaughtered innocent people. It was like when Miklan of House Gautier turned into a Black Beast. The negative energy dwelling within his Crest turned Maurice into a monster. The people of Fódlan grew to despise him, and he was stripped of his honor. His whole clan was conquered, and it was believed that his bloodline had vanished... But even now, there exist a few descendants who have inherited Maurice’s Crest, and his curse. My family line...is one of them. Maurice’s Crest is a symbol of disaster. Anyone who comes in contact with it is met with great misfortune. Those who carry the Crest became beasts at night and slaughter innocent people.
Byleth: What that man mentioned earlier...
Marianne: Yes, the rumor about the Wandering Beast in the woods... People are saying the creature is similar in appearance to Maurice’s bestial form.
Byleth: If it’s defeated, wouldn’t the rumor be dispelled?
Marianne: That may be true but...I doubt I could do it on my own. If you and some of the other students came with me though...
Byleth: Let's go. 
Marianne: Thank you! But, um... Promise you won't tell anyone about my Crest?
Marianne: I'm sorry to have to ask...but thank you!
Byleth: I'll think about it. 
Marianne: It is my personal matter, so I can't expect you to get involved. But if you change your mind...I'll be waiting.

@Battle 
Marianne: A-are you really the Wandering Beast that people talk about?
Wandering Beast: You... Do you bear our Crest? For what purpose did you come here?
Marianne: Our Crest? Does that mean...
Wandering Beast: It appears that your presence has been detected by bloodthirsty Demonic Beasts...

Marianne: Demonic Beasts? Everyone... Please move carefully!
Wandering Beast: This forest is the den of Demonic Beasts. You will be lucky to make it out alive.

Marianne: You saved me, Professor... Thank you. The Wandering Beast's true form... Could it be... Oh! Sorry! I need to focus on the fight! 

Marianne: Argh! I'm...not strong enough...

@Character-Falls
Marianne: Dear Goddess... My soul is yours to take...

@Battle
Wandering Beast: My beastly blood is roused... You will not be able to stop me!

@Boss
Wandering Beast: Nothing will stop me...from feasting upon your flesh and blood!

%Byleth,Wandering Beast
Wandering Beast: That sword... It's the sword of the king! Are you the one who can liberate me?!

%Marianne,Wandering Beast
Wandering Beast: Nothing will stop me...from feasting upon your flesh and blood!
Marianne: No! I won't let you!

%Claude,Wandering Beast
Claude: That looks just like Miklan's Black Beast... Could a Hero's Relic be at fault?
Wandering Beast: Hero... That is a word that takes me back.
Claude: Takes you back? You... Are you...
Wandering Beast: After so long, I cannot speak of it.

@End 
Wandering Beast: Well done... Finally, this nightmare of a thousand years is at its end. Oh, inheritor of my Crest...if this body is to decay, then the sword... I leave it to you...
Marianne: ...

Marianne: I still can’t believe what we saw in that forest... The Wandering Beast’s eviscerated body... Only human bones and this sword remaining.

Marianne: Surely the creature’s true identity was...
Crest Scholar: I’m sorry...
Marianne: You again?
Crest Scholar: I heard rumor that the Wandering Beast was slain, but do you really believe that frees you of suspicion? Without proof that it was slain, the argument that you are not a beast does not stand. Furthermore, I... Huh? Oh! That sword!
Marianne: When the Wandering Beast was defeated, this sword...
Crest Scholar: It’s unmistakable! Carved into that sword’s Crest stone is Maurice’s Crest! But how would the lost Magic Blade end up with the Wandering Beast? According to what I know of Maurice’s story, he didn’t let go of the sword until the very end. That must mean... I see. So that’s what happened... My apologies, it seems I was mistaken. I must be going.
Marianne: So the Wandering Beast was...
Byleth: Maurice himself.
Marianne: He was roaming the dark woods for over a thousand years, suffering for his murderous past.
Byleth: Someone who bears the Crest of the Beast.
Marianne: No, I’m sure that was Maurice himself. He was roaming the dark woods for over a thousand years, suffering for his murderous past.
Byleth: Good thing you were able to put an end to it.
Marianne: It’s true... And because of that, I feel as though...my curse has been lifted. The blood of a beast no longer flows through me. I feel human for once.

Marianne: Thank you, Professor. I couldn’t have done it on my own. Without your help, I would never have found peace. I’ll do anything I can to repay my debt to you!

@Opening 
Western Church extremists have taken over land sacred to Cichol, one of the Four Saints. Seteth heads out the rid the area of them, and Flayn insists on going along.

@Intro 
Flayn: Brother, please wait!
Seteth: For the last time, Flayn, the answer is no.
Flayn: You are departing for the Rhodos Coast, are you not? I must come!
Seteth: You will do no such thing. I am not going there to pay respects at the cemetery, but to do battle. With you there, I will be beside myself with worry. It will be easier for me to fight if I know you are safe.
Flayn: But...I must!

Flayn: Professor! You have come at just the right time.
Byleth: What's going on?
Flayn: Surely it must be fate that you have appeared at a time of my greatest need!
Byleth: I don't like the sound of that...
Flayn: I only wish to make a small request.
Flayn: My dear brother is about to set forth on a most dangerous mission.
Byleth: A mission?
Seteth: Indeed. The Western Church is attempting to seize sacred ground by force. Though they now have a new bishop, it seems that a radical faction has emerged to resist the new order. We cannot allow the holy artifacts enshrined there to fall into their hands.
Flayn: I, too, wish to be of use to the church! And I do admit I am terribly worried about my brother. No matter my protests, he will not allow me to come. Professor, this is where you can help. Will you accompany us both on this expedition?
Byleth: Why me?
Flayn: If you are there to protect me, my brother's fears will be allayed. Isn't that right, Brother?
Seteth: I suppose your aid would indeed be useful, yes.
Flayn: I knew it! Please, Professor, will you join us?
Byleth: Very well. 
Flayn: Wonderful. Let us depart at once!
Byleth: Not right now. 
Flayn: Please tend to your errands promptly. Then you will come along with us, yes?
Seteth: There is still time before we must depart. If you are able to accompany us, let me know.

@Battle
Priest: You heretics, who defile our goddess! The sacred coast belongs to us, the Western Church!
Seteth: You are the heretics! Begone from here at once!
Priest: Silence, dog of the apostate! Prepare to receive our righteous blades!

Seteth: I will recapture the monument. Everyone else should focus on removing the surrounding enemies.
Flayn: Wait, Brother! I shall accompany you!

Flayn: Leave! Let Mother rest in peace!

Priest: It is our duty to worship Saint Cichol! We will not allow heretics to come near!

Priest: It's like the goddess herself commanded me to live... I must offer her my thanks.
Seteth: The goddess doesn't want your thanks!

Priest: But it was...for the sake of the goddess...

Priest: The goddess protects us! We will never yield to the likes of you!

Priest: I got away, thanks to the protection of the goddess!
Seteth: Insufferable arrogance! We'll have to send someone after them...

Priest: Goddess... Have you abandoned us?

Priest: Heretics! Prepare to taste the power of the true servants of the goddess!

Priest: We're no match for them... Brothers... Retreat...
Seteth: Do you dare compound your crimes further? There will be no escape for you!

Seteth: That is the last of them. Flayn...will you place some flowers at the monument?
Flayn: Of course, Brother. That is what I came here to do.

@Character-Falls 
Flayn: This place... is very precious to me... please... protected it... for me...

Seteth: I must pull back... I leave the rest to you. Do not let them take this position.

Seteth: Your assistance is most appreciated. I can only hope that the Western Church will now see reason and abandon this place. But just to be safe, I have retrieved the holy artifacts. We cannot risk them falling into their hands. I will entrust them to you. I must confess, despite the situation, it was a pleasure to return here. This coast has a certain sentimental significance to my sister and me.
Byleth: Sentimental significance?
Seteth: Yes. This stone monument is not merely here to commemorate Saint Cichol. It is also the grave of my wife.
Flayn: You are safe now, Mother. Finally, you may find peace.
Byleth: Your mother is also buried here?
Seteth: I suppose you have earned the right to know. But this must remain between us. Flayn is actually my daughter. My late wife and her mother are the same person.
Byleth: I had no idea.
Seteth: Due to certain...circumstances, it is more convenient for us to masquerade as siblings for the time being.
Byleth: I suspected as much.
Seteth: And here I thought we had hidden it skillfully.
Seteth: There are many who would seek to harm Flayn due to the unique blood she bears. Falsifying her identity is necessary to conceal her from such individuals. Mercifully, I happen to look quite young for my age. We make rather convincing siblings, do we not?
Byleth: That's true enough.
Byleth: If you say so.
Seteth: Hm. I was certain our cover was adequate.
Flayn: Mother loved the coast so much. She and I came here together often. Fishing was her favorite pastime. I used to sit and watch while she cast her line.
Seteth: I remember it fondly. You did so love to eat the fish she caught, as well.
Flayn: Fish is my favorite food, it is true. Due in no small part to Mother.
Seteth: I still come here to fish, from time to time, using the skills my wife taught me. It reminds me how deeply I appreciate those years... and how I wish I could return to them.
Flayn: We cannot turn back the clock, Father. We must live our lives fully, in the present moment.
Seteth: You're right. That is what she always said, isn't it? Dwell too much on the past, and you may be unable to move forward. Come, then. Let us return home.
Flayn: Good-bye, Mother. I love you. I shall bring flowers again for you next time.

@Opening 
Dedue receives a concerning missive about his people, who continue to bear the burden of oppression based on blame for the Tragedy of Duscur.

@Intro 
Dedue: ...

Byleth: Has something happened?
Byleth: What's on your mind?
Dedue: Oh–it's you, Professor. Since you are here, I have a favor to ask.

Dedue: Your Highness. You've returned.
Dimitri: Sorry to keep you waiting, Dedue. I'm glad you're here as well, Professor. I want you both to hear this. Dedue is already aware, but you should know there's been an uprising in the Duscur region, in the western part of the Kingdom.
Byleth: An uprising in Duscur? Why?
Dimitri: Dedue... Would you like me to explain?
Dedue: No. It should be me.  I am from Duscur. It lies just beyond the mountains on the northwestern border of Faerghus. But the people of Duscur no longer live there. The land was burned to ashes by the army of Faerghus. All of the people were slaughtered.  This was our punishment for the crime of regicide.
Dimitri: 
Dedue: The barren expanse that was once Duscur is now controlled by a Kingdom noble. But Duscur survivors, such as myself, still exist outside the region. This uprising is most likely the work of such survivors, seeking to reclaim their homeland.
Dimitri: A request for aid was sent from Viscount Kleiman to the Kingdom capital and the church. He is the one who rules over that region at present. For now, the lords surrounding the Duscur region have sent their armies to help suppress the uprising. However...
Byleth: Is there a problem?
Byleth: Are they short on troops?
Dimitri: They have sufficient troops, and strong ones at that. My worry is that there will be more unwarranted death. There have always been many in the Kingdom's army who believe the people of Duscur our foes, and hate them because of it. You would think they'd refrain from squashing the rebels out of political expediency...but I doubt that will be the case. If the Kingdom's army and the rebel forces of Duscur collide, there is no doubt that the rebel forces will be annihilated. I'm afraid...that's the best case scenario. It could also turn into complete and bloody chaos for both sides.
Dedue:  Indeed.
Dimitri: Which brings me to my news. I have just now received the permission I requested from the church.
Byleth: Permission for what?
Dimitri: I asked the church to deploy our class to help handle the situation.
Dedue: So we may go?
Dimitri: Not so fast. We still have a responsibility as students of the academy, after all. The only one who can truly make the decision as to whether or not we go is our professor. So... What do you say?
Byleth: Very well. 
Dedue: You have my most sincere gratitude.
Dimitri: And mine as well. But we must move fast. I will go and alert the others.
Byleth: Let me think about it. 
Dimitri: I know this was sudden, but given the situation, I'm afraid there isn't much time to ponder. When you've decided, please speak with me right away.
Dedue: Please, decide quickly.

@Battle 
Dedue: The Kingdom's vanguard has already arrived. Just as we'd feared, they far outclass the Duscur forces. We cannot stand by and allow another massacre. But we cannot obstruct the Faerghus army, either. Our best hope is to force the troops of Duscur to withdraw before the Kingdom soldiers get to them.
Dimitri: The main body of the Kingdom's army is bound to arrive soon. Until then, let's aim to quell this uprising ourselves. Once the main force arrives, we'll be out of options. We must move fast.

Dimitri: It seems the church and the Kingdom troops are not working together. My head hurts just thinking about it, but we may be able to use that. First, let's push Duscur to retreat. The Kingdom might then also withdraw without a fight.
Dedue: Let us be quick about it.

Duscur Soldier: Our grudge will not be settled...until all of you are dead and buried!

Kingdom General: Split up between the east and the west, and advance! That'll put the squeeze on those Duscur animals in a hurry!
Dedue: They are moving out. Time is of the essence, now.

Kingdom General: Seems this area's done already. All right, men! Fall back!

Kingdom General: OK, looks like they're already under control. Let's head back now.

Kingdom Soldier: We're here to quell this rebellion, starting now. Hunt down those filthy beasts, and give no quarter!
Dedue: The main army has arrived. We stand no chance against those numbers. We took too long. It is all over...

Duscur Soldier: I give my all for our goal! You will die here!

Dedue: Go now if you value your life.
Duscur Soldier: But aren't you with Faerghus? In any case... Thank you.

Dedue: You can still get out of here. Run.

Duscur Soldier: You're not going to kill us?! Well, I won't wait here to find out. I'm leaving!
Dedue: Safely away.

Duscur Soldier: I won't allow it... If only you dastards weren't here...
Kingdom Soldier: I'll have your life for atonement, king slayer!

Duscur Soldier: Heretics... What is it you think...we have done?
Kingdom Soldier: Filthy Duscur demons...

Duscur Soldier: Revenge for my brothers...even at the cost of death...
Kingdom Soldier: Not content with slaying His Majesty, you thought to revolt?! Pathetic!

@Boss 
%Dedue,Duscur General
Duscur General: You...are a man of Duscur. How can you make friends with our hated foes? Is it possible that you've lost your Duscur spirit?
Dedue: Are you finished?

%Dimitri,Duscur General
Duscur General: Now, this is a windfall... Who knew we'd meet our sworn enemy here!
Dimitri: Sworn enemy? Well, I cannot disagree.
Duscur General: We will slay you and topple Faerghus! That way, for the first time in ages...Duscur can be reborn!
Dimitri: Hmph.

@End 
Duscur General: Is this...how our dream ends...
Dimitri: I will check the status of the Kingdom troops. Dedue, I leave the Duscur army to you.
Dedue: Yes, Your Highness. Please be careful.

Duscur General: Why save us?
Dedue: I will not abide the needless death of my own people.
Duscur General: You must know that as long as there is breath in me, I will fight.
Dedue: Then fight, and be defeated. But so long as you pose no threat to His Highness, I will not end your life.
Duscur General: Idealistic fool. We will not relent. Not until we've taken back the homeland you monsters stole from us!
Dedue: I share the same sentiment.
Duscur General: You? Who sold his soul for Faerghus?
Dedue: His Highness has promised the people of Duscur a home. His will be a kingdom that is proud to harbor the blood of both Faerghus and Duscur.
Duscur General: That's impossible. Don't be naive.
Dedue: Believe what you will. But Faerghus will change under his reign. That is my firm belief.
Duscur General: ...

Dimitri: The Kingdom army has retreated to the fortress. There should be no further danger.
Duscur General: Prince of Faerghus! You monster!
Dimitri: Can you still run? Then I suggest you do so now.


Duscur General: ...
Dedue: May our paths cross again.
Duscur General:  I certainly hope not. But remember this one thing. The people of Duscur never forget their grudges. Nor do they fail to honor favors.

Dedue: Thank you, Your Highness, for accommodating my selfish request.
Dimitri: Think nothing of it. This was something I wished for, as well. If you must give thanks, direct it at the church for allowing us to join the battle, and to our professor for leading the charge. It's about time we headed back. The professor and the others are waiting.
Dedue: I am right behind you.

@Opening 
Almyran forces are attacking Fódlan's Locket. With her brother suddenly fallen ill, it is up to Hilda to take over the defense. Cyril volunteers to accompany her.

@Intro 
Hilda: Hey, Professor. I might have to go back home for a little while.
Byleth: Is someone in your family sick?
Hilda: Oh no, nothing like that.
Byleth: Is there some kind of emergency?
Hilda: Well, that's one way of putting it...
Hilda: The Almyran forces are causing trouble at Fódlan's Locket. Oh, do you know where that is? Well, the mountain range that separates the Alliance from Almyra is called Fódlan's Throat. There's a fortress right on top of the throat, and they call that Fódlan's Locket.
Byleth: So, you're going to help defend it?
Hilda: Well, yeah, you could say that. I'm sure my brother would be able to handle them on his own. But he said he really wants me to help out. I guess he's a bit tired out from all his hard work. Anyway, our dad's not as sprightly as he used to be. He's not up for a fight. Apparently it would look bad if we left it to the retainers. I really, really don't want to go, but I guess I have to.

Cyril: Heya, Hilda. I...well, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I heard ya talking...
Hilda: Hm? Oh, what's up, Cyril?
Cyril: You're gonna fight the Almyrans, yeah?
Hilda: Yes. But it's nothing you need to worry about, Cyril.
Cyril: It's not that. I was just wondering if...if maybe I could maybe go along with ya?
Hilda: But--you'd be fighting people from your homeland. Do you really want to do that?
Cyril: None of 'em would remember me anyway... It's just that...I got captured in the battle at the Locket, and that's how I ended up here. So I'm kinda worried that other kids who lose their folks might not be so lucky.
Byleth: What do you mean?
Cyril: Before Lady Rhea took me in, I had a real hard time as a servant of House Goneril.
Hilda: I'm sorry to hear that. But it's not like I'll go around snapping up Almyran children.
Cyril: That's good, but I just... I want to see things for myself, so I know...that everything's OK.
Hilda: Hm. Well then, let's go together! Oh, would you want to join us, Professor? My brother will be there, but I'm a little scared about fighting all those fierce Almyrans...
Cyril: If you could come too, it would be really great. We'd all feel way safer if you did.
Byleth: I'll come with you. 
Hilda: Great! I know we'll be OK if you're there! Let's head out right away.
Cyril: I'll go and get ready too.
Byleth: I'll think it over. 
Hilda: You're a real tease, Professor. I know you're going to come along in the end. But we can't wait long, so hurry up on deciding.

@Battle 
Hilda: Most of our allies have fallen. My big brother and I can probably handle this though...
Goneril Soldier: Hilda! Glad you made it! Lord Holst has been afflicted with a sudden illness and couldn't come...
Hilda: He's not here?! Oh... I'm sorry. You must have been absolutely terrified. It's OK though! I brought along someone who can definitely help us! That's you, Professor. Please help us save our allies and protect Fódlan's Locket.

Cyril: Good thing I knew about this back road, huh? We oughta be able to help our friends from here.

Goneril Soldier: Support! We're saved!

Goneril Soldier: Argh... No help came...
Hilda: Oh no! They got one...but we can still rescue the others!

Goneril Soldier: We must defend here, or else... Our house... The Alliance...
Hilda: All our allied troops were wiped out. We won't be able to defend this place.

Hilda: Ah, things are looking up. Let's keep going, and save the others!

Hilda: We did it somehow. Cyril, Professor--thank you.
Cyril: You bet.
Hilda: I'm gonna drop by my family's estate and complain to my brother a bit. You two should head back.

@End 
Cyril: They aren't really trying to cross Fódlan's Throat. I'm not saying they're not serious, but fights like this one aren't really invasions.
Byleth: Then what are they doing?
Cyril: They just start fights like this sometimes. It's so they can show off how strong they are. I think it's pretty dumb. I mean, people are getting killed! And why? So some guy can think he's tough? After every fight, they do a big feast, and everybody eats and dances and there's music... It's supposed to honor the dead, but I figure they just like to make noise. I think they're all idiots, but if I'm real honest, it wasn't the worst way to live life.
Byleth: Feeling homesick?
Cyril: Nah, I'm where I belong now, and I don't really like Almyra. If they wanna show how tough they are, then they oughta look after kids who've lost their parents.

Hilda: Whew, I'm tired. Professor, Cyril, thanks for all your help.
Cyril: You get a chance to see your brother?
Hilda: I did. Though I think I'd be better off otherwise. He was horribly ill, for one thing. He looked so pale and haggard. Apparently he'd eaten a bad mushroom before the battle and it made him horribly sick. What an idiot. Anyway, when I told him we'd handled the Almyran situation, he was just gushing with praise. I tried telling him that it wasn't all me, but he didn't even listen.
Byleth: Weren't you glad to get praise from your brother?
Hilda: That did feel pretty good, I'll admit. But then things got awkward. He started trying to pawn off his whole inheritance. I told him I wanted none of it! Eventually he settled for foisting this thing on me. Do you know what it is?

Cyril: One heck of an axe. He gave it to ya?
Hilda: Yes. It's a magic axe called Freikugel. It's the Hero's Relic of House Goneril. He said that I should have it, since the Crest I bear will allow me to wield it. He was so insistent, I eventually relented. But I don't think I can be responsible for something so precious. Hey, Professor... Why don't you take it instead?
Byleth: You should keep it.
Byleth: Why me?
Hilda: Heroes' Relics contain terrifying power. They're beyond the capabilities of a novice like me. You're the only person I trust to take care of it. Please, help me out here!
Byleth: If you're sure...
Byleth: If you really think it's necessary...
Hilda: Thank you so much! I honestly didn't know what I was going to do with this thing! A big scary axe is not my style. Plus, look closely--parts of the axe are pulsating, like it's alive! How gross is that? But I'll use it if you tell me to, Professor. Or you can get somebody else to wield it, if you like. It's all up to you now!

Byleth: ...
Cyril: That Hilda... She really is something.

@Opening 
When Catherine and the Knights of Seiros ride out to seek retribution against the Western Church for their attack on the archbishop, Ashe is eager to accompany them.

@Intro 
Catherine: There you are. I have a request for you.
Byleth: A request?
Catherine: It has to do with that plot to assassinate Lady Rhea. The bishop leading the Western Church was somehow involved.
Catherine: And speaking of the Western Church, there was also that incident in which one of the more extreme factions tried to occupy sacred land.
Catherine: Enough is enough, so now the Knights of Seiros have been tasked with putting the bishop down. I thought you and your students could come with us.
Byleth: Why would you want us to help?
Byleth: Why for such an important mission?
Catherine: Because you wield the Sword of the Creator. Lady Rhea is going to personally execute the bishop. I have been appointed as her guard. I want your help protecting her. So what do you say? Will you come?

Ashe: Um, excuse me! I’d like to come along.
Catherine: Ashe! You were listening in? It’s not up to you whether you can “come along.”
Ashe: Please, this is important to me.
Catherine: Your adoptive father, Lord Lonato, had connections to the Western Church. I understand that you want answers. But our objective is to punish, not to investigate. We can’t let you jeopardize the mission.
Ashe: I won’t get in the way, I promise!
Catherine: Hm... What do you say, Professor? Keep in mind we would be bringing the whole class, not just Ashe.
Byleth: We’ll go. 
Ashe: Thank you so much.
Catherine: OK. I guess it’s fine. Get ready, then.
Byleth: I’m not sure. 
Catherine: Hm. Well, can’t hurt to wait a bit, I suppose. Do let me know when you finish your preparations. This is an important mission.

@Battle 
Bishop: There she is -- The sneaky little witch trying to pass herself off as the goddess’s envoy... Archbishop Rhea! I’ll bring judgment upon you in the goddess’s stead!
Catherine: They’re using the fog as cover to ambush us. What a cheap ploy.
Rhea: It won’t do any good to get annoyed, Catherine. That voice... We’re up against a faction of bishops.
Catherine: They’ve shown themselves, at least, so we won’t have to go to the trouble of finding them. All right. You got a death wish? Come at me! You really want to fight against Thunder Catherine?

Catherine: Please, Professor. Don’t let Lady Rhea get hurt. Our mission isn’t just to wipe out all the enemies, but also to protect Lady Rhea. Ready?

Ashe: Lady Rhea!
Catherine: Hold the line! Don't let them attack Lady Rhea again.

Rhea: They have received reinforcements, and it seems the priests are calling them over.
Ashe: Then we'll just have to take them out!

Rhea: It seems that taking out the priest has stopped the reinforcements coming over here. We should be able to stop the reinforcements coming from the other side by taking care of the other priest.

Rhea: They will not be able to send any more troops now. Let us sweep up the stragglers.
Catherine: Good work, Lady Rhea! Let's round 'em up and cut 'em down.

@Boss 
Bishop: Apostates will suffer the punishment of the goddess!

%Ashe,Bishop
Ashe: Lonato’s blood is on your hands...
Bishop: Were you Lord Lonato’s page or something? Indeed, he was a devout believer. All we did was provide Lord Lonato salvation from his misery!
Ashe: Salvation?! You used him and threw him away!

@End 
Bishop: Apostates! You sully the name of the goddess!
Rhea: You are the apostates! The goddess is with me!

Rhea: Goddess, have mercy. Forgive them their sins, and save their souls...
Catherine: It would have been better if we’d captured the bishop. But they didn’t make it easy for us. What now, Lady Rhea?
Rhea: We must go to the headquarters of the Western Church. Perhaps there is still someone there who knows what has transpired.
Ashe: Let us help too. It may not be much, but we’ll do whatever we can!
Rhea: I am sure you will be a great help. I am glad to have you by my side.

Catherine: Thanks, Professor. I really appreciated your help with the investigation. That’s it for today. Head back to Garreg Mach. The church will have to choose a new bishop, and do whatever else is necessary to rebuild the Western Church. Lady Rhea is grateful to all of you. She said she would send along a reward. You should feel very proud. Receiving a gift directly from Lady Rhea is exceedingly rare. Still. That was a real mess, huh? For them to come out and charge us so boldly...
Byleth: I’m glad we made it out.
Catherine: As am I. We kept Lady Rhea safe, thanks to you.
Byleth: I thought we were doomed.
Catherine: I did too. But we made it out somehow, thanks to you.
Catherine: Hey, where did Ashe go? I haven’t seen him for a while.
Byleth: No idea.
Catherine: Could he still be back there? I’m glad he’s so dedicated to his work, but...
Byleth: He couldn’t still be back there, could he?
Catherine: That may be it. I hope he’s not getting in the way...

Catherine: There you are, Ashe. We were just talking about...
Ashe: ...
Catherine: Why the brooding expression? Hey, what’s that bundle of papers in your hand?
Ashe: This was given to me. It has to do with my family.
Byleth: Given to you?
Byleth: Is this about Lord Lonato?
Ashe: I haven’t finished reading it all yet. But I think it might offer some clues about something I need to know. Professor, Catherine. Thank you for letting me come with you on this mission. I’d better get ready to go.

Catherine: It’s a little painful to watch... I do hope that those papers, whatever they are, will help him get over his past. I suppose it’s time for us to start heading back to the monastery.

@Opening 
Manuela and Hanneman have predictably opposite reactions to a disturbing rumor going around the monastery.

@Intro 
Manuela: It's raining, Professor. On rainy days, the wound I got from the Death Knight hurts like fire. Every time it aches, I get angry. You understand, yeah? I'm sure they had their reasons to kidnap Flayn, but still... Did they really need to stab me? What'd I have to do with it?! They ruined my beautiful, porcelain skin. Worse, they took off before I could stab them back. So rude.

Hanneman: That's rather enough, Manuela. Cease your moaning and give the professor a break.
Manuela: Oh, stuff it, Hanneman. Unlike you, the professor has a big heart and listens to me talk about any problem I have.
Hanneman: More likely, your incessant ramblings offer no chance to interrupt.
Manuela: Is that true, Professor?
Byleth: Manuela isn't bothering me. 
Manuela: I knew it. You listen to me because you care about me, don't you?
Byleth: Professor Hanneman is right. 
Hanneman: You heard that, didn't you, Manuela? You are bothering the professor.
Manuela: Go away, Hanneman! Leave us alone. And stop making me shout! it causes the old wound to hurt again.
Hanneman: Then perhaps you'd best stay quiet. Keep your emotions in check, I'd say.
Byleth: Let's stop this now.
Byleth: Let's all get along.
Manuela: Don't worry, Professor. We do this all the time.
Hanneman: Indeed, Manuela and I do not mix well. Been true for years. That said, if it were up to me, I would prefer speaking to her in a calmer manner.
Manuela: It's not like I enjoy bickering with you. So maybe keep your mouth shut more often.
Hanneman: I state that which needs to be heard! For example--
Byleth: Let's stop this now.
Byleth: Let's all get along.
Manuela: I'm sorry. I couldn't help it...
Hanneman: Same, same. Apologies. I am here because I have new information on the Death Knight's hiding place.
Manuela: What? Really?! You could have started with that.
Hanneman: Several students have reported possible sightings on the western edge of the Sealed Forest. While the authenticity of these reports has yet to be verified, it is still a very real possibility. I was thinking I would report this to Seteth as a precaution.
Manuela: What? Why? We can't be slow! He's going to get away!
Hanneman: Protocol on this matter requires reporting to Seteth, then Lady Rhea, then...
Manuela: Professor, let's leave this old geezer behind and get going!
Hanneman: Old geezer? I am barely 15 years your senior! I will not hear such--
Manuela: Stop talking! Let's gather a team and get going!
Byleth: I agree. 
Manuela: I'll go scout ahead. I'm coming for you, Death Knight!
Hanneman: Manuela, wait! It would not do to get yourself killed without someone to avenge you!
Byleth: Not yet... 
Manuela: Well, I'm going ahead anyway. You can't stop me.
Hanneman: Manuela, take a moment. You must prepare before heading out! Professor, please let me know as soon as you can if you could join us.

@Battle 
Hanneman: Manuela's in a tough spot, Professor. Even if she's only got herself to blame, we cannot abandon her.
Bandit Leader: Heh... We have plenty of visitors today. Let's stop their annoying rescue attempt!

Bandit: Now that is a woman...
Manuela: Uh-oh. They've noticed me. Here they come!

Thief: Just when I decide to disguise myself as a mountain bandit and sneak in, we get attacked. Just my luck!

@Boss 
Bandit Leader: We are the Death God Gang! We're all unstoppable!

%Manuela,Bandit Leader
Manuela: Hey! You're not the Death Knight! What gives?
Bandit Leader: Death Knight? What nonsense are you talking now? Do we look like knights to you, lady?
Manuela: You're just lousy hill bandits. Well, I'll teach you to waste my time!

%Hanneman,Bandit Leader
Hanneman: Why, there is no Death Knight here. That student's testimony was, well, it was utter bunk!
Bandit Leader: Hey, you! The weird old dude with the beard! What kinda crap are you mumbling to yourself there?
Hanneman: I beg your pardon?! Do not image you can insult me without some form of retribution!

@End 
Hanneman: Manuela, are you uninjured?
Manuela: A few scrapes and bruises. But, yes, I'm well enough.

Manuela: How could anyone think that was the Death Knight? It was obviously just an ordinary bandit. Oh well, I may not have found my revenge, but at least we got to retrieve stolen goods.
Hanneman: Manuela! You unthinking fool!
Manuela: Hanneman, I've heard enough already.
Hanneman: How bloody stupid are you?! If that were the real Death Knight, you'd have new--likely fatal--wounds to match your first! Do you know how much you worried all of us? You should be ashamed!
Manuela: Oh no...
Byleth: Relax. She's OK.
Hanneman: This is a matter of life and death! It should not and must not be taken lightly!
Byleth: Hanneman's right.
Hanneman: Exactly! You are supposed to set an example for our students. Yet you let emotion get the better of you?
Manuela: You're right... So there, I said that. It's true, but, ugh. I'm sorry. I'll apologize to everyone later.
Hanneman: I should say I'm sorry as well. I lost my temper just now. I see you act so irrationally, and I lose my wits. I care about you a great deal, and wish to see you safe. Will you believe me?
Manuela: Yes, of course. I'm the same way, after all. I let my emotions get the best of me. We're both too old to be shouting all the time.
Byleth: So, everyone is friends again?
Manuela: You're awfully quick to but a bow on this. Are you sick of us already, Professor?
Hanneman: You're part of this, Professor. We are the only teachers this academy has. No need for bickering!
Manuela: Well said, Hanneman. Would you care to join me for a celebratory drink?
Hanneman: That sounds lovely. Perhaps a nice cup of tea is in order.
Byleth: ...

Sothis has a request for you, Byleth... At her insistence, you travel alone to the Red Canyon, followed by curious students.

@Intro 
Sothis: Hmmm... What was that name again?
Byleth: What's on your mind?
Sothis: Oh, this is frustrating me to no end! I simply can't recall. Oh, I have it! Zanado!
Byleth: Zanado, the Red Canyon?
Sothis: That's it! It was not long ago that we were there... And still, I somehow managed to forget!
Byleth: Where we defeated the thieves....
Sothis: That's it! It was not long ago that we were there... And still, I somehow managed to forget!
Byleth: What is that?
Sothis: Oh my, your memory is even worse than mine. It was not long ago that we were there!
Byleth: What about it?
Sothis: Well... That place brought back some fragments of my memory. I cannot help but wonder why. I feel we must return to find some answers there.
Byleth: Let's go. 
Sothis: Yes, you are right! For as the saying goes, there is no time like the present.
Byleth: Now isn't the time. 
Sothis: No? You must delight in spoiling my mood... Well, if you refuse to go, there's little I can do... Please tell me if you change your mind.

Edelgard: Hmm... Our professor is sneaking off alone. Where to, I wonder...
Hubert: I don't recall hearing of any such plans for our class. Perhaps we should follow.
Edelgard: Intrigued, are we? Yes, let's do just that. We will consider it...extra training.

Dimitri: It is most unlike our professor to go wandering alone like that...
Dedue: Curious, Your Highness?
Dimitri: Yes. I have an uneasy feeling about this. Let's gather the others and find out what is going on.

Hilda: Huh? Where's our professor going all alone like that?
Claude: I hate not knowing what's going on... OK, that's it. Let's gather the others and get to the bottom of this.
Hilda: You want to follow our teacher?! What a pain... Ugh, but I guess I'm dying of curiosity too.

Sothis: Yes... It is all coming back to me. This structure... Oh, but it's as though my memories are clouded. The most important pieces are obscured. But I once called this home. I have no doubt. I seem to recall something...on the other side of that wall. I cannot see it, but I can still feel it... It is not my imagination. I know this to be true. We are already deep within this valley...
???: Grrrraargh!
Sothis: Oh! What was that awful sound?!
Byleth: You heard something?
Sothis: This is not time to joke around! Do not pretend you didn't hear!
Byleth: It was a terrible scream.
Sothis: Yes. And that was not a normal beast, but a huge and terrifying one!
Sothis: Look! There! At the entrance of the valley...a giant shadow!

@Battle 
Sothis: What is it now?!
Sothis: Those hungry wolves... That howl must have riled them up. We have no choice but to fight our way out. Give it your all!

Hubert: It's good we've caught up with the professor, but this situation is--hard to put into words, actually.
Edelgard: Wolves to the front, hawks to the rear, and what appears to be a Demonic Beast at the canyon's mouth...
Hubert: A wild beast, at that. Or perhaps it's more fitting to call it a stray.
Edelgard: If we can't prevail over that Demonic Beast, we won't make it out of the Red Canyon alive.

Edelgard: The first thing we need to do is reunite with our professor. The wolves are closing in...

Edelgard: More hawks... This is bad. We'll be caught from both sides!

Edelgard: The hawks are still coming. Perhaps we should see to those before we deal with the beast.

Dimitri: This is bad... It's a good thing we managed to catch up with our professor.
Dedue: Wolves at the front. Hawks at the rear. And at the canyon mouth, a Demonic Beast.
Dimitri: Or perhaps to call it a stray beast would be most fitting... If we cannot take out the beast, I doubt we will ever see the monastery again.

Dimitri: We must help our professor, first and foremost. This is a tough situation for anyone.

Dimitri: They must hope to catch us from both sides.

Dimitri: Blast! More hawks! We should probably take those out before we approach that beast...

Claude: It was the right move for us to follow Teach. But however you look at it, we're in a tough spot now...
Hilda: Wolves, hawks...not to mention a Demonic Beast guarding the canyon's entrance! We should never have come here.
Claude: Don't say that! But what's a Demonic Beast doing here? Is it a stray? Even Teach would have trouble out here all alone. Let's help out before we're down one professor!

Claude: First thing's first. We need to reunite with Teach. Hurry up, everyone!

Claude: Great...more hawks. Those feathery jerks are trying to take us out from both sides!

Claude: More hawks?! The air's swarming with those feathered freaks! Let's get them before we fight the beast.

@Boss 
%Byleth,Wild Demonic Beast
Wild Demonic Beast: Graaargh!
Sothis: This thing... It has no will or mind to call its own. You must now strike it down! That is the best you can hope to offer this poor, lost soul.
Byleth: ...

%Claude,Wild Demonic Beast
Claude: Do you think it was once a human, like Miklan? No... It's not possible...

%Flayn,Wild Demonic Beast
Flayn: Let us put an end to its suffering. I think that is the most honorable thing we can do at this point.

@End 
Sothis: Our work is done? My, my... Things did not go as planned. Let us return, before any more hawks or wolves join us. But what was that Demonic Beast doing within the Red Canyon...

Edelgard: I'm glad you are safe, Professor. It was rather reckless of you to venture out alone like that.
Hubert: I suppose we came out here without permission too. If we all wish to avoid punishment... Perhaps we can all agree that we came out here for an extra-curricular activity. Let's leave it at that.
Edelgard: Still, I would like to know what brought you to this valley in the first place...

Dimitri: Professor, I am so glad that you are unharmed. What if something had happened to you?
Dedue: Your Highness, our instructor is safe. We should return to the monastery at once.
Dimitri: Yes, I suppose you are right. If we stay here much longer, we are sure to be reprimanded.
Dedue: It is not untrue to assert that our professor led us here for battle experience...
Dimitri: Dedue, you surprise me! And you, Professor. I hope you will tell us what brought you here...

Claude: Listen, Teach. No one likes aimless wandering more than me, but it's not worth dying over.
Hilda: Well, we're all OK now, so let's just focus on the positive. Ooh, maybe we can tell folks back at the monastery that we came here for battle training? With our dear professor's permission?
Claude: Hilda, you scamp! No one has a knack for getting out of trouble quite like you do. It is a gift, milady.
Hilda: Oh, is that right? Well, no one can get into trouble quite like you, so it works out!

Sothis: Oh dear... I put us in a bit of danger there! We are most fortunate that those delinquents followed us... You very nearly met your end! What a marvelous professor you must be, for all your students to be so concerned.
Byleth: I'm proud of us. 
Sothis: Hmm, you seem more confident in your ability to teach. But that makes sense, as you have me to help you out.
Byleth: I'm not used to it yet.
Sothis: You are not used to it? Hm. You must start thinking of yourself as a professor here. Be confident, as you have me to help you out.
Sothis: How disappointing to have dived so deep into danger, and yet to have nothing to show. Huh? What is this...strange feeling... My memories... Do you feel them stirring? How curious. You seem to have grown stronger! And all thanks to our journey to Zanado. It really was worth all that effort!
Byleth: I found something...
Sothis: Huh? You found this? I daresay you may find a use for that. You should decide how best to use that thing. But wow! We got a lot out of this trip. It was a bother for a spell, but in the end, I feel we should think fondly of our little trip. We actually had a delightful time, wouldn't you say?

@Opening 
Interested in learning more about the legend of Macuil, one of the Four Saints, Claude ventures out across the territory of Margrave Edmund to the Sreng Region.

@Intro 
Claude: Hm...

Claude: Very interesting...
Byleth: What's interesting?
Byleth: What are you reading?
Claude: Oh, Teach! How long have you been there? Don't sneak up on me like that! You almost gave me a heart attack. Anyway, I'm reading the official biography of the Four Saints, as sanctioned by the church. I know you're not very familiar with the teachings of Seiros, but even you must have read it at least once.
Byleth: Maybe...
Claude: Huh. I'm amazed you managed to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church.
Byleth: I don't think so...
Claude: Tell me again... How exactly did you manage to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church?
Claude: Well, whether you've read the biography or not, the Four Saints must at least ring a bell, right?

Claude: Well then, I've got a little quiz for you. Name the Four Saints, companions of the great Saint Seiros. I'll give you a hint. There was Cichol, Cethleann, Indech, and... who was the fourth one again?
Byleth: Macile.
Claude: Ooh, tough luck! That would be incorrect. The name you were looking for is Macuil.
Byleth: Macuil.
Claude: Correct! I was hoping you'd know that much at least.
Byleth: Maicul.
Claude: Ooh, tough luck! That would be incorrect. The name you were looking for is Macuil.
Claude: In any case, you can learn some interesting things reading about the life and times of Saint Macuil. For instance, he was more skilled with his hands than his fellow saints, and even became an accomplished blacksmith. He used his skills to forge countless sacred weapons for the army of Seiros. Of course, he didn't just forge weapons. He also used them in battle himself. Legends say his strength was second only to Seiros. It's even said that he played a big role in the Battle of Tailtean, where Seiros fought Nemesis, the King of Liberation who became the king of evil. Macuil lost his life in that battle, and now his body rests in a coffin within the Holy Mausoleum. Or so one story goes. Another legend says he set off on a journey to find a new land. That he left Fódlan from the east, crossed the sea, and vanished. He must have left Alliance territory, but where exactly would he have set sail from, I wonder? Thinking about it reminds me of another interesting story concerning the Sreng Region. The peninsula is attached to the mainland of Fódlan and extends from the northeastern part of Kingdom territory. If you would set sail from Margrave Edmund's territory, you could cut cross a stretch of sea and land there. And it just so happens that in the Sreng Region, there are ruins built to worship a sacred beast that appeared from across the sea. If the ruins have something to do with Saint Macuil, there could be sacred weapons there... So? Have I piqued your interest or what?
Byleth: Maybe a little.
Byleth: Not really.
Claude: You always have to play it cool, don't you? Just think of how useful it would be to have weapons like that! Not to mention that the peninsula would be pretty easy to get to about now, seeing as how Alliance territory has settled down a bit. We'd be there and back in no time. No one would even notice we were gone. Come on, Teach! Let's go to the Sreng Region!
Byleth: Let's go. 
Claude: I always see it through once I set my mind on something. Let's make the necessary preparations before I die of curiosity.
Byleth: Let me think about it. 
Claude: I guess I can wait...just a while. But make sure you decide before I die of curiosity, OK?

@Battle 
Claude: There are the ruins... It looks like we're not gonna have the luxury of an excavation. Look. I bet those are the watchmen of the ruins, and that they've been ordered to keep out intruders. And that big beast... I hear they call it The Wind Caller.
The Wind Caller: Thieves... Only by defeating me can you claim the secret treasure!
Claude: Argh! It speaks! What is it?!

Thief: Huh? Who are you? I'm just here for a bit of treasure! Don't attack me!
Claude: Someone got here first... Must be a band of looters. We can't let them get the treasure! Guess their luck's about to run out.

Thief: You're not trying to take this treasure from me, are you?

Thief: The treasure... I thought it would make me rich...


Thief: If I don't get this treasure back, the boss is gonna be really angry with me!

Thief: I should never have become a thief...


Thief: After all the trouble we went through to get this treasure, I'm not gonna let you get your hands on it!

Thief: Gah... Those thieves...


Thief Leader: Huh? Are you looting too? Well, I'm not letting you have this treasure!

Thief Leader: No! That's my treasure...

@Boss 
The Wind Caller: You have had your fun. If you are going to flee, now is your chance. If you are not going to flee... I shall take your life as payment!

%Byleth,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: Hmmm... Those who stand before me... How long has it been? Hundreds of years? Thousands? You have the stink of Sothis upon you... Let us find out whether you share her power.

%Claude,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: I smell those detestable 10 Elites... Who are you?
Claude: I'm the grandson of the grandson of the grandson of the elite Riegan. Now tell me who you are!
The Wind Caller: I am your family's enemy. If you carry the blood of the 10 Elites, you cannot be permitted to live.
Claude: What do you mean by that? And what's that Crest on your forehead?
The Wind Caller: No more talk. If you wish to survive, you must destroy me!

%Flayn,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: Ah, that face takes me back in time... You have not changed one bit, Ceth-
Flayn: I ask that you keep quiet, Uncle!
The Wind Caller: Why the rush, Ceth-
Flayn: Shh! Please keep quiet, Uncle!

%Seteth,The Wind Caller
The Wind Caller: Are these your companions?
Seteth: They are indeed. I should tell you that Seiros is in a precarious state right now.
The Wind Caller: I will not assist you. I have lived apart from the world of man, which disgusts me so. This war disgusts me also.
Seteth: I thought you might say as much. This is regrettable.

@End 
The Wind Caller: ...
Claude: It stopped moving... It is dead?
The Wind Caller: Zzz...
Claude: No... It seems it's just sleeping... I thought we were supposed to be given the treasure, but... Forget it. I'll just have a look around there. What about this thing? Huh. I'll think about it later.

Claude: Thanks for all your hard work, Teach. Sorry for dragging you along with me. I had no idea it would turn into a fight. But hey, at least we got some treasure out of it. I'll leave this in your capable hands. Do with it as you will.
Byleth: Why me?
Claude: You know our friends even better than I do.
Byleth: Why don't we share it?
Claude: How would we do that?
Claude: Give it to whoever you think it'll suit best. More importantly, I didn't go there looking for treasure. Not really. Legends about the saints abound. It's hard to tell fact from fiction. I like to confirm whatever I can, with my own eyes, to find the truth in those legends.
Byleth: What did you find out?
Claude: Not a thing. We didn't find anything concrete to prove that Saint Macuil had been there. We can't say for certain that the treasure we found was Macuil's either. I do wish we could have spoken to that Wind Caller a bit more.
Byleth: Could it have been Saint Macuil?
Claude: Ha! Unlikely. Macuil lived thousands of years ago. And I've never heard anything about the saints being monsters like that. Wait a minute... Could the Wind Caller have anything to do with the Immaculate One? The Immaculate One is a monster sent by the goddess... Could the Wind Caller be... Where was it that I heard that stuff about them having been sent by the goddess... Ugh, maybe I'm too tired. My head is heavy and I can't think straight anymore. Let's call it a day for now. I've got plenty of time to think this over.

@Opening 
Hubert reveals some of his thoughts about the mysterious power aiding the Empire with strange technology. As fate would have it, a visitor chooses that moment to arrive...

@Intro 
Hubert: Professor. You're here.
Byleth: Did you send for me?
Hubert: No. But while you are here, you may as well listen. I am sure you recall hearing about Kronya, Solon, and Lord Arundel. I am investigating their true identities. I want to know their origins. Their numbers. Their base of operations. Their plans. I want to know where they acquired their dark powers. How they disguise themselves. Many intriguing mysteries surround these people. Wouldn't you agree?
Byleth: Yes.
Hubert: I have a name for them.
Byleth: Not really.
Hubert: No? I suppose someone of your statue has more immediately pressing concerns. Well, I have a name for them.
Hubert: Those who slither in the dark...

Imperial Soldier: Lord Hubert! Pardon me, but Lord Arundel is at the monastery. He says he wants to discuss something with you and is waiting in the reception hall.
Hubert: Speaking of... Professor, would you come along?



Lord Arundel: Hubert. I have something I must request of you.
Hubert: Request? That is an unusual word choice. A request, by definition, can be refused. But if you have orders, Regent, I will follow them.
Lord Arundel: Heh. Such a reaction before you even hear me out. Very well. One of my subordinates was conducting experiments in the Sealed Forest. The Demonic Beast he was using ran wild and has created something of a...situation. Take care of it.
Hubert: Experiments, you say? Heh...very well. I will set out at once.  Professor, will you assist?
Byleth: Yes. 
Hubert: Thank you for your support. It is a great help.
Byleth: Now is not a good time. 
Hubert: I understand. I will call upon those who are able to move immediately. Let me know if you change your mind. It will take some time to prepare.

@Battle 
Hubert: My, my. Looks like this forest became infested with Demonic Beasts while we weren't looking. I suppose we've not a moment to lose. Not that I'm concerned for any of these...people. But since there may be a reward in it for us, we may as well do what we can to rescue them.

Hubert: Now then. Let's split up and move in to assist. It may be worth focusing your attention on those being targeted by multiple Demonic Beasts.

@End 
Mysterious Mage 1: What a disgrace to be saved by those fools...
Mysterious Mage 2: Enough. These certainly proved useful. Go ahead and take them.
Hubert: Your tools, I gather? Yes, I suppose we will take them off your hands since you asked so nicely.

Lord Arundel: I'm surprised at you, Hubert. Saving all of my poor subordinates...

Lord Arundel: Hmph. Casualties. You were not as helpful as I had thought you would be.
Byleth: I'm sorry.
Byleth: We did the best we could.
Lord Arundel: I am not criticizing you. This failure is my own for thinking you were capable of more.
Lord Arundel: It seems gratitude is in order. Let us meet again soon.

Hubert: Good riddance. What a nuisance that man is. He and his ilk must be aware of my investigation. No doubt this was all an attempt to make us believe we are powerless against them. It has only achieved the opposite effect.
Byleth: How so?
Hubert: They are looking down on us. They think we cannot touch them. But the closer we get to them, the less true that becomes. Just look at this weaponry we received as a token of their appreciation. It would be impossible for us to manufacture such a piece with our current tools and knowledge. It is not as powerful as a Relic, but it is nearly so. We will keep them close, for now, while we still need their strength to rule Fódlan. Once Fódlan is united, however, the focus of this war will shift. Rather than swords clashing on the battlefield, it will be knives cutting in the darkness. Lady Edelgard's war will be over, and House Vestra's will begin. We who rule the shadows will eradicate those who slither in the dark. When that time comes, Professor, you will be quite useful to us.

@Opening 
Amid riots in Hrym territory, Ferdinand learns that his missing father, Duke Aegir, has been found. Lysithea, who knows the area well, goes with him to investigate.

@Intro 
Duke Aegir: Can't...stop...running...

Duke Aegir: Wha--?!

Rogue A: We got you! You're the prime minister, aren't you?
Rogue B: Not anymore. He lost his power and his fancy title. Now he's just a man.
Duke Aegir: I...
Rogue C: Shut up!
Rogue A: Yeah! Do you know what you've done to regular folks like us? Since you villains took over the Hrym territory, our lives have been nothing but pain and misery! Heavy taxes, forced labor. It's brutal!
Rogue D: Now we're gonna make you pay!
Duke Aegir: Agh! Argh! Aaaaaaaargh!



Ferdinand: Hm, such a nice selection of tea leaves in the pantry here.
Lysithea: Tea is nice and all, but it's not much good when you don't have sweets to go with it.
Ferdinand: Sweet treats are less common, yes, but perhaps that makes sense. War is not sugar-coated.
Lysithea: If you've got time to be cheeky, you've got time to find me some sweets.
Ferdinand: But Lysithea, your smile is so sweet--

Knight of Seiros: Lord Ferdinand! Excuse the interruption. Our scouts happened upon the information you were looking for. I thought it would be best to let you know as soon as possible.
Ferdinand: They know where my father is?!
Knight of Seiros: Yes, sir.
Ferdinand: Tell me, now.
Knight of Seiros: After losing his position as prime minister, your father was held in Enbarr for a very long time. He escaped. For a while, no one knew where he was. The other day, however, he was sighted alone in the Hrym territory. Seemed he was heading for an allied region.
Lysithea: Hrym...
Ferdinand: Alone, you say. Was he safe?
Knight of Seiros: I'm afraid not... There is a major insurrection happening in the Hrym territory. It's been five years since Duke Aegir lost his control of the area... The military seems to have finally lost control, and the people's violence is unleashed.
Ferdinand: I do not understand. Why are they rioting?
Lysithea: It's obvious, isn't it? Ferdinand, do you really know nothing about Hrym? Your own father was ruling it -- you don't know what became of the area once he fell from power?
Ferdinand: If it was truly a House Aegir territory, I would have been trained in governing the area. But my father insisted that I have nothing to do with Hrym. But now is not the time to talk about this. We have to help him before he gets caught up in the violence.
Lysithea: You're right. Now isn't the time for chitchat. Let's get over there quickly. Professor, will you be coming?
Byleth: I'll go with you. 
Lysithea: We'd better depart as soon as possible. I know a bit about the situation. I'll fill you in later.
Byleth: I want you to wait. 
Ferdinand: I understand. If you cannot help us, the Knights of Seiros will, so it is not a problem.
Lysithea: Professor, time is of the essence. If you're going to come with us, prepare as quickly as you can.

@Battle 
Ferdinand: This is where my father was sighted? The citizens are rioting everywhere.
Lysithea: Over there! Quick -- we need to help them!
Ferdinand: There seem to be some people inciting the violence. If we take them out, perhaps the violence will subside.
Lysithea: It might be best to spread out...

Ferdinand: The north side of the town is in chaos. I do not think we can advance.
Lysithea: It seems better to simply hold the line against the enemies to the north, and focus our efforts on saving the citizens in the east and south.

Villager: Th-thank you! Looks like I won't be robbed this time!

Villager: Thank you ever so much for helping us! I don't know what would have happened if it weren't for you...

Villager: We owe you our lives! We're saved! Saved, I say!

Villager: I get to live another day, and it's all because you came to the rescue!
Lysithea: I think that's all of them. I'm so glad we were able to help everyone.

Rogue: All right! Let's ransack this place!
Lysithea: Ugh, we weren't fast enough! But there's still time to save the others. Hurry!

Rogue: Oh yeah, keep going! Hahaha!
Ferdinand: They got past us...again. We have to save the next one!

Rogue: I'll take whatever I want, and there ain't nothing you can do to stop me!
Lysithea: Ugh, they ransacked another house! But there may be others yet who need our help.

Rogue: All right, boys! Smash and grab whatever's left!
Ferdinand: We could not save anyone?! It infuriates me to feel so helpless...

Rogue: Oh, looky there, some houses are still untouched! Let's give 'em a good plundering, boys!
Lysithea: Professor, let's make haste and go help them! Their lives may be forfeit if we don't get to them quickly.

Rogue Grappler:  Hyaah! Go on, boys! Riot to your heart's content!
Rogue Grappler:  Argh! I'm not the only...bad guy here...
Rogue Thief: What?! W-we give up! Have mercy! That guy made us do it!

Rogue Swordmaster:  Hahaha! If we cause enough chaos, we can do whatever we want!
Rogue Swordmaster:  My ambition...unfulfilled...
Rogue Thief: We yield! Yield! We were just following orders! It's not like we love a good riot, really!

Rogue Sniper:  What do you want?! You'd better not stand in our way!
Rogue Sniper:  And after I went to all the trouble of killing that noble and stealing his treasure...
Ferdinand: Father, no! So, we were too late after all...

@End 
Lysithea: Ferdinand... Hey.
Ferdinand: Yes?
Lysithea: I... I don't know what to say. About your father, I mean.
Ferdinand: No, it is all right. Some part of me was expecting this. I do not know what happened in Hrym territory, but I'm sure he got what he deserved. You knew more about it, you said? Maybe you can tell me everything later.

Lysithea: I can tell you what I know.
Ferdinand: Please do.
Lysithea: You know about the Hrym rebellion, right?
Ferdinand: Of course. The rebellion started when Emperor Ionius IX tried to consolidate power. The Hrym family tried to split off from the Empire and join the Alliance. Working with House Ordelia, they raised an insurrection. The Empire suppressed it. And then a puppet leader was installed in the Hrym territory. House Aegir was tasked with handling the actual governance of the region. Seeing this, the nobles feared that the Empire would assume total control. That's when the six great noble families chose to wrest power from Ionius IX.
Lysithea: That's right. The Insurrection of the Seven. I've always wondered why it was called seven when there were only six noble families.
Ferdinand: It was the six great noble families, plus Hrym.
Lysithea: How vexing. Either way, events unfolded shortly thereafter. Are you aware of how Duke Aegir was ruling the Hrym territory? He imposed harsh taxes upon the people -- much harsher than on his own -- making their lives very challenging. People fled their homes in droves to the neighboring Ordelia territory. But they were sent back from where they came. The Empire was occupying Ordelia territory as well, as it turned out. Issues were further complicated when Duke Aegir fell from power. Aegir was dismissed from his position, only to be replaced by Lord Arundel.
Ferdinand: Edelgard's uncle, the regent of the Empire...
Lysithea: Correct. And he imposed even heavier taxes on the people, squeezing them painfully dry. The people were conscripted for duty. Any who opposed were killed on the spot. Lord Arundel did this in the name of Duke Aegir.
Ferdinand: What?!
Lysithea: Your father was by no means a great ruler. But it was Lord Arundel who stoked the fury of the people and directed that fury at your father. Duke Aegir is not perfect, but he's not the villain in this.
Ferdinand: Lysithea, thank you for telling me all this. I am embarrassed to say, I had no idea. I see now that it was not his fault. But he did go along the wrong path, and place a burden on his people. He can no longer atone for what he did, so I will have to. I need to go think about what I will do after the war. How I will make up for my father's mistakes.
Lysithea: Nothing helps deep thought like sweets.
Ferdinand: Hm?
Lysithea: Sweets. They help you think. Perhaps you should find some for us.
Ferdinand: I see. If I find some, I will be sure to let you know.

@Opening 
Sylvain is unable to stand idly by when he learns that the band of thieves once led by his brother, Miklan, are again causing trouble in Margrave Gautier's territory.

@Intro 
Sylvain: Hey, Professor. You're looking lovely as ever.
Sylvain: Are you working today? You gotta take a day sometime. Get out in the world and have some fun.
Byleth: That's not a bad idea.
Sylvain: Right? Sometimes you gotta forget all the things you oughta do and focus on what you'd rather do. Hey, we should go get something to eat. My treat.
Byleth: I could never...
Sylvain: Aw, come on, Professor. Let me buy you something to eat. Relax for a couple hours at least.
Byleth: No, thank you.
Sylvain: Ah, fine. You're missing out though.
Byleth: What are you after?
Sylvain: What? I can't invite my professor to dinner without it being a scam? Heh! I...ah...OK, fine. You got me.
Sylvain: I need to ask a favor, and I wanted a way to work up the courage to ask you.
Byleth: Ask me what?
Byleth: Is this about a girl?
Sylvain: No, for once it's not about a girl.
Sylvain: There are thieves in my father's territory. I was wondering if you'd go with me to drive 'em off. You remember the thief leader you fought at Conand Tower, yeah?
Byleth: Your brother?
Sylvain: Yes, Miklan. He was the oldest son of House Gautier.
Byleth: Miklan?
Sylvain: That's right. Although he's dead now...

Byleth: Yes, that's crazy.
Sylvain: The way my father is...he probably has some other motive that I'll never know.
Byleth: Why just you?
Sylvain: Because he thinks he'd lose face asking the church for help. I don't know. He could have asked another trusted house to send troops, but he only asked me. And the way my father is...he probably has some other motive that I'll never know.
Sylvain: Maybe he just wants me to get some more experience in battle. Crazy way to suggest it though. Anyway, I'm not going alone, no matter what he asks. I'm going to ask some of the others in our class to help too. But none of us have your expertise. If you'd come with us, I'd be grateful.
Byleth: Of course. 
Sylvain: Great! I'll talk to the others and see who's in. Thanks, Professor!
Byleth: I can't right now. 
Sylvain: OK. I understand. I did kind of just drop that question on you, huh? If you change your mind though, let me know. I'll be around for a bit.

@Battle 
Sylvain: OK, we've got the thieves covered on both sides. Some of the thieves are still carrying what they stole, so we have a chance to get it back. Gotta be careful, though. They'll run off faster than a nobleman's daughter if we just rush in. Target the strongholds to cut off their escape routes.

Sylvain: My father's offering a reward for every thief and rogue we take out. The more you beat, the more you get. Just remember, you gotta take them down fast. They'll bolt as soon as they're hurt. Take the strongholds and we cut off their escape route.



Sylvain: OK, that'll do it. This exit route is blocked off. Very good. Now, let's keep cool and take out the other strongholds.

Sylvain: That's one more stronghold taken and one more escape route blocked. There are still some strongholds left. Professor, which should we go for first?

Sylvain: Another escape route blocked. We're nearly done! Take out those thieves, and capture that last stronghold.

Thief: We've been rattled... Let's get out of here for now.
Sylvain: Ugh, they're getting away! If only we'd taken the stronghold out in time.

Thief: I guess we've pinched enough stuff here. That'll keep our bellies stuffed for a while!
Sylvain: Professor, are you letting them get away? Come on, we gotta block off their escape routes!

@Boss 
Thief Leader: Gah... I'm not sticking round here to get slaughtered by a bunch of stuck up jerks like you!

%Sylvain,Thief Leader
Thief Leader: Hey, I know that face. You're the boss's little bro, right?
Sylvain: I'm sorry to say it, but yeah, I'm his brother. And he's led you into a bad spot. Anyway, your boss is dead. So this is your chance to disband this little thief gang of yours.
Thief Leader: Quiet, fool! You think I have any other choice but to be a thief?
Sylvain: Well, it's probably on me for making such a stupid request.

@End 
Sylvain: Professor, thank you for your help. We drove off the thieves and got a reward from my father. Job well done, eh? Although, I don't know how to feel about this particular reward.

Sylvain: I guess that's why my father tasked me with this particular mission. He wanted me to prove myself worthy of this Relic. This weapon, the Lance of Ruin... It killed my brother, and now it's mine.
Byleth: Isn't that dangerous?
Syvlain: Not remotely. I bear the Crest of Gautier. The same Crest my brother wished for his whole life but never came to possess.
Byleth: You're still thinking about your brother, aren't you?
Sylvain: I suppose I am... Miklan hated me from the moment he found out I had a Crest and he didn't. He was selfish and egotistical. I know it's not right to say bad things about the dead, but he earned it. Even now, I'm still cleaning up his messes. I have to wonder though... What if it was the other way around? If he had the Crest and I didn't... Would I be the one my father thought was worth forgetting? Or would my fate have been wholly unlike his?
Byleth: Thinking like that won't get you anywhere.
Sylvain: You're probably right, Professor. It's not like me, is it? I don't pray much...but I think I'm going to pray for those who lost their lives to the thieves tonight. And for all of us. I'm afraid there are more days like this coming our way.
Byleth: Why do you say that?
Sylvain: Faerghus has always been a cold place. Never very well-to-do. Until about 10 years ago, our region was a battlefield for the people of the Sreng Region to the north. And after the late king fell, the whole Kingdom became unstable. So it's no real surprise that more and more people are resorting to thievery just to survive. And there are those rumors of the current regent being too busy chasing the ladies to bother with governing. Don't worry, I get the irony. The whole damn Kingdom is in decline because of nonsense like that. I'm hoping once we get Dimitri on the throne everything will get better. Anyway, I'll leave it up to you to decide how you want to use our reward. Including the Lance of Ruin. I know I can trust you with it until you think I'm ready. And, Professor, if I could, I'd still like to buy you a meal sometime.
Byleth: There's no need.
Sylvain: Or do you really just hate the idea of having dinner with me? Just kidding! I know you're busy.
Byleth: You have another favor to ask?
Sylvain: No, I'm just asking a friend to hang out, that's all.
Sylvain: Again though, thank you for everything, Professor. I couldn't have done it alone.

@Opening 
As Edelgard works to reorganize the army after merging with Alliance troops, she receives an urgent message from Duke Goneril, whose forces guard Fódlan's Locket.

@Intro 
Edelgard: There... We must rethink the supply route now that the battle lines have moved. This one will be Hubert...and Count Bergliez will oversee this force here...

Edelgard: Ah, Professor... Is something wrong? Sorry, I thought I had a bit more time before the council meeting.
Byleth: You never stop working.
Edelgard: True. Though ideally, I'd like to hand off anything I can to my subordinates. But while we're on the front lines, I can't help but worry about every little thing.
Byleth: Sorry to bother you.
Edelgard: No bother at all, but I'm afraid I'm not quite finished here. Still, I'm happy to see you. Your presence lightens my mood a great deal.
Edelgard: Now, let's see...

Hubert: Pardon, Your Majesty. An urgent matter.
Edelgard: What's happened?
Hubert: There is an army from Almyra at Fódlan's Throat. Reports indicate it is of appreciable size.
Byleth: Fódlan's Throat?
Hubert: A steep mountain range runs along the border between Fódlan and Almyra. That mountain range is called Fódlan's Throat. The sturdy fortress built within those mountains is called Fódlan's Locket. It occupies the sole path through. The church and the Alliance nobles built the Locket to safeguard against Almyran invasion.
Edelgard: Normally, House Goneril watches over the fortress. In times of trouble, the lords join together to protect it. But I assume it would be too difficult to defend against this incursion with only the troops of Goneril...
Hubert: The situation has been precarious for House Goneril since Holst fell ill.
Byleth: Holst?
Hubert: The heir to House Goneril, renowned for his bravery. He is Hilda's elder brother.
Byleth: I see.
Edelgard: Holst is a formidable commander. it is only logical that House Goneril would struggle in his absence. The Alliance has shattered. They can't request soldiers from the surrounding lords. And the Imperial troops stationed there can't be relocated so easily. The best course of action is for us to go out there and deal with this ourselves. It's critical for us to protect that location. This is our chance to prove that we won't allow it to fall.
Hubert: Yes. It is to the benefit of our future governance not to abandon it. It seems this must be done. Will you assist us?
Byleth: I will. 
Edelgard: We'll depart after you finish making preparations. Move swiftly. We must move before the Almyran army crosses the Throat.
Byleth: Let me think. 
Edelgard: Yes... Preparations must still be made. We'll wait a bit longer. If you're not going to join us, we'll take those who are able and willing. Don't worry about it.

@Battle 
Edelgard: It seems we made it in time. Let's help the soldiers of House Goneril withdraw. The Black Eagle Strike Force will protect Fódlan's Locket!
Goneril Soldier: Support! We're saved!
Nader: Reinforcements? And that flag belongs to the Imperial army... Ha! A fine enemy, indeed! Break through the Locket and make a name for yourself! No need to by shy--strike all at once!

Edelgard: We fight to protect Fódlan! If the defensive line is broken, we fail! Our enemies are many...but we can use the terrain to our advantage and stop them where they stand!

@Boss 
Nader: I must commend you for your courage, seeing as how you dare stand against me!

%Byleth,Nader
Nader: Your sword is fit to cleave a mountain in two. Care to try it out against the undefeated Nader?

%Edelgard,Nader
Edelgard: They call you undefeated... Oh, but you've already suffered one defeat, have you not? And on this day, victory will again be ours!
Nader: "The Once Defeated" isn't quite as exciting, is it? I'll just have to claim this victory here to wipe away the shame of defeat!

@End 
Nader: So this is how far I go... Unbelievable... What a scary woman...
Edelgard: No matter how many times you attack, we will never allow you to capture the Throat.

Edelgard: The Almyran troops are difficult opponents... For now, I would much rather focus on Fódlan's internal territories. I hope they don't mount another attack anytime soon.

Edelgard: The Almyran Army retreated. Their casualties were numerous. As I understand it, they won't be attempting another invasion anytime soon. Still, we must prepare the local troops before their enemy returns.
Byleth: They are an irritating neighbor.
Edelgard: Indeed. But if possible, I would like to foster amicable relations with them.
Byleth: Maybe we can befriend them?
Edelgard: That is my hope. I would even consider a treaty.
Edelgard: Unlike Fódlan, Almyra is not a land ruled by a blind fealty to the goddess. I believe we need only to communicate openly with them and respect the differences between our cultures. If we do that, we should be able to have an meaningful dialogue with them, one more promising than what we can expect from followers of the goddess.

Edelgard: Ah, Hubert. What did Duke Goneril say?
Hubert: He expresses his sincere gratitude to Lady Edelgard. In addition, he would like to leave the protection of the Throat to Imperial troops from now on.
Edelgard: Is that so? How reasonable of him. By the way, what was it that ailed Holst?
Hubert: I did not hear all the details, but apparently he ate some bad mushrooms. It is said he is now emaciated and pale, and his skin exudes a mysterious vapor.
Edelgard: Huh, I can't help but imagine what that must look like...but it's probably better not to think about it.
Hubert: Agreed. Do not worry yourself with such thoughts.
Edelgard: ...
Byleth: I'm too curious.
Edelgard: Indeed... Well, then maybe you should pay a visit. And then...you could tell me what it looked like.
Byleth: It's best left unseen.
Edelgard: There's only one option, then. I must pay a visit on my own and see this ailment with my own eyes.
Hubert: Heh...
Edelgard: Actually... On second thought, I'd better not. As emperor, I can't risk it.

@Opening 
The war in Fódlan has put Brigid in a precarious position. With Bernadetta in tow, Petra returns to her homeland in hopes of avoiding a confrontation with her grandfather.

@Intro 
Bernadetta: Ah, nothing like a moment of perfect stillness...
Petra: Why is it preferable to have stillness?
Bernadetta: Ah! Petra? Please don't sneak up on me like that! Oh... You're here too, Professor? What's going on?
Petra: I was asking my question first. What are you enjoying about air that is still?
Bernadetta: Um. Still air makes me feel better, that's all. It means you're in a nice, closed-off space where you can hide.
Petra: But spaces that are wide and open are wonderful. Places like forests and oceans.
Bernadetta: Guess we'll have to agree to disagree about that.
Petra: I am not understanding your answer, but I am appreciating your explanation. I am reminded. I was wanting to ask if you wish to go to the forest or ocean with me?
Bernadetta: Um. What? What part of anything I said would make you think I wanted that?

Bernadetta: So your grandfather is in trouble. He's trying to lend us soldiers from Brigid, but... Edelgard is sending messengers there to convince Brigid she's not their enemy.
Petra: You are saying messengers, but the truth is they are a threat. Brigid is having no power to refuse.
Bernadetta: I get it, but what does this have to do with me?
Petra: Professor was asking this of me. I was told...if I am going to a far away place, to be taking Bernie with me, since she is hiding away.
Bernadetta: What?! Professor! What did I do to deserve this?! I know I'm a recluse, but I do go out on missions once in a while!
Byleth: You can't refuse.
Bernadetta: Tyranny! Abuse of power! I have rights!
Byleth: Lend me your strength. 
Bernadetta: You say that, but I don't think I'm ready for this.
Petra: Bernie, I am wanting this as well. Please join me.
Bernadetta: Since you put it that way, Petra...I'll think about it. Do you really want me to go, Professor?
Byleth: I do. 
Bernadetta: All right. I'll lend a hand...for everyone's sake!
Petra: What is the point of lending a hand? Are you not needing both of them to battle?
Bernadetta: What?! No, it's a figure of speech! Oh, don't make me imagine that!
Byleth: I'm not sure. 
Petra: Maybe we are not needing you then. I will try borrowing the power of the church.
Bernadetta: Um, OK... I don't mind shutting myself in like usual. But I can't say I feel good about all this!
Petra:  If your mind is changing, please tell me. I will be waiting as long as I can.

@Battle 
Bernadetta: Professor, this is bad! The enemy's already here!
Petra: In strength, the enemies may be winning, but I am having an idea... I have been hearing that my friends are being imprisoned in the western stronghold... We will be taking the stronghold and releasing our allies! Do not let loose your hope.
Bernadetta: Wh-what? That side's crawling with enemies! We should go east! Way fewer of them over there...

Imperial Soldier: What's this?! You there! Identify yourselves!
Bernadetta: Ah! They're here. I'm not the one you want. I'm innocent!

Petra: The capturing of the stronghold has been completed. Our friends from the stronghold will soon be aiding us in battle...

Hubert: Well, well, well. This little diplomatic errand to Brigid just got interesting. It seems we have some special guests. Capture the road ahead before they reach it.

Petra: If they are blocking the road, I will not have the ability to be seeing my grandfather! I must be moving quickly!

Catherine: I came here to tell the people of Brigid not to join forces with our enemies. Looks like the Empire had the same idea. Let's block the road and cut them off!

@Boss 
Hubert: Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. You will not turn them against us!

Catherine: Brigid will not become a puppet of the Empire. The Knights of Seiros won't let it happen!

Catherine: I can't achieve anything more here. Keep fighting! Stop them!

%Petra,Hubert
Hubert: So, Princess of Brigid. Now we see where your loyalties truly lie. This, after we spared your life in return for naught but your fealty. How ungrateful.
Petra: Ten years have been passed. The Empire has been changed, just as Brigid has!

%Bernadetta,Hubert
Bernadetta: Ah! They're here! Help me!
Hubert: Heheheh. Go on and scream, if it makes you feel better. But if you could die swiftly and without a struggle, I would greatly appreciate it.

%Bernadetta,Catherine
Bernadetta: Ah! It's Thunder Catherine! We're done for!
Catherine: Hey, I was going to say that! You didn't let me introduce myself. How rude. Thunderbrand and I will have to teach you some manners.

@End 
Hubert: Heh. No more I can do here. Troops, remember your orders. I must withdraw.

Petra: It is done! Now, I can be meeting my grandfather. We must be moving with haste!
Bernadetta: Finally over? Phew! All right, let's get out of here! This isn't exactly, um, the ideal environment for a recluse, you know.
Petra: I will be speaking with my grandfather. Once he is convinced, I will be returning. Professor, everyone, please be waiting here. Enemies may still be nearby.
Bernadetta: Got it. We'll wait right here. And if anyone comes, um, the professor will handle it. Right, Professor?

@Battle 
Petra: My life is endangered! I must keep alive!

Petra: Reinforcements are ready. Let us attack with each other!

Petra: Professor... Please, convey to my grandfather... that... I am without regret...
Bernadetta: Petra!? Petra no! Don't leave us!

Petra: Grandfather, I cannot be meeting you... My objective was failed.

@End 
Petra: It is done. Now, I can be meeting my grandfather. We must be moving with haste!
Bernadetta: Finally over? Phew! All right, let's get out of here! This isn't exactly, um, the ideal environment for a recluse, you know.
Petra: I will be speaking with my grandfather. Once he is convinced, I will be returning. Professor, everyone, please be waiting here. Enemies may still be nearby.
Bernadetta: Got it. We'll wait right here. And if anyone comes, um, the professor will handle it! Right, Professor?

Bernadetta: The vegetation around here's pretty different from the kinds we usually see. It may be no good for a recluse, but the forest does have its own charms, doesn't it?
Byleth: I'm surprised to hear you say that.
Bernadetta: Didn't you know? I love greenery! Especially carnivorous plants. They're my favorite.
Byleth: You like plants?
Bernadetta: Sure do! Especially the carnivorous ones.
Byleth: Carnivorous plants...
Bernadetta: Yes! They just sit there, nice and still, and wait for their dinner to come to them! How great is that? And they all look so unique too!
Byleth: ...
Bernadetta: What? Don't you think so? Oh, look! Petra's back!
Petra: Sorry to be making you wait. I have spoken with him.
Bernadetta: It's been a long time since you've seen your grandfather, huh? How'd it go?
Petra: As is usual, my grandfather is well and strong. He was saying that he will be supporting us and giving us troops.
Bernadetta: That's great! So we did it?
Petra: We did. You have my thanks. Ever since we were losing the war to the Empire, Brigid has been viewed as a vassal state. But with Fódlan at war...it is a chance for Brigid to be changing our situation. Our cooperation today is part of that chance. Brigid is wanting equality with Fódlan. We will be working hard to make this happen.
Bernadetta: Ah...
Petra: Bernie? What is it you are feeling?
Bernadetta: You're amazing, Petra. You went all by yourself to a foreign country... You worked hard for your homeland, and you achieved your goal. I'm always focused on my own problems, and I barely ever get anywhere...
Petra: That is not the truth. You were fighting hard for me. You came here to be helping everyone. You were not thinking only of yourself. I am never doubting you were working hard. We will be working together to keep moving forward to the future.
Bernadetta: You...really mean it? That's so nice!
Petra: And you were telling me about your interest in foreign vegetation. That is one reason I wanted to be bringing you here. Did it make you happy?
Bernadetta: It did! It was really exciting! I've got so many drawings I need to do before we head back! I might even have enough to make it into a book! Yeah, I should do that! Want to help, Professor?

@Opening 
Lorenz receives a letter from his father, Count Gloucester, who wishes for his son to resolve a territorial dispute that is about to escalate to violence.

@Intro 
Lorenz: Ah, perfection. These tea leaves are just divine. Quite the impressive selection, if I do say so myself.

Cyril: Lorenz, so this is where ya are.
Lorenz: Hello, Cyril. Lured here by the exquisite aroma, were you?
Cyril: Uh...no? I've got a thing for ya. It's a letter. Alright. Well, don't say I didn't deliver it.

Lorenz: A letter for me, is it? Curious. Let's see what we have here.

Lorenz: ...

Byleth: So, who's it from?
Lorenz: Hello, Professor. It is a rare correspondence from my father, as it happens.
Byleth: Is that a love letter?
Lorenz: Alas, Professor, nothing so whimsical as that. This correspondence comes from my father.
Lorenz: Some difficulty with Acheron, apparently. My father wishes me to return home and settle it.
Byleth: Acheron?
Lorenz: A young lord whose domain borders my father's. Do you know of the Great Bridge of Myrddin? It is an old bridge across the Airmid River. A key crossing between Alliance and Empire territory. Acheron controls the land on the northern side. Controlling such an essential location gives him quite a bit of clout, which he is ever so eager to deploy toward the purpose of stirring up trouble. This time, he is dredging up an old border dispute that was supposed to be settled some time ago. He has even begun to dispatch military force. It is best we rout his troops before they cause any damage to the surrounding villages.
Byleth: Why does this fall to you, Lorenz?
Lorenz: To my father, Acheron is insignificant in the face of far more pressing political matters. Other houses wield far greater power and influence: Goneril, Ordelia, Edmund, and of course, Riegan. To make his voice heard at the roundtable conferences, my father must keep up relations with them. That is simply the way the Leicester Alliance works. It was, after all, founded with the goal of freedom from Faerghus. We prize that independence highly, even if it occasionally hinders cooperation. There is often talk of mutual aid, but the truth is that each noble acts to maximize personal benefit. At the moment, the Riegan Dukedom is in no state to keep those conflicting motivations in check. So while the Alliance may appear to be at peace, the reality is that internal conflict is a routine matter. Of course, this leaves me precious little time to sit back and enjoy a cup of tea. Alas, I must be off.
Byleth: Good luck.
Byleth: Sounds tough.
Lorenz: Since you are here, perhaps you would care to accompany me on this little errand? I have no fear of Acheron, but it could be valuable to experience these political nuances firsthand.
Lorenz: The fate of the Alliance will someday rest upon my shoulders, so it is important to me that those I deal with understand its workings. What say you to broadening your horizons?
Lorenz: It is important to me that those I deal with understand its workings. What say you to broadening your horizons?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Lorenz: Excellent! Let us be away at once. I shall leave the finer details of preparation in your capable hands.
Byleth: Another time. 
Lorenz: Of course. I understand you are quite busy, yourself. I cannot linger here forever, but please do come and speak with me again if you change your mind.

@Battle 
Lorenz: Far more enemies than I expected. I am glad you decided to come with us, Professor.
Acheron: Oh? And here I thought Count Gloucester would be too busy to send his soldiers here... Ah, well, it doesn't matter. I'll just have to deal with you little meddlers swiftly and decisively!
Lorenz: That is Acheron. If we can deal with him, that ought to scare the rest of these rats off. We need not actually kill him. So long as we cut his escape off convincingly enough, that should suffice. Incidentally, take note of those drawbridges. They can only be operated from one of the banks. We may be able to use that to our advantage.

Acheron: Ooh, have you found something nice? Go ahead and hand it over!
Lorenz: Thieves! Do not allow them to escape!

Lorenz: A thief has escaped!

Acheron: Looks like our boys gave them an artful slip!
Lorenz: I cannot believe we missed both of those dastards!

Lorenz: The enemy is on the move! Do not let them through!

Acheron: Well now, so you couldn't stop us after all!
Lorenz: Me, outmaneuvered by a rat?! Ugh. What a disgrace!

@Boss 
Acheron: Who are you? I'd appreciate it if you could just not get in my way!

%Lorenz,Acheron
Lorenz: Give it up, Acheron! We are in the right. If you try to remain here any longer...
Acheron: What, you'll kill me? A tiny kid like you kill someone like me? Oh, that's too funny.
Lorenz: An animal like you cannot be allowed to run amok. We will settle this here and now!
Acheron: If you think you're up to the task, then by all means. But it's not my fault if it ends badly for you.

%Claude,Acheron
Claude: I did hear that some good-for-nothing inherited this territory. I guess that's you, then.
Acheron: Who do you think you are? I'm not a good-for-nothing! You are!
Claude: If you were actually good for anything at all, I'd at least expect you to recognize who I am...

@End 
Acheron: Argh! Wait! I lose, I give up! I surrender! Please don't kill meeee!
Lorenz: ... You have my thanks, Professor. Please go on ahead. I will clean up here and then report to my father. See you back at the monastery.

Acheron: Now that's a stubborn defense... We should probably give up. Let's retreat!
Lorenz: So, they've withdrawn. What a pointless battle.

Lorenz: You have my thanks, professor. Please go on ahead. I will clean up here and then report to my father. See you back at the monastery.

Lorenz: Your assistance in this incident with Acheron has proved most essential. Consider me in your debt. Thanks to you, the Alliance was able to nip this internal conflict in the bud.
Byleth: What will become of Acheron?
Lorenz: He has written a pledge to my father, swearing never to cause trouble about the border again. Of course, he is hardly the type to bind himself in good faith to anything written on paper. But Acheron has many connections, both in the Alliance and in the Empire. To remove him entirely would cause more conflict. We will just have to watch him closely for now.
Byleth: That sounds like a cautious approach.
Byleth: That is a prudent decision.
Lorenz: Indeed. I do plan to eliminate him eventually, however. He is nothing but trouble. Incidentally, there was one other benefit to embarking upon this errand. Have a look at this.

Lorenz: The magic staff, Thyrsus. A Relic passed down through House Gloucester for generations. It seems my father has finally recognized my ability. Apparently he had been considering entrusting this Relic to me for some time. He has had precious few opportunities to take to the field of battle personally, of late. Doubtless by giving this to me, he intends to send the message that I must work even harder. I will certainly continue to do my utmost. But I am by no means completely subservient to his will.
Byleth: Is all not well between you two?
Byleth: You disagree with your father's opinions?
Lorenz: I would not go so far as that. But my father seldom thinks beyond the immediate benefit of our house. While that is important, I prefer to consider the greater good when I make decisions. I believe that is a noble's duty. Now, for the time being, may I trust you to decide how we may best make use of Thyrsus? For the moment, I think you are in the best position to apply it to the betterment of all of Fódlan.
Byleth: Are you sure?
Lorenz: To be quite honest, I am not certain I feel ready to decide the fate of a Relic on my own just yet. Do me this favor, Professor, and I will be grateful. Now, to celebrate! Allow me to treat you to tea.

@Opening 
Ignatz and Raphael, two sons of merchant families, set out to put an end to a series of monster attacks on merchants in Alliance territory.

@Intro 
Raphael:  So basically we just gotta defeat their leader, right? Then why don't we approach from...ugh! That won't work at all! Horses won't fit through there! I can't figure this out! I give up.
Byleth: Try to calm down and think it through.
Byleth: Shall we go over it one more time?
Raphael: But enemies never move how you want them to in a real battle, do they? I reckon I learn better on the battlefield.

Ignatz: Professor! I need to speak with you.
Raphael: Ignatz! You all right?
Ignatz: I received a letter from my brother back home. There's some disturbing news.
Byleth: What's going on?
Ignatz: Monsters have been attacking merchants within the Alliance territories.
Raphael: That happens all the time. I mean, that's how my parents died, so...
Ignatz: Ah, Raphael! I didn't mean to bring up such a sensitive topic in your presence.
Raphael: Hey, don't worry about that. C'mon, let's hear the rest of it.
Ignatz: Very well. These attacks seem to be focused on specific merchants.
Byleth: Like who?
Ignatz: Those who are traveling from the territory of House Gloucester to the Riegan Dukedom. Merchants traveling in the opposite direction, from Riegan to Gloucester, don't suffer nearly as many attacks.
Raphael: That doesn't make any sense. Someone's gotta deal with those monsters though.
Ignatz: Agreed. At this rate, my father and brother can't conduct business without risking their lives. Professor, could you assist me? I need your help exterminating these creatures.
Raphael: Now you're talking! I'm going too! I'm not learning anything in a classroom! You're gonna go, right, Professor? Don't you wanna help these folks?
Byleth: We depart at once. 
Raphael: Yeah! I knew you couldn't resist!
Ignatz: Thank you so much, Professor! And Raphael, I can't begin to express my gratitude.
Byleth: Not right now. 
Raphael: Seriously? Can't you see how important this is to Ignatz?
Ignatz: Ah, no, that's perfectly understandable. I'm sure the professor has much to do. But let me know if you change your mind, would you? If you can't come, I'll try asking some of the knights.

@Battle 
Merchant: Aah! Monsters! Begone!
Ignatz: Look! The monsters are attacking those merchants again.
Raphael: Looks like there are some humans mixed in there! Maybe they're controlling the monsters! If they are, do you think we just have to take out the leader?
Ignatz: Let's get started, before it's too late!

Raphael: The merchants can probably escape, but we gotta get rid of those enemies who are blocking the path!
Ignatz: Look, a drawbridge! We can use that to cross, but we'll need to lower it first.

Raphael: Oh no! Looks like we just lost one of the merchants!
Ignatz: Come on... Let's try to save the rest of them.

Merchant: No... Why?!
Ignatz: No! We couldn't save any of them?!
Raphael: Aaargh! They can't get away with hurting those merchants! I'm gonna make them pay!

Alliance General: What do you think you're doing? Don't get in the way of our duty!
Ignatz: Your duty? You're letting monsters wreak havoc on innocent people!
Alliance General: Shut it! It's got nothing to do with you!

Alliance General: I'm not looking forward to telling the count...
Raphael: Looks like we took care of 'em!
Ignatz: That man mentioned the count. What could Count Gloucester have to do with all this?

@End 
Merchant: Thank you so much! We're safe now and it's all due to your efforts! I can't bear to think what might have happened if you hadn't shown up.
Raphael: Yay! A happy ending for everyone!

Merchant: Thank you so much! We're safe now, but it's a shame we weren't all lucky enough to escape... We might've all met the same fate if you hadn't shown up.
Raphael: I'm real sorry we couldn't save everyone...

Ignatz: If you don't mind me asking....were you headed to the Riegan Dukedom?
Merchant: We were. We traveled around the Alliance selling our wares. I heard this route was dangerous, but...
Ignatz: Dangerous, you say. Are you referring to the recent cases of merchants being attacked on that route?
Merchant: That's right. We can't turn a profit without going to Derdriu. I don't know what Count Gloucester is thinking.
Byleth: This is the count's doing?
Ignatz: I had a feeling it might be. You're certain?
Merchant: Looks that way. I think he's unhappy with merchants contributing to House Riegan's wealth. It seems like he's been at odds with them forever. They say even the previous Duke Riegan's death...
Raphael: Was that the count's fault too?
Merchant: It's only a rumor, but it was Count Gloucester himself who lured the late Duke Riegan out. If I recall correctly...he invited the duke to his estate to strike a deal on some valuable art pieces. I believe the duke brought a pair of merchants with him to assess the pieces in question, but...
Ignatz: ...
Merchant: Alas, it seems those merchants lost their lives alongside him. A terrible misfortune. I wish these nobles wouldn't get us common folk mixed up in their feuds. You came from Garreg Mach, right? I'll send a token of our thanks over later.

Ignatz: ...
Byleth: Those merchants who lost their lives...
Raphael: Yeah, that was my ma and pa.
Ignatz: My parents received the request initially, but they had other business. They recommended Raphael's parents as substitutes. We could never have imagined...
Byleth: And Count Gloucester, isn't he...
Ignatz: Yes, he's Lorenz's fath--
Raphael: OK, OK! That's enough of that! It's just a rumor, right? So, who cares? Even if it's true, that's our parents' business. It's got nothing to do with us.
Ignatz: But you--
Raphael: You got no idea what really happened, right, Ignatz? And I bet Lorenz doesn't know either! The way I see it, it was monsters that killed my parents. They died in an accident. I got no reason to hate anyone or blame somebody else for their deaths. I don't have time for that. I got my little sis to worry about instead.
Ignatz: Raphael...
Raphael: Now that that's settled, let's head back! What do you think that merchant's gonna send us? I hope it's food!

Byleth: Raphael is a nice guy.
Byleth: Raphael is a good man.
Ignatz: Yes. He really is.

@Opening 
Ingrid receives an unexpected proposal of marriage from a noble of rising status. As soon as Dorothea hears the name, she is adamantly against any engagement between them...

@Intro 
Ingrid: ...

Dorothea: What's the matter, Ingrid? I never hear you sigh like that.
Ingrid: Oh, hi, Dorothea. And hello, Professor. Nothing's the matter. Well, nothing major.
Dorothea: You don't look like it's nothing major. Then again, I suppose you always have a furrowed brow, don't you?
Ingrid: Truth be told, there's rather a lot going on. It seems that there's always something to worry about...
Byleth: What do you worry about?
Ingrid: A childhood friend who's always causing trouble, my family... Things like that.
Byleth: What's worrying you right now?
Ingrid: Now? Oh, I really did not wish to bother you with such trivialities...
Ingrid: You see, I received a letter from my father recently.
Dorothea: From Count Galatea? What a kind gentleman to have for a father.
Ingrid: I thank you. But the content within the letter is what I find troubling.

Dorothea: Let me see! Oh, it's a marriage proposal... For you.
Byleth: Do you know the suitor?
Byleth: Have you ever met the suitor?
Ingrid: I've not met him, though I've heard his name here and there. He began life as a merchant but has somehow achieved rank in court. An enterprising noble from an allied territory. It's most likely that he wants the Crest of Daphnel that I bear to adorn his family name.
Dorothea: Hmm, yes, that sounds about right. The jerk.
Ingrid: You sound as though you know him. Do you?
Dorothea: Yes, I must admit that I know him. He tried to court me when I was a singer. Best advice I can give you, Ingrid? Stay far, far away from this guy.
Ingrid: He's offered a sizeable dowry, so I must at least consider it–for the sake of my family.
Dorothea: Dowry? Ha! Blood money. That's all it is.
Ingrid: Dorothea, I–
Dorothea: This jerk's entire fortune is soaked in blood. Do you want to rebuild your own house using that kind of money? I mean, it's all just rumors, but I think it still might be worth investigating. What do you think, Professor? Should we go check this guy out?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Dorothea: Great. Let's tell the others.
Ingrid: Uh, really? OK...
Byleth: We don't have time. 
Ingrid: That's right, Dorothea. No point bothering. All of us, including the professor, are far too busy.
Dorothea: Are you sure? If you change your mind, Professor, just let me know.

@Battle 
Dorothea: Pft... The more we look into this guy, the more I see he's a monster, and no good for my Ingrid!
Ingrid: No kidding. There's no denying it. We'd better get back to the monastery.
Rogue:  Hold on a minute, you brats.

Rogue: Hand over the girl!
Ingrid: Surely you can't mean me. Wait... Did he send them?
Dorothea: This jerk figures he can grab Ingrid before things get too messy for him. Of course, we know the truth about him now, and he'll want to kill us and get rid of the evidence... But we'll never let him take Ingrid. Come on, let's hurry!

Dorothea: Protect Ingrid! Don't let anyone get near her!
Rogue: You'll never escape!

Merchant: I'll increase the reward! Now hurry up and capture that girl!
Ingrid: That merchant is giving order to the bandits! I bet if we take him out, reinforcements will cease!

Dorothea: It's an ambush! Ingrid's in trouble!

Ingrid: Enemies in hiding...here? They are really getting on my last nerve!

Rogue: Ha! Gotcha! Your future husband is eagerly awaiting his bride, you know.
Dorothea: Oh no! No! Ingrid!

@End 
Ingrid: Finally! It's over. I'm sorry for causing such a mess.
Dorothea: Oh, hush. For you, I'd go through twice as much trouble. But are you all right? Did they hurt you?
Ingrid: I'm OK. Really. Thank you, Dorothea. My father will need to hear of this.
Dorothea: Ingrid! Welcome back. Did you speak with your father?
Ingrid: I did. I just returned to the monastery.
Byleth: What happened with the proposal?
Ingrid: As soon as I informed him of the suitor's unsavory tendencies, he rejected the proposal outright. Were we to form ties with such an individual, it would bode poorly for our family, regardless of the weighty dowry offered.
Dorothea: Oh, thank goodness! I'm so glad it all worked out.
Ingrid: You and me both. My father also insisted I take this.
Byleth: A Hero's Relic?
Ingrid: Indeed. This is the magic lance, Lúin, which has been passed down for generations within my family. My father and siblings have no way of using it, since they bear no Crest. Father told me I should take it and use it to protect myself with. He said it's far better used protecting his daughter than gathering dust.
Dorothea: Aw, that's so sweet! Your father really does mean well, Ingrid.
Ingrid: He's unendingly stubborn, but I am proud of who he is. Dorothea, Professor... I want to thank you.
Byleth: Of course.
Dorothea: We couldn't just do nothing while you were facing a life of being married to a monster.
Byleth: It was important that we help you.
Dorothea: It really was quite exciting too! So, you know, don't worry about it.
Dorothea: I could never hand over my lovely Ingrid to some jerk who only wants her for her Crest.
Ingrid: Oh? Do I belong to you now, rather than to myself? Hey... Dorothea. This is probably more than a little awkward, considering where it came from, but...here.
Dorothea: A ring? Is this... No! Is it?!
Byleth: A proposal?
Dorothea: Oh, Ingrid... I accept your offer! We'll be together forever!
Byleth: A bribe?
Dorothea: I mean, sure, I suppose... Clumsy bribe though, giving me a ring and not telling me why.
Ingrid: Stop teasing me, Dorothea! I'm trying to be sincere. I wanted to find a way to emphasize how grateful I am to you. So I looked for something from among my things that I thought you would like. I mean...you may already have one like it, but I thought on the off chance you didn't...
Dorothea: Ingrid, you are just adorable and I love it. But perhaps we should lend this ring to our teacher for now. Our dear teacher can best decide how to use it. You found hard enough. You've earned the right to have a little fun.
Ingrid: As you wish, Dorothea. I gave the ring to you, so you can do whatever you please with it.
Dorothea: Haha.

@Opening 
Safety for the people of the Kingdom has been a growing concern, and Fraldarius territory is no exception. Felix has been called upon to help restore order back home.

@Intro 
Felix: There you are. I was looking for you. I need a favor.
Byleth: It’s unusual for you to ask for help.
Felix: Yes. It’s an unusual favor.
Byleth: You want to spar, right?
Felix: No. This is more serious.
Felix: My father sent a messenger. He wants me to return to Fraldarius territory.
Byleth: Your father?
Felix: Rodrigue Achille Fraldarius, the highest ranking member of the Faerghus nobility. I believe you've met him. So I heard. But about the favor. You’re familiar with the Tragedy of Duscur, I presume?
Byleth: I am.
Byleth: I can’t recall.
Felix: Warriors from Duscur killed King Lambert of Faerghus.
Felix: After the king’s death, public order disintegrated. Bandits continue to raid villages across the Kingdom, including those within Fraldarius territory. My father says he needs my help driving the bandits away.
Byleth: And you want me to join you?
Felix: Precisely. Good guess. Perhaps I shouldn’t pull you into this... It stems from my family’s failure to secure the region. But honestly, I want to see you in action. I never tire of watching you fight. And it’ll be much more interesting for you than the training ground. Or maybe this task -- driving off bandits -- seems dull to a former mercenary?
Byleth: I'll join you. 
Felix: Excellent! While I’m at it, I have a second favor to ask of you. Could you recruit more fighters? I bet there will be willing volunteers, if you’re the one inviting them. I’ll set off on my own and meet up with you there.
Byleth: Let me think about it. 
Felix: OK. I can handle a few bandits. If you change your mind about it, tell me soon.

@Battle 
Felix: Hmph. Struggling to defeat some bandits? What a pathetic old man my father is. Some villagers are trapped. Let’s help them escape.
Rodrigue: Felix, my son. You’ve finally brought reinforcements!

Rodrigue: Everything will be fine! Good people of this hamlet, escape while you can!

Rodrigue: The stronghold is ours. No more bandits should come crawling out of here.

Felix: Weakling. That should put a stop to their reinforcements.

@Battle-Talk 
%Byleth,Rodrigue
Rodrigue: So it's you! From the Officers Academy. Thank you for taking such good care of my son. It pains me to trouble you, but I humbly request your assistance in helping secure the villagers' safe escape!

%Felix,Rodrigue
Felix: Pathetic. Struggling to defeat some ragtag bandits.
Rodrigue: Felix... You may know this already, but no matter how many you kill, more always appear. Anywhere in the Kingdom these days you can see the same kind of scenes. His Majesty, the late king, would despair to see it.
Felix: A dead man doesn’t despair. Besides, let’s focus on the living.

%Dimitri,Rodrigue
Rodrigue: Oh, Prince Dimitri is here to help! I am humbled, Your Highness, and so sorry to trouble you.
Dimitri: No, it is fine. As a man of royal birth, this is the obvious course. However, it does not exactly seem like they are remnants of Miklan's faction.
Rodrigue: Indeed. Nothing but common bandits, and yet... Ruffians like that have recently surged in number.
Dimitri: I am aware. For now, let us focus on saving the villagers.

@Battle 
Rodrigue: Outmatched by a damn bandit...
Felix: Come now. Stop living in denial, old man.

Rodrigue: I cannot die in this place... His Majesty would want me to keep going...
Felix: My foolish father... He's in trouble.

Rodrigue: Everyone, I'm sorry. It's over for me...

Villager: Thank you so much! Please, help my neighbors too.

Rodrigue: That should do it. We’ve chased those ruffians away for good.
Villager: Thank you so much for your assistance! Please accept this small gift as thanks.

@End 
Rodrigue:  We are grateful for your help. I doubt those bandits will stop anytime soon. But at least this village is safe. This village was important to the late king. If we hadn’t saved it, I wouldn’t have been able to face His Majesty.
Felix: How foolish.
Rodrigue: Pardon?
Felix: We were protecting your subjects, not your ego. I don’t give a damn as to whether you can bring yourself to face a dead king.
Rodrigue: I will not tolerate such language from you.
Felix: I came here to hone my blade, and to save innocent people. I suppose if I had died, you would say the same thing you did after Glenn’s death. “He died like a true knight.”
Rodrigue: ...
Felix: I have nothing more to say. I’m going back.

Rodrigue: I'm sorry you had to see that. He's been that way for four years now. Of course, I understand his sentiment, to some extent. It all comes down to... Well, a difference of opinion.

@Opening 
Five years after Rhea's disappearance, a letter that she wrote prior to that battle has surfaced. The mysterious message raises more questions than it answers...

@Intro 
Seteth: Here you are. There is something we need to discuss. I found this letter in Rhea's quarters. I believe it is intended for you.
Byleth: How do you know that?
Seteth: Simple. Your name appears at the top. Once I saw that, I decided not to read any further. I will admit, however, that I am quite curious. Will you permit me to read it along with you?

Rhea: Dear child... I have little time, and so I will keep this brief. I asked you to take care of things should something happen, but I wished to make myself useful as well. I left a treasure at the Holy Tomb. Please take it. However, note that I set a bit of a trap to prevent thieves from stealing it. Please take ample precautions so that you are not harmed when you retrieve it. May Sothis protect you... -Rhea

Seteth: Judging by the rushed handwriting, she must have written this just prior to the battle five years ago. I know nothing of this treasure, but it must be quite valuable. If you intend to recover it, then I will accompany you. Shall we go?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Seteth: The letter does indicate that Rhea laid some sort of trap in the Holy Tomb. We should bring some allies along, just to be safe.
Byleth: Not now. 
Seteth: This was clearly important to Rhea. It certainly warrants a closer look in my opinion. Let me know if you change your mind.



Gilbert: Professor. So this is where you were. I have something I would like to show you.
Gilbert: I found this in Lady Rhea's room. It seems to be a letter...addressed to you.
Byleth: Did you enter the room on your own?
Byleth: Did you check out the room on your own?
Gilbert: I admit some guilt to the action. However, I hoped Lady Rhea had left something behind. I have not read the contents of the letter. If you do not object, could we read it together?

Gilbert: Her handwriting is a mess. It is likely she wrote this letter five years ago, just before the battle. If Lady Rhea says it's a treasure, then I've no doubt it would be useful to us. If you plan to retrieve it, I will accompany you. What is your plan, Professor?
Byleth: Let's go. 
Gilbert: However, it says Lady Rhea laid some manner of trap in the Holy Tomb. Just to be safe, I'd like to request somebody to accompany us. We don't know what dangers await.
Byleth: Not now. 
Gilbert: I defer to your judgment, Professor. But are you sure? Please let me know if you change your mind.

Claude: Here you are, Teach. Take a look at this.

Claude: I found it in Rhea's room. It's addressed to you.
Byleth: Did you enter her room on your own?
Byleth: Did you look through her room on your own?
Claude: Well, I know it's not necessarily fair to Rhea, but there's no way I wasn't going to take a look. I thought I might find some valuable information. Or even some treasures that could be useful for the coming war! In the end...all I found was that letter. I obviously couldn't read it before you did. Go ahead. I'm sick with curiosity.

Claude: Her handwriting is messy. She must have written it right before that battle five years ago. That treasure... If it belongs to Rhea, there's no doubt that it has great value. It would be bad if some thief managed to sneak off with it. Let's go and get it, Teach!
Byleth: Let's go. 
Claude: Great! But...there's a trap there that might injure us? Huh. Just to be safe, there's a friend I'd like to invite as well. After all, who knows what lies ahead.
Byleth: Not now. 
Claude: Wow. Even though Rhea left that special treasure behind just for you... Let me know if you change your mind, OK? I'll be around.

@Battle 
Seteth: These are the guardians of the Holy Tomb. They will attack any intruders. We had better take care.

Seteth: Rather excessive merely to deter thieves, isn't it? We should target those commanding phantoms.

Seteth: These phantoms are strengthening the golems. We must defeat the phantoms first.

Seteth: That's one, but there are others. We need to handle all of these commanders.

Seteth: That's reduced the golems' strength. Now's our chance to take them out.

Seteth: We have subdued the Holy Tomb's guardians. Let us get what Rhea left behind so we can leave this place.

Seteth: Got it! Ah--this seems important.

Gilbert: Something is wrong. Do not let your guard down.

Gilbert: Phantoms? And some are giving commands. Remove them from the battlefield immediately.

Gilbert: Mechanical beasts... Locate their puppet masters, and eliminate them!

Gilbert: One down! Target the remaining commanders!

Gilbert: The puppets still move, but they appear weaker. Destroying them should be easier now.

Gilbert: It seems all is safe. Let's find Lady Rhea's treasure, quickly.

Gilbert: Here! So this is Lady Rhea's treasure...

Claude: There's something there. Are those the devices that Rhea warned us about?

Claude: Those are the phantoms... And some of them are giving orders. Let's target those first.

Claude: Giant monsters... It would be best to take care of whoever's controlling them straight away.

Claude: They may be phantoms, but they can still be harmed. Let's take out the other commanders!

Claude: Those giant monsters can still move, but they seem much weaker now. We should be able to finish them.

Claude: Looks like we made it through the madhouse. So where's this treasure that Rhea mentioned?

Claude: We finally found it. This must be...the treasure? Let's get out of here and take a look.

@End 
Seteth: Allow me to apologize, on Rhea's behalf, for putting you so squarely in harm's way. That much force should not have been necessary to deter mere thieves. Perhaps, in her haste, Rhea made a miscalculation.
Byleth: What kind of trap was that?
Byleth: Did Rhea really build all that?
Seteth: It is a little-known legend that the Holy Tomb was constructed by the goddess herself. That mirage, those guardians--I believe that trap was there from the beginning. It must have been disabled for the sake of the ceremony the last time you were there. Now, as to this treasure we've uncovered... This is an ancient Relic, blessed by the goddess and kept sacred by the Church. It is both a priceless piece of history and a holy artifact of extraordinary power. Rhea has entrusted it to you, and you may do with it as you wish. But please treat it with the utmost care.
Seteth: Well, I suppose that concludes this bit of business. I shall take my leave.



Gilbert: I never thought a Holy Tomb would have a trap such as that. Had we not been prepared... Yet, if Lady Rhea set that trap, then what kind of person is she?
Byleth: A goddess, maybe?
Byleth: A genius, maybe?
Gilbert: Perhaps you could go save Lady Rhea and ask her directly. Whatever the truth, still this treasure has been recovered. I do not know how much history is attached to this item, but it is an amazing artifact. It is possible this weapon once engraved its name in the history of the Church of Seiros. This is your responsibility, emparted to you by Lady Rhea. You must decide how best to make use of it.
Gilbert: I will be going now. I must prepare for our next battle.



Claude: Good grief! Rhea's trap was more extensive than I expected. Could something like that really be a result of sorcery alone? I don't understand the structure at all... It certainly wasn't made quickly.
Byleth: Was it made earlier?
Byleth: What it there from the beginning?
Claude: I think so. That trap may have been built into the Holy Tomb when it was first constructed. In which case, there might have been another purpose for building it, other than just as a saint's tomb... Now I have even more questions for Rhea. I hope we reunite with her soon. However, we now have a salvaged treasure... It might be something incredible... The church kept some of the legendary weapons that were blessed by the goddess. This isn't something one just stumbles across. Anyway, it was entrusted to you, Teach. Do what you will with it.
Claude: My curiosity has been satisfied for the time being, so maybe I'll return to my responsibilities...

@Opening 
Without a Crest or a family fortune, Leonie has a difficult time getting her hands on quality gear. Linhardt offers her a hint about a sacred weapon anyone can wield.

@Intro 
Leonie: Not bad at all, if I do say so myself.

Linhardt: I see needles and thread. What has you engaging in the textile arts, Leonie?
Leonie: Patching up a hole in my equipment bag. Take a look. What do you think?

Linhardt: If your objective is merely to block up the hole, then I believe you've performed quite adequate work.
Byleth: You might need a new one.
Leonie: I'm not going to throw away something I can still use. I can't afford to be wasteful.
Byleth: Maybe you should ask for help next time.
Leonie: Blocking the hole was all I cared about, so this suits me just fine.
Linhardt: Yes, but your bag is less bag and more a collection of dirty, smelly patches.
Leonie: Smelly, huh? I don't smell anything.
Linhardt: That aside, don't you have an allowance from your house to make purchases?
Leonie: No, nothing. Worse than that, actually. I'm in debt. I could only afford the Officers Academy because everyone in my village donated.
Byleth: The tuition is that expensive?
Leonie: It's not just that. In the Alliance, you have to pay the nobles as well in order to secure recommendations. Commoners can only get an education by borrowing money. It's pretty stupid. Not sure what makes the nobles think they've got the right to– Oh, sorry, Linhardt. Forgot you're a noble.
Linhardt: If one is in a family that bears a Crest, then you're going to stand atop the social pecking order. I'd raise the topic with the goddess. She handed out Crests to the nobles after all.
Leonie: Just handed them out, huh? You make it sound pretty casual.
Linhardt: By the way, I have a weapon to recommend. It should suit a commoner such as yourself.
Leonie: That so? I just told you I don't have a lot of money.
Linhardt: You're not going to buy it from a merchant. If you find it, you can keep it for free.
Leonie: Now you've got my attention.
Linhardt: There's a legend I read recently about Saint Indech, one of the Four Saints of the Church of Seiros. 
Leonie: Uh-huh? Keep talking.
Linhardt: Sorry... Suddenly very sleepy. Nap time calls.
Leonie: Hey, come on! You can't just doze off in the middle of a story!
Linhardt: Long story short, there's a holy weapon hidden in Lake Teutates that you can use even without a Crest... 
Leonie: Lake Teutates? Right. Let's go, Professor!
Byleth: Me?
Leonie: What's with that look? Don't you want to help your lovely students?
Byleth: Lovely?
Leonie: Yeah. Me and Linhardt. Aren't we just the cutest?
Linhardt: Leave me be. I'm off to nap.
Leonie: We'll never find it unless you're there. If you're really that tired, we'll just have to carry you.
Byleth: I'm not sure I want to carry him.
Leonie: We'll bring more people. We'll take turns. Come on, Professor. You're coming, right?
Byleth: I will. 
Linhardt: If we're going now, I do suggest leaving Edelgard and Hubert innocent of our quest. Lake Teutates is a place that concerns the saints of the Church of Seiros. It may become bothersome should the two of them find out...
Leonie: I'm not fond of keeping secrets from friends, but I guess we can tell them when we get back.
Leonie: All right, let's go find this thing!
Byleth: Maybe later. 
Leonie: Ah, well. Guess it's just you and me, Linhardt.
Linhardt: Zzz...
Leonie: Let me know if you change your mind, Professor. Looks like I might be waiting here a bit.

@Battle 
Leonie: Linhardt! Wake up! We've reached Lake Teutates!
Linhardt: Huh? What? Oh, um. Yes. So we have.
Leonie: A temple on a lake, huh? Looks fancy. And that's a cute...uh...guard dog?
The Immovable: Guard dog? Is it I to whom you are referring?
Leonie: Whoa! A magic beast! And it talks!
The Immovable: Nuisance... You weaklings should turn tail and run!

Leonie: Uh, hi! We're actually, um, looking for something...
The Immovable: I know well what it is that you desire. If you want it, you must first complete my trial.
Linhardt: Of course we do. This is as awful as I expected. Perhaps we could go home now?
Leonie: Are you kidding? It's just a little fog! Come on, let's go talk to Mr. Magic Beast!

Linhardt: I suspect our opponent is an illusion. If we cut off the source of this magic, they should stop attacking.

@Boss 
The Immovable: Fine. Defeat me, and show me what you are capable of!

%Byleth,The Immovable
The Immovable: Could you be the incarnation of Sothis? Interesting... Let's test your mettle!

%Linhardt,The Immovable
Linhardt: We'll fight, but your form and mannerisms suggest that you might be...
The Immovable: If you want your wish to be granted, it is better that you fight me in ignorance.

%Leonie,The Immovable
Leonie: Hey, Mr. Magic Beast! If we defeat you, will you grant our wish?
The Immovable: Indeed, I will.
Leonie: Great! I may not have a Crest, but I'll give it my all!
The Immovable: You are an interesting young girl... I accept your challenge.

%Seteth,The Immovable
Seteth: You seem to be holding back. Thank you for that.
The Immovable: Hmph. Do not flatter me. My power is not what it once was. The best I can do nowadays is to have fun meddling with humans who wander in here.
Seteth: I see. We were hoping you might help us, but is seems that may be too difficult.

%Flayn,The Immovable
The Immovable: Oh! You're here too! I've always wanted to meet you, Ceth–
Flayn: I ask that you keep quiet, Uncle!
The Immovable: What's that? Ceth–
Flayn: Shh! Please keep quiet, Uncle!

@End 
The Immovable: You did well. The trial ends here... What sublime children of men... Go ahead. Name your desire.
Leonie: So, uh, we heard you're giving away free weapons?
Linhardt: Do be quiet, Leonie. Somewhere in this temple is said to rest the holy bow of Saint Indech. It is called "the Inexhaustible." Could you find it in your heart to let my friend here have it?
The Immovable: You have shown might deserving of my sacred bow. I will grant your wish.
Leonie: Yes! Thanks, Mr. Magic Beast!

Linhardt: Aren't you happy, Leonie? That's quite a bow, and it was completely free.
Leonie: I'll say. I've never seen anything like it. But is it really OK for me to take this?
Linhardt: I would say so, wouldn't you? After all, you went through an awful lot to get it.
Leonie: I know, but... Professor, maybe you should hold on to it for me. At least for a while.
Byleth: Why me?
Byleth: It's yours, Leonie.
Leonie: It's not a weapon just anyone can use. I can see that. I want to be more confident in my strength before I really call it my own. Even holding it right now makes me feel unworthy. I'd really appreciate you looking after it for me.
Byleth: I understand.
Leonie: Thanks, Professor. And everyone else who helped me too. I'm really grateful. Linhardt, I'm sorry I forced you to come along. But seeing such a kind-hearted person like you... Well, let's just say my opinion of the nobility's shifted a bit.
Linhardt: I'm not sure I completely understand, Leonie, but it sounds like praise, so I will take it as such.
Leonie: Now, let's get back to work! I need all the training I can get!

Linhardt: She already possessed the strength to use that bow... She went through the trouble of fighting a saint so she could claim that weapon as her own.
Byleth: A saint?
Linhardt: Or maybe you'd call it a saintly beast. In any case...
Linhardt: When the time is right, can you fill in Edelgard about what happened?
Linhardt: Oh, and please do let me use that bow. It's not exactly a Hero's Relic, but it is still rather fascinating, isn't it? I would love to learn to what extent the bow's connection to the Crest influences the weapon and perhaps even... Oh, it's been too much of a day, hasn't it? I'm feeling tired, so let's talk about this later. Good night.

@Opening 
Whispers of Death Knight sightings in Garreg Mach excite Caspar, but Mercedes has a much more pensive reaction. Something must be on her mind...

@Intro 
Caspar: Professor! Mercedes! What are you two doing here?
Mercedes: Um, we were just talking. Why do you look so flustered?
Caspar: Haven't you heard? An Imperial army was spotted near Garreg Mach!
Mercedes: Oh. Do you think they came to scout?
Caspar: Maybe? We could probably take care of 'em if that's the case... But I heard the Death Knight is out there!
Mercedes: The Death Knight...
Byleth: Is that a problem?
Byleth: Who was that again?
Caspar: Don't you remember? He's the guy who abducted Flayn! We fought him a bunch of times after that! Right, Mercedes? Oh. Is something the matter?
Mercedes: N-No. It's nothing. Really... Now's probably not the time, but I was just thinking of my brother.
Caspar: You have a brother?
Mercedes: Yes, but we have different fathers. He was a year younger than me.
Caspar: Why'd he suddenly come to mind?
Mercedes: You see--

Knight of Seiros: Quickly! You must prepare for battle! The Death Knight has been spotted in the Sealed Forest! He only has a few troops with him, so we planned on taking him out with just the knights, but... We can't guarantee that reinforcements won't arrive. We would appreciate your backup, just in case.

Mercedes: The Death Knight... I have to go...
Caspar: Mercedes, wait! I don't know what's going on with you, but...
Mercedes: No! I have to go see him!
Byleth: Let's go with her. 
Caspar: Yeah, we can't let him get away! I'll help Mercedes find the Death Knight! You go gather the others and meet up with us, Professor!
Byleth: I'm not so sure... 
Caspar: We don't really have time to sit around and think, but a little prep can't hurt against the Death Knight.
Mercedes: Yes... You two are right...
Caspar: Let me know when you're ready. Try not to take too long though, all right? It's not like the Death Knight is just gonna wander around the forest waiting for us to find him.

@Battle 
Mercedes: Emile, wait! Don't go! Take your helmet of. Please. Let me see your face. It really is you under there, isn't it? I've been searching for so long...

Caspar: I finally caught up with you, Mercedes. You're faster than you look... But I'm here now, so you can give up, Death Knight!
Death Knight: ...

Death Knight: Flee, and I will not chase you... Challenge me, and I will have no choice but to fight...

Mercedes: Enemy reinforcements are approaching! What should we do?
Caspar: Let's take 'em out! Reinforcements just means we get to fight even more!

@Boss 
Death Knight: I told you that if you fled, I would not chase you. But it seems you wish to die...

%Mercedes,Death Knight
Mercedes: You try to hide yourself with that mask and helmet...But I know who you really are.
Death Knight: I...have nothing to say to you.

%Caspar,Death Knight
Caspar: The Infamous Death Knight! Champion of the Empire! Taking you down is gonna be satisfying.
Death Knight: Heh. Simpleton...

%Byleth,Death Knight
Death Knight: Fate is unkind. There will be no resolution today... Flee, and I will not give chase.

@End 
Death Knight: Simple...but effective...
Caspar: You're not getting away that easy!

Death Knight: I must go...

Caspar: Phew...we did it. Are you all right, Mercedes?
Mercedes: I am, thanks to you. But still...
Caspar: There's something you wanted to ask him, right? Come on, he ran off into the forest.
Mercedes: Thank you, Caspar.

Death Knight: You came...

Mercedes: How many years has it been since we last spoke? I'm so sorry... I should have come for you sooner... I'm sure it wasn't pleasant living in House Bartels.
Caspar: I'm not sure I follow. Do you know this guy, Mercedes?
Mercedes: My younger brother... Emile... Is it really you?
Caspar: I'm sorry, what? Your brother is the Death Knight?! But you two look nothing alike!
Death Knight: Mercedes... Leave the monastery.
Caspar: Hold on just a minute! Is that all you've got to say for yourself?
Death Knight: This doesn't concern you...
Caspar: That's not true! You're her brother, right? But you've got nothing nice to say to her after all this time?
Death Knight: You will die...
Mercedes: Even if I die, I've made my choice. Please, Emile. Fight on our side instead.
Death Knight: I cannot. My soul has long departed... And yet... Here. Take this and go.

Mercedes: Is this...a Hero's Relic? You and I must share the same Crest.
Death Knight: When next we meet, I will kill you without hesitation.
Mercedes: You won't kill me. I have this now.
Death Knight: Hmph. Do not die until I can kill you...
Death Knight: Hmph.
Caspar: What is it? You got a problem with me?
Death Knight: Take... this...
Caspar: This is...
Death Knight: I will kill her. Until then, she must live...

Mercedes: Emile! I can't believe he's gone again...
Caspar: I can't tell whether or not he actually cares that you're his sister...
Mercedes: Hmm... Somewhere, hiding underneath that helmet, there's a very sweet boy.
Caspar: Is that a joke? Would a sweet boy threaten to kill someone? I don't get you, Mercedes.
Mercedes: Living at House Bartels changed him. But that's beside the point. Thank you, Caspar. I couldn't have confronted him without you.
Caspar: Don't worry about it. I may not understand you half the time, but we're still pals.
Mercedes: Come on then, pal. Let's get back to everyone else.
