The bishop leading the Western Church was somehow involved."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "And speaking of the Western Church, there was also that incident in which one of the more extreme factions tried to occupy sacred land."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Enough is enough, so now the Knights of Seiros have been tasked with putting the bishop down. I thought you and your students could come with us."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why would you want us to help?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why for such an important mission?"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Because you wield the Sword of the Creator. Lady Rhea is going to personally execute the bishop. I have been appointed as her guard. I want your help protecting her. So what do you say? Will you come?"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Um, excuse me! I\u2019d like to come along."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Ashe! You were listening in? It\u2019s not up to you whether you can \u201ccome along.\u201d"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Please, this is important to me."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Your adoptive father, Lord Lonato, had connections to the Western Church. I understand that you want answers. But our objective is to punish, not to investigate. We can\u2019t let you jeopardize the mission."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I won\u2019t get in the way, I promise!"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Hm... What do you say, Professor? Keep in mind we would be bringing the whole class, not just Ashe."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We\u2019ll go."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Thank you so much."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "OK. I guess it\u2019s fine. Get ready, then."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I\u2019m not sure."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Hm. Well, can\u2019t hurt to wait a bit, I suppose.

What a cheap ploy."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "It won\u2019t do any good to get annoyed, Catherine. That voice... We\u2019re up against a faction of bishops."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "They\u2019ve shown themselves, at least, so we won\u2019t have to go to the trouble of finding them. All right. You got a death wish? Come at me! You really want to fight against Thunder Catherine?"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Please, Professor. Don\u2019t let Lady Rhea get hurt. Our mission isn\u2019t just to wipe out all the enemies, but also to protect Lady Rhea. Ready?"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Lady Rhea!"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Hold the line! Don't let them attack Lady Rhea again."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "They have received reinforcements, and it seems the priests are calling them over."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Then we'll just have to take them out!"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "It seems that taking out the priest has stopped the reinforcements coming over here. We should be able to stop the reinforcements coming from the other side by taking care of the other priest."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "They will not be able to send any more troops now. Let us sweep up the stragglers."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Good work, Lady Rhea!

What now, Lady Rhea?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "We must go to the headquarters of the Western Church. Perhaps there is still someone there who knows what has transpired."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Let us help too. It may not be much, but we\u2019ll do whatever we can!"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "I am sure you will be a great help. I am glad to have you by my side."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Thanks, Professor. I really appreciated your help with the investigation. That\u2019s it for today. Head back to Garreg Mach. The church will have to choose a new bishop, and do whatever else is necessary to rebuild the Western Church. Lady Rhea is grateful to all of you. She said she would send along a reward. You should feel very proud. Receiving a gift directly from Lady Rhea is exceedingly rare. Still. That was a real mess, huh? For them to come out and charge us so boldly..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I\u2019m glad we made it out."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "As am I. We kept Lady Rhea safe, thanks to you."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I thought we were doomed."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "I did too.

I\u2019m glad he\u2019s so dedicated to his work, but..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He couldn\u2019t still be back there, could he?"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "That may be it. I hope he\u2019s not getting in the way..."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "There you are, Ashe. We were just talking about..."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Why the brooding expression? Hey, what\u2019s that bundle of papers in your hand?"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "This was given to me. It has to do with my family."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Given to you?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Is this about Lord Lonato?"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I haven\u2019t finished reading it all yet. But I think it might offer some clues about something I need to know. Professor, Catherine. Thank you for letting me come with you on this mission. I\u2019d better get ready to go."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "It\u2019s a little painful to watch... I do hope that those papers, whatever they are, will help him get over his past. I suppose it\u2019s time for us to start heading back to the monastery."}]}
