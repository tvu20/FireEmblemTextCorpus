Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t pull you into this... It stems from my family\u2019s failure to secure the region. But honestly, I want to see you in action. I never tire of watching you fight. And it\u2019ll be much more interesting for you than the training ground. Or maybe this task -- driving off bandits -- seems dull to a former mercenary?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'll join you."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Excellent! While I\u2019m at it, I have a second favor to ask of you. Could you recruit more fighters? I bet there will be willing volunteers, if you\u2019re the one inviting them. I\u2019ll set off on my own and meet up with you there."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Let me think about it."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "OK. I can handle a few bandits.
