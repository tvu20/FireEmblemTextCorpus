It\u2019s said there were once 12 heroes who saved F\u00f3dlan. There was the King of Liberation, Nemesis...the 10 Elites, and finally...Maurice. One day, Maurice suddenly transformed into a hideous beast and slaughtered innocent people. It was like when Miklan of House Gautier turned into a Black Beast. The negative energy dwelling within his Crest turned Maurice into a monster. The people of F\u00f3dlan grew to despise him, and he was stripped of his honor. His whole clan was conquered, and it was believed that his bloodline had vanished... But even now, there exist a few descendants who have inherited Maurice\u2019s Crest, and his curse. My family line...is one of them. Maurice\u2019s Crest is a symbol of disaster. Anyone who comes in contact with it is met with great misfortune. Those who carry the Crest became beasts at night and slaughter innocent people."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What that man mentioned earlier..."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Yes, the rumor about the Wandering Beast in the woods...
