How long have you been there? Don't sneak up on me like that! You almost gave me a heart attack. Anyway, I'm reading the official biography of the Four Saints, as sanctioned by the church. I know you're not very familiar with the teachings of Seiros, but even you must have read it at least once."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Huh. I'm amazed you managed to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't think so..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Tell me again... How exactly did you manage to get a job teaching at an academy run by the church?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Well, whether you've read the biography or not, the Four Saints must at least ring a bell, right?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Well then, I've got a little quiz for you. Name the Four Saints, companions of the great Saint Seiros. I'll give you a hint. There was Cichol, Cethleann, Indech, and... who was the fourth one again?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Macile."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Ooh, tough luck! That would be incorrect. The name you were looking for is Macuil."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Macuil."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Correct! I was hoping you'd know that much at least."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maicul."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Ooh, tough luck! That would be incorrect. The name you were looking for is Macuil."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "In any case, you can learn some interesting things reading about the life and times of Saint Macuil. For instance, he was more skilled with his hands than his fellow saints, and even became an accomplished blacksmith. He used his skills to forge countless sacred weapons for the army of Seiros. Of course, he didn't just forge weapons. He also used them in battle himself. Legends say his strength was second only to Seiros. It's even said that he played a big role in the Battle of Tailtean, where Seiros fought Nemesis, the King of Liberation who became the king of evil. Macuil lost his life in that battle, and now his body rests in a coffin within the Holy Mausoleum. Or so one story goes. Another legend says he set off on a journey to find a new land. That he left F\u00f3dlan from the east, crossed the sea, and vanished. He must have left Alliance territory, but where exactly would he have set sail from, I wonder? Thinking about it reminds me of another interesting story concerning the Sreng Region. The peninsula is attached to the mainland of F\u00f3dlan and extends from the northeastern part of Kingdom territory. If you would set sail from Margrave Edmund's territory, you could cut cross a stretch of sea and land there. And it just so happens that in the Sreng Region, there are ruins built to worship a sacred beast that appeared from across the sea. If the ruins have something to do with Saint Macuil, there could be sacred weapons there... So? Have I piqued your interest or what?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe a little."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Not really."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "You always have to play it cool, don't you? Just think of how useful it would be to have weapons like that! Not to mention that the peninsula would be pretty easy to get to about now, seeing as how Alliance territory has settled down a bit. We'd be there and back in no time. No one would even notice we were gone. Come on, Teach! Let's go to the Sreng Region!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Let's go."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I always see it through once I set my mind on something. Let's make the necessary preparations before I die of curiosity."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Let me think about it."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I guess I can wait...just a while. But make sure you decide before I die of curiosity, OK?"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Claude", "line": "There are the ruins... It looks like we're not gonna have the luxury of an excavation. Look. I bet those are the watchmen of the ruins, and that they've been ordered to keep out intruders. And that big beast... I hear they call it The Wind Caller."}, {"speaker": "The Wind Caller", "line": "Thieves... Only by defeating me can you claim the secret treasure!"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Argh! It speaks!

Sorry for dragging you along with me. I had no idea it would turn into a fight. But hey, at least we got some treasure out of it. I'll leave this in your capable hands.

We didn't find anything concrete to prove that Saint Macuil had been there. We can't say for certain that the treasure we found was Macuil's either. I do wish we could have spoken to that Wind Caller a bit more."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Could it have been Saint Macuil?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Ha! Unlikely. Macuil lived thousands of years ago. And I've never heard anything about the saints being monsters like that. Wait a minute... Could the Wind Caller have anything to do with the Immaculate One? The Immaculate One is a monster sent by the goddess... Could the Wind Caller be... Where was it that I heard that stuff about them having been sent by the goddess... Ugh, maybe I'm too tired. My head is heavy and I can't think straight anymore. Let's call it a day for now. I've got plenty of time to think this over."}]}
