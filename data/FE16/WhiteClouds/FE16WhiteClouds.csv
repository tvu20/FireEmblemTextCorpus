FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|This will be your first time at the monastery. I’d be happy to show you around.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|It really is Fódlan in a nutshell. The good and the bad.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Like it or not, we’ll be there soon enough.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|There it is. Garreg Mach Monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Rhea's here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|I wonder... Did the flow of time bring you here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|It's been years since I've last set eyes on this place. To be forced to see her now...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Her?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|You saw her in the courtyard earlier, didn't you? The archbishop...Lady Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|You've been here before?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|I've never spoken of this to you before, but...many years ago, I was a knight here. I reported to the archbishop...Lady Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|The archbishop?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Lady Rhea?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|As you know, the majority of folks in Fódlan are devout followers of the teachings of Seiros. The leader of that ridiculously large religious organization is the archbishop, Lady Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|Thank you for your patience, Jeralt. My name is Seteth. I am an advisor to the archbishop.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Right. Hello.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|It has been a long time, Jeralt. I wonder…was it the will of the goddess that we have another chance meeting like this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Forgive my silence all these years. Much has happened since we last spoke.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|So I see. The miracle of fatherhood has blessed you. That is your child, is it not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Yes...born many years after I left this place. I wish I could introduce you to the mother of my child...but I’m afraid we lost her to illness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|I see. My condolences. As for you…I heard of your valiant efforts from Alois. What is your name?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|My name is...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|A fine name indeed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|You must at least show the basic courtesy of telling us your name! Do you not think you are being a bit rude to the archbishop?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|It is all right, Seteth. My dear, I am called Rhea. I am the archbishop of the Church of Seiros. In truth, I was only being polite. I already know your name. And a fine name it is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for saving those students of the Officers Academy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Hmph.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Jeralt. You already know what it is I wish to say, do you not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|You want me to rejoin the Knights of Seiros, don’t you. I won’t say no, but…|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Your apprehension stings. I had expected that Alois would have already asked this of you. I must step away for now, but I expect they will desire a word with you soon. Please listen carefully to what they have to say. Until tomorrow… Farewell.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|I can’t believe it. Forced back into the Knights of Seiros. I’m sorry I dragged you into this. Looks like I’ll be stuck here for a while…and I’m afraid your services are requested as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|As a mercenary?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|As a servant?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Nothing like that. They want you to teach, by the sound of it. You heard those brats earlier talking about the Officers Academy, right? Well, the academy just happens to be short a professor. And apparently that damned Alois went and recommended you to Lady Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|So. You must be the new professor. My, how stern and handsome you are!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Er, no. I’m not the one you’re looking for. You can handle things from here. Good luck.  And…watch out for Lady Rhea. I don’t know what she’s thinking, making you a professor like this. She may be up to something. Stay on your guard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Oh. It's you, then? So young...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Competence and age are not necessarily correlated, as you well know. I am Hanneman, a Crest scholar and professor at the Officers Academy. I wonder if you bear a Crest of your own. When next you have a moment to spare, I insist that you pay me a visit so we can delve into the subject further.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|I’m Manuela. I’m a professor, a physician, a songstress, and available. It’s nice to meet you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|You're a physician?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|I look too pretty for that line of work, do I? But yes, when I’m not teaching, I can be found in the infirmary. If you’re ever lonely, please do come and pay me a visit. I would love to–|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|"You're a songstress?"|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Of course. Before I came here, I belonged to a renowned opera company. Perhaps you've heard of me? The Mittelfrank Opera Company's beautiful, peerless–|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Spare our colleague the needless chatter, Manuela. Now then, it seems you’ll be taking charge of one of the academy’s three houses. I expect you haven’t yet been briefed on the nature of each, have you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Do you really not know? Fine, I’ll do you a favor and explain. The Officers Academy is comprised of three houses of students, each of which is closely affiliated with its region of origin. The Black Eagle House is for students from the Adrestian Empire. Their house leader this year is Edelgard, the Imperial princess, who is in line to be the next emperor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|The Blue Lion House is for students from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Their house leader this year is Prince Dimitri. He is to be the next king of Faerghus.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Lastly, there is the Golden Deer House, which is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Their house leader is Claude, grandson to Duke Riegan, the leader of the Alliance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|To think that the next emperor, king and sovereign duke are all here. It certainly is a promising year for the academy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|I’ll say. I just hope none of those little treasures cause any trouble.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Hm, quite. For now, I suggest taking a stroll around the academy to get your bearings. And when you’ve a moment, please stop by my research laboratory.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|The old man has a point. Oh, and keep in mind that I’ve only notified the house leaders that you’re our new professor. It’s more fun that way. I suggest you try spending time with the students. Some odd ducks in that bunch, but they’re good kids. I’m sure Lady Rhea will have more information for you tomorrow, but that should get you going. Good luck. You’ll need it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|Have you no intention of changing your mind, Rhea? Appointing a stranger–a child no less!–as a professor at our esteemed academy is–|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|I have made my decision, Seteth. I know worrying comes naturally to you, but there is truly no need. That “stranger” is Jeralt’s flesh and blood, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|I can’t say that’s all too comforting. How trustworthy is this Jeralt character? Is he not the man who went missing after the great fire 21 years ago? I would remind you that Flayn is now here with us as well. I beg of you…please consider whether this is an unnecessary risk.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Seteth. They have my trust. Let that be enough for you as well. More importantly, I have received a report from Shamir. I am increasingly concerned about a matter regarding our suspicious individual. We cannot ignore those who harbor ill will towards the church, especially if they are frequenting Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|Yes, that matter is of great importance as well. I shall continue my investigation. Rhea… For now, I will have faith that you are placing your trust with the utmost care. I pray that nothing occurs to shake that confidence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|I assume you are already aware that you will be teaching here at the Officers Academy. Correct? To start, please speak with the three house leaders. You should also take a look around the academy and acquaint yourself with your new home. That is your first task here at the monastery. Please let me know if you accept it. Once you have finished, come and speak with me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|You should speak with every student you can. This might be your only chance to see what they're really like before you become a professor...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea| You are responsible for choosing which house to lead. If there are still students you have yet to speak with, try visiting each house's homeroom.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Alois|Ha! I imagine you were a bit surprised that I recommended you as a professor here. Frankly, we had someone else in mind for the role, but they ran off during our dustup with the bandits. Can't entrust students to someone who's abandoned them once before, huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|You saved the lives of the students you came across. That, at least, was admirable. Now, you should make the rounds. Go around the monastery and see that you greet everyone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|So you've accepted a teaching position here... Pity. I was hoping you would lend your strength to the Empire. I never properly introduced myself, did I? My name is Edelgard von Hresvelg. I am the princess and heir apparent to the Adrestian Empire. I wonder if you'll be tasked with leading the Black Eagles... I hope you've had a chance to meet everyone. Would you like to know more about any of the Black Eagles?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Yes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Me? Well...some think I'm a bit distant. Arrogant, even. But there's little to be done. One day, I must rise to become Adrestia's next emperor. What else... Well, it seems to me that we may have similar personalities.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Hubert is the heir of Marquis Vestra. He has served me since I was a child. You may think his blood runs a bit cold, but... Heh, actually, that's rather accurate. Still, if you can get past that, you'll see he's quite astute and reasonable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|For some reason, he thinks of me as a bitter rival and is always trying to challenge me. It's terribly irritating. His house is that of Duke Aegir, which produces Adrestia's Prime Ministers. That family is...perhaps too pleased with its own status.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|He's remarkably intelligent, but he only wishes to apply himself to tasks that particularly interest him and nothing else. He's also fond of...well, napping. If he had any work ethic or sense of duty to speak of, I suppose he would be destined to become an official of the Empire.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|He's the second son of Count Bergliez. He has no inheritance in his future, which is perhaps why he's always so eager to prove himself. He's overly energetic and rushes headfirst into any battle. If he ends up in your care, be sure to keep a close eye on him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|She's Count Varley's only daughter. I suppose you could say she's a bit eccentric, but she seems like a gentle soul. I believe she's shut herself away in her quarters and doesn't care to leave, but...don't worry. I'll make sure she finds her way to class.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Few commoners have joined the Black Eagle House, but Dorothea is an exception. She's a songstress from a famous opera company in the Empire. I'm not entirely sure what brought her to the Officers Academy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|To the west of Fódlan is an archipelago called Brigid. Petra is the granddaughter of their king. Brigid is a vassal state of the Empire, which is how she came to be enrolled here. She's incredibly smart and studious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Please accept my apologies for the other day. You came to our aid, yet I hadn't even the courtesy to properly introduce myself. I am Dimitri Alexandre Blaiddyd, crown prince of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Of course, at the academy I am simply a student. And I've heard word that you are to become a professor here. Delightful news. I still have much to learn, but I'm confident I could benefit greatly from your guidance. In any case, welcome to the monastery. I hear you're investigating the different houses. Did any of the Blue Lions catch your attention?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Yes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Me? Oh. Um. Please forgive me... It's difficult to open up on the spot, don't you think? I'm afraid my story has not been a pleasant one... I do hope that doesn't color your view of me, but I understand if that can't be helped.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Dedue was born in Duscur, and has been loyally working in my service for the past four years. He's rather taciturn, but once you get to know him, you'll see he's a kind and good-natured young man.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Felix is the heir to House Fraldarius. He has a bit of a sharp tongue, but don't let that fool you. Deep down, he's a good guy. He gravitates towards people who are skilled. Perhaps you would enjoy a friendly competition with him sometime.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|He's the adoptive son of Lord Lonato of Castle Gaspard, but I hear he was born a commoner. He has an extremely earnest personality, so I'm certain he will approach your lectures with great enthusiasm.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Sylvain is the heir to House Gautier. He is a capable person who highly values his friends. That said... Well, he's always been a bit of a...ahem, skirt chaser, so to speak. Pardon my bluntness. I speak with him about it often, but it doesn't seem to help.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I hear she was born to Imperial nobility, but a twist of fate brought her to the Kingdom. She may seem carefree on the surface, but she's actually a kind soul who pays careful attention to everyone around her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Annette is Baron Dominic's niece. She is a talented student who scored extremely high marks at the Royal School of Sorcery. She's cheerful and hardworking. Brilliant, really. Though she can be a bit oblivious at times. I hear she caused an explosion in the kitchen last night...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Ingrid is Count Galatea's daughter. She is also a childhood friend of Felix, Sylvain and myself. She is diligent, industrious, and principled. In truth, she is more knightly than most knights you will ever meet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Well, well. Scored a teaching gig here, did ya? Talk about a great first impression. I guess that means I'd better introduce myself properly. I'm Claude von Riegan. I'm from the ruling house of the Leicester Alliance, but don't worry too much about all that madness. I'm guessing you don't know which class you'll be teaching yet, do you? I bet you'd like ours. We're not as...difficult as the other two. Have you met the folks from the Golden Deer House yet? Care to know more about anyone?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Yes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|(laughs) Piqued your interest, have I? As luck would have it, I'm pretty curious about you as well. But what's life without a bit of mystery? Let's just spend the next year or so learning about each other, little by little.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|He's the heir of Gloucester territory. If you haven't already picked up on it, he's a bit arrogant and fancies himself a lady's man. That said, deep down he's really devoted and honest... Though I wouldn't mind never hearing him talk about his noble obligations ever again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|He comes from a merchant family, but his parents died in an accident. Seems like he's had a rough life. Despite all that, he's just about the most cheerful guy you'll ever meet. His passions are training, eating, and... Actually, that's about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|He's the second son of a merchant family. Since his brother will inherit the business, he's training to become a knight. If you ask me, doesn't seem like he truly wants to be a knight... He's probably just doing it to please his parents...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Lysithea is the daughter of Count Ordelia, and is probably the youngest student here. But watch out! She gets angry if you treat her like a child. As for me, I do it on purpose. You have to make your own fun in this place, you know?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Marianne is Margrave Edmund's daughter...and that's pretty much all I know about her. She doesn't interact much with other students, so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of folks here have never even heard her speak.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Hilda is the only daughter of Duke Goneril. It seems her father and brother coddle her quite a bit. If you look up "lazy" in the dictionary...her picture won't be there because she never got around to submitting it. Not too unusual for a noble, I guess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary. I think she said that her father is a hunter. She's pretty blunt and as stingy as they come. A habitual saver, too. I think she's hoping to repay her village for helping to send her here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|(I suppose I should return to Rhea...)|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Student|This is the classroom of the Black Eagle House, which is for students from the Adrestian Empire. Our house leader is Princess Edelgard. There are many other nobles among our ranks as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert|I am Hubert. A humble servant of Lady Edelgard. I heard you came to the aid of Her Highness. You have my most sincere thanks. This is Petra. She has come all the way from Brigid to study in the Empire. Back on her archipelago, she is actually a princess. In Fódlan terms, she would be called heir to the throne.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Petra|Hello. I am called Petra. I am pleased to be meeting with-- No, I am pleased to have met you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Is it true that you saved Edelgard? That's incredible! The name's Caspar, by the way. Pleased to meet ya!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Linhardt|Linhardt. Good-bye.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Yeesh, Linhardt. How'd you get into the academy with those manners? So, are you a student here too? Maybe we'll be in the same class!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Bernadetta|Ah! What?! I don't talk to strangers!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|Bernadetta, this is no stranger! Our house leader owes this person a great debt. Is that not right? (To Byleth) I am Ferdinand von Aegir, legitimate son of the Aegir family, the Empire's foremost house. Are you going to join our class? I look forward to getting better acquainted with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|Well, aren't you just lovely. Is this your first time in the monastery? Shall I show you around? Oh, my name is Dorothea. Before I joined the academy, I was a member of an opera company in the Empire. You should hear me sing sometime.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Student|This classroom belongs to the Blue Lion House. Our house leader is Prince Dimitri. All of us here hail from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|Well, well! It must be my lucky day today, being approached by such a beauty. I'm Sylvain Jose Gautier. Feel free to say hi whenever you like.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|And who's this? You don't look familiar at all. Do you work here at the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|Oh, Mercie! Do you think this is that mercenary people have been talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|Now that I think about it, that does sound like something Dimitri may have said... I suppose you'll be enrolling at the Officers Academy too, then? Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Mercedes, and this is my best friend–|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|I'm Annette! It's nice to meet you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ingrid|I have heard all about what you did from Prince Dimitri. As a citizen of Faerghus, I thank you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|He also said you're quite skilled. And he doesn't just say things like that. I look forward to sparring with you and beating you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ingrid|Felix, must you always speak of fighting right away? Oh! And, uh...you may call me Ingrid. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|Hi, there! You must be the one everyone's talking about. I'm Ashe. Great to meet you. This here is Dedue. He serves Prince Dimitri.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dedue|I have heard that you rescued His Highness. Words cannot express my gratitude. Should you ever require my strength, please know that I will hasten to repay this debt.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Student|The Golden Deer House is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Our house leader is heir to the Alliance's leadership, House Riegan. We have plenty of other prominent nobles as well!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Raphael|Are you someone's guest? The dining hall's that way if that's what you're looking for.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Leonie|No, Raphael. That's Captain Jeralt's kid. Hi, I'm Leonie Pinelli–Captain Jeralt's first and greatest apprentice! I'm sure he's told you about me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Raphael|Nice to meet you! I'm Raphael Kirsten. Who are you again?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|Hey, are you that mercenary? Everyone's been talking about you. I'm Hilda Valentine Goneril. And her name is...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Marianne|M-Marianne von Edmund...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|Are you joining the Knights of Seiros or something? Well, I look forward to seeing more of you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|So you're the skilled mercenary who saved Claude, are you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|Oh, you are? It's such an honor to meet you! Ignatz Victor. My parents are Alliance merchants.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|And I am Lysithea von Ordelia. Please do not forget it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|Ah. You must be the renowned mercenary who rescued Claude. Honestly, you should not have troubled yourself over the likes of him. My name is Lorenz Hellman Gloucester. You will want to remember it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeritza| What do you want?  I am Jeritza. I teach here. Weapon instruction. These are the training grounds. Good-bye.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Gatekeeper| Greetings! You must be the new professor. What a pleasure!  As for me, my job is to stand here at this glorious entrance and leisurely watch over the comings and goings of everyone. Make folks smile, you know?  Er...and by that, I mean...to vigilantly guard this entrance with my very life! No levity whatsoever. As of now, nothing to report.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|Here I am again, the office of the captain of the knights. That said, I'm merely here to assist. Apparently the current captain is getting on in years. I hear the captain has a hard time keeping up with the responsibilities of the job.  That's where I come in.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|This is my research laboratory. I've worked hard to furnish it with the rare materials and purpose-built equipment required for my work.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Oh, Professor! Dropping by so soon? I expected we'd take some time. Exchange a few smiles as we passed in the hall, flirt a bit, you know... Well, you're here now, and I do like a man who knows what he wants. Lock the door. Huh. That welcome didn't faze you at all, did it? What's the matter? Don't you like me? Or...are you just so innocent you don't understand me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Cyril|I'm real busy, so could you please move along now? Thanks. OK now, what else did Lady Rhea need doing today?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Tomas| Welcome to the library. Here you may find literature from the far reaches of Fódlan.  I am Tomas, the librarian. If you have need of me, do not hesitate to ask. I have worked here for...hm. I have lost track of the decades, it seems.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|How are you enjoying your time at the academy thus far? I hope you have found our halls brimming with the vitality of well-intentioned souls.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|Hm. I suppose it is time for you to take charge of one of our three houses of students. I must note that I am personally against entrusting someone as lacking in trackable history as yourself with such a task, but it is as the archbishop desires.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|The Black Eagles, the Blue Lions, and the Golden Deer… All so different. I hope you’ve made it a point to get to know each of them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Since you are new here, we have decided to allow you first pick. Manuela and I will take charge of the remaining two houses.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|(Which house will I choose...)|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Are you having trouble deciding? Please, open your heart to the will of the goddess and choose carefully.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|So, you have chosen the Black Eagles, led by Edelgard, correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|So, you have chosen the Blue Lions, led by Dimitri, correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|So, you have chosen the Golden Deer, led by Claude, correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Your heart has made its choice, then. All I ask is that you guide these open minds with virtue, care, and sincerity.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|They are all promising youths who bear the weight of Fódlan’s future upon their shoulders. I hope you appreciate what an honor it is to lead them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flayn|Brother? Oh! I am so sincerely sorry! I did not mean to interrupt.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|I am in the middle of something, Flayn. Is it urgent?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flayn|No, no, it’s nothing. More importantly... Who is this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|This is our newest professor at the academy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flayn|Oh my! A new addition to the Officers Academy! I am so very pleased to meet you, Professor. I am Seteth’s little sister, Flayn. I am so happy to make your acquaintance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|Let us focus on the topic at hand. There is something you should be aware of. In a few days’ time, there will be a mock battle between the three houses, intended to gauge the current progress of the students. We will be using this battle as an opportunity to ascertain your own abilities as well. Please do not disappoint the archbishop. That is all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Wait. So our new professor is...you?! I didn't see that one coming.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|Easy, Caspar. Aren't you being a bit rude?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Linhardt|You know it's a waste of time to expect politeness from him.  It will be a pleasure learning from you, Professor. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to take a nap.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Bernadetta|Ah! Don't look at me like that! Oh, and...please don't talk to me too much either.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea| I'm sorry for the chaos you've walked into...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|I hear we are rather close in age, Professor. I hope you do not mind if we treat you like one of us. In our class, we try to treat each other as equals, despite any differences in age or status. Personally, I would love to include you in that inner circle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I don't mind at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Petra|You have a gut, Professor. I will take great joy from your teachings.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|Petra, I believe you mean to say that our professor has guts. That's a bit different from having a gut. You can't go around saying someone so slim and attractive has a gut!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Petra|Oh! Please take my apologies. I have not yet mastered this language.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Professor, I want you to know that it's perfectly acceptable for you to treat me as you do the others. I may be the Imperial Princess, but here at the academy, I'm just another student. That said, know that I have high expectations of you. And high hopes. But I'm certain you can lead the Black Eagle House to greatness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Sure, sure. Now, let's break the ice with a training session! I want to see our new teacher in action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Petra|Why will the ice be broken? Is this a custom I have missed in my studies?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Not real ice, just the ice of...um--- Well, it just means let's get to know each other.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Bernadetta|I don't wanna train! Let's stay in the classroom and...learn from a book.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|Let's all calm down and have a nice cup of tea, how about? Doesn't that sound lovely, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Linhardt|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|I know we all agreed to treat each other as equals, but there is a limit to what I can tolerate. The esteemed Black Eagle House requires order.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert| Looks like your first job will be to quiet down this racket. I don't envy you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Ugh, they're not normally this...rowdy. I do hope you can manage, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|Wait, does this mean our new professor is-- No! I really can't believe it! But I was speaking to you so casually, as though we were companions! Oh, I am so sorry, Professor; you just look the same age as the rest of us, and-- Oh, and I’m sorry I just said that too! I really must watch my tongue…|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I don't mind if you treat me as a friend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|You say that, but...I just don't know about all of this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I'll admit, it doesn't sit well with me either. After all, we wish to show you due respect.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|Sure, but if the professor says it OK, shouldn’t that be enough? That is, if Your Highness can consent to such a thing. After all, we’re already speaking this way to our future king, so we may as well relax our speech with our professor too, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Well, we’re not in the Kingdom, so it only goes to follow that we should all speak companionably.  I concede. If the professor says it’s fine, we ought to accept that kindness gratefully.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ingrid|As for me, I'm not sure I can manage.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|You don’t have to force yourself if it’s too difficult. You’re fine with that too, right, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|Such benevolence is a sight to behold! I don't suppose you would care to join me for tea? We could discuss education...and marriage.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|Control yourself, Sylvain. I have more important matters to discuss with our new professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|Having heard of your skills, I'm eager to meet you in battle. Come to the training ground later. There, you will show me what you’re capable of.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|You aren't wasting any time, are you, Felix? As it were, count me in for any such battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|Hmph.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|Pardon me, but I would also love to observe you in battle, for future reference. If that’s OK with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Ashe, I don’t have you speak of merely watching. You should join us as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes| If you get injured, simply say the word, and I’ll patch you up straight away!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dedue|Your Highness, do take care not to go overboard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|You worry too much, Dedue. I'll be fine, I promise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|My companions, is there not something inherently wrong with crossing blades, as a way to bond with each other?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ingrid|Huh, I never thought of it that way. Well, if that’s how you feel, I suppose you’ll just stay behind while the rest of us are at the training ground?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|Ingrid, my dearest friend! You really are too hard on me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Well then, Professor, what do you think? As you can see, the Blue Lion House is a lively bunch, but you’ll fine none who work harder. I’m certain we’ll cause our fair share of trouble, but I’m very much looking forward to the year ahead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|Wait, what?! Are you really our new homeroom professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|Is that true? You aren't quite what I pictured. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|I was sure you'd be roped into joining the knights!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Don't tell me, you chose this class just to get to know me better, right? I'm flattered, really.  Whoops. Now that you're our professor, maybe I should choose my words more carefully.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I don't mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Oh? Well, then. Since we're pretty close in age and all, I suppose formalities aren't all that necessary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|One must truly marvel at the exceptionality of this appointment. Becoming a teacher to students almost the same age as yourself. How...unusual. I've heard you are a skilled mercenary, but I cannot shake my discomfort at your new position.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Raphael|Are you really as strong as they say? Let's see your biceps! I bet I've packed on more muscle than you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|I doubt that. Apparently our new professor was personally recommended by Alois, one of the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|As far as skill goes, I saw it with my own eyes. What's more, Teach here is the child of the most renowned former captain of the Knights of Seiros.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Leonie|I heard. There's no way a child of the captain isn't worthy. It's simply not possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|"The Captain"? Who are you talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Leonie|Captain Jeralt, of course, the most notable captain of the Knights of Seiros and a peerless mercenary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|He's not that well known...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|You're exaggerating a bit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Leonie|Hmph! It doesn't matter what you think of him. Captain Jeralt deserves nothing but respect.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|Hm. Well, after working as a mercenary alongside a father figure such as he, I have high hopes for our professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|Just because someone is special... doesn't mean their children are special too, Lysithea. Assuming that a child is going to be exceptional just because of their lineage is a bad idea.  Don't you agree, Marianne?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Marianne|Huh? Oh, um, yes, I suppose so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Leonie|Well, we can find out for ourselves in battle. I can't wait to see what tactics you've learned from the captain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Raphael|A battle? Shouldn't we have a welcome party or something first? I'll get the meat.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|How savage. I propose a nice conversation over tea instead. I am more than willing to procure some high-quality leaves.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Raphael|Tea? You can't get to know someone over tea. If there's no meat involved, it's not a party.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|Your common sensibilities are grating to my noble ears. Please quiet yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Sorry for the bickering, Teach. As you can see, the Golden Deer is a rowdy bunch. We're not especially unified. You'll find nobles and commoners alike here-- those who are dedicated to their studies alongside slackers. But hey, that just makes your life more exciting, right? I really hope you're looking forward to the year ahead as much as I am.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Say, while you're here...I'd like to use this device I designed to determine whether the power of a Crest resides within you. Won't hurt a bit. Promise. You don’t know about Crests? Well, allow me to tell you everything–absolutely everything–about them. Is your calendar clear? This will take a while. Crests are a fascinating topic, but before one can dive deeply into said topic, one must first understand what Crests are. They are power incarnate. They are said to have been bestowed upon humans by the goddess countless ages ago. They exist within the flesh, and are passed down through bloodlines. Those who carry crests may excel at magic, display exceptional strength, or any number of boons. Each Crest has its own power, the nature of which is beyond mortal understanding. For now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|And you believe I have a Crest?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|I suspect as much, yes. But we won’t know for sure unless I look into the matter. As I said, Crests are passed down through the blood. However, just because someone carries a Crest does not necessarily mean their descendants will inherit it as well. Only a scarce few descendants of a Crest’s bloodline end up inheriting that Crest’s power. Perhaps one of your ancestors bore a Crest, and you just happened to inherit it. That is how a Crest usually presents itself, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Do what you can to find out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Yes, of course. I'll get to the bottom of it straight away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|There's no need to look into it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|I most strongly disagree! There absolutely is a need. My Crest research is of critical importance to the church, I'll have you know. Since you are now a professor here, I must insist that you aid in my research. Of course...there are those who lack the foresight to aid in my endeavors, such as that stubborn Seteth. But such individuals are the rare exception.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Now then, please go ahead and hold out your arm over this device here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|What is this?! A pattern I’ve never seen before…Is it possible an as-yet undiscovered Crest has been detected? To think there are still Crests out there that even I am unaware of! How thrilling! Ahem… Pardon my unrestrained jubilation. I have much to consider. You may leave now. I have more research to do in regard to this Crest. Yes, so very much more research. But for now, your work here is done.  Hmm… What could this line here be indicating? Perhaps it represents a lack of symmetry… or perhaps… What in the world? Oh, I see… It may be connected to that, but to a greater degree than usual…|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|With each moon, professors of the Officers Academy receive a schedule for the month ahead. It notes the days on which events and missions will take place that month. Pay careful attention to your schedule so that you may thoughtfully plan what you intend to do each month, and when.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|(So, this is my room... I thought I heard a girl's voice...but I must have been imagining things.)|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Some believe the dignity of the Empire rests on the results of the mock battle. That's an overstatement, of course. Still, we must do our best to prevail. You should take the time to learn each student's abilities. Perhaps some extra lessons and training sessions are in order? You look as if you have no idea what's going on here. I know my way around, so I'm happy to help you find your footing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|The monastery has some exceptional facilities that everyone who lives at the Officers Academy is welcome to make use of. For example, you can enjoy a meal with your students at the dining hall or take part in some one-on-one sparring at the training grounds. I suggest visiting the various facilities whenever you have the time to spare. It's a great way to get to know the students, faculty, and various workers here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Have you noticed the bulletin boards placed around the monastery? Those contain requests people have posted, as well as helpful information from the market. If you prove yourself by helping people with their requests, certain facilities here will become available for your use. The bulletin board is updated frequently, so I suggest checking it at least once a month.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|You should take your time when speaking with everyone, but when it comes to using the facilities... Well, you need to be more careful with that. If you use them without planning ahead, your free time will be gone before you know it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|A great deal is expected from professors of the Officers Academy, so it's important to hone your skills. To put it plainly, you'll need to keep expanding your knowledge of all disciplines, not just battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|I trust you're eager to face the Black Eagles in battle. Enjoy the thrill of anticipation while it lasts. Soon you'll wish you had chosen to lead our house instead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I hear there will be a mock battle soon. We must not neglect our training. I trust that you will carefully study the strengths and weaknesses of each of your students, that you may provide effective guidance. Regardless of the results, this battle will be a great learning experience. Even so... What is the point of competition if the aim isn't to win? As this is your first time at the monastery, please allow me to show you the ropes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Both students and teachers of the Officers Academy are free to use the facilities within the monastery. For example, you can dine with others at the dining hall or partake in one-on-one combat in the training grounds. I encourage you to wander around the monastery and lend an ear to the people living here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|There are bulletin boards in various places around the monastery. Have you seen them, Professor? There you can find requests from various sources, as well as information about the market. If you fulfill these requests, you should eventually be able to use even more of the facilities here. The bulletin board gets updated frequently. You would do well to check it once a month.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|This probably goes without saying, but no matter which facility you use, it will take up a considerable amount of your time. It's helpful to plan out activities in advance so that you don't mistakenly squander your time here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Professors at the Officers Academy are expected to have exceptional leadership skills. Students and teachers alike must devote themselves to their studies and strive to acquire great wisdom, even outside their respective Fields.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I heard about the upcoming mock battle. I want you to know, Professor, that I do not intend to lose. I hereby declare my intention to prevail at... Goodness, listen to me. The thrill of competition has carried me away. I won't speak so formally of a class assignment in the future.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Did you hear the news, Teach? Looks like we're gonna have a good ol' mock battle between the houses! The Golden Deer House isn't exactly what you'd call an elite group just yet, so you may want to whip everyone into shape with some extra training. After all, competition is only fun if you win. To that end, I'd better prepare as well. You know, I was researching what it's like to live here long before I even enrolled. Want me to fill you in, Teach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Students and teachers of the Officers Academy are all free to use the facilities within the monastery. That means you can chow down with students in the dining hall, or get in some one-on-one sparring at the training grounds. As you explore the monastery, try visiting the various facilities and talking to the people who live here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|If you haven't noticed, there are bulletin boards in various places around here. You can check them out to see posted requests or to find more information about the market. I hear that fulfilling requests can even earn you the right to use more facilities. The bulletin board gets updated frequently, so it's probably a good idea to check it once a month.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Far be it from me to tell you how to use the facilities, but it's a good idea to be mindful of how you're using your time. If you don't think about how you're spending your free time, it'll be over before you know it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Here at the Officers Academy, even professors are expected to study often to help maintain their strong leadership skills. In other words, students and teachers alike have to strive to grow in every possible field.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Hey, Teach! I hear there's gonna be a mock battle between the houses. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a bit concerned about facing an elite mercenary like you. Maybe take it easy on us, what do you say?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert|Dimitri and Claude are the leaders of the other two houses. Do not underestimate them. When we take the field, it would be best not to engage the both of them at once.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert|If you continue to insist on distracting me, I will have no choice but to get rid of you. Joking, of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|Let me tell you the provenance of our class name. The eagle, that refers to the twin-headed eagle on the Adrestian Empire's coat of arms. And black is the traditional color of the Empire's armor, hence, "Black Eagles."|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Linhardt| The Great Tree Moon is the best time of the year for naps. I could just forget all about my assignment...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|That's not a good idea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Now I'm feeling sleepy too...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Linhardt|Yeah...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Who, Jeritza sure seems strong. I kinda thought he was gonna be the new professor assigned to our class. After that teacher ran away during our outdoor training, I figured Jeritza was a natural replacement. I was surprised when you were suddenly appointed professor instead. I don't think I could hold my own against Jeritza in battle. I could probably take you though.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Not a chance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|You really think so? With enough training, I'm sure I'll beat you someday!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Probably.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Hah! Seriously? You should really work on your self-confidence if you're planning on becoming a professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Bernadetta|Um. I, ah, was just heading back to my room–bye!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Bernadetta|I don't like to come out unless I really have to. Hope you're OK with that, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|Hi, Professor. How're you doing? If you're not busy, would you like to join me on a little trip into town? If I'm cooped up in this dusty old monastery for too long, it drives me absolutely crazy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|Yes, it's true that I'm the only commoner in the Black Eagle House. I knew that before the first day of class. Those people are simply exhausting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Petra|Professor. I hope you know I am having great abilities for reading and writing. With sadness, I still have struggles with speaking. If my ways of speak...of speech are causing a burden, I hope you will have forgiveness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Petra|Here at the monastery, I have had many great learnings from many great people. I am hopeful to have learnings from you too. As forever, I will do my best trying!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dedue|His Highness has said that he trusts you, and I have no cause for doubt. But if you mistreat him in any way, I will take action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dedue|Let me know when you are hungry. I will make you a quality meal, as thanks for your service to His Highness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|I'm busy. Do you want something?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I was hoping to spar with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|I can't right now, but let's fight soon. I look forward to beating you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Nothing in particular.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|Then get out of my way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|Oh, did you come to look at the plants too? The greenhouse here is really incredible. There are so many rare flowers I'd never seen back home. And herbs I never even knew existed!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I've never had much interest in plants.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|That's normal. They all looked the same to me before I really studied them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|You seem well-informed on the subject.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|My adoptive father is the real expert. He taught me everything I know about herbs, including how to tell them apart and how to make medicines.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|You should try looking around the greenhouse sometime, if the mood strikes you. Maybe something will catch your eye!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|Hey, Professor. If you've got spare time, want to join me for a trip into town? We could try to pick up beautiful girls... Or not. I'm kidding! Don't look at me like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|Well, there's Dorothea, Hilda, and Mercedes. Lady Rhea's quite the beauty too. And I must admit, I've even checked out Professor Manuela once or twice. You know, Professor, I think I'm going to like it at the Officer's Academy. There are beautiful girls as far as the eye can see...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|Before I came to the Officers Academy, I attended a school of magic in the Kingdom capital. That's where I met Annie! That's what I call Annette. Oh, I guess Lorenz was at the school of magic too? But Annie was always just so nice to me, even though I was older. She's my best friend in the world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|Hello, Professor! Uh, I have a teeny tiny question for you, if that's all right... You haven't seen a man with hair the same color as mine, a scowling face, and a generally gloomy demeanour...have you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Looking for someone?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|Well, yes. It's a bit difficult to explain... Please just let me know if you do see him, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Can't say that I have.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|I suppose it was silly to ask. Sorry for wasting your time!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ingrid|The Blue Lion House derived its names from the honorary title of the first king of Faerghus. Loog, the King of Lions, wore brilliantly blue garments. His chivalric exploits are recorded in multiple legends. The library holds various historical accounts regarding him and the Blue Lions. If you find time, you should read them. They're filled with insights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|Our house is that of the Golden Deer. Do you know the significance of that name, Professor? Golden Deer are sacred creatures said to have protected Leicester since time immemorial. All three of the houses have a meaning behind their name. You should feel free to ask around, if that sort of knowledge interests you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Raphael|Ugh. I really need to eat. I can't hold out until the next meal! Why can't the dining hall stay open all the time? I need to keep eating if I want to get stronger!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|Have you memorized everyone's names yet? I'm Ignatz, in case you forgot. I'm looking forward to learning from you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|This is the Golden Deer House. You're in charge of a different house, right? Too bad we won't see more of each other. I'm happy to learn from you, if the opportunity comes up!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|Hi, Professor. Have you gotten around to visiting the library yet? It's absolutely loaded with valuable information. I only wish I wasn't burdened with the necessity of sleep, so I could spend all my hours there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|You like reading?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|In a manner, yes. But it's more that I want to learn as much as I possibly can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|You ought to get some rest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|Please don't treat me like a child. I may be a bit younger than the others, but that really shouldn't factor in.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Marianne|Goddess, I pray to thee... Please protect us... ...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|So, about the mock battle that's coming up...you don't mind me sitting it out, do you? As a fragile maiden, I'm useless in battle. I'll just cheer everyone on instead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|Oh, Professor! Have you adjusted to life at the academy yet? Me, I'm still not used to it. I'm not one for all this studying and training.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Leonie|I'm Captain Jeralt's first and best apprentice. I can beat anyone, Professor. Even you, if I have to! It may have been only for a short time, but I learned from the absolute best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Do bear in mind that even as you are appraising your students, they are appraising you as well. I hope that you will do your best to form lasting bonds with your flock. Oh, and I look forward to witnessing your prowess in the mock battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|These are the students' quarters. To better help you supervise them, you also have a room here. Your room is here at the end. Commoner students also reside on the first floor, while the second is primarily for students of noble birth. As a rule, we try to avoid discrimination based on social status here. But the nobility can be quite insistent when it comes to matters of propriety. Speaking of, it would be best for you to avoid improper conduct. I expect you to set a good example for the students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flayn|Hello there, Professor. Well, I call you that, but I am afraid that I am not a student here myself...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|That's a shame.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flayn|Should the opportunity arise, I would love to become a student and begin my studies in earnest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Where can I visit you, then?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flayn|My brother would not be pleased if he heard you saying such things.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flayn|The monastery is kind enough to provide a sanctuary for my brother and I. He's the only family I have.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Alois|Captain Jeralt has hardly changed since 20 years ago. I've aged at least three times as much as he has! Why am I talking about this? Oh, right, it was because I just overheard Tomas remarking on the subject. The leader of a legendary group of knights, returned. People are bound to be talking about the ol' captain!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeritza|I care nothing of friendship. If you have no business here, leave.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|The church has changed a lot since my time. Seteth, Hanneman, Manuela, Jeritza, and many of the knights... None of them were around 20 years ago. Have you met Leonie yet? Apparently it was my influence that inspired her to leave her village. Sorry to burden you, but could you watch over her for me? She's the only apprentice I've ever had.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Apparently there is to be a mock battle between the houses. Interesting, but I hope you understand that I have far more important things on my mind. My research is proceeding slower than I would like. Your Crest is something of a challenge. Frustrating. Yet, also, quite intriguing. I was wondering if I might get a sample of your flesh. A couple square inches would do. No? Perhaps some blood? A couple of drops on the device are all I need.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|(It's some kind of experimental apparatus...)|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I might as well assist by providing a blood sample...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|Oh, thank you, Professor. Those few drops of blood are invaluable to my research! Oh, so much more to learn!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I had better keep my distance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|A mock battle? This early? Wow, Professor. They're not giving you any time to settle in, are they? Don't you worry though! Should you get injured, I will care for you all through your recuperation. I will see to you oh-so very, very, personally.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Tomas|Professor, I hear you are lacking in knowledge of the Church of Seiros. The library contains countless documents about the teaching and history of the church. I encourage you to make good use of them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Cyril|I'm a little busy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Oh, sorry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Cyril|If you're looking for the greenhouse, it's right there. See it? Looks like a greenhouse? That's it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Can't we talk just a little?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Cyril|I really can't right now, I got a lot of things to do. Work and stuff like that. Why don't you look at the flowers in the greenhouse instead? They're pretty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! By the by, have you ever regretted a decision and wished you could go back and undo it? It's too bad there's no lesson for how to turn back the ol' clock, huh? But I suppose a bad decision isn't worth all that fuss anyhow!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Student|I'm not too keen on the professor of my class. I really hoped to focus more on strategy. Hmm, maybe I should talk to my professor about transferring to a different class.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Monk|There are two types of Crests. Major Crests manifest their power most effectively, while Minor Crests are slightly weaker. It is said that the closer a person's blood relation is to various saints and Heroes, the higher their chance of bearing a major Crest. Of course, there are also examples of Major Crests manifesting in children whose parents bear no Crest whatsoever. The exact nature of how and why Crests are inherited is still a mystery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Priest|I hear a member of House Hresvelg, the ruling family of the Empire, has entered the Officers Academy for the first time in ages. It is said that the Adrestian Empire's very founding was aided by none other than Saint Seiros. That is why the Crest of Seiros is on the Imperial flag. In recent years, a rift has developed between the Empire and the church... Let us hope that this will be a good opportunity for both parties to reforge their close relationship of years past.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Knight Of Seiros|As part of our commitment to the goddess, the knights undertake various missions across all of Fódlan. Assisting with the education of young nobles is also a part of our sacred duty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Knight Of Seiros|The Imperial princess, the crown prince, and the heir to the Alliance's leading house... This is one exceptional year, that's for sure. If you're a teacher here, you'd better watch your step. If anything were to happen to those kids... Well, suffice to say that it could harm the reputation of the Church of Seiros, which we've spent almost a millennium establishing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Monk|Tomas has served as the monastery's librarian for decades. Actually, he was away from Garreg Mach for a spell, but he returned to his post last year. There is no one as familiar with the monastery archives as he is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|It's finally time for the mock battle. This is my chance to measure your worth as an instructor. Do you think you can rise to the challenge?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|"Leave it to me."|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|So confident. This will be interesting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|"I'm concerned..."|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|That doesn't inspire much confidence, does it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Each of us has undergone strict training. We're prepared for anything that comes our way. That means there's no need to hold back. Show us what you're capable of.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Hey there! Did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting? Oh, no worries–we'll just join in now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Simply tell me your weaknesses, and you're welcome to stay. But is there enough time to cover them all?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Ah, so you can't win unless you know my weakness? Poor princess. You really should believe in yourself more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|I spare no effort when pursuing victory. As a master of schemes, I should think you would understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Schemes? Me? I have no idea what you're talking about! I plan to fight fair and square, as ever.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Hearing the words "fair and square" from Claude can only be a bad omen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Your Highnesses haven't known me for very long, but you already have me figured out, don't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|No need to poke fun. I will fight with honor. That said, I will fight to win.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Yes, and the same is true of us. Right, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|"Don't go too hard on us."|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|No use trying to hide how you really feel, Teach. I can see it in your eyes–you don't intend to lose.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|"I don't intend to lose."|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|If that is how you feel, then I will not hold back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Ah, how time flies! In that case, I'll see you later.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Edelgard, Professor, be careful out there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Ah, it's finally time for the mock battle. I'm eager to put my skills to use. And you, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I'm looking forward to it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Excellent. I have high expectations for your command. That said, I've no doubt it will take everything we've got to pull a victory.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I hope we can win.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you command use as you did back in the village, I have no doubt we'll be fine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Our opponents are mighty, that much is certain, but I'm positive we can win.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Hey there! Did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting? Oh, no worries–we'll just join in now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Nice try, Claude, but I do not intent to let slip our strategies. Especially when we are up against such strong opponents as you two.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Well now! Kind words from his kingliness. If that's the case, we'd better come up with some clever schemes so as not to disappoint. Right, Princess?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Right. No matter the tactics you devise, we will destroy you. The best you can hope for is to learn a thing or two.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Haha, there's nothing wrong with a friendly rivalry, but let's not get carried away. A rash attitude could be your undoing, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Hmm... Perhaps your time would be better spent preparing instead of worrying about the competition's mindset.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Hey, now! If you two are getting this fired up before the battle even starts...it'll make it that much easier for my class to sweep up a win. So please, carry on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|A good point, Claude. I apologize–that wasn't my intention. At any rate, let's vow to make this a productive battle, shall we?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Don't go too hard on us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|No use trying to hide how you really feel, Teach. I can see it in your eyes–you don't intend to lose.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I don't intend to lose.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Oh? In that case, I won't hold back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Ah, how time flies! In that case, I'll see you later.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Time for a mock battle, eh? Hmm, how should we go about this... Well, you'll be our commander, that much is for sure. Just don't screw it up and everything'll be great. Got it, Teach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I'm not concerned.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Right. I'll do whatever I can to help too. I mean, I'm kind of obligated to. For example! If I add a little something to their food to upset their stomachs...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Don't even think about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Yeah, yeah, wink, wink. I read you. You can't officially condone that sort of thing, right? But say, hypothetically speaking, students from the other houses started racing to the infirmary... As far as anyone knows, it could just be a harmless little stomach bug making the rounds.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Well, well. What a fascinating conversation you two are having. May we join?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Claude, I can't believe you would stoop to such crooked schemes to gain the advantage. Have you no honor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|If that was really my scheme, I wouldn't be talking about it out in the open. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until our battle to see what's really in store.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|It's irrelevant anyhow. Whatever you have planned won't save you from a crushing defeat.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|She has a point. Still, I'm rather eager to see what sort of scheme that mind of yours conjures up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|You heard 'em, Teach. We can't let these fine folks down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|It will be a fair fight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Heh, of course. A fair fight, as all fights are. Good one, Teach. Play innocent now so they won't see it coming.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|If they insist.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Are you serious, Teach? Well, if a crooked scheme is really what you're after, I've got more than a few of those up my sleeve.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I'm sorry, Professors. It's about time I returned to my training anyhow. Claude, Edelgard, until we meet again on the battlefield, farewell.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|The mock battle is finally here. Will you lead us to victory?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|I'm sure you already understand, but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner. Incidentally, I'll be overseeing this mock battle. So listen well if you want to win.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|Me?! But I'm not ready!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Once you've finished preparing, make your move. Dedue, Mercedes. Keep our enemy occupied until then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dedue|I'm on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|Oh my! We'll try our best!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Welp, we're surrounded. All we can do is fight back with all our might!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Beautiful work, Professor. But the true challenge starts now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|You're a tough opponent, but I refuse to yield. Do not fool yourself into believing I will hold back!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Dimitri... It's time! We can finally settle the question of who's stronger.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Very well. I accept your challenge. With you as my opponent, I won't hold anything back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|I would expect no less!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Coming up with brilliant schemes, I can handle. No problem. But I'm not much for fighting. Go easy on me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|You know that was a joke, right? Jeez, not so much as a smile...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Look at that, a real life princess! I'll have to be careful not to scar that little face of yours.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Careful, Claude. I'll win no matter what, but you're only making things harder for yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Losing hasn't even crossed your mind, has it? Ooh, this'll be a bit of a shock, then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|To shock was your intention to begin with, was it not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|I've lost?! Oh! Unthinkable!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|I've lost. The new professor is quite a commander.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|Ouch! Was that really necessary?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Argh, I hate losing! I guess I'll just have to settle for cheering the others on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|I must have let my guard down. I guess that's a loss for the Golden Deer House.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Manuela|Well done. I nearly wound up a patient in my own infirmary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|Ah–so strong! Have to do better next time...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dedue|Ngh. Apologies, Your Highness. I can go no further.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|Oh no... This is as far as I can go...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|My training was insufficient... I am so sorry, everyone. The rest is up to you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I suppose that does it for the Blue Lion House...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hanneman|My goodness. The leadership of someone with actual battle experience is... Well! I was as good as useless.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|I am the son of House Aegir! How did I fail? I must need to train harder...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert|Hmm. The new professor's rather strong. Suppose I'll have to call it a day.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|My, my... The new professor seems very capable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Forced to retreat... Well, things will only get tougher from here on out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|To think that the Black Eagles could lose so readily...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|All right, that's that! The winner of this mock battle is... The Black Eagle House!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Even though it was just a mock battle, we defeated both houses masterfully. Take pride in this victory, everyone!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|This victory is the result of everyone's hard work. Thank you, my friends. You did well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|It is about time for the battle to begin. Our victory depends on your leadership. Do not let us down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|Me?! But I'm not ready!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Dorothea, will you head towards the front lines? I wish to draw the enemy towards us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|You got it, Edie. Leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Ferdinand. Hubert. If the enemy comes, stop them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|Leave it to us, although I could do this on my own.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert|Heh. Clearly not, or Her Highness would not ask me to watch your back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Welp, we're surrounded. All we can do is fight back with all our might!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Victory is in sight, Black Eagles. Do not let up!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Flawless tactics, Professor. Our only choice in this situation is a head-on attack!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Psst, Your Princliness. You've got a thing for Edelgard, right? Come on, fess up. You'll feel better.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Claude, please. This is no time for idle banter. Your defenses are wide open.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|That didn't get to him, huh? What a shame. I'll find a better way to ruffle him up next time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|There can be no victory unless I defeat you. So be it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|So this is the stage for the mock battle... The command's all yours, Teach!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|I will fight on the front lines! I can stop the enemy's advance with grace!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert|Do you have Lady Edelgard's permission to--hmph. I suppose I've no choice but to provide cover.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Thank you Hubert. We are off to a terrible start.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Once you've finished preparing, make your move. Dedue, Mercedes. Keep our enemy occupied until then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dedue|I'm on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|Oh my! We'll try our best!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Hm, you are performing as expected, Professor. We will have to face you with our full might!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|We will use the forest to ambush our enemy. Everyone, I am counting on your support!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Jeralt|If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|It seems we're surrounded... At a time like this, our only option is to cut a path through!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Are you planning on fighting two houses at once? I will admit, that is favorable for us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Beautiful work, Professor. But the true challenge starts now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Great work, everyone! Even if it's just a mock battle, the taste of victory is sugary sweet!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Excellent work today, Professor. Though our victory should come as no surprise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|It was a close call.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Was it? I'm not sure I agree with that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|It was easy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Yes, it was. Further proof that you're well qualified to guide the Black Eagles.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Petra|That was impressing, Professor! I mean...impressive. We gained a victory because of your great leadership.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dorothea|We certainly did. We all tried our best, of course, but we couldn't have won without you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ferdinand|I was curious what it would look like if you did not hold back. And you did not disappoint!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hubert|Hmph. I daresay we owe our victory to Lady Edelgard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Linhardt|How so? For that battle, she was only a soldier following our professor's command. Sure, she was an incredibly powerful soldier...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Caspar|Don't worry about it too much, Linhardt. All that matters is that we won!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Bernadetta|I'm all done with being on the battlefield, OK? I'd rather stay back than pursue victory out there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|You are all as ridiculous as always. We only managed to win because we worked together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Edelgard|Was it something I said? Is it so odd, me talking about togetherness? If so, that perception must change. In fact, I'm canceling the festivities so we can discuss this topic further. I'm kidding, of course. Come on, everyone! We've earned this celebration.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Professor! I've been looking for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I was hoping we could all share a meal together. It could serve as both a victory celebration and a post-battle analysis. What do you think?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|A victory celebration?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Of course. After all, we fought hard out there. Such exertion is bound to make anyone hungry for respite, don't you agree?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I'm invited?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Of course. Why wouldn't you be?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sylvain|Come now, Professor! We can't very well celebrate without the key to our victory present.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Annette|He's right! He really is! We were only able to win because we had your help, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Felix|Yes. Compared with that boar who knows nothing save frontal attacks, your tactics were nearly decent.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ingrid|Felix! You really ought to stop picking fights with His Highness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Don't worry, Ingrid. I encourage all to speak freely. And I must agree that the professor's tactics were truly extraordinary. I have much to learn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Mercedes|Oh, sure, but today was exhausting, I'm so hungry I can barely stand...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ashe|To be honest, so am I. Let's head to the dining hall. Together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Professor. I'm sorry to intrude, but...you don't look too happy for someone who just won.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|You're mistaken.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|You say that, but your eyes tell a different story.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Is that so...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|Hm. Well, I understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes. I'm sorry for prying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Dimitri|I know we only just met, so this may be difficult for you, but... I'd love nothing more than to share our happiness with you. Joy can be so fleeting, after all. We're all in this together...so I hope you will consent. I'm sure the rest of the class feels the very same. Well...come along, Professor. Let's enjoy the fruits of our labor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Great work, Teach! That was a brilliant win.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I'm glad we won.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|I've been anticipating that magic moment when your tactics and my schemes entwined, and you did not disappoint. That composed expression you always sport like a permanent mask is a perfect complement to my ruthless scheme. That's a joke, of course. Mostly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Everyone did well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|Huh. Playing ignorant as to the quality of you command and deflecting the praise to your students. You really are a model professor, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|To be honest, I had a bunch of other schemes planned as well, just in case the situation called for it. But I didn't have to resort to any of them. I suppose our opponents lucked out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lorenz|Well met, Professor! The breadth of your skill was on full display today. I must admit that your tactics were masterful. I shudder to think what may have transpired had it been Claude leading us into battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Raphael|I noticed that too! We just did what you told us, and we won! I love it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Lysithea|As expected from a child of the former captain of the knights. Thank you for today, Professor. I have much to consider.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Hilda|I never doubted that our professor would be amazing! It was way too obvious. Don't you agree, Marianne?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Marianne|Huh? Me? Oh, um, yes. Of course. Well done, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Leonie|Captain Jeralt taught his child well. It would have been more of a surprise had our professor proved lacking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Ignatz|Don't you think it's a bit hard to give Jeralt all of the credit, Leonie? In any case, it's clear that we only won because of our new mentor's guidance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|A mercenary's wisdom and techniques are forged in battle. Those are the sorts of things you can only learn through experience. Right, Teach? But more importantly, it's time to celebration our victory! Teach here has yet to try my well renowned home cooking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Claude|I really do hope you'll join us. After all, I swiped some finely aged cheese from the dining hall for just this occasion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Your work with the students was remarkable. I can see Jeralt trained you well. I do hope you were able to use the occasion to bond with the students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I did.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|I am so happy to hear it. Nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Not really.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|Oh? Well, you have only just met them, so I suppose that should come as no surprise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|Of course, the mock battle was mere practice. The real fight is the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, which will take place during the Wyvern Moon. You are expected to properly train your students so as not to humiliate the academy during the long-held tradition that is the coming battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|As for today, I have called you here to tell you of your mission for the month ahead. Your class is to dispose of some bandits causing trouble nearby.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|My mission?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Bandits?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Seteth|Those affiliated with Garreg Mach Monastery have a moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of social standing. Students are no exception. Each month, before the newly birthed moon departs, each house of students must complete their assigned mission. You shall work to complete the task at hand alongside your students and report back to the archbishop before the deadline. Understood? I will soon provide you with the necessary details for your first mission. If I told you now, I expect you would only forget, and I despise repeating myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Rhea|I can sense something special within your heart... I have high hopes for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sothis|Bandits, they say…|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sothis|Do you recall when we first met? You shall not fall so shamelessly again, correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sothis|Have you no words for me? Do not tell me that you are shocked to hear from me! You ought to know that I am always with you now. To hear my voice should not come as a shock.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|Right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|I don't understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Sothis|Whatever shall I do with you? I am alive within the confines of your heart. I am unknown to all but you. But through your eyes and ears, I see and hear. Just listen to your heart, as you are doing now, and we may speak like this. That is all that I know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Kostas|What is this nonsense?! All I was told was to kill as many noble pipsqueaks as possible! No one said anything about the Knights of damned Seiros being on our trail!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flame Emperor|You have proven yourself worthless. Distracted by something so trivial. I had hoped you would achieve your goal despite the setback. But now a child of the Knights’ former captain is in play. How interesting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Kostas|Hey, this isn't what I agreed to!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flame Emperor|Hiring a mercenary as a professor. What was that woman thinking?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Kostas|Are you listening to me?! How do we finish this?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flame Emperor|You die.|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Kostas|Wh– What?|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Flame Emperor|Underestimating the Knights was an amateur mistake. One you will pay for. The road to eternal torment awaits you all. Now I must locate your replacements...|
FE16WhiteClouds|01-ThreeHouses|Kostas|Wait! Get back here! Damn you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|We are planning a grand ball for this month. I am sure the students will be most pleased.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Seteth|Yes, certainly. However, we must not devote all of our time to frivolity. We have a new mission for you. We have found evidence of someone sneaking into an unused chapel.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|A chapel?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|It is a building that was once a temporary sanctuary at a time when the monastery was under renovation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Was something stolen?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|No, there is nothing of value in that building. We do not yet know what the intruders' objectives are.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Seteth|This month, your class is tasked with guarding the chapel and investigating these intruders. With the recent state of affairs surrounding the holy church, we cannot afford to overlook any abnormality, no matter how seemingly trivial.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|I am ordering a seasoned knight to assist you to ensure the safety of the students. In times like these, I am afraid we must always expect the worst.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That's reassuring.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Which knight?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Reporting for duty, Lady Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|I thought you two could use the time to bond. And to speak of important matters...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Appreciate the thought.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Seteth|Bear in mind that Jeralt has a separate mission of his own. He will join you once he has finished it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|It's true. I'll be away from the monastery for a while. But when I return... I'll come and watch you work. I'll be looking forward to it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Tomas... No, Solon, was it not? And the Flame Emperor... It is most clear that something has transpired. And it relates to you somehow. Or is the fault my own, and you're just caught inside the wave... Sothis, the goddess of this world... I bear her name... Hmm... How confusing. I feel as though my head has turned to mush!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Everyone's in such a festive mood. I feel a bit out of my element here. I can't help but worry something might happen while we're all distracted... After all, our enemies are always plotting. Still, this air of levity is much more agreeable than the grim atmosphere of late.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|It seems the dastards who set Remire Village aflame have yet to be apprehended. Monsters. Trampling mercilessly over innocent lives. They deserve a gruesome end...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Someone entered the old chapel... I think the townsfolk used it for feasts and such in the past. With that whole Tomas business, you can't blame the church for being on edge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|Another month full of chaos. I've barely had time to catch my breath. What is the objective of Tomas and his ilk? And what makes Flayn so special–does that not bother you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Ah, the ball. It reminds me of my first such event, back in the Imperial capital. It was held by my father, the prime minister. I really showed off my dancing skills! Everyone was quite impressed with me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|You know, Professor, I used to think I would be comfortable with all manner of experiments, so long as they provided usable results. But when I heard of Solon's work, well, I realized I'd not consider the moral and philosophical limits of what "all manner of experiments" might mean. Urk... Sorry. I'm not great with blood, even when I'm just thinking about it. I feel a bit ill now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|I can't believe this... I'm so angry right now! First it's the Death Knight, and now Tomas, and neither of them are in custody! I can't stand the thought of such evil lurking in the world. We have to do something about this! I have to do something about this!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|The ball. A grim reminder of my sad reality. The other nobles will be fine, I'm sure. They've all been to events like this before. But me? I'm a noble, and I've never even been close to one of these things!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|I wonder if Remire Village will ever be the same again. How do you recover from such a terrible event? So many dead, so much destroyed... I can't see how the whole village doesn't just end up abandoned.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Our class was also sent to help put the village in order. But then…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Dancing of Fódlan is not the same as dancing of Brigid. The reason is maybe that the music has many differences. In Brigid, dancing is different for each person. Our dancing has vigor and ferocity. There is no speech of technique for our dancing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Even though there is to be a ball, we still have a mission. It would be nice if this month passed by in peace.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Argh... Too much merriment. The librarian betrayed us. The Death Knight is back. Is this the time to be throwing a ball?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Last month was– Well, you know even better than I do. I hope this one will be more cheerful. This ball though... I don't know. It's all new to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Great work in Remire Village, Professor. Who would have ever guessed it was Tomas? Ah, but no. Now isn't the time to get lost in gloomy thoughts.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Oh, now, where did that Ingrid run off to? The ball is soon and she hadn't even put on any makeup! I was trying to help her out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|So, Tomas the librarian was a bad guy? But he always seemed so nice! C'mon, self. You're better than this. You promised you'd be on top of things this month.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Mercedes locked me in her room for hours earlier... She was slathering pounds of makeup onto my face. Saying something or other about the ball. It really wore me out...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Ah. The long-awaited ball. Finally, an opportunity to showcase my exquisite skills on the dance floor. These skills were ingrained in me when I was a boy. My hands and feet move on pure instinct.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|The ball is coming up soon! I am so excited! I can't wait to fill up on food while everyone's dancing. I even heard there'll be some prime cuts of meat!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Some scary things have been happening lately. I hope that this month, of all months, is peaceful. The ball is coming up and everything... Although I'm not much of a dancer actually.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|It's true that Tomas was employed here under the recommendation of House Ordelia. But that's all I know of the topic. I'd never even seen him prior to enrolling here. Even when he was supposedly in Ordelia territory, I never once saw him there. I'm still feeling bothered by all of this, but...there's not much else I can say about it right now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|A ball? Um, I don't think I'll partake.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|It's almost time for the ball! Oooh my, am I excited! This being a school, we don't have many chances to get dressy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|I'm glad the Remire Village situation got sorted out. But it's not over yet, is it? And I can't believe old Tomas turned out to be an enemy. Who can you trust anymore?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|Before the ball, it is customary that we host a competition of dance known as the White Heron Cup. The students are quite fond of this tradition. Each house must select representatives to compete. Their dance shall be judged by its beauty, grace, and technique. The student who is deemed the winner will be given the opportunity to train as a dancer, should they so please. It is a very precious thing, the gift of dance. I hope that you and your students will choose to participate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|I have been told that your house won the White Heron Cup. This can only be a result of the students' talent and effort, not to mention your steadfast instruction.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|It would appear your house was defeated in the White Heron Cup. With the White Heron Cup concluded, all that is left is to wait for the ball. I hope you will find it enjoyable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|It has come to my attention that you did not participate in the White Heron Cup. Were none of your students skilled in dance? With the White Heron Cup concluded, all that is left is to wait for the ball. I hope you will find it enjoyable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Seteth|I have looked into Tomas, but I just cannot make sense of this at all. From his behavior up until now, I never would have suspected that a man like him could turn on us. I have also discovered that his appearance has changed... It is almost as if he is not even human! What in the world is going on?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Hello Professor! The ball will soon be upon us. Ah, I can feel my heart fluttering already! I... I have never danced in front of people before. Not even once in all my life. I am very much looking forward to it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Ah, the ball... It reminds me of how I met my wife. I was at a village's harvest festival. There was a full moon bathing everything in its cool glow. She appeared out of nowhere, dancing gracefully in the moonlight–a lovely fairy!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That story sounds fake.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Hah! The "full moon" was an embellishment, I admit. But you can forgive a man for waxing poetic, can't you? Anyway...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That's a wonderful story.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|We soon fell in love and tied the knot. Now we have a daughter, who's as bright and beautiful as a sunny morning. So, whenever I see people dancing, I think of my wife, and my heart does a little waltz.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Catherine|The area with the old chapel was supposed to be off-limits. It was at risk of collapse, so they didn't even post guards. It's not too strange. Does that surprise you? Eh, Garreg Mach has lots of places that are blocked off for one reason or another. That's true of the underground Holy Mausoleum as well as the northern woods. People call it the sealed forest, but as far as I can tell, it's nothing special. Just a forest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Shamir|What's this about? The ball? Knights don't participate. It's an event for students, but it does pique the interest of some knights in particular.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Shamir|Alois can't dance, but I hear he likes to watch. He volunteered to judge the White Heron Cup. Not that I care.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Gilbert|It cannot be true that our siblings-in-arms could turn against us. However, I will continue investigating members of the church. To think even someone as senior as Tomas would fall under suspicion... I know not how far to take my search.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Even the knights...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Gilbert|Unlike the monks, the Knights of Seiros are Lady Rhea's direct subordinates. Some are in quite unique circumstances, but I cannot think any of them would betray us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Even the students...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Gilbert|Yes, a great many strange and terrible things have come to pass this year... I must not dismiss the possibility that someone among the students is behind it all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hanneman|Garreg Mach Monastery is said to have been completed during the Ethereal Moon. Why, 995 years ago as a matter of fact. That's rather a long time ago, don't you think? Every year, a ball is held to celebrate the founding. And every one hundred years, a very special celebration takes place. It's a grand festival, involving all of Garreg Mach. It is thrilling to read of past festivals, and I'm rather excited to experience one for myself. Once in a lifetime, eh? The next one, in five years, will make a millennium. Should be quite an event. Do you imagine you'll still be here teaching then?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Manuela|Great. Just...great. It's that time when all the students get all lovey-dovey. You're new, but you know about the ball, yeah? I can't bear it. Young love is wasted on the young. They can't appreciate it to its fullest! Ugh, I wish I could fall in love too...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Manuela|Oh! Speaking of the ball, Professor, have you selected your representative for the dance contest yet? If you don't, the contest will go on without your house. And that would be...embarrassing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Cyril|Nah, Tomas wouldn't betray the church. I don't believe it. I won't believe it! There's some people in the church who hate people like me who are from Almyra, but Tomas was always real kind. But if he really was Lady Rhea's enemy... Well, I'd defend her against anybody. No matter how kind they'd been in the past.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Anna|Hey, Professor. How's it going? Making lots of coin? I'd love to catch up, but I'm super busy right now. Working. For money. You understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Ah, other than the legend of the Goddess Tower, of course. Have you heard the students talking about it? On the last night of the Ethereal Moon, on the same night as the ball... If a man and a woman go to the Goddess Tower and make a wish, it's sure to come true! I have a wish, but I can't find anybody to make it with me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|(Is there someone I feel that way about?)|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|The White Heron Cup is a competition of skill and grace in dance. Please encourage your house to participate. That said, if you are serious about winning, be sure to choose your representative carefully.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|By the way, have you chosen our house's representative for the White Heron Cup? If nobody else comes to mind, I'm willing to take up the challenge, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Understood. Just leave this to me and victory is assured.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|I see... If you believe there's someone more qualified, I certainly won't object.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|On a lighter note. I've heard you've yet to choose a class representative for the White Heron Cup. It's not something I'm interested in, but if no one else wants to do it, then I will shoulder the burden.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|How very whimsical of you. I suppose I'll have to do what I can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|Wise. Better to choose someone with more charm.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Do you see what I am trying to say here? Do not make me beg you... Please, choose me as our representative for the White Heron Cup!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Wonderful! You will have a chance to see the legendary footwork of House Aegir!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Hmph. If you really think someone is better suited for it, I will not argue.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Let us change the subject and settle my stomach. I assume you've heard about the dance competition? Have you chosen a representative yet? Or... Oh my. You haven't, have you? Have you come to tell me I'm to be it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I see... I can dance, in theory, but I dare say in practice things may go very differently.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I think that's wise. I simply can't really be bothe-- What I mean to say is I lack the confidence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Ugh. Sorry about that, Professor. I'm just so frustrated right now. I need something to take my mind off things. That reminds me! If you're looking for a volunteer, I'd be happy to represent our class in the White Heron Cup. I'm an excellent Dancer.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Great! We both know I'm our class's best chance at winning this thing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|You really think you can find a better dancer than me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|What is a White Heron Cup, anyway? Wh-what?! A dance competition?! That's terrifying! W-we need a representative for our class?! Please, anyone but Bernie!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|You're just trying to humiliate me, aren't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Oh, what a relief! Thank you so much, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|I'm sorry, Professor. I'm talking about such grim and terrible things when we could be talking about the White Heron Cup. It's a big dance contest between the classes, and I simply adore dancing. I'm quite good at it, since I was a diva in an opera company, you know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|I think my heart just skipped a beat. You want me to represent the class? I'm not sure when I last experienced such flattery, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|What? Why not me? Oh, whatever. So long as you remember to chose someone, hm?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Are you choosing me to represent at the White Heron Cup? Or are you not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|I will display all that I have learned. I will grab the victory!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|I have understanding. You believe that I cannot grab the victory, I am guessing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I... I'm sorry. Please ignore my troubled ramblings. Was something the matter? Something to do with the White Heron Cup? Professor, I beg of you. Please do not chose me as our house representative. I am utterly serious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|What?! Curse you, Professor. I will of course accept, but know that you have damned us all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Oh, thank the goddess. Please be sure to select someone with the confidence to win for us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Incidentally, I have heard there will be a dance competition prior to the ball. Have you chosen a representative yet?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|I will take part, if you insist.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Someone must want to participate. You would do well to find that person.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Ah, whatever. You look like you're about to say something. Are you considering me as our representative for the White Heron Cup? Heh.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|I was joking. You really couldn't find anyone else?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|I see. That's a relief.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|But speaking of the ball, isn't there something happening just before it? The White...Heron...something? It sounds like every class needs a representative. Have you picked ours yet?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Are you sure you want m-me to do this? I guess I'll just have to do the best I can, then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|You should pick one of the nobles. They all have experience with this sort of thing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|The ball is almost here...and the White Heron Cup dance contest. So, Professor, who will be representing our class?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Me? Uh, sure! Why not? I'll get out there, show off my moves, and drive the ladies wild.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|I get it. No worries, really. I'd rather see a beautiful person dancing instead of some goof like me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|While we're on the subject of the ball, what's this I hear about a dance competition? Physical activity isn't my forte, but dancing can be fun! If there's no one else you'd rather select, I'm happy to represent our class.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Thanks for having faith in me, Professor! I'll try my best to win!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Are you sure? Please let me know if you change your mind!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|After all, we have the ball to look forward to, and the White Heron Cup before that! Oh, speaking of have you chosen our house representative yet? If not, I'd like to volunteer!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Really? That's fantastic! I'll try as hard as anyone's ever tried, you can count on it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Aw, that's too bad. But if you reconsider, you know where to find me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Speaking of, I heard that there's going to be a dance competition. Have you sorted out who will represent our class, Professor? It's not me, is it? Please don't say it's me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Oh dear... Well, I'll see what I can do, then. On my honor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Thank goodness. I don't know the first thing about dancing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Considering this recent rash of strange incidents, I wonder if having a ball is really the best idea... And then there's the White Heron Cup. Sheesh. What poor sap are you enlisting to represent our house, Teach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Claude: Me?! Don't be unreasonable, Teach! Ugh... I mean, if I have to make a miracle happen, I guess I'll figure it out...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Oh, but first, the White Heron Cup! Who will appear onstage, I wonder? You're choosing a representative for the dance contest, isn't that right? Choose me! I'm a pro!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Great! Now that I'm in the spotlight, I'll do anything to win!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Aww, I was really getting excited for it. Let me know if you change your mind, huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|From what I hear, the White Heron Cup will be held just prior to the ball. Say no more, Professor. I would consider it an honor to represent our class!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|You will not regret this choice!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|By all means, take your time and think it over. But I do assure you, there is no candidate better suited to the task than yours truly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Apparently there's supposed to be a dance contest too. I think it's called the White Heron Cup. Who's gonna represent our class? I can do it if you haven't picked someone else!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|You made the right choice, Professor! Everyone's gonna think my moves are hilarious!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Aww, really? I may not look it, but I'm actually a pretty good dancer.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Watching other people dance can be fun though. I've heard people talking about the White Heron Cup. Do you know who will be representing us?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Me?! What? No, please! You can't!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|I think a noble would make for a better choice. Bound to know their way around a ballroom.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Right... It's the dance this month, isn't it? I can't see how anyone would be much in the mood for dancing, considering... Although I suppose the White Heron Cup does sound pretty fun.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Uh, you want me to be our representative? I've certainly got a few moves...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|It would probably be more logical to ask someone who likes dancing in the first place, so I certainly understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|There's a dance contest as well? I see. I'll cheer for our class, of course. So, um... Who will represent our house in the contest?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|I see, well... Um, I'm sorry. What did you say?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|I'm sure whoever represents our class will do a fine job. Much better than I could do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|The ball? Doesn't matter. I don't dance. I might show up for the food though. Not that it's got anything to do with me, but have you picked someone to represent us for the White Heron Cup yet?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|What? You're asking a peasant to dance? You've got some pretty weird ideas!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Well, someone's bound to want to do it. I'm sure we've got a few people with the talent to win too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Have you heard yet about the White Heron Cup? If you have yet to choose a representative, do you mind terribly if I volunteer?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Ah, thank you, Professor! I am overcome with joy! Just you wait until my feet touch the ballroom floor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Understood. Ah, well. Either way, I am still so excited about the ball!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Well, I suppose we should practice, then. Shall we?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|How was that? I believe I've improved my technique.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Huh... Well, let's practice whenever you can spare the time. Agreed?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|To think I'd be rehearsing my dance moves, of all things. Give me some advice, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|A little less grotesque now? Maybe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|All right. But if we want to avoid a tragic accident during the contest, I will need more practice.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Professor, uh... Do you know how to dance? I could really use some guidance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|You really can do everything! I am envious of you, if you will pardon my frankness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Fair enough. You do not think I need guidance. You are probably right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Professor? Are you here to practice with me for the dance contest?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I don't enjoy a bit of this, you know. Entirely too much standing up and moving around for my taste. But if I'm going to do it, I may as well be in it to win.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I see... Well, that's just fine by me. There's a book on fishing that I'd like to finish.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Hey, Professor! Did you want to practice dancing with me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|What did you think? Pretty perfect, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|You're probably right. I don't need any more practice. I'm a natural!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Professor! Will you give me some dancing lessons?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Was that okay? A little reassuring at least? Maybe?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Is this your idea of an education? Clip my wings and toss me off a cliff?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Hey, Professor. You're here to help me practice for the dance contest?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|How was that? Was my dancing everything you hoped for and more? I certainly enjoyed it. We simply must do it again. Soon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Well, I am terribly talented, agreed. Still, I think I'll practice on my own if you're too busy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|I have much to be learned. We will now practice the dancing, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|I have much more knowledge of Fódlan lance. How is my dancing, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|That is not fortunate. I will have patience.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I am in the thick of battle, so battle I must. Will you help me prepare, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|How...was that? I perhaps did not offend as much as usual, but...I do not like our chances.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I suppose I must practice diligently while I can. On my own. Away from prying eyes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Will you teach me to dance?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Was that satisfactory?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|That makes things difficult.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Here, help me practice my dancing. You forced me into this, so you're going to help me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|How did I get roped into this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Hmph! You irresponsible fiend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|I've been practicing as best as I can, Professor, but do you think you could give me a little help?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Was that all right? I'm completely self-taught, so I really have no idea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|You really want to leave this all up to me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Oh, Professor! I'm glad you're here. I need help figuring out this whole...dancing thing. Mind helping me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|One and two and three and four... Got it! I'm pretty good at this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Aw, don't be like that, Professor. You chose me... You should help me win.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Oh, Professor? Do you mind watching my dance routine? I would appreciate your honest opinion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|How was that? I hope it's good enough to win...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|I'm so sorry, I didn't realize you were busy. I didn't mean to distract you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Professor! Would you watch me dance really quick? I've been practicing a ton!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Mwahaha! Well? What do you think? I'd say I'm pretty great. Wouldn't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Oh, do you have really important professor things to do? Well, let me know when you have the time!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Professor, I admit--I have two left feet when it comes to dancing. Do you have time to give me any pointers?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|How did I do? Was I awkward? I felt awkward.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Perhaps some other time, then. Since you chose me, I'll need your guidance in all this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Teach, this is all your doing. Step up and take responsibility. You've got to help me practice my dance moves.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|My legs aren't as unwieldy as before, I think... If I keep this up, I might do not terribly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|You're too busy? Too busy to take responsibility for your actions? Wow. Well, you'd better make time for me before it's too late.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Hey, Professor! Care to join me for dance practice?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Phew! I don't think we can possibly lose. Just you wait and see.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|What, you've got something better to do than watch me practice?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Rehearsals will not be necessary. But, if you insist, I can give you a small taste of what is to come.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Well, Professor? Are those not the most exquisitely refined moved you have ever witnessed?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|I assure you, dancing is fully ingrained in my being. Any further practice would be redundant.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Hey, Professor! You want to teach me some winning dance moves?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|That looked pretty good, right? I think I can win this thing!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|If you think my moves are good enough, then I don't need dance lessons.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Professor, can you watch me practice?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Is this how you do it? I'm feeling a little unsteady...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Professor, don't abandon me in my time of need! Why'd you pick me in the first place?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Professor, can you supervise my dance rehearsal? If I'm going to do this, I want to win it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Well? How was I? I figure if I dance with passion and fervor, I'll appear even more mature.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|You've chosen me, but you won't even bother to help me prepare? That's rather rude, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Did you need something, Professor? I suppose I should p-practice, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|No, no. That's no good. I can't seem to get a feel for it...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Oh. Very well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Professor! Come join me for dance practice!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|I'm going to have to do this in front of a crowd? I can feel myself going pale already.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Hey, you're the one who put me up to this! The least you can do is give me a hand!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Yes? Do you need me for anything, Professor? I would be happy for some dancing guidance, should you have any!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Thank you so much. I am eager to improve my dancing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|I see. Perhaps soon!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Ladies and gentlemen! My sincerest apologies for the wait! Thank you for gathering here on the eve of the highly anticipated ball to bear witness to... The academy-wide dance competition! Welcome to the White Heron Cup!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|The competition will be judged by...me! Your humble servant, Alois Rangeld! And also... The acclaimed former songstress of the Mittelfrank Opera Company, Manuela Casagranda!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Manuela|Yes, yes, thank you. Oh, and it should go without saying, but I swear to show no bias to my own house. Got it? Good.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Last but not least, the glamorous assassin who does all of her dancing in the dead of night...Shamir Nevrand!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Shamir|Hmph.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|The three of us swear on our honor to judge the following proceedings with utmost impartiality and fairness! And with that, will the representatives of each house please make their way to the stage!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Contestants! Are you ready to dance? And is the band prepared to play? Very well... BEGIN!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|TIME! That's all, folks! Splendid! All three of you were fantastic! Now, let's hear what the judges have to say...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Manuela|Oh my, let's see. I suppose I have no choice but to vote for...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Manuela|Oh my, let's see. I suppose I have no choice but to vote for...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Great feedback, both of you! Well then, let's see... Factoring my own humble opinion... Yes! We have a winner! And I will announce who it is...right now! Without any delay! The winner of this year's White Heron Cup is...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Well, a victory is a victory.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|I am not sure the judges are in their right minds...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Haha! As expected of someone as accomplished as myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Oh? Well, just so long as nothing else is expected from me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|I won? I won! How did I win?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Bernie? Are you sure? Heh...heh...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|I wonder if I can use this to bolster my singing career...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Everywhere, dancing is dancing. This is the proof.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I won? There must be some mistake...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Is this a joke?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Nonsense.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Are you sure this is OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Heh heh heh! I knew I had it in me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Oh, really? How lovely!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|I did it! Go me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Oh. Um. Sorry. I really didn't see this coming.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Ah, what a burden to be great at everything!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Perfect! Where's the prize? There is a prize, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Haha! As expected!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Me? Uh, really?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Can't say I had much confidence going in, but this is great!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Yes, it was the logical choice. My dancing was superior.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Oh dear... This is a bit embarrassing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|I can dance? Huh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Have I prevailed? Oh, most glorious! My practice was not in vain!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|The ball is tomorrow. I have no worthwhile memories of such events, yet I'm still looking forward to this one.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|As am I, in the sense that I look forward to destroying all of the unworthy suitors who will inevitably swarm Lady Edelgard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|I will admit, Edelgard is adorable. However, when it comes to elegance on the dance floor, I am superior!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|You're not a bad dancer, Ferdie. But you do have some moves that are...hard to watch.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|You honor me with your kind words! I understand that I am sometimes too dazzling to behold directly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I'm envious of your positive attitude. I also know how to dance...in theory. Maybe I should participate as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Not me! You wouldn't catch me dancing at a ball any sooner than you'd catch a fish swimming through the sky!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar| You do tend to flop around like a fish on the land, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Wh-why would you say that?! Now I feel like a fish on a skillet...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|On a skillet... Hahaha! Ahem, never mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Speaking of the ball, do we get to pick who we dance with? I wonder who I should ask...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|A bold subject change. Should Lady Edelgard wish it, I would be honored to...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|I will fight with all that I have in me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Fighting? No, that's not really the point...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|I will not be as a fish upon the flame!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea| Um... OK...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|I have a proposition. Let's all agree to meet back at the monastery exactly five years from today.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Like a class reunion? That's a great idea!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|Five years from today will be the millennium festival for Garreg Mach Monastery. I've heard the magnitude of the festivities will exceed all prior years.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Ooh, how exciting! Sounds like a great excuse to come visit our dear professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|You will be seeing how much growing I have done. You will be pleased, Professor. This idea is good!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Who knows where each of us will be in five years' time...or who we will become. Still, I have faith that all of us will gather and celebrate our reunion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|That's assuming the professor is still here in five years...and not enjoying a cozy early retirement.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Even if that's the case, you will come, won't you? Whether or not you're still teaching here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I will try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Don't forget, my teacher. Even if the millennium festival should be canceled, I promise to return here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|This is the only ball of the year, and I see why. Everyone is absurdly excited...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Your Highness, you sound so detached. We are all encouraged to enjoy the ball tomorrow.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Right you are, What a burden...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Huh. I never thought we'd see eye to eye, but I agree. I'd rather be swinging my blade than wasting my time with some girl at a ball.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Felix! Your Highness! You must be joking, right? This is our chance to dance with all of the ladies of the academy to our heart's content. You wish to throw away the best day of the whole year for sword practice? Insanity, I tell you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|I'm pretty excited about the ball, myself. It's not like we get to do things like this very often.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Too true, Ashe. In fact, I'm gonna do you a favor and give you a crash course in chatting up girls. By tomorrow, you'll be an expert!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Actually I'd much prefer if someone could just teach us how to dance...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Don't worry about the dancing part. I can teach you that, easy!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|It's time for the ball! That warrants at least a tiny bit of makeup, don't you think, Ingrid? Just a smidge?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|I...hmm. Maybe. I'll think about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|It's settled! Tomorrow morning we'll meet up in Ingrid's room. Ooh, I can't wait!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Hahaha. You know... There's no telling where life will take us after we leave here. If only we could find a way to come together again, just like this...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|A fine notion, Your Highness. Perhaps five years from now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Five years from now? Ah! That's when Garreg Mach Monastery will be holding the millennium festival.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|By then we'll be addressing Your Highness as Your Majesty instead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|That's right. I suppose we all know it's coming, but by then you'll be far removed from us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Come now. You know me better than that. My title may change, but I won't. And it won't just be me, you know. Five years from now, you'll all have your own stuffy positions to contend with. But as I understand it, the festivities at the millennium festival will be of a scale far beyond anything we've yet seen... In other words, the perfect excuse for us all to return here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Ooh, a reunion? That sounds fun! I wouldn't miss it for the world!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I'd love for you to be there as well, Professor. After all, you're the heart of the Blue Lion House.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'll be there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'll try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Good. Then it's settled. Of course...if something happens and I'm not able to attend, I'm leaving all of the logistics of organizing this reunion to you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You have to attend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|It's true! I'm sure being a king will keep you busy, but it's a bit early to be backing out of your own plans, don't you think?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Yes... I suppose you're right. I'm sorry. You have my word. I will return as well. Count on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|The time has come for the annual ball. But first, an eve of merriment! OK, I'll admit it. The Officers Academy isn't as uptight as I thought.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Ooh, I adore such things! Dancing is the only thing I'm really good at anyway.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|There's a feast tomorrow, isn't there? Isn't there?! Ah, I can't want a moment longer!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Dancing, singing... I'm not good at either of those things.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|So? Dancing is fun! Oh! And remember, you can't dance with the same partner multiple times. It's tradition! That means you have to dance with all of the gentlemen in all of the houses, swapping dance partners as you please...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|How scandalous. I, for one, plan to simply behold the pure essence of dance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|I'll, um.... watch. From a distance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|You can't just watch, Marianne! If a boy asks you to dance, you simply must accept. It's only polite.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|You can ask...anyone? To dance? Gah, whatever should I do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Hahaha! Lucky you, Ignatz! Tomorrow, if only for a day, you may live out your dearest dreams of an exalted existence! As for me, I am surely to be overwhelmed with the propositions of desperate ladies. I will doubtless have little time for partners of my own choosing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Which one of you is dreaming now, Lorenz?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Everyone! Listen up. To no one's surprise, I have a brilliant idea. Teach, you'll want in on this too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What's your idea?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|This may sound impetuous. Perhaps irresponsible. Almost certainly impossible. But we're gonna do it anyway. In exactly five years' time, let's promise to meet again, right here at the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|A reunion? There's usually food at reunions. Count me in, Claude!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Five years from now... will be the monastery's millennium festival, celebrating 1,000 years since the founding of Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|I hear the millennium festival will be the largest celebration in the monastery's history.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Oh, I get it! It'll be easier for us to all get back here with the millennium festival as an excuse.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|How true. As the new leader of the Alliance, I will certainly have the occasion to attend and pay my respects to Lady Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|That almost certainly will not transpire.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|And you, Teach? I guess it's hard to imagine that you'll still be teaching here five years from now... But I'm sure no matter where you end up, you'll come running at the chance to see your adorable little Golden Deer again, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Who knew Teach had a heart of ice? Too bad I can see from a mile away that you're joking. How you really feel is written all over your face.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Probably so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Ahem... That was your cue to promise everyone you'll return. Go on, set a good example, Teach. If you promise, everyone else will, too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Hahaha! I'm already excited! After five years, we'll all be whoever we're going to become!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Please, Professor! Invite Captain Jeralt too! I want to show him how well his apprentice turns out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|It's settled, then. What do you say, Claude? Is it official?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|The promise is sealed! That means we're all obligated to keep it. Five years from today, all of us will meet again at the monastery. Don't forget it, Teach. You and I will meet here again...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Running away? I understand. You hardly had the time to breathe in there. It must be hard to be the favorite teacher at the ball! Poor, poor Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I am not everyone's favorite...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Was that a joke? I find it hard to tell with you. Just think of all the students begging you to dance!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It is difficult.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|So you do think you're the favorite! I might have known.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|But where is there to run? This place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Ah... I see. The Goddess Tower waits for you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Ah, here you are. Are you waiting for someone?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm not waiting for anyone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Good. I would not wish to interrupt anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I was waiting for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard| For me? Well, you should have summoned me earlier. Regardless, here I am.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Has something happened?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|No, nothing in particular. In fact, that's why I came here. This place, the Goddess Tower... It was special to my parents. My father attended the Officers Academy himself. A few years after graduating, he was crowned emperor. One day, during a visit to the monastery, he snuck into the Goddess Tower on a nostalgic whim. And there she was, my mother. She had just enrolled in the academy that very year. They were instantly drawn to each other. Love at first sight, you could say. It was the first time either had truly been in love... or so the story goes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Their first love?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Yes. Of course, as emperor, my father had already married for political reasons. As the Empire demands many heirs, he also had numerous other lovers. In the end, my mother settled for becoming one of his many consorts. But I choose to believe there was genuine love between them. Heh, I suppose it's a silly story to cling to.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It's a lovely story.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Isn't it? It's a shame that the lovely stories ended after I was born. For as long as I can remember, my mother had already been exiled from the capital. It's strange. Something about you makes me reveal all of the things I so carefully keep concealed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Who was your first true love?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Hmmm. For some reason, I feel compelled to tell you all of these things I have kept hidden. I can't say the name, but it was a noble who I met in the Kingdom, a lifetime ago.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Anyway... What about you? It's your turn to reveal some long-held secret! You can share a story about your past...or perhaps tell me about your first love.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I have no such stories|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|You're telling the truth. I can tell. Hm... I wasn't even able to make you blush.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Please don't ask that of me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|You realize that just makes me more curious than ever!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Sorry...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Heh... No, I'm the one who should apologize. It wasn't my intention to pry. I'm just intrigued by you and your mysterious past. You have supposedly always been a mercenary, but I believe there is more to your story than that... Let's leave it there for today and return to the ball. There must be plenty of students hoping to talk with you...and to dance with you. I would not wish to prevent you from mingling. I cannot keep you all to myself, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|Here for a tryst, Professor? I won’t interfere. I shall take my leave at once. Farewell.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Just a moment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|Yes, what is it? I assume you are waiting on someone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What do you mean, a tryst?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|You have arranged to meet someone here at the Goddess Tower, have you not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|No, not at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|I see. Apologies for the misunderstanding. Then I take it you are unfamiliar with the rumors about this place?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What rumors?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|There is an old legend that says promises made between lovers here are sure to be fulfilled. If you believe in that sort of thing. I would have expected you to be familiar with the story already, considering how popular you are. I was certain that someone had asked you here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I am not that popular.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|On the contrary, I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That is not the case.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|No need to sound so dejected. I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|But thanks to their cowardice, I am gifted with this opportunity to speak with you. It’s clear you have never felt at ease around me, as a result of how little trust there is between us. I should get back to the ball, regardless. I imagine there would be quite a scene if you turned out to be lying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You don’t believe me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hubert|Trust is not in my nature. Good night.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Hello, Professor. I just needed a quick break from the festivities. Fancy running into you here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You followed me, didn't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|I beg your pardon?! Absolutely not! It is simply a coincidence. The heir to the great house of Aegir, chasing after a woman in the dead of night! The very thought of it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What a nice coincidence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Yes, a coincidence...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Anyway, seeing you here, I cannot help but recall the legend of the Goddess Tower. It is said that when a man and a woman meet here by chance on the night of the ball, their paths become one. The goddess blesses them and ensures a harmonious union.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I heard it differently.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Oh, you heard the legend too? How was it different? That the goddess is sure to grant any promises made here? Ah, perhaps that is how it goes, come to think of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Are you sure that's the legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Indeed, that is how it goes. Or at least, that is the version I heard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|How long have we known each other now? About nine months, by my count. The passage of time is swift indeed. Listen. I need to tell you something. After I graduate, I must pass stern judgement on my father. His greed got the better of him. He has strayed far from the righteous path. As the next Duke Aegir, I will succeed him as prime minister, and it will fall to me to hold him accountable. Only then can I justly guide the Empire's subjects and work to create a better world. That is my dream, my will, and my future. I pray that I will have the courage to fulfill my solemn duty and that I will have your support.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Of course. I'm with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm always happy to listen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ferdinand|Thank you. Knowing that you are on my side, I feel unstoppable. Well, shall we head back? Plenty of people must be wonder where you went. Specifically the legions of men who would like to dance with you! To be honest, I count myself among them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Professor, you're late.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|To tell the truth, it was an act of sheer hope that I might find you here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|We didn't have plans to meet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|True, but a young man can hope to accidentally bump into someone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Oh, sorry!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|My apologies, Professor. It was a bit of a joke. I’ve been waiting here because I thought you might come by.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I'm glad to find I was right. I hoped to find you so I might ask... Well, I would very much like to research your Crest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Not right now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Does that mean you might be interested eventually? Let's decide the place and time right now, then. What? Is that not acceptable?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why would I let you do that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Because it would be terribly interesting?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Anyway... Have you heard the legend of this place, Professor? It's a sentimental one to be sure. The story goes that if two people share a vow at the Goddess Tower, they'll be bound together forever. Hm, or was it that they'll be cursed forever? One or the other for certain. All the same, I think it's a rather lovely legend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It doesn't sound that lovely to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Tell me more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Well, I suppose it does depend on your enjoyment of potentially mistranslated myths. Professor, be warned. This may seem forward of me… However, let's vow that one day I will be allowed to research your Crest as much as I please.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I think not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Excuse me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I've overstepped my bounds again, haven't I? It's just that today is such a special day and, well, I suppose I got caught up in all the excitement. How about this instead? Let's agree to meet here again one day, just the two of us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|If the opportunity arises.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|Such an opportunity won't just arise, we have to make it happen for ourselves. I look forward to that day.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I agree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Linhardt|I look forward to that day. I really do…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Hey, Professor! I was looking all over for you. What are you doing up here? I think this place is supposed to be off-limits...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I didn't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Well, that's the official rule. I don't think anyone follows it though.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|If it's only supposed to be...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Heh! Good point. No one follows that rule anyway, and I heard no one from the monastery really cares.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Where did you hear that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Huh. I can't remember her name. It was just some girl who started talking to me last night. She was trying to get me to leave the ball tonight and go to the Goddess Tower with her. She wouldn't say what she wanted to do here though. Said it was a secret or something. I told her I'd be too busy dancing and stuffing my face with food, so she left. Don't know why, but she didn't seem too happy about it. I guess I was curious though, so I came to check it out. That's when I saw you walking this way, so I followed you in.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That's just awful.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Isn't it? She wouldn't explain herself and she got angry!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I was referring to you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I can't help but feel sympathetic.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|I appreciate that, but I'm not really looking for sympathy. I just wish she would've explained herself before getting all angry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|My sympathy was not for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Huh? Why? Well, it's all over now. Can't change what's in the past.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I like your positive attitude.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Thanks! I had a feeling you'd get it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Maybe you should worry about the past a little.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Ugh. Really? I just don't like to dwell... But if you say so, I could keep it in mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Anyway, I'm going to head back to the ball. You coming? Doesn't look like there's anything too exciting going on here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Let's head back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Maybe coming to the tower wasn't a total waste of time. I got to talk to you at least, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm going to stay.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|All right. Don't stay too long though. You might catch cold.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Caspar|Welp, I'm starting to get hungry again. Time to fill up on some more food!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta| Ah! Wh-what's that?! Ghost?! Is it a ghost?! Don't eat me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Calm down, it's OK.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|It'll eat the skin right off my bones and no one will ever— Huh? Oh, it's you, Professor. What a relief.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It's just your professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|I knew it! I said, Bernie, this place is haunted, you'll just get eaten by the ghost of some dusty old professor or— Oh. Oh, it's you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You can relax now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Right. I'm better now. Thanks. But try not to scare me like that again, please... With the ball happening tonight, I was sure there wouldn't be anyone here. And from far off, you look... Well, you kinda have a spooky silhouette. I guess you haven't heard the legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Oh, so if a couple swears a vow on the night of the ball, the goddess grants their wish? That's amazing! Is it true? I guess that's the sort of thing you miss when you spend all your time avoiding people. But wouldn't it be nice to spend some time alone with a nice guy in this lonely tower, cut off from all the rest of the world? Anyway… Oh, Professor! Since you're here and all, could I ask you for a favor? As you probably know by now, it's my lifelong dream to live in solitude forever… So could you help me to swear that vow?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Nice try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Saw right through me, huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I can't promise that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Guess you're right. It probably wouldn't work out so well for me, would it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Bernadetta|Ah, well. No use complaining. Actually, I'm happy I got to see you here tonight. Even if it was just by coincidence. Would you mind staying a little longer? It's nice and quiet, and the sky's really pretty. I quite like the atmosphere. On a night like this, being out in the open doesn't seem so bad…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Ah, Professor! You showed up!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why are you here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Um, I'm the one who called you here, remember?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why do you look so happy?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Well, because you're here, of course!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|You came here because you read the letter I sent you, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Not that I recall…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What letter?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Are you saying this is...a coincidence? How disappointing to think you didn't come here specifically to see me. Still, if we're meeting by complete chance... that has a certain appeal too. It's as if destiny brought us together! And tonight is the night of the ball... Lucky me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What are you plotting?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Plotting? That's a bit rude, don't you think?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I thought you weren't comfortable around me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Oh, that's just when you're looking through me in front of others. When it's just us...I kind of like it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Originally, I wanted to see what you'd do when you read my letter. I just wanted to see if you'd come here like I asked. I had a feeling that you would. Though, I suppose you didn't even read the letter to begin with… I should just be thankful I wasn't left here waiting. All alone. Forever. Do you know it's been almost nine whole moons since you arrived at Garreg Mach? You must have found a special someone by now, haven't you, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I have.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Ooh? Who could it be? You've made me so curious. Oh, don't worry. I'm not going to pry if you don't want to share. Your private life is private, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I have not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Uh-huh, right. I bet you're just hiding it. There's someone you're sweet on… Don't you worry, I won't pry if you don't want to share. These things are private, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Is that what you wanted to talk about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Are you changing the subject? Don't do that. Ohh, I bet that means you do have someone, don't you? Don't you worry, I won't pry if you don't want to share. These things are private, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dorothea|Well, I oughta get going… I wouldn't want to be in the way if your special someone shows up. Either way, I do hope you'll share a dance with me later.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Professor, what is bringing you here? Is the ball not enjoyable?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I had to escape.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Escape? I thought the ball was for dancing, not fighting... Oh! Escape! Meaning...to leave. I have understanding.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I wanted to see you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|But you are seeing me every day. Why would you be wanting to see me now? Maybe you and I share a reason for being here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm lost.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Lost? But this monastery is where our home is... I am not understanding.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|I have been hearing about a legend. About the Goddess Tower. People have a belief that the goddess watches this place on this night. If you share a promise, the goddess will make that promise become true. That makes men and women who are close come to this place. On this night. I am wanting to see that, and so I came to observe. With secrecy. But no one is here. I have much disappointment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I wanted to see that too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Someone might arrive still. We could go find a hiding spot for both of us. We may have to be squished with each other, but I will not be worried if you are not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You shouldn't spy on people.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Yes, that has truth. I will be thinking about that from now on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Oh! I have a realization! If someone sees us here with each other, they will think that we are with each other! That is not accepting...acceptable for people to misunderstand!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That could be a problem.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|We should be returning to the ball, separately.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I wouldn't mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Petra|Is that OK, Professor? I think we are agreeing on that. Maybe we should be returning to the ball... with each other.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|It's quiet here, isn't it, Professor? That reminds me. Do you know the legend associated with the Goddess Tower?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I've heard it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Is that right? You don't strike me as the sort to enjoy stories like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm not concerned with such things.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Just as expected.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|They say that wishes made in this tower will come true. I wonder who came up with such a silly notion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You don't believe it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Legends are legends, nothing more. I doubt there are many who really believe that wishes can be granted. The goddess just watches over us from above... That is all. No matter how hard someone begs to be saved, she would never so much as offer her hand. And even if she did, we lack the means to reach out and grasp it. That's how I feel about her. In any case... I suppose there's no harm in passing the time with silly legends. What do you say, Professor? Care to make a wish? We are here on the night of the ball. Why don't you try wishing for something?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|After you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I can't think of anything, so go ahead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|A wish of my own... I suppose my wish...is for a world in which no one would ever be unjustly taken from us. Or...something along those lines.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That's a great wish.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'll wish for the same.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Thank you, Professor. Although, at a time like this... Perhaps it would make more sense for me to wish that we'll be together forever. What do you think?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|… Haha! Well now, Professor! You must admit I've improved in the art of joke telling.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That's cruel.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It didn't sound like a joke.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I'm sorry... I guess that was rather thoughtless of me. … Honestly... I do regret saying such a thing. Please think nothing of it. I've blurted out irresponsible things like that to my classmates. Promises that we'll see each other again and the like. I have no business making such promises for the future. There are certain things that I must accomplish, even if it means risking my life. I may not even have a future to promise to someone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|We should head back soon. It's rude of me to keep you all to myself. Shall we, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|What are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I could ask you the same.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I needed some quiet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|I felt similarly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Though I elected to attend this ball, I did not know what to do with myself once there. I do not wish to be a nuisance to His Highness or to my classmates. Thus, I have sought solitude. I noticed a number of people looking for you, however. Should you not return to the festivities?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I’d like to stay here a bit longer.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Not just yet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|As you wish.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|The stars seem brighter here, somehow. I have heard the goddess of Fódlan grants a special blessing at this tower. The blessing ensures that any oath sworn between man and woman here shall be fulfilled. That is what I have heard. We had similar legends in Duscur. Some elements of human culture are universal, I suppose. Is there an oath you would like to swear?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Not that I can think of.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|I understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I swear to work toward peace for Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|I am not sure that a full and lasting peace is possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|But while I have this opportunity, permit me to swear an oath to you. I swear that we will look upon these same stars again, when His Highness has led us to a more tranquil age.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That is a worthy oath.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I look forward to it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Good. There is a chill in the air, is there not? I am accustomed to cold weather. But you should go back indoors.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Let’s go back together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|If you wish. I suppose the damage to your reputation for being seen with me has already been done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Will you share a dance with me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|I do not know how to dance. If you wish to teach me, then I will endeavor to learn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dedue|Let us return. If the cold is too much, I will lend you my coat.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Oh, look who it is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|I just wanted some quiet. It's so loud, I needed a little respite.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Are you waiting for someone?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|No. I just wanted a bit of quiet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Besides, what are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I thought I might find you here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Huh? You must be joking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm here for the same reason as you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Ah. Well, I guess it figures.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|Hm. Have you heard the legend of the Goddess Tower? That if you make a pledge, it will be fulfilled? Childish, I know. But if it were true... Let's make a pledge to the goddess. I pledge that someday, I will surpass you. I'll surpass your technique, your skill with the sword, and your cunning as a warrior. Then I will make you taste defeat!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That seems extreme.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That's your pledge to the goddess?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|What a disappointment. If you're looking for a passionate affair, you've got the wrong man. Go find someone else. I've spent my life avoiding love and romance. They're distractions. Blades, blood, and battle. That's what I'm made of and nothing else. If someone saw us, however, this may look like an amorous meeting. You'll have to settle for being mistaken as my lover.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That's mean.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What nonsense.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Felix|It's time I went back to training. I'll always be more comfortable holding a sword than a woman's hand. Try not to catch a cold up here. I'd hate for such a good sparring partner to be out of commission. Good-bye.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Professor! Did you come up here for a rest too?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That’s right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|I guess we think along the same lines. I was feeling kind of worn out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Actually, I was looking for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|For me? Oh! I’m so sorry to put you out of your way! I was just kind of worn out from all of the excitement. I am enjoying the ball, but it’s a bit much, you know?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Everyone else seems used to this kind of thing, but I’ve never been to anything like it before. My friends did teach me a bit about proper manners and how to dance, but I still feel out of place. Stepping on girls’ feet, messing up the pretty floral decorations… Haha, I’ve been a bit of a disaster. Sometimes I wonder if it’s even right for someone like me to be in a place like this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I feel that way sometimes too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Really? You do? That’s kind of reassuring!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You have every right to be here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|You're right, of course. I'm a student at the Officers Academy, just like everyone else. Lonato was kind enough to send me here. I need to live up to his expectations.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|By the way, have you heard the stories about the Goddess Tower? They say that if a man and a woman make a wish together here, the goddess will make it come true.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What would you wish for?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Oh, never mind me. I'd like to know what you'd wish for!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Let’s make a wish together, then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|My thoughts exactly! Do you have anything in particular you’d like to wish for?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|My wish is…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Your wish is?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|For your wish to come true, Ashe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|What? My wish? W-well, um...let me think.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I can’t think of anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Well, if you can't come up with anything, maybe I should think of a wish instead?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|All right, I’ve got it. I wish for my brother and sister back home to be able to live out their lives in peace.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That’s just like you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That’s a lovely wish.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|This kind of thing is pretty embarrassing, huh? Maybe I should be heading back. I’ll never get better at fancy social events like this if I keep running away from them, right? I guess I should ask another girl to dance. Oh, but I’d better make sure I go over the steps again first.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You could dance with me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ashe|Really? You’d do that? Wow, that’d be great! Just promise not to laugh if I mess it up, OK? Come on. Let’s head back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Evening, Professor. Lovely night, isn’t it? Just look at those stars… I heard you were headed over to the Goddess Tower, and I got curious about who you might be meeting. But here you are all by yourself. This isn’t a lover’s tryst at all! Heh heh…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Tryst?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Oh, yeah. The Goddess Tower is where lovers meet. Didn’t anybody tell you? They say that if you exchange vows here, they always come true. It’s a sacred place for lovers.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why are you here alone?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Where is your lover?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Well, the person I’m interested in...is already here. You’re here alone. I’m here alone. I was thinking maybe…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Wait. Me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Well, of course! We’re the only two people here, aren’t we? I keep thinking about it, and it just makes sense. My Crest and yours…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That’s too much, too soon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Marry you? I can’t even trust you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Heh, OK. True, true. You know, I’ve never regretted any of my past behavior...until you turned me down just now. I can’t be who I’ve been my whole life. I gotta get it together and become a man you can trust. I know that sounds like another one of my games, but it’s true. I’ll prove it to you. Anyway, I’m going to head back to the ball. Since we’re both here, would you accompany me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I’ll go back with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Well then, my lady, I do hope you’ll give me the honor of a dance. It will be good practice for our first dance at our wedding reception. Heh heh—I’m kidding!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I’m going to stay here for awhile.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|It's chilly out tonight, so take care not to catch cold. And if you do get cold, you know where to find me. Sorry. Old habits die hard, I guess... OK. Well, I'm headed inside.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sylvain|Anyway… Let’s get going before you change your mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Why, Professor! I was wondering where you ran off to. I searched the entire floor but couldn't find you anywhere. Tired, are we? I can tell by that look on your face. It must be exhausting being so popular, huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm exhausted...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|I can imagine. Shall we take a break here, then? Say, Professor. Have you heard the legend of the Goddess Tower? They say that if two people exchange a vow here, the goddess herself will fulfill it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I've never heard that before.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Well, that simply won't do. You'll fall behind if you can't keep up with your students!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I think I recall such a story.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Ah, so even you have heard that one. The stories must travel far.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Many young couples come here in private, all thanks to that legend. They make promises to stay together forever. Things like that. I actually saw a man invite a lady to join him at the tower while on my way here. It's rather romantic, don't you think?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I think so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Indeed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I disagree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Really? You're a strange one, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Though, just because two people share a promise, that doesn't guarantee they'll be together forever. You've noticed many nobles at the academy, right? They very rarely have the freedom to choose their own partners. Yet still they wish to stay together. Maybe that's why they pray to the goddess. Are you waiting on anyone, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|No, there's no one.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|What a relief. I was afraid that I was keeping you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I was waiting for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Oh my. Even though we didn't make plans to meet? You're a charmer, aren't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Mercedes|Ah! I almost forgot why I came looking for you! I was wondering if you'd like to dance with me. It's just so loud in the reception hall though. I think I'd rather stay here with you... If that's all right with you, Professor. Thank you. I appreciate it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Professor! I'm happy to see you here. Everybody's been asking about you. You're really popular with the students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I had to escape.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm worn out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Oh, really? Huh. Uh, actually, I've been trying to find you too. But if you're not interested in dancing, that's OK. We are supposed to be at a ball thought... If you're not going to dance tonight, when and where will you get another chance?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Wait...really? There isn't any music... But this is too special to pass up! Maybe...I could sing a little something. I may not look like it, but I'm a practiced singer. Though...people do tend to think my lyrics are a little odd. ♪ Fry the food, it tastes so good... It fills up our hungry tummies... ♪|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Now I'm hungry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What an interesting song.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|It's about this yummy stew one of the monks taught me to make a while back. Oh, I know! I'll make it for you! It really is just about the tastiest thing in the world. Um... If I'm bothering you, please tell me now and I'll leave you alone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Say, Professor... Did you know that if you make a wish here at the Goddess Tower, it will for sure come true? That's why people usually meet up with someone they like here. For a rendezvous! And they make a wish that they'll stay together forever. So... Uh, I thought you might be waiting for a girl here. And that I'm messing it up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I've never heard about that tradition.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Nothing of the sort.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Hehe, that's just what I'd expect you to say! But since we're already here, let's go ahead and made a wish together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What kind of wish?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|I've already decided what it will be. Dearest Goddess... I wish for the professor and I to always be the best of friends! How's that sound? Can we wish for that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'd be happy to.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Really? That makes me so happy!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It's a little embarrassing...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Oh no! Actually, when I said it aloud, I could tell it was an embarrassing wish... Oops!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Annette|Well, I'd better be going now, and you should think about returning to the ball too. But make sure you save me a dance!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Whew, I can't manage one more bite. So full... So full!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Oh! Professor! What do you think you're doing here?! I came here to stuff my fa—I mean to have some ME time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I sort of followed you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|You mean you saw that just now? All the food? Everything?! Ugh, so embarrassing... Maybe there's a nearby rock I can crawl under.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|No reason, really.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Oh, so we're just running into one another by chance, then. Phew. If you had followed me here, I'd be a little...bothered. And probably embarrassed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Were you waiting for someone?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Who, me? No, no, of course not. I was just about to walk off all that food I just ate. Really, I came here to have some privacy. But you're here now, so I suppose that makes it a bit less private.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Are you worried people may get the wrong idea?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|I suppose there's that possibility, now that you mention it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Just the two of us...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Uh...well, yes. I suppose it's just us here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Does that concern you too, Professor? I'm happy to return to the reception hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It's not terribly concerning, really.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|Of course. Nothing to see here! I'm happy to keep walking off this food, in that case. Ah, the stars certainly are beautiful tonight, hm? It's peaceful, looking up at them together, don't you think? Maybe we can do it again sometime.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'd love to come along.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ingrid|If we return from here together, I worry that people would start unsavory rumors about us. I don't concern myself with gossip, but I'd hate for it to mar your reputation in any way. Are you certain? Fair enough. Let's head back, then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Oh. Hey, Teach. What brings you to the Goddess Tower? You know what, never mind. The answer is as clear as day. You couldn't bear the ball anymore and simply had to escape.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I wouldn't say that...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I just needed a break.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|There's nothing wrong with admitting you're not comfortable in a noisy crowd. Really, I get it. I'm the same way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I don't believe it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Ha! See right through me, do you? But I really do mean it. Parties aren't for me. Music and fun are all well and good, but those dances the nobles do are...something else. I was never really taught to do that sort of thing. My upbringing was...lacking in certain ways.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Even though you're from a noble family?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Even though you're heir to the Alliance?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Even so. I may have secured a fancy new title, but who I am on the inside... Well, status alone can't change that. That's a bit of an aside, though. Say, Teach... have you heard the legends about this tower? They say if a man and a woman pray for the same thing here, on this night, the goddess will grant their wish without fail.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why tonight?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Who knows? Maybe it has something to do with celebrating the anniversary of the monastery's completion. Maybe the goddess comes down from above on this night and this night alone to celebrate with us. Even goddesses like to party, right? The truth is that it's just a legend the students here like to tell. It's not based on any real facts. But I suppose it would be a waste to pass up a chance of having our wish granted. What do you say, Teach? Care to try?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What would we pray for?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Hm... Let's see... How about we pray for our ambitions to come true? You don't exactly seem like the selfish type, but even you must have an ambition or two.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I do not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|More of a hope...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Even if you're not aware of it, I'm sure there's something your heart of hearts wishes for.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|No one is ever completely satisfied. Everyone has something they long for. Otherwise, what's the point of it all? Of course, same goes for me. Without even realizing it, I found myself holding tight to some pretty big ambitions. If you would... I would love for you to share in those ambitions with me, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|But all that aside, let's get started. Let's pray to the goddess before she tuckers out for the evening. OK... Here goes. Oh, divine Goddess! Hear our prayers! We beseech you and your radiance! Please, grant us that which we seek!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|Huh. I think that should do it. The goddess'll make our dreams come true now, yeah?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I wonder.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|At any rate, we've done all we can. Whether we actually believe our dreams will come true or not is up to us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Claude|I suppose we should head back soon. I'm sure everyone is looking for you. Just promise to spare a dance for me. OK, Teach? I swear, so long as it's not one of those goofy noble dances, I am a treasure on the dance floor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Ah. There you are, Professor. I didn’t see you at the ball. I was wondering where you’d slipped off to. Everyone is waiting for you. Shouldn’t you be heading back?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Momentarily.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|No, I’d like to stay here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Well, there’s no need to hurry. The ball will continue a while longer. Was the noise becoming too much? It must be difficult, if you are unaccustomed to high society. I say that, but I’m actually the same. After a while of excitement, I yearn for peace and quiet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Did someone turn you down?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Professor! Rude! Just what do you think of me? There are definitely students in there making the most of things. Flirting as if their very lives depended on it. But for a catch such as myself, every day is an opportunity. There’s no need to appear desperate. Still, it’s unexpected that the two of us would be here together, isn’t it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why is that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Do you not know the legend of this place? The goddess is said to grant a special kind of blessing, unique to the day of this ball. It is said that on this day she will honor any vow sworn between man and woman here at this tower. It’s a famous legend amongst the students, which may be why I expected to find more of them here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|So, you came here to spy on people?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|Of course not! I would never stoop to such despicable behavior! Honestly, I forgot all about the legend until now. I’m not interested in that sort of foolishness. Though I suppose it couldn’t hurt to test it. Even if it is only a legend. What do you say, Professor? Shall we swear some sort of vow together? Something that will benefit the both of us. What dream should we promise to make a reality?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Peace for all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Happiness for the two of us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lorenz|That’s very fitting. I will remember that we made this vow here today. Well, I should head back. Lest, by my absence, the festivities lose their luster.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael| Omm… Mmm… Mmm… Huh? Who’s there?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|P-Professor! Is the ball over already? What, uh… What are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Just taking a break.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Ah, a break. Sure, sure. That's uh... That's what I'm doing too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I heard a strange noise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Strange noise? No need to worry! I’ll, uh… I’ll look into it for you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Huh. I suddenly have the energy to dance! Maybe I’ll head back to the ball.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What were you eating?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Ah! You noticed. It was just some meat. It was a much nicer cut than I’m used to. We all got one helping, but some people didn’t want theirs! Can you believe it? I hate to see good food go to waste. I’m sorry, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You should be.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You need to follow the rules.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|You’re right. I know… Oh! By the way! I heard something on my way here. I heard that if two people make a wish together in this tower, on this night, the goddess will grant it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Two people?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|I don’t know the specifics, just that you can’t do it alone. There has to be two of you. Since we’re both here now, let’s make a wish together! What should we wish for? More delicious cuts of meat?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|No? Then how about bigger muscles?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|What else is there to wish for? Hm! Me becoming a proper knight? But that’s just for me, not you…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|We can wish for that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|We can? Professor! That’s so generous of you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Now that we wished for it, I’m sure I’ll become a proper knight!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Let’s wish for peace in Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|Peace in Fódlan? That's a good wish too!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Raphael|I really hope our wish comes true.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Gah! Is that you, Goddess?! Professor! Ah. I’m sorry, I thought you were the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That’s ridiculous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|You’re right, you’re right. Imagine, if she just appeared out of nowhere! Do you know of that old legend, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Old legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Yes. It’s said that if a man and a woman make a vow tonight at the Goddess Tower… She will appear before them and bless them, ensuring that vow’s fulfillment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Ridiculous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|I know, but can you imagine if she just appeared out of nowhere? Still… Maybe, even if we can’t see her, we can sense her presence. I envision the goddess as the most beautiful creature in the world… More beautiful than any landscape, any artwork. Utterly beyond compare. That’s what I think anyway. Or perhaps, what I hope. Since I first heard that legend, I’ve wanted to try it and perhaps meet the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|But if the legend’s true…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Yes, I know what you’re getting at. She would never appear before a single person. Frankly, I didn’t know any girls well enough to invite them here. So I was hoping a couple would come along, and I could sneak a peek… Wait! That came out wrong! I take that back. I have absolutely no intention of peeking!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Shall we make a vow?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|What? You and...me? I suppose we do fit the criteria, but are you certain you would want to do that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|In that case, let’s try it! What should our vow be? Please, pick whatever sounds best to you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Peace for Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Happiness for all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|May you live your life honestly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Oh? Oh! I see! Yes, that's a wonderful vow.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Now, let us pray.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|Did you feel that?! I think the goddess is near!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Still ridiculous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Ignatz|You’re right, of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Yes?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|I saw you wandering off to this tower. I thought you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Actually, I'm a ghost.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Don't toy with me like that, Professor! I know it's you. I figured you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Everyone seems to be looking for you. You're surprisingly popular.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|That surprises you, does it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|I do find it surprising, yes. Particularly your popularity with the ladies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Naturally.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Despite your confidence, I'm still surprised by your popularity with the ladies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|It isn't like you're very sociable, after all. Not to be rude, mind you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|How do you fare in such matters?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Er, I wouldn't know, to be honest. I have no interest in such things. The academy is for honing one's skills. Not for frivolous romances, despite what the other students may think. I overheard them gossiping about a place where a man and a woman can make a vow, and it is certain it will come to pass. Seems to be some folktale they enjoy. I wonder where this place is...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|The Goddess Tower?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Oh, of course! I recall now. It's— Wait. That's... That's here, isn't it?! Uh, just to be clear, this is pure coincidence. I didn't follow you for...for that. But we are here alone, so people may wonder what our aim is. Let's get out of here before someone sees us and gets the wrong idea!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|There's no need for panic.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Are you saying you don't mind if someone sees us and thinks… Oh, I suppose you believe there's no danger of that, since it's just me. You're treating me like a child, aren't you? Well, I don't mind either, then. Obviously there's nothing going on here. If you're going stick to around until we collect dust, then so will I!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Lysithea|Actually, I'm gonna go now. Don't you stay too long either! You'll catch your death of cold out here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Please be patient! I'll be done with my prayer in a moment... Dear Goddess, I beg thee… Oh! Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Is someone else here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|No... I'm the only one here. Umm… Well, more accurately, I'm the only human present. My bird friend is here as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You're talking to a bird?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|No! Well. It's more like the bird is...doing me a favor. They say if a man and a woman pray here, on this night, their wish will come true. At least, that's how the legend goes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|And the bird?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|It's a pigeon. A...male pigeon. At least, I think so. I thought he might count as a man.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Well, I'd better be leaving. It seems my pigeon friend got impatient and flew away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm sorry...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|No, it's fine. The goddess probably wouldn't accept a male pigeon anyway.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'll take his place.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Oh? Um. Are you saying you'll pray with me, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Thank you! If you have a wish for the future, let's pray for it, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What is your wish?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Who, me? Oh, nothing in particular. Let's pray for your wish. There must be something you want. Well?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Peace in Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Very well. Let us pray.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Only to see you smile.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Hey, no need to tease me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Marianne|Professor? I must be going now, but...I'm glad I ran into you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Professor! You're not waiting for anyone, right? Thought so! I bet you've never heard the legend about this tower then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I haven't...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Something special happens here during the Ethereal Moon, on the night of the ball. First, an unmarried boy and girl need to meet at the Goddess Tower and make a vow. Then, the goddess will grant them divine protection, and ensure that their vow comes true. Or so they say! It's a well-known story among the students. A couple guys invited me up here, but...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You turned them down?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Yes, I did.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|They stood you up?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|No! How rude. I turned them down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|If I accepted their invitations, then our vow would come true. It's just a legend, sure...but I prefer to be cautious about such things. One of the guys was pretty handsome, and he came from a good family... But that doesn't really tell you what a person's like on the inside. I want a life partner who's good-hearted and good-looking. Anyway, I went for a walk and happened upon you, and I thought... The professor's perfect. Why don't I just make a vow with him? Hah! I'm just kidding, Professor. To be honest, I wanted to spy on you. See if you had someone else up here. Although, if you did want to make a vow with me, I wouldn't object. Need some time to consider?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Yes. Let's revisit this tomorrow morning.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Hilda|Hang on! It won't mean anything tomorrow! Oh, I get it! Everyone's looking for you down there, girls included. You don't want to keep them waiting. You're pretty smooth, you know that? Well, I'm off, then. I'll see you at the ball. Ah... Did the goddess hear that conversation?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Hey, Professor. You all alone here? I mean, you're not waiting for anyone or anything, are you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Actually, I'm meeting the archbishop.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Liar. I saw Lady Rhea just moments ago. She was in the reception hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Manuela should be here any moment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Yeah, right! I just passed her flirting with some guy on my way up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Anyway, I saw you heading to the tower, so I thought I'd drop by. I figured you might be lonely.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|You figured that, did you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Hey, don't make it weird! By the way... Have you heard the legend about this place? They say if a guy and a girl make a promise here together, the goddess will make sure it's kept.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I've heard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|It's a pretty well-known legend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I had not heard that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Really? It's a pretty well-known legend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Thing is, the way the story goes, it doesn't work all the time. It has to be the night of the ball. Tonight. So, since it's just you and me here, what do you say we give it a go? I mean, I don't know if the goddess will really take the time for a pair like us, but it's worth a try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What are you suggesting?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Well—you know! Let's make some kind of promise! We've got the chance, it'd be a shame to waste it. I mean, not something romantic or anything. That'd be weird. We could promise I'll become a top-tier mercenary! Though I guess that's more of a wish… Let's see... OK, I've got it. I solemnly swear to meet you once more, on this very ground, as a mercenary beyond compare! Oh, but that was all about me. No fair. You probably have something you want to promise too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|No, I think that covers it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Hah. You really do take after Captain Jeralt—always putting others first. All right, then, Goddess. You heard the promise. It's a done deal. Say, Professor...why did you come out here, anyway?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I just wanted some time alone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Leonie|Ah. Well, it is pretty crowded down there. I guess I shouldn't have interrupted. I'll leave you to it. But don't stay out here too long, all right? You'll catch a cold!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Professor? Is that you over there? It seems both of us were curious about this place.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What are you talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Oh, perhaps I was mistaken. I figured you had come to this tower after having heard the legend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|You've not heard of it, then? I suppose I only recently learned of it myself, from a friend. Legend tells that on the night of a ball, when a man and woman pledge vows at this very tower… The goddess will bestow her blessing, ensuring those vows come to pass. Of course, such things do not really come to pass. But there are many who place stock in this legend. I wondered what sort of vows youths tend to pledge... So here I am, hoping to gain deeper understanding. Only to bump into you! Are you meeting someone here, perchance?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|No, I'm not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|That's unfortunate. I wonder if anyone else will be coming… Professor? If the legend were true, what type of vow might you pledge?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It's hard to say…|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|No ideas? Perhaps your imagination is lacking due to the lack of a partner. What say you to being my partner? How about sharing a vow with me? I'll give you until the count of three to come up with something heartfelt and honorable. One...two...three! Go ahead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|May we always be together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|May we both find joy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Flayn|Oh! You made my heart flutter! I see. This is the type of vow one would make to another. You've taught me well, as a professor should. I'm most certainly wiser and more mature than I was, even just moments ago. Oh dear. What if the goddess really did hear your vow? Although...I suppose I would not mind if that turned out to be the case. I bid you good evening.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Running away? I understand. You hardly had the time to breathe in there. It must be hard to be the favourite teacher at the ball! Poor, poor Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I am not everyone's favorite...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Was that a joke? I find it hard to tell with you. Just think of all the students begging you to dance!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It is difficult.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|So you do think you're the favorite! I might have known.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Professor? What are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Aren't you going to dance with Edelgard?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|No, I should think not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Aren't you going to dance with Claude?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Haha, good one, Professor. I could see saving a dance for Edelgard, but Claude is another story. In any case, I have no intention of dancing with anyone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|As a child, Edelgard taught me how to dance. It was...a bit awkward, honestly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Edelgard?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|As a child?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I've told you before we're siblings by marriage, haven't I? Her birth mother was my stepmother, although I didn't know that at the time. My stepmother treated me with such kindness...just as though I were her own flesh and blood. And yet she never so much as hinted that she had her own child...Edelgard. We were born and raised in different territories, without ever knowing the other even existed. Yet, against all odds, for just over a year, we became childhood friends.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Friends?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Not siblings?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Indeed. Unaware of each other's stations or backgrounds, we met and became incredibly close. This was when she and Lord Arundel were living in the Kingdom.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why were they in the Kingdom?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|They were in exile... This was a time of great turmoil within the Empire. I ran into her when visiting Lord Arundel's residence with my father. She seemed...quite bored. With everything. At first I found her to be difficult and stubborn, but that facade quickly fell away, revealing her true self beneath... That's around the time when she taught me how to dance. Her instruction was... Oh, let's call it strict. To put it nicely.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Edelgard|Wrong foot, Dimitri! You're supposed to lead with your right!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|El, the sun's going down! I really oughta be heading home...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|That one year before she had to return to the Empire was...so much fun. The time of my life, in many ways.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|It's kind of pathetic to think about it all these years later, but can you guess what I gave her as a parting gift?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Flowers?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|A book?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|No, that makes too much sense. Actually, I gave her a dagger! You should have seen the look on her face!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|A dagger?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Huh. Good guess, Professor. But I swear, it came from the heart.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|In Faerghus, we've long considered blades as tools of destiny. As a way to cut a path to a better future. She was being dragged all over, unable to live the life she wanted. I thought the dagger could help her cut out a path to the future she dreamed of. However...that was many years ago. I'm sure she's forgotten all about the boy I was back then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I'm afraid it's far too late for that. Things are different now. She's different. I'm different.  Anyway... I'm feeling a bit out of place here. Festivities like this don't suit me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Professor... Will you join me for a bit? You must be getting a bit tired of the ball by now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|But where is there to run? This place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|It seems that everyone is having a delightful time. Will you not dance some more?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'm tired.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I'd rather not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|How dull of you! Had I a body of my own... Oh, I would sing and dance until I fell upon the ground! But you... Hmph. Do as you will.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Ah, you're not the only one who feels that way. Look over there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Hmph. I'm bored beyond compare. Will you not follow her?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why would I?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I have no reason to.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Oh, come on! Hurry up! I know that you are curious to see what she is up to... I hear...someone singing. From other there...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea| ♪ In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright... On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight... ♪|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|That song... I feel I have heard it in the past... Actually... It is not that I have heard it. I... Did I once sing that song to someone? No. There's more. I wrote this song... Oh, but how could that be so? If that were true, then how could she be singing it? Unless... No, no. I am suddenly so exhausted... As are you, no doubt? Quickly then. To bed with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Captain? Captain! Where are you? Hey, Professor. Have you seen your old man?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Too bad. I guess it will have to be you, then...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|I'm back. Sorry for the delay, my last mission took longer than expected.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Captain! Thank goodness you're here. There are reports of Demonic Beasts near the chapel!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Nonsense. I haven't heard anything about the monastery's walls being breached.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|That's why I'm heading there now, to see what's really going on. You'll join as well, won't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Of course. We're both sworn to protect this place.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Where did they come from?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Demonic Beasts?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|It's odd. Just before they appeared, someone saw a number of students heading toward the chapel. They were apparently acting strange, as though they weren't in their right minds. Shortly after, Demonic Beasts started to appear, one after the other.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Are the students safe?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Were the students killed?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Hm... The students... There's no way those Demonic Beasts got in from the outside... But none of that matters right now. We need to act. Go summon your students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Damn it... I wanted to talk to you about something important, but there's no time. There's never any damn time. But this is much more urgent, so it can hold for now. I'll meet you there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|There really are Demonic Beasts here... They're emerging from the chapel! I'll head that way. The rest of you, protect the students who weren't able to get away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Student|Help me! These beasts... They're...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Student|Argh! Somebody help me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|That beast... There's a stone or something on its forehead...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Monica|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Do you really think you can keep going? Don't push yourself too hard. Thinking about what happened in Remire village, it's clear you've gotten the hang of being a leader. Maybe you should have taken command of me too!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Student|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|The Demonic Beasts were actually students? How can this be...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Student|Thank you! But my friends who couldn't get away... Are they OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Student|I was so scared... I'll find a way to repay you, I promise!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Student|Sorry. That was a close one...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Student|Phew... You saved me. Thank you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|There isn't a trace of evidence to be found in the chapel. This must have been something to do with Remire. Perhaps...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Monica|Wait!|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Huh? Another student?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Run along now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Monica|Thanks for all your help, sir.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Monica|You're just a pathetic old man. How dare you get in the way of my brilliant plan...you dog.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Run along now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Monica|Thanks for all your help, sir.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Monica|Huh? What are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Thales|You must survive. Merely because there is a role that I require you to fulfill.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Sorry. It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|To think that the first time I saw you cry...your tears would be for me. It's sad, and yet...I'm happy for it. Thank you...kid.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|So this is where your father lived... Hm? Are you still crying? If turning back the hands of time was not enough to save his life, you must accept what came to pass was fate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|It wasn't fate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Control yourself. Though Jeralt's death was at the hands of wicked ones, a fate is still a fate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Our enemies will pay.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Agreed. We cannot let the wicked ones run free.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Oh! Your father said to look for something here. He must be referring to whatever is behind that bookcase there...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Your father's diary... Huh, his handwriting is prettier than his face would suggest. Well, well! These entries here are from before your birth. He seems to have been writing this for quite some time. Hm? Ah... Read that part there. Horsebow Moon, Year 1159...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Jeralt|Day 20 of the Horsebow Moon. All is cloudy. I can't believe she's dead. Lady Rhea said she died during childbirth. But is that the truth? And still, the child she traded her life for doesn't make a sound. Didn't even cry at birth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Well now! That baby must be you! That means... Hm? Someone is approaching us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|There you are. Lady Rhea is looking for you, Professor. And after your audience, why don't you join me at the dining hall? You haven't eaten since...since it happened. Have you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Forgive me... I suppose it's too soon to try and coax you back into the normal swing of things. As for what happened to Jeralt... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't do anything to stop it. Stay here until you've found some peace. I'll cover for you with Lady Rhea and everyone else.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Thank you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|We'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready to return to us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|If only.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|No need to put on a brave face. No one would blame you for taking time for yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I don't believe it's a sign of strength to just keep going forward no matter what. Taking the time to grieve for those we've lost...there's strength in that too. That's what I think, anyway. That said... It's also important to remember that no matter how sad you are, eventually your tears will dry up. That's when you have to figure out what it is you're living for. Then you can cling to that, with all your might, and start moving forward again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What I'm living for?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Four years ago, in Duscur, I experienced the same pain you're feeling now. My father...was the strongest man I knew. Someone I loved and admired deeply. That day, he was killed before my eyes. His head severed clean off. My stepmother, the kindest person I had ever known, left me behind and disappeared into the infernal flames.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Everyone who I considered precious...my family and my closest friends...I couldn't save any of them. Not a single one. Now, the burden of the work they left behind falls on me. I must ensure they have no regrets. That's my duty, as the sole survivor of the tragedy. It's a heavy burden, but accepting it gave me the strength to pick myself up off the ground and start moving again. Start living again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|Jeralt is gone... So, what will you do now, Professor? What must you do? Look deep in your heart and I'm certain you'll find the answer there...indelible and inescapable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|I've probably bothered you enough for today, but I have just one more thought to leave you with. Even now, Seteth is gathering the knights to begin a full scale search for the enemy. It may not be right away, but before long they will find their trail.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Dimitri|No matter what happens or what anyone may say, know that I plan to stand by you, Professor. Through anything. Until the bitter end.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|Well? Did you search deep within yourself as he suggested? And did you find yourself some answers? This book is filled with secrets yet unknown. We must return another time to read the rest. Oh, but I have at least figured one thing out. I know now why our fates are intertwined...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Ah... Here you are. To think that Captain... that Jeralt would meet his end like that. I hope you know that you were the most important thing in the world to him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|I was?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|What do you want?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|He wasn't the most emotional guy. I'm sure expressing his affection wouldn't have come naturally to him. After what's happened, it's up to me now. I, Alois, swear to protect you in the captain's stead.  Sorry. This isn't the time for my blathering. Lady Rhea is looking for you. I came to tell you that. I'll take my leave now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Sothis|This book is filled with secrets yet unknown. We must return another time to read the rest. Oh, but I have at least figured one thing out. I know now why our fates are intertwined...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|Professor. I have been waiting for you. I am filled with grief at the loss of our most celebrated knight. Jeralt was an ally of many years...and also a dear friend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Many years?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|When did you meet?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|It was a long while back. At the time, Jeralt was a soldier of the Kingdom. He was injured in battle, and I saved him just as he was about to perish. That was our first meeting. After that, he became a Knight of Seiros. He gave his all to the service of the church.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Why did he leave the knights?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|But it had been so long since you last saw him...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|He...fell in love with one of the nuns here at Garreg Mach. Their love produced a child...whom she died giving birth to. It was her decision. She weighed her own life against that of her child's and, in the end, implored me to save the child. Your father...never truly accepted that decision. He took the child–took you–and disappeared without warning.|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Who was my mother?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Byleth|Did I inherit my Crest from my mother?|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|Your mother...she was my...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Alois|Sorry for the interruption, Lady Rhea. There's something you must hear immediately. A report from the knights patrolling the area...|
FE16WhiteClouds|09-TheCauseOfSorrow|Rhea|Very well. Professor, you are dismissed for the day. Please rest and focus only on mending your heart. Understood?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Mounted Knight|Huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Soldier|Lady Seiros!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Seiros|Tell me, Nemesis, do you recall the Red Canyon?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Seiros|You'll die for that! Die, die! You took...everything... that I loved!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Seiros|He's gone now, Mother...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Oh my. What could have brought you here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|I wonder how you got in here… It is most rude to interrupt a moment of repose. Very rude indeed. Now come to me. I wish to have a look at you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Hmm... I have not seen the likes of you before. Who are you, anyway?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I'm a ghost.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Do not deceive. You would do well to keep your wit in line.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I'm a demon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Do not deceive. You would do well to keep your wit in line.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I'm a mortal.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|I see. Then you must have a name of sorts. Go on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Huh. I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names. You must possess a day of birth as well. Beneath which moon and on what day were you born to this world?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Well, wonders never cease! It seems we share our day of birth. How strange! Hmm. It all feels so...familiar. I think it may be time for yet another nap... It is almost...time to...begin...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Hey. Time to wake up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Were you having that dream again?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I was dreaming about a war...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Massive armies clashing on a vast field, right? There hasn’t been a battle like that in over three centuries…|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I was dreaming about a young girl...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|You’ve described her to me before. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|In any case, just put that out of your mind for now. The battlefield is no place for idle thoughts. Risking your life is part of the job for mercenaries like us. Letting your mind wander is a sure way to get yourself killed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|OK, time to get moving. Our next job is in the Kingdom. I told you before. It’s far from here, so we’ll need to leave at dawn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Oh, right...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Hm? Good grief. Everyone is already waiting for us outside.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Mercenary|Jeralt! Sir! Sorry to barge in, but your presence is needed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|What's happened?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|Please forgive our intrusion. We wouldn’t bother you were the situation not dire.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|What do a bunch of kids like you want at this hour?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|We’re being pursued by a group of bandits. I can only hope that you will be so kind as to lend your support.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Bandits? Here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|It's true. They attacked us while we were at rest in our camp.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|We’ve been separated from our companions and we’re outnumbered. They’re after our lives…not to mention our gold.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|I’m impressed you’re staying so calm considering the situation. I… Wait. That uniform…|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Mercenary|Bandits spotted just outside the village! Damn… There are a lot of them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|I guess they followed you all the way here. We can’t abandon this village now. Come on, let’s move. Hope you’re ready.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Let’s take care of those thieves before they overrun the village. Take down the enemies in front first. That should take the wind out of their sails.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|You have a strange aura about you… You say you’re a mercenary, so show me what you can do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|Thank you. We are in your debt. It wouldn’t do for us to fall in a place like this. Please, lend us your strength. Let’s work together to drive out these thieves!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|It’s because of you guys that I’m not dead right now. Thanks for that! I didn’t expect to run into mercenaries like you in some remote village. The gods of fortune must be smiling on me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|We’ll advance while protecting ourselves from the enemy. Take up position inside the forest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Yes, good. If we’re in the forest, we can sustain their attacks without losing the advantage.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|This is a fine opportunity. Use the combat arts I taught you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Attack when an ally is nearby, and the enemy will be intimidated, making them easier to hit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Kostas|Damn. Why are there mercenaries in the village? Guess we'll have to deal with them too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Kostas|I'm gonna kill you where you stand...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Kostas|What the?! Aren't you Jeralt the Blade Breaker? What's a renowned mercenary like you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|I'm the one who should be complaining. I'm caught up in the mess you started!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Kostas|Hey, you with the blank stare! Outta my way!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Kostas|You'll die!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Honestly! What are you accomplishing with that little stunt?! It’s like you’re trying to get me killed, you fool!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Well, it’s fine. After all, if you don’t know the value of your own life, you’re not going to protect it very well, are you? Course not.  Well then, I guess it’s up to me to guide you from now on, right? You can call me Sothis…but I’m also known as “The Beginning”.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Hmm… Sothis… Yes, that is it. My name is Sothis. And I am also called…The Beginning. But who once called me that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|What are you talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Sothis?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|I was not able to recall my name…until just now. And just like that, it came to me. How odd. That look upon your face… Did you think me a child? A mere child who forgot her own name?! Phooey! That “child” just saved your life! And what does that make you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I am no child.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Ha! Such arrogance. You look the part but are you truly an adult?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I'm less than a child?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Correct! You understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|You threw yourself before an axe to save just one young girl. Yet all is well, as I have stalled the flow of time for now. You would have died had I not intervened.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Thank you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|You stopped time?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Hm. I do not hear your gratitude. Perhaps I should force you to leave?  There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Though it is only momentary, time has stopped. However did I manage that...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|What will happen when time resumes?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|What now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|When time begins again, the axe will tear into your flesh, and you will surely meet your end. How rude of you to drag me into this! Now what to do…|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Turn back the hands of time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Keep time frozen until I'm safe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|That is ridiculous! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I'll just stay here and wait to die.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|As though I could stand idly by and watch that come to pass! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Yes... I do believe it can be done. You really are quite troublesome. I cannot wind back time too far, but all is well. You are aware of what’s to come, which means you can protect yourself this time. Now, go… Yes, you who bears the flames within. Drift through the flow of time to find the answers that you seek…|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|Huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Kostas|You'll die!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|Hey–over here!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Hey... Did you just...|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|The Knights of Seiros are here! We'll cut you down for terrorizing our students. Hey, the thieves are running away! Go after them! The students seem to be unharmed. And...who's this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Ugh... Why him?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Event|An Unexpected Reunion|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|Captain Jeralt?! It is you! Goodness, it’s been ages. Don’t you recognize me? It’s Alois! Your old right-hand man! Well, that’s how I always thought of myself anyway. It must have been 20 years ago that you went missing without a trace. I always knew you were still alive!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|You haven’t changed a bit, Alois. Just as loud as ever. And drop that “captain” nonsense. I’m not your captain anymore. These days I’m just a wandering mercenary. One who has work to do. Good-bye, old friend.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|Right... Good-bye, Captain. Wait! That isn't how this ends. I insist that you return to the monastery with me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Garreg Mach Monastery... I suppose this was inevitable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|And how about you, kid? Are you the captain's child?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|He is a stranger to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I'm a bandit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|That is correct.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|Is that so? Well, physical differences aside, your mannerisms do remind me of the captain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|I'd love for you to see the monastery too. You will join me, won't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|What's troubling you, Captain? You aren't about to run off again, are you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Jeralt|Even I wouldn't dare run from the Knights of Seiros.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|The Knights of Seiros... They do seem rather skilled.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Ah. It seems your presence is required. Get going!|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|I appreciate your help back there. Your skill is beyond question. You’re clearly an experienced mercenary. And your father...that would be Jeralt, the Blade Breaker? Former captain of the Knights of Seiros. Oft praised as the strongest knight to ever live. Have I missed anything?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|The Knights of Seiros?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|You haven’t heard of the Knights of Seiros? The most famous order of knights in all of Fódlan?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|I didn't know he was a captain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|How curious. I’d wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|Hey! You are coming with us to the monastery, right? Of course you are. I’d love to bend your ear as we travel. Oh, I should mention that the three of us are students of the Officers Academy at Garreg Mach Monastery. We were doing some training exercises when those bandits attacked. I definitely got the worst of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|That would be because you ran off.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|Too true! I was the first to make a strategic retreat. Everything would have worked out if these two hadn’t followed me and ruined everything. Because of them, every single one of those bandits chased after us. Utterly ridiculous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|Ah, so that’s what you were thinking, Claude. And here I thought you were acting as a decoy for the sake of us all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|His intentions were as clear as day. You will prove a lacking ruler if you cannot see the truth behind a person's words.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|Hm. You will prove a lacking ruler if you look for deceit behind every word and fail to trust those whom you rely on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|Oh, joy. A royal debate between Their Highnesses. I wonder how being completely predictable affects one’s ability to wield power. Personally, as the embodiment of distrust, I’d say your little exchange smacks of naiveté.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|Me? Naïve? Tell me, are you actually incapable of keeping quiet, or is your lack of self-awareness a condition of some sort?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|In any case, forgive our digression. I must speak with you, if you can spare a moment. The way you held your ground against the bandits’ leader was captivating! You never lost control of the situation. It showed me I still have much to learn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|Your skill is precisely why I must ask you to consider lending your services to the Empire. I might as well tell you now. I am no mere student. I am also the Adrestian Empire’s–|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|Halt, Edelgard. Please allow me to finish my own proposition. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in dire need of exceptional individuals such as yourself. Please, do consider returning to the Kingdom with me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|Whoa, there! You two sure are hasty. Trying to recruit someone you just met. Tactless, really. I was personally planning to develop a deep and lasting friendship on our journey back to the monastery before begging for favors. But it seems there’s no time for niceties in this world. So, capable stranger, let’s get right to it. Where does your allegiance lie?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Hmm. It seems one's place of birth is quite significant to them. Yet they are so impressed by you, that you may take your pick. Well?|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Adrestian Empire: Land of Ancient History|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Edelgard|A wise choice. Though the Empire has fallen from its former glory, the other regions are merely offshoots that pale in comparison.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Holy Kingdom of Faerghus: Land of Noble Knights|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Dimitri|Understood. Faerghus is a noble and distinguished kingdom that has always valued chivalry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Leicester Alliance: Burgeoning League of Nobles|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|Is that right? Well, that’s a win for the Alliance, so I suppose I’m obligated to be happy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Alois|All right, that's enough with the small talk. It's time to head back to the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Claude|Looks like we'll have to pick this up another time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|My, my. They are in such a hurry. You know... Each of the three is most unique.|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Edelgard…|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Dimitri…|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Byleth|Claude…|
FE16WhiteClouds|00-AnInevitableEncounter|Sothis|Yes, I thought the same. I am so sleepy once again... I may be sleeping...but I...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|As I believe you are already aware, Seteth's younger sister, Flayn, has gone missing. At present, all we know for certain is that she has not left Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|Flayn is not the type of person to just wander off on her own without telling me where she is going! We have searched the monastery thoroughly, but have found nothing. I am now mobilizing the knights to begin searching the town. Troubling rumors have been running rampant lately. I do not wish to consider the worst, but...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Troubling rumors?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|What is it you're afraid of?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|There are rumors of someone prowling the streets and attacking innocents, night after night. The knights have investigated the matter. They have not discovered any remains, nor have they found any concrete evidence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|The people are panicked! They all insist someone called the Death Knight is coming to claim their souls with his blade. There is no way she could have escaped unscathed if she were captured by such a fiend! Where is she?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|Seteth, recall that impatience begets error. Please do your best to calm yourself. I think of your...sister as family as well. You know that. You have my support. We will devote ourselves fully–mind, body, and soul–to recovering her.  Professor. Your mission for this month is to help find Flayn. The knights have the town covered, so I ask that you focus your efforts on searching the monastery again. We do not have time to waste. You have your orders.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Flayn has gone missing? Most unsettling.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|It doesn't seem likely that she's simply gotten lost. I'll help in any way that I can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ferdinand|So, our mission this month is to find her? Well then, let us hurry and locate her before anyone else!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Bernadetta|I hope Flayn is OK! What would happen if... Just what would we do if...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dorothea|You can't think like that, Bern. Seteth would have a heart attack if he heard you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Linhardt|I've heard that she has a Crest, but I suppose, for this moment, that is irrelevant.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|We'll start by gathering information. Someone must have seen Flayn recently.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|Right. If we work together, I'm certain we'll find her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|Flayn has disappeared? Seteth must be beside himself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sylvain|So finding little Flayn is our mission for this moon? Leave it to me, Professor. Chasing after girls is my specialty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ingrid|Sylvain... Even you must agree that now isn't the time for jokes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|I hope Flayn is OK. I've heard rumors about some Death Knight running around town...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Felix|Sounds intriguing. I had been hoping to cross blades with him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ingrid|Felix! Please consider how Seteth must be feeling right now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|In any case, we must start our search at once. Every moment matters. On your order, Professor, let's try to collect as much information as we can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|What? Flayn is missing?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|So, finding Flayn is our mission for the month, I take it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Raphael|Wait. Who's Flayn?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Leonie|Seteth's little sister. Surely you've seen her flitting about the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lysithea|She is the girl who looks about the same age as me, but seems well beyond her years.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Seteth is much older than Flayn. He's always looking out for her. He must be worried sick. If I were to go missing, I can't imagine what that would do to my brother.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|When searching for someone, it's best to start by gathering information. Hopefully someone has seen Flayn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|I'm on the lookout for suspicious individuals. The only place I've yet to check is the library.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We'll go together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|As you wish.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Get some rest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|As you wish. After I check the library.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|Candlelight... And who is that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it Flayn?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it the Death Knight?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|No, it isn't. Impossible...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|Professor. Dedue. What are you up to at this hour?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|Your Highness! My apologies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|Oh, none necessary. I'm sorry for startling you. I was just doing some research. But I'm just about finished. I didn't realize how late it had gotten. We'd better head back to our quarters, Dedue. Until tomorrow, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sothis|A most unusual man! Whatever could he have been looking for so late at night? Hm? That book is quite askew... He must have rushed to put it back upon the shelf.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sothis|It seems to be a record of donations from nobility. Arundel... That's not a name I know. But look at that! This Arundel gave quite a sum each year... That is, until the year 1174. He must have died or fallen to financial woe. Hmm... I can't imagine what this has to do with Flayn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sothis|Oh my... Just one small girl who's gone astray has caused all this. We cannot let this stand. You must do all you can to find out where's she's gone. Now ask around to see what information you can find. Come now! No time to waste!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|We must begin our search for Flayn, Professor. If she ran off on her own free will, that's her business. But that may not be the case. For her sake, I suggest we assume that she was abducted and begin an investigation. Who benefits from kidnapping her? Let's gather all the information we can on anyone who's been acting strangely.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|Manuela ran off with Jeritza's mask? Hmm... We'll have to speak with both of them. But where could Manuela be? Jertiza is likely at the training grounds or in his quarters on the eastern side of the knights' hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|Flayn is missing... We should split up and search for her. There isn't a moment to waste. We must find her before it's too late.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|When I consider how Seteth must be feeling, my heart breaks. We must find Flayn as soon as possible. There are no signs of her having left the monastery, but we cannot safely rule out any possibility just yet. I'm wasting precious time standing about trying to think of a solution. I'll survey the monastery and see what information I can gather. There must be someone who has a clue as to Flayn's whereabouts.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|What? Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? I have a bad feeling about this... We must find them both at once! Professor Jeritza will be at the training grounds or his quarters. I believe the latter can be found on the eastern side of the knights' hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|I have thoroughly surveyed the entire monastery, and yet I have not found a single trace of evidence that suggests Flayn was abducted. Perhaps we must seek out personal recounts rather than physical evidence... In any case, we must hurry before something terrible happens.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|No sign of her leaving the monastery, eh? That is, assuming we can actually trust that information...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Oh, but I'm sure this space has no shortage of secret passages and hiding spots!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|True. For now, there's not much we can do aside from making a thorough search of the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Let's ask around and see what we turn up. You never know who might have seen something.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? What could that possibly mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Well, that's suspicious! Sounds like we should try talking to them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|Professor Jeritza is almost certainly in the training grounds or his quarters. Where was that again? Oh, over on the eastern side of the knights' hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|Flayn's gone missing? Where could she be? If it were an ordinary kidnapping, you'd think there'd be a demand for ransom or something by now. I don't like the sound of this...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|If Flayn has been taken hostage, then we know she is alive. At least for now. There would be no point to abducting her if simple murder was the objective. That's only logical, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ferdinand|A beautiful, delicate maiden vanishing into thin air... It is like something out of a book. If it were a book, we would have no need to worry! She would be rescued presently by a dashing nobleman. Do you have any idea as to where she might be? Where she might have wandered off to?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Perhaps she went looking for treats?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ferdinand|That is what I thought! Why I am here, in fact. But she is nowhere to be seen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|To the greenhouse, for some flowers?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ferdinand|Hmm, the greenhouse. I did not think of that. I will take a look around there later.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Linhardt|Flayn? No, I haven't seen her. She's been abducted. Oh, you're looking for her. Sorry, my mind was somewhere else. I just recently learned she has a Crest. Did you know that, Professor? If it was a particularly rare Crest, I could imagine Professor Hanneman would have quite an intense interest in her. Oh, no, I'm not accusing Professor Hanneman of abducting Flayn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Caspar|I don't know if she ran off or got kidnapped or what! I just know that Flayn's in trouble. That's it! I can't keep sitting around. I gotta go find her! Now where do I start?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Bernadetta|Uh, Flayn's not in here! Ugh, I guess I have to let you in to prove it, don't I?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Bernadetta|There. See? No one's in Bernie's room but Bernie. Maybe Flayn just wanted to be alone for a while. Have you considered that? Come to think of it, where is her room, anyway?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dorothea|Hey, Professor, have you seen Manuela? I saw her running off somewhere in a terrible hurry. I wonder if it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance. Do you know, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|You're on first-name terms with Professor Manuela?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dorothea|Oh, yes. Didn't you know? She was the senior diva in our Opera Company.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Petra|Flayn was childnapped. That is what you are thinking? And the villain is inside our monastery? Hmm. I must have admittance. One person...has been catching my eye. Shamir is a knight not like other knights. Her movements are being reminders of...no, they remind me of warriors of Brigid. Before she was here, what was she getting up to...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|I've heard the monastery is full of secret passages. If there is no sign of Flayn's departure, it's possible that she used one of those. Whatever has happened, I hope she is all right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Felix|Ah, you're looking for Flayn's kidnapper. I can't say anything for sure, but I do have suspicions about Jeritza. There's something about how he's handling his blade lately. It seems more...impulsive than usual. It couldn't hurt to try speaking with him, at least. At this hour, I think you'll find him sparring with Catherine at the training grounds.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ashe|I heard something like this happened last year too. Neither the culprit nor the missing student were ever found last time. Some people say it was the work of evil spirits.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Maybe it was.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ashe|D-don't say things like that, Professor! I'm sure the culprit is, you know, corporeal. We'll catch whoever it is!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Then it could be the same culprit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ashe|I thought the same. Could there be a connection?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sylvain|Ow! Ingrid just about slapped the teeth out of my head. All I did was suggest that Flayn had eloped...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Quite an insensitive joke.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sylvain|Insensitive? I was just exploring possibilities!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is that a possibility?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sylvain|I don't know. I was just suggesting things, then suddenly I was seeing stars and Ingrid was yelling at me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Mercedes|Do you really think Flayn was kidnapped?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|She must have been.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Mercedes|I have a feeling you're right. We really need to find her, and quickly!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|There must be another explanation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Mercedes|Do you think she ran off on her own? That doesn't put me any more at ease.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|There have been a lot of rumors swirling around lately about a Death Knight who kidnaps people from the nearby town... You don't think Flayn was...you know. Do you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We can't rule it out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I don't believe so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|Whether the rumors are true or not, I just hope our Flayn is safe...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ingrid|To think that Flayn would disappear like this... Seteth must be worried sick. I haven't got much to go off of, and perhaps it's out of line for me to feel so uncomfortable... But something has been bothering me for a while about Gilbert. I feel as though I've met him somewhere before... I also noticed him staring intently at Annette once. Hmm...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lorenz|If Flayn were taken hostage, I expect we would have received demands from the culprit by now. Perhaps this is not a kidnapping at all. Do you suppose she could have simply run away?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|That's possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lorenz|If that is the case, it is unlikely that we will find her anywhere in the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I don't think so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lorenz|What could it be, then? What possible motive could there be to abduct her?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Raphael|I hope Flayn isn't going hungry. If someone really kidnapped her, I'll never forgive them! Now that I think about it, I saw Alois hanging out by the pond not too long ago. He was always getting into trouble for trying to talk to Flayn, you know. It's probably a crazy thought, but I'm starting to worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|I've only ever spoken to Flayn a handful of times. She always seemed so naive about the ways of the world. I'm worried about her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|You think she'd be easily deceived?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|Yes, I'm afraid so. I just hope she comes home safe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Do you have feelings for Flayn?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|Wh-what makes you say that?! This is hardly the time for teasing, you know!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lysithea|Reflecting on it now, Flayn has always seemed a rather odd person. She appears young, yet there's something about her that seems much older than her years suggest. And she's quite wise, but also surprisingly naive...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Maybe she's lived a very sheltered life.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lysithea|Hmm, you might be right. Whatever the case, Seteth seems to care for her more than anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Maybe she's actually a ghost.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lysithea|A ghost?! Don't be absurd!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Marianne|Dear Goddess, hear my prayer... Please watch over Flayn... Please protect her...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|I bet Flayn ran away. She couldn't stand being held back by Seteth any longer. I can emphasize. I know what it's like to have an overbearing big brother.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Leonie|Where could Flayn have gone? Do you think she's really been kidnapped? I hear Tomas has been going around asking about her... But he's probably just worried like the rest of us. Though it wasn't just Flayn. He was asking about you and Captain Jeralt too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|Professor, have you still not found any leads regarding Flayn's whereabouts? I have looked everywhere. Not even the knights on guard have seen anything of note.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|You're searching too?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|I, too, care for Flayn. She is like family to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We will find her, together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|Yes, let us work together. It reassures me to have you by my side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|May the goddess protect dear Flayn until she returns to us...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I will find her. I swear it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|That is all I ask. Please, lend me your aid!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Try not to worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|You ask the impossible. Oh, Flayn...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|She would have never left the monastery of her own volition. Why is there not a trace of her to be found?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Alois|Hey there, Professor. Did you want to talk?  What?! Me, abduct Flayn?! You can't really believe I did that!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Did you find anything in the pond?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Alois|Well, this may sound silly, but... I was too scared to even look. I couldn't bear the thought of finding her in its depths.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I hear she was always yelling at you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Alois|Oh, that's just because of my dumb jokes. She says that they're not very good. But if I went around kidnapping everyone who said that, the whole monastery would be empty!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Catherine|Did you hear about Flayn? It's just one thing after another this year, I swear. Some of the lower-ranked knights are searching for her in the town. If they find anything, I'll know.  What? Jeritza? Hm, come to think of it, I haven't seen him today. What would make you suspect him?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|That mask he wears is suspicious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I heard that he goes out every night.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Catherine|I see. Well, I'll let the knights know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Shamir|What brings you here? I'm taking a break.  Is this about Flayn? You find me suspicious? Hah.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|You're not from Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Shamir|True. Your point being?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|What did you do before coming to the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Shamir|I was somewhere else. Fighting. Is that a problem?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Shamir|I understand that I don't fit in among the Knights of Seiros... But that hardly links me to Flayn's disappearance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Shamir|Working hard, aren't you? I'll admit, I'm impressed. I can assist with any tasks, or help with your students|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Shamir|On it. I'm available anytime I'm not on a mission with the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Gilbert|Miss Flayn's whereabouts are unknown? I pray she is safe... We do not seem to have any leads at present.  I am one of the suspects, am I? Well, hopefully I can lay your suspicions to rest. Do you know of my, let's call it...unique situation?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Your true identity?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Do you mean Annette?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Gilbert|I was once a knight in service to the Faerghus royal family. If Ingrid believes she saw me before, it was likely in Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. Annette is... She is my... But no, I would appreciate it, Professor, if you would ask no more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|Because of Flayn's disappearance, all of the knights are searching nonstop. But we haven't found a single lead. Seteth's face is getting paler by the minute. It's hard to watch.  What's that? You're looking for Manuela? Well, I did pass by her earlier. She was carrying something. A mask of some sort...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Jeritza's mask?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|I'm not close to the guy, so I can't say for sure. But come to think of it, you could be right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Flayn's mask?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|Are you feeling all right? When have you ever seen Flayn wearing a mask?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|Young Flayn's disappearance is most troubling.  What? Who would suspect me? You know what? I'll tell you who. A fool. That's who.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is her Crest rare enough to justify kidnapping her?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|Flayn's Crest, the Major Crest of Cethleann, is rare, but there are others who possess it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|You have already investigated her thoroughly?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|Alas, Seteth would never allow that. However, while Flayn's Major Crest of Cethleann is rare, there are other who possess it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Tomas|Is something the matter? I see. So, Flayn has gone missing. I will do what I can to support the search.  Hm? It seems that you are a bit suspicious of me. Might I ask your reasons?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Why were you asking about Flayn?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Tomas|I was away from the monastery for a few years, but do not forget... I have spent more than four decades in total working here at Garreg Mach Monastery. Yet it was not until recently that I learned that Seteth has a sister.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Why were you asking about my father?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Tomas|It has been two decades since I last knew Jeralt, yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Tomas|It is only natural to be curious, don't you think? I assure you, there is nothing more to it than that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Cyril|I can't believe Flayn just disappeared. I don't like it one little bit. Oh, are you here to see someone? Alois and Shamir and all the knights are gonna head into town soon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Today...there is quite a bit to report! There is a masked individual who has been going into town every evening and not returning until the following morning. You see? Nothing gets past this guard! I doubt it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance, but... Well, better safe than sorry, I always say.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Student|Professor! I saw him! A knight wielding a gigantic scythe! He was just like the rumors say! All covered in jet-black armor! It was the Death Knight, I just know it! You don't think he has something to do with Flayn's disappearance...do you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Knight Of Seiros|I can only imagine how worried Seteth must be, but isn't mobilizing the entire order of knights a bit...excessive? I was originally assigned to investigate those reports of the Death Knight in the town near Garreg Mach. When I think how many more victims that dastard might claim while we're all busy searching for Flayn... I'm sorry... That was insensitive. We're all under a lot of stress right now. It's important that we find her quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Monk|I've served here at Garreg Mach in some capacity or another for several decades now. But after all that time, even I can't claim to know everything about the layout. Searching the entire interior of the monastery is a more difficult task than you may think. It makes you wonder who designed such a titanic compound. There are fragments of records remaining from its original construction, but none of them name an actual architect...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Monk|This might be the first time I've ever seen Seteth look so worn down. If poor Flayn was lured away by anyone... I personally think the clear suspect is that miscreant from Duscur. Those people are deceptive by nature...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Student|The whole monastery has been turned upside down! I wonder if we're still going to have the Battle of the Eagle and Lion next month. It's a yearly tradition, but with things the way they are right now...it's hard to imagine. At any rate, I hope they find Flayn soon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|It seems Flayn is still missing. What could have happened to her?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Caspar|Everyone, hurry! I heard a scream from Professor Jeritza's room!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sothis|Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|Professor Jeritza? Are you there?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|He does not seem to be here... Hm? On the ground! Professor Manuela!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is she injured?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is she...dead?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|No, She's unconscious. Someone clearly attacked her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Look at her hand. It looks as though she is pointing at something... There.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|There's an opening behind that shelf. Perhaps a secret passageway...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|We know as much as you do. She needs to be taken to the infirmary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|Yes, of course–and quickly. Give me a hand, child.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|Understood. I'll support her head. Professor, I'll be back shortly. Please be careful.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Caspar|Does this mean Professor Jeritza did it? Could he also have kidnapped Flayn?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|We should start by investigating this passageway. Do you agree, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Let's investigate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Agreed. The culprit could be hiding inside.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We should call for the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|We don't have time for that. It would be on us if the culprit escaped.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Caspar|That settles it! We'll take the offensive. Here we come, you monsters!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Shall we, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|We still don't know where Flayn is... But we can't give up. Not until she's found.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ingrid|Professor! Your Highness! I just heard a scream! In Professor Jeritza's quarters!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sothis|Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|Isn't that... Professor Manuela!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|Professor Manuela! Please wake up! Professor Manuela!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is she injured?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|She's still breathing...but she needs medical attention immediately!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is she...dead?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|No, I believe she's just unconscious. But this wound requires immediate attention!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|Look! Do you see Professor Manuela's hand? It's like she's pointing at something...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|I see it! Behind that shelf! Could it be a secret passage?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|Of course. I'll return shortly, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|Do you think this is related to Flayn's disappearance?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|What should we do, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Let's investigate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|It looks dark...uh...dark in there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Mercedes|Aw, you've always been scared of dark places, haven't you, Annie? But don't worry! The professor and I will protect you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We should call for the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|You're right. We should call for help.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ashe|But the culprit could flee while we wait! Sh-shouldn't we take a look?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|There are sounds coming from within. If we're going to investigate, now is the time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Mercedes|We'll be OK, I'm sure of it. Are you ready, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|There's still no sign of Flayn... What should we do, Teach? I'll admit, I'm out of schemes here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|Professor! Claude! Something's very wrong. Please hurry to Professor Jeritza's room!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|Knock, knock. Is anybody...whoa! Professor Manuela!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|I heard a scream coming from here just moments ago. It must have been Professor Manuela!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is she injured?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|She's unconscious. She was clearly attacked by someone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is she...dead?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|No, I believe she's just unconscious. It looks like she was attacked by someone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Hey! It kind of looks like Professor Manuela is...pointing at something.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|So we follow where she's pointing and... Oh? What do we have here? There's a rather suspicious hole behind that shelf.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|Right, right. Hold down the fort for me, Teach. I'll be back once we get Professor Manuela taken care of.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|What could have happened here? And where is Professor Jeritza?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|This must be related to that girl's disappearance. What if she's being held captive down there? No, no, that's crazy... Right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Let's investigate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|Right... It's scary, but... OK.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Don't be a coward, Ignatz. We'll be fine as long as we stick close to the professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We should call for the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|But...what if something bad happens while we're searching for the knights?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|You mean, like, a captured girl being strangled or something?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|Ah...you're right. What should we do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|We've got to investigate. Lead the way, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|The culprit may be hiding inside, so let's be extra cautious!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|I never would have imagined... Hm? I see someone. They're unconscious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it Flayn?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Yes, and there is someone else too. It appears to be another student.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it Jeritza?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|No, Professor. It's two young girls.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Caspar|Someone's coming! I recognize that scythe and mask... It's that jerk we fought at the Holy Mausoleum!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|What is this place? It's so...BAH! I see someone! I think...they're unconscious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it Flayn?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ingrid|Yes, I see Flayn! But...who is this other person?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it Jeritza?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Felix|Are you blind? They're obviously female. And there are two of them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|Professor! Someone's coming from farther in! That scythe... Is that the knight who attacked the Holy Mausoleum?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|It's way too creepy down here. And it smells funny. And...BAH! A person! They're...unconscious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it Flayn?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Yes! It's Flayn! Oh, but there's someone else too...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is it Jeritza?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Look closer, Professor. There are two girls.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ignatz|Someone is coming! That scythe... Could it be the knight we fought at the Holy Mausoleum?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Death Knight|That sword. You must be... One of us will die, the other will live. I will enjoy this dance of damnation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Our objective is to recover Flayn. Let us hope we are not too late.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Hmm. Something odd about the floor over there. What will happen if we step on it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Contraptions in the floor. Stay alert.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|Interesting apparatus. I wonder if we can operate it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Flame Emperor Soldier|So, you have come! I'll make sure you never leave!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|That knight looks like death itself. We must rescue Flayn immediately.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|There's something strange about the flooring at the end of the corridor. Something might happen if you step there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|Some kind of contraption has been activated.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|What is this device? It appears operational.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Professor, we need to defeat the Death Knight, and then rescue Flayn!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Hm. Look at that strange tile over there. I bet something will happen if you step on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Whoa. Look at those weird contraptions on the floor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|I wonder what that is? Looks like you can use it, but who knows what'll happen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Death Knight|I have no need of you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Death Knight|Now, you will die together... How joyous...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|You should withdraw from here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Death Knight|I don't take orders from you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Death Knight|Kill them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|???|Halt. You're having a bit too much fun.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Death Knight|You are getting in the way of my game.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|???|Hmph. You'll have more opportunities to play soon. Your work here is done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Death Knight|Understood. I will go...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|???|We will cross paths again. I am the Flame Emperor... It is I who will reforge the world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Linhardt|Flame Emperor? Rather worrisome that he sounds intent on showing up again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ferdinand|Are they both OK? We should get them out of here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|The enemy's withdrawn. Let's carry them up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Mercedes|Flame Emperor and the Death Knight? I have to say, they both looked very dangerous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ingrid|Where did they go? It doesn't matter. We need to get these two out of here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue|Bring them up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lorenz|Flame Emperor, eh? Seemed quite frightened of us if you ask me! Haha!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Leonie|He's gone. We should get these two out of here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hilda|Let's get out of this horrible place! C'mon, we can carry them up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Linhardt|They're pale, and their pulse are slow... Still, I don't believe their lives are in danger.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|You found Flayn? Where?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Ferdinand|You missed the most important part of the mission! We found her within that secret passage. The culprits were the Death Knight and...what was his name? Ah, the Flame Emperor. Sadly, they got away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|All that matters is Flayn's safety. Right, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I wanted to catch them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|It is unfortunate. If only you could have waited for me to return...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hubert|We will take these two to the infirmary. Professor, please inform Seteth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|Whatever the circumstance, I'm glad Flayn is safe. Though I'm curious to find out who that other girl is... Huh, Professor? Is that...a smile?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Edelgard|Heh, you look...happy. I don't think I've ever seen you like this before. Anyhow, we should hurry to Seteth. He must be beside himself by now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Mercedes|Thank goodness. Those girls are pale as ghosts, but at least they're alive. But that Death Knight person...feels so familiar.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|You found Flayn?! Thank goodness!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Annette|She was unconscious at the end of that secret passage. We found the culprit too...but he got away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|No use dwelling on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We almost had him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|I'm just grateful that everyone is safe. That's what matters most. I'd like to hear what transpired, but first we need to get these ladies to the infirmary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dedue| Understood. We'll go at once.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri| I'm...I'm sorry, Professor. I'm so relieved, I suddenly felt weak. I couldn't be happier with how things turned out. And I imagine no one will be more overjoyed than Seteth. Hm. Hey, Professor. Can you make that expression one more time?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Like this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|I don't think I've ever seen your face like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|No.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I don't think I can...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Dimitri|Heh, I apologize. I've forgotten myself and come dangerously close to teasing you. It's just...I've never seen you look so happy before. It's downright mesmerizing. Ah, but this isn't the time for idle chitchat. We must hurry and share the good news with Seteth!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Marianne|They're both alive... Thank goodness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|You actually found Flayn?! Nice work!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lorenz|It is a shame you could not be there, Claude. I would have liked for you to witness our mortal struggle against the Death Knight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|He got away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|We could not defeat him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|Hey, at least we managed to rescue Flayn and complete our mission. That's what counts, right? Right! Excellent work, everyone! Now then, let's get these limp ladies to the infirmary, shall we?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Raphael|No problem. I can carry them both at once.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Lysithea|Be gentle with them, Raphael! Let us carry each one individually. And slowly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Claude|You know, Teach, seeing you smile sure makes me feel better. You look happy for a change. Hm? Do you really not know? Well, truth is, I've never seen you smile before now. At times, it made me wonder whether you were even human. But I suppose that was just my imagination running wild. Anyhow, we've probably kept Seteth waiting about as long as he can stand. Let's hurry up and tell him the great news.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|Professor... Please, allow me to express my eternal gratitude once more. Flayn is safe and sound, and I have you to thank for that. Mere words could never express how thankful I am. I...I am indebted to you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I couldn't have done it without the students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|Yes, of course. I shall express my gratitude to the students as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I'm just happy she's safe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|Yes, indeed. I...I, too, am overjoyed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|But why was Flayn taken to begin with?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|Her kidnapper was the masked knight who vanished during the Rite of Rebirth. The one known as the Death Knight. Considering the circumstances, it seems plausible to assume that his true identity is Jeritza. And we cannot forget about the mysterious Flame Emperor... His true motives are yet unclear. However, I have an idea. I believe the enemy may have been after Flayn's blood. The blood that flows through her veins is special. It is extremely rare...and extremely dangerous. If enemies who know the secret of Flayn's blood have appeared, our only option is to leave the monastery and go into hiding.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Flayn|Brother, wait.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|Flayn?! What are you doing here? You should be resting!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Flayn|I do not like the path of your thoughts. I do not wish to live in some lonely, remote location where I never get to see anyone. Not ever again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|If we stay here, you may be targeted again! Wouldn't it be better for the two of us to live in peace?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Flayn|Even if we ran off to some new, secret location, there is no guarantee that they would not find us. That is why I believe it would be safest to stay in the monastery, where we are surrounded by capable knights and professors.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|I see your point, I do. However...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Flayn|You know it is the only reasonable option. What if I were to join the professor's class?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|That is a great idea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Flayn|You think so too? I am so very pleased to hear that! With a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Why would you do that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Flayn|Because, with a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Seteth|I see. I am afraid you have a good point. Professor... Due to my position, I have closely scrutinized everything about you. After all that has happened, I must admit that you are indeed...a trusted ally. So, what say you? Can I entrust you with Flayn's safety?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|It would be my pleasure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I suppose I have no choice.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Sothis|I am so glad that Flayn is safe. Yet I can't help but wonder what the story is about the other girl. She wore the uniform of the academy. But who is she?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|Well done, Professor. I see that I was right to ask your class for assistance. I have been told that Manuela and Flayn are recovering nicely, as is Monica.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Is Monica a student here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Who is Monica?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|Monica, the girl you rescued along with Flayn, is also a student at the Officers Academy. However...|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|She is a student from last year's class. She went missing just before she would have graduated. It never occurred to us that something might have happened to her at the monastery. We assumed she had run away. I never dreamed that we would find her. Not like this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|Monica has asked to rejoin the Black Eagle House once she has fully recovered. Our enemies are still out there, so we must remain cautious and continue our investigation. However, we must also help the students to move on from this incident.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Hanneman|After all, the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field next month.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Rhea|Yes. The students will remember it for the rest of their lives. Please guide them so they may show us their best at the coming battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|So, you'll be going to Gronder Field next month. You've never been there before, have you? There is unease in the western side of the Empire, but everything east of the capital, Enbarr, is stable. Well, there was a noble rebellion a short while ago, but it didn't amount to much.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|What will you do next month?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|I have my own mission. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Will you come to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|Sorry, but I've got my own mission, and it's far from Gronder Field. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|What I'm more concerned about is finding out who among us is pulling the strings. Ever since the Rite of Rebirth, strange groups have been seen around Garreg Mach, and elsewhere too. There was also an incident where some knights investigating these suspicious strangers...turned up dead. Not that it's likely, but if something like that ever happens to me... Search this room. Every corner. Behind every shelf. I'm going to leave something for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|Don't say things like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|Don't get me wrong. I have no intention of dying. I know it would be too much to ask you to cheer up, but can you at least drop the serious...  Well, I'll be. Was that a smile just now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Byleth|I promise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|06-RumorsOfAReaper|Jeralt|Don't just nod solemnly. There's nothing to worry about. I'm just being cautious. Then again, I guess you're always solemn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|Unforgivable! I cannot believe that the Adrestian Empire would embark on such a violent course of action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|The fault is my own. I failed to see the wickedness within Edelgard's heart.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Is she wicked?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|What is her objective?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|Or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know. Perhaps she is planning to make herself a false deity by demonizing the Church of Seiros...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|Adrestia received its very name through a divine oracle. To injure the goddess is a sin most foul that shall not be forgiven nor forgotten. We must stop the Empire...and quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Shamir|I have returned, Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|Welcome back, Shamir. Were you able to discern the Empire's movements?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Shamir|Their main troops are marching towards Garreg Mach. It is said that they will join forces with Edelgard's army and arrive within two weeks.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|Two weeks? That is not enough time! It will require all of our efforts just to prepare our defenses before then. We must send notice to all surrounding villages at once. We must order the residents of Garreg Mach to flee for their lives.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Shamir|It will be done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|...Professor...listen closely. If our enemy invades the monastery, I will have no choice but to stand upon the battlefield. If something happens to me...I am entrusting my sacred duties to you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Why me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Sacred duties?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|You must have guessed it by now. The truth of who you are. Or perhaps I should say, your lost memories are surely beginning to return. I have acted all these long years as a mere proxy for you. But the duty is yours and yours alone. Only you can lead the people of Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|...Rhea, please. You must tell me all that you know. I beg of you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|That one...is the progenitor god. Am I correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|In a sense. Our dear professor is...a vessel. One who carries the power of the progenitor god within. In time, the vessel will become one with the power contained within, and the progenitor god shall return to this world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|I see. I trust that you are aware of the questionable nature of this experiment? But I suppose there is no turning back...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|I ask that you help our friend...and in doing so, help her. I am waiting and hoping for the moment when our creator rules this wayward land once more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|I am sorry, but I cannot do this. I am not certain it is just...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|I see. That is a shame.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|I understand. As ever, I will take you at your word.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Flayn|Lady Rhea! Brother! I will do my part as well!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|Flayn! Were you eavesdropping? Regardless, I am glad to hear it. You owe your life to the professor, after all. And in the end, they may prove to be our brethren.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|You have my gratitude, Seteth. And you as well, Flayn. As followers of the progenitor god, it is up to us to see our mission through.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dimitri|... I'll have that girl's head. Just you wait...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|The Empire is moving quickly. Edelgard must have been preparing for this for a while now. If you really think about it, she must have been planning for this even before you got the Sword of the Creator... Of course she was always a step ahead of us. We were blinded by the ball and the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, and everything else...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ferdinand|Half of the Empire's six great noble families have declared their support for Edelgard. Of the other three, Lord Vestra was assassinated. Hubert, his son, will succeed him. Bernadetta's father, Count Varley, is under house arrest. His wife is now supporting Edelgard. And my father...he was stripped of his role as prime minister. As as result, House Aegir has lost all of its power, all of its land. We have lost everything. I...I... What do I do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Linhardt|The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Caspar|I don't normally have a problem jumping into a fight, but it feels strange going up against my father. We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! I hope he's not part of the group coming to attack Garreg Mach...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Bernadetta|What does war with Edelgard mean for us, Professor? And why does she even want that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Bernadetta|Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|She seems to think force is the only way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Bernadetta|I wonder why she'd think that...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Bernadetta|That's how it always goes, I guess. You never realize something can't be undone until you've done it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dorothea|Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Us or her, you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dorothea|But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|We will not lose.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dorothea|Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Petra|I am owing big debts to Duke Gerth of the Empire. He is the Minister of Affairs that are Foreign. He is a friend of Edelgard. He is to her side. What should I be doing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Petra|I have had the arrival of a letter from Edelgard. She is asking...that I join her side. She is making the decision...no, she is deciding if Brigid is a friend or an enemy of the Empire. But my choice is not to be friends. My choice is to fight with you. Brigid is not a friend of the Empire. We will not be following again. We will be ready to fight with you instead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|His Highness calls for the head of Edelgard. For me, that is cause enough to fight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|That is against the teachings of the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|You're truly all right with that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|And if Edelgard was responsible in any way for the Tragedy of Duscur, that is something I cannot ignore. If that is the case, then she is my enemy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Felix|You saw it too, didn't you? The boar's true nature. He's hidden his desire for revenge pretty well. But now it's stirred up. Well, regardless. That girl's starting an all-out war, isn't she? But an enemy is an enemy, no matter who they are. Don't let compassion for her get in your way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Annette|Once the Imperial army reaches the monastery, we'll have no choice but to fight...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ashe|What's going to happen to us?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Everything will be all right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ashe|I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I can't say for sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Annette|Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Sylvain|Things must be pretty crazy in Faerghus about now. My father must be beside himself. I don't get it. Why did Edelgard make enemies with the nobles?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I have no idea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Sylvain|Me either... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|For the sake of her ideals?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Sylvain|Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Sylvain|I hope this all gets sorted out quickly and safely. I'm worried about my father.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Mercedes|I guess we have no choice but to fight, have we? Oh, but why would Edelgard do something like this? I'm sure we'll be all right though, Professor. The goddess will keep us safe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ingrid|I've known His Highness since I was a child, but I've never seen that side of him before. He seemed like a completely different person than the one I know...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Lorenz|The Empire's aggression cannot stand. But if we are going to attack them now, we must be honest with ourselves about our chances of success. It goes without saying that I will fight the Imperial army with everything I have, for as long as I am able. But House Gloucester's territory is adjacent to Imperial lands. Let us proceed with caution.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Raphael|I hear the Alliance's territory will be in danger if we don't get rid of these Empire guys! If the Alliance is in danger, that means my sister's in danger too! There's no way I'm gonna allow that. It doesn't matter how many guys they throw at us, I'll beat 'em all! These muscles aren't just for show! But first, I gotta get some food.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ignatz|You know, Professor, I'm glad that I came to the Officers Academy. I feel accepted here. I've learned so much. Honestly, I'm surprised at how much I've grown. So, I will not let the academy be destroyed. It's important to me, and I will protect it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I feel the same.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ignatz|I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Don't do anything rash.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ignatz|I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ignatz|We're gonna win this, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Lysithea|So Edelgard, the one who calls herself the Flame Emperor, was connected to those strange beings. The Imperial army might be using even more terrifying methods than we know. You had better be cautious, Professor. Any amount of carelessness might prove to be our undoing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Marianne|Can we really defeat someone who is willing to turn their back on the world just to uphold their own beliefs? I've spent my whole life running in fear, and now...I...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|We can win this together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Marianne|Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|We can't win if you run.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Marianne|You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hilda|You'll battle Edelgard, right? Good luck! Me? Oh, I'm going to run away. I have zero interest in dying here, thank you very much.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hilda|At times like this, I just feel so anxious, you know? But you'll watch out for me there. Right, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Leonie|What is Edelgard even trying to achieve? She wants to destroy the church so badly that she'll take on anyone who doesn't fall in line? I don't get it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Her ideals are in conflict with yours.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|It's a hard thing to accept.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Leonie|I just can't believe she'd start a war over it. Not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way. Could Captain Jeralt's death have also been a part of her plan? Don't you go and die on me, Professor. Captain Jeralt would never forgive you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|How are you, Professor? Any new changes to report? With the Imperial army drawing near, it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did... Thankfully, you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side. Please try to listen carefully for her voice...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I will try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I can't hear a thing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|May the goddess's voice reach you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|We must protect Garreg Mach. Defiling the Holy Tomb was a sacrilege. I will not allow such a thing to happen again. The archbishop has already given you a new responsibility. I want you to rise to that honor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Flayn|Professor... War is breaking out again, is it not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Again?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Flayn|There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I want to stop it if I can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Flayn|An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Flayn|I never wanted another war... All we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Alois|Well, perhaps it's pointless to get upset about the past. My duty now is to prepare for battle. We're depending on your strength, Professor. Crush our enemies!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I'll try|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I'm depending on you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Alois|Captain, I hope you're watching! We will protect Garreg Mach!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Catherine|Ugh. If I could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self! Now it turns out Edelgard is the Flame Emperor, and the new Adrestian emperor! And she's striking out against the monastery, with the full force of the Imperial army behind her. We gotta beat her at her own game! For our sake as well as Lady Rhea's...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Shamir|We're falling behind. I don't know that we can keep up with the new emperor. To think that she was able to raise an army of that size right under our noses... However hard we fight, I give us a 50 percent chance of winning. The enemy has too many advantages. We must make careful preparations.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Gilbert|There are always small power struggles, still... It has been hundreds of years since all of Fódlan was consumed by war. I didn't actually think it would come to this... I feel as though I'm not in my rightful place. I cannot protect the things I should... Professor. If I survive this war, I wish to return to my homeland... To the land of my king.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hanneman|The Holy Tomb held many Crest Stones. This is the first time I've heard of Crest Stones being hidden away in such a place... But more importantly, I'm interested to know the Empire's aim. Why would their army desire Crest Stones? There is power there, yes. And yet... I must think on this. The Crest Stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding Conand Tower and the chapel as well... And of course, the Crest Stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into Demonic Beasts... Could that possibly be their aim?! The Empire's army may well plan to use Crest Stones to create Demonic Beasts!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Manuela|The mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was Edelgard? Wow. Doesn't make much sense though, does it? There would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess... Eh, I'm gonna stop. I don't really have the head for this political stuff. Mostly I'm worried about my old opera company. I wonder what's happening in the capital right now. I hope they're safe...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Cyril|It's my job to protect Lady Rhea. I've gotta do it. and I gotta do it as best I can. And if that means I gotta die for her, then I will. Ugh, how could Edelgard treat Lady Rhea like she's the bad guy? She's never been anything but nice to everybody! I just don't get it at all...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Anna|I can't believe the Empire raised an army... Even I couldn't have guessed it. War is profitable...but dangerous. I really don't like seeing people I care about out there mixed up in all this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Gatekeeper|Greetings Professor! Something to report! Unexpected, isn't it? Apparently, this is the first time Garreg Mach has been invaded in its whole 995-year history! It's my job to protect this gate, so even if enemies come in droves, I will never let them through! I hope we both survive... Let's battle with all our might and pray we win this thing!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Alois|Listen up, everyone! The Imperial army is upon us. If you can fight, pick up a weapon! Everyone else, hurry up and evacuate! We have the goddess's protection on our side. We have nothing to fear. Victory will be ours!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Catherine|Professor. Are you ready?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Almost.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Catherine|Well, hurry up. I don't need to tell you that the situation is dire. We have some support troops from the local nobles, but the army we're facing is immense. No matter how you look at it, we're at a disadvantage. To make matters worse, the enemy is being led by Edelgard. Do not underestimate how extraordinary her abilities are.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Linhardt|Of course we know, but we can't let her get away. Also, please cease your unwarranted glaring. We don't deserve your judgement.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ferdinand|My father was removed from his role as prime minister and is still under house arrest in the Imperial capital. As his successor...it is my duty to stop her!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Caspar|The way she's going about all of this is wrong. It's up to us to help her realize that!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Bernadetta|I won't be following her, but...l won't run away either!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dorothea|Edie's going to come at us with all she's got. And that's a lot. That means we need to fight her with all of our might too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Petra|She is one who has strength, that has certainty. But we have strength also. We will not be losing!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Flayn|I shall fight with all that I have. It is an honor to fight alongside each of you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Catherine|You students really have guts, don't you? Though, I suppose I can't call you students anymore. You're now part of our order. You have our support and our gratitude. Professor, I'm counting on you. Go ahead and take the lead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I'll protect the students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Catherine|These kids...they look up to you. I guess that goes without saying. Just look in their eyes and you can see it. If we all make it through this, let's meet again. Good luck out there!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dimitri|They're here. At long last.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Felix|It seems this will be a battle to remember. About time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ashe|I'll never give up, no matter how outnumbered we are. I'll fight to the very end!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Sylvain|Hm, I should have made a move on the Imperial princess before things got this far. It could have changed everything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Mercedes|We have the goddess's divine protection on our side. All that's left to do is to try our best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Annette|All we can do is fight as best as we can. Though...if I'm being honest, I'm really scared right now...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ingrid|We can't just hand over the Kingdom and the monastery. We'll stop her, no matter what it takes!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|Your Highness, you do not seem...well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dimitri|  Unwell, you say? What's gotten into you? Nothing could be further from the truth. I'm so happy I can hardly contain myself. My father, my stepmother, my dear friends? They want her head. They want her life! They've whispered as much to me. And the chance to answer their pleas has arrived, at long last!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Don't lose control out there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dimitri|  I'm always in control, Professor! And I'll stay in control until I have the pleasure of killing that woman!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|Don't act rashly. We're all in this together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dimitri|  Of course, of course! But don't mistake my intentions. Edelgard will die by my hand, and mine alone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dimitri|Let's move, Professor. Even if it costs me my life, I won't rest until I've crushed her skull in my bare hands!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hilda|She's back already? Talk about impatient!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|If we don't stop them, the academy will be destroyed. Prepare for battle, everyone!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Lysithea|We will stop Edelgard's rampage!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ignatz|Our opponent is formidable, but if we work together, we will not fail.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Raphael|Enough talking! Let's go!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Marianne|Dear Goddess… Please, protect us all…|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Flayn|I shall fight with all that I have. It is an honor to fight alongside each of you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hilda|Professor, Claude… You'll lead the way, won't you? You won't let any of us fall, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|I wanted to talk to Rhea first, but as expected, that won't be possible. What did she hope to accomplish at the Holy Tomb? What happened to you as a baby? There are still so many things I need to know. The same goes for the real origin of the Crest Stones and the Heroes' Relics. As for Seiros and Nemesis…just how much of their mythology is true?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|It's true. But lucky for me, I refuse to die with so much still unknown. Hey, Teach… All joking aside. Can we possibly survive this battle?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|We'll find a way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|That's all we can do, right? If we gave up, the god of fate wouldn't be happy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|Hey, now! I wasn't really looking for an honest answer. Honesty is bad for morale, Teach. You'd better cut that out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|I'm a lot of things, but I'm not the kind of man to just roll over and die in a place like this. I have my own ambitions to see to. There are things…dreams…that I must see come to fruition. And I've been thinking. I want you to see those dreams realized as well. On top of all that, there are still so many secrets out there, just waiting to be uncovered. We can't let that stand, can we?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|So, Teach… No, scratch that. You're so much more. You're my ally and my friend. Teach… Friend… None of those words quite capture what you've come to mean to me. We may not be connected by blood, but I believe our bond goes deeper than that. Now that we know each other, our hearts are connected. Even if our paths diverge and we're forced to say good-bye… I know that we'll meet again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|And so, for lack of a better word, I gratefully call you my friend, and I hold fast to the belief that this isn't it for us. No matter who or what you really are, I'll always be on your side. You can't count on much in this world, but you can count on that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Knight Of Seiros|I have a report! The enemy is within the walls. They're about to break the defensive line!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|The archbishop and the defensive line both require our assistance. We must protect them until reinforcements get here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Knight Of Seiros|Report! The enemy has taken the entrances there the reinforcements were heading!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|We must retake the strongholds to the east and west so our reinforcements can get through.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|One stronghold secured.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|Both strongholds secured, with time to spare.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|Alright, that's one stronghold recaptured. Now, the other!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|That's both strongholds! It appears we were right on time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Seteth|No–the monestary has fallen! We've been defeated...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Catherine|I'm here, and I've brought reinforcements! Don't worry--we'll protect the monastery!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Shamir|I brought reinforcements. I'll send them to the front line.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dedue|They have taken the monastery. We have lost...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|We took back one of the strongholds. On to the next…|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|All right, we took back both of the strongholds. Let's keep up the momentum!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|Damn it... The monastery has fallen into the hands of our enemy. We failed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|The goddess protects us... what is there to fear rebel swords... This is blasphemy against the goddess! Stop this now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|N-no... I cannot fall here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Randolph|A wonderful chance to earn some recognition! I'll be the one to take down the monastery!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Randolph|I have no choice but to distinguish myself in this fight!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Randolph|Argh! I'm finished. I'm loathe to say it, but I must retreat...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hubert|Such a shame. There are people in the Empire you truly care about, too, aren't there? I wonder what will become of them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hubert|What you fail to appreciate is that we have, at our backs, a force you cannot hope to defeat.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hubert|I can afford to fall back. We still have the advantage.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Death Knight|This fight is but a sideshow... to the ravaging of the sacred place that is Garreg Mach...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Death Knight|The time is not right... I will wait for the next opportunity...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ladislava|I will not allow you to get any closer to Her Majesty!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ladislava|My life was changed forever by Her Majesty... Now, I lay it on the line. For the Empire!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Ladislava|Lady Edelgard, I'm so sorry! I can't keep going! I must retreat!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Edelgard|Think very carefully about whether you wish to raise your sword against the Empire... or if you will offer it to us in fealty. And after you've thought it through, if you still wish to fight, I won't stop you. I will simply use the full extent of my power... and crush you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Edelgard|You will come to regret raising your blade against the emperor of the Adrestian Empire!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Caspar|Huh. This guy seems real familiar...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Randolph|Y-you dastard! Aren't you... No...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Caspar|Eh, that doesn't matter right now. Let's go!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Hubert|Lady Edelgard held you in such high esteem. In the end, however, it seems like you are nothing more than a slave to your goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Death Knight|This battlefield is too chaotic... for us to kill each other upon...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Edelgard|I wish you were someone whose heart could be swayed by my words and deeds. If it were so, I would have done anything to make you my ally...|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Dimitri|You're late. I... We are all tired of waiting. Now, let's separate that sick head from your neck, shall we?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Edelgard|Heh. You never were one for patience.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Edelgard|You fought well. But now, your fight is over. Send in our reserve troops! And give my uncle the signal!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|What... is this?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|Everyone here, young and old, is in your hands.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|No. I will not allow another Red Canyon tragedy to happen here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Claude|What is going on?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Empire Soldier|What now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|12-ToWar|Rhea|Why did you come?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|Rhea, please talk to me. What are you hiding? What is the meaning of how that one looks? It is almost as though...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|As I said, there is nothing of which to speak. For now. At the end of this month...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|I read Jeralt's diary. I happened upon it in his room.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|What?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|In it, he stated the reason for his departure. The baby thought to have died in the fire...has returned to us. Jeralt realized that you had done something to the child and decided to flee. What did you do to that baby, Rhea? Nothing...questionable, I should hope?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Seteth, enough. They will be here shortly. No more, I beg of you. I will take our dear professor to the Holy Tomb. There...I should be able to see our dearest wishes to fruition. When I was young, I heard her voice there... I'm sure of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|You may enter.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|I have been awaiting your arrival, Professor. Now that you have received sacred power from the goddess, there is somewhere you must pay a visit to at once. You must go to the Holy Tomb so that you may receive a divine revelation from the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|The Holy Tomb?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|A revelation?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|The Holy Tomb is where the goddess sleeps. This monastery was originally built for the purpose of protecting that hallowed temple.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Only a select few know of it, but there is a legend about Seiros and the Holy Tomb. Saint Seiros, the first soul to be gifted power from the goddess, received her revelation there. She was told it was her sacred duty to save the people of Fódlan, and that she must use her power wisely in order to lead them. The words that were handed down to Seiros from the goddess will likely fall upon your ears as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|Prepare yourself to go at once. There, may you find out why you were blessed with such power.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|There will be a ceremony at the Holy Tomb. It is then that you will receive the goddess's revelation. You may share this mission with your students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Do you think it wise to bring them into this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|A mission? Now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|It is said that when Seiros received the revelation, she had holy warriors by her side, protecting her. Your students, who have followed you and fought alongside you through the darkest of times, are well suited to stand by you for the ceremony. Of course, as the leader of the Church of Seiros, I will be by your side as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Strange...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|The occasion is too significant to be missed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Isn't that too dangerous?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|The Holy Tomb is a sacred temple that is sealed off from the rest of the world. There is nothing to fear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Even if something were to happen, I am more than capable of protecting myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|Much has changed, but your duty has not wavered. Steel your mind for the ceremony, and prepare your students well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|Rhea and Seteth were not their usual selves. What happened to Teach that's questionable, and what really awaits at the Holy Tomb? The way they were acting, I don't think they have any plans of sharing that information.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|(I can't hear Sothis's voice anymore...)|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Professor, you should know that I'll be away from the monastery for a few days.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Where are you going?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|It's meant to be a secret, but...I'm going to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Don't worry, I'll be back in time for the ceremony at the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|Professor. Please. If he hears it from you that he needs to rest, perhaps His Highness will listen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|He's exaggerating. He thinks my color is off and that rest will cure all. I have a headache, but that's just from lack of sleep. It's not going to stop me from completing this month's mission.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|You should rest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|The professor agrees. Please rest. At least until the task is at hand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|I won't. Even if I tried, it's not like I would get any decent sleep. It would only be a waste of time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Don't overexert yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|I must insist—|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Who do you think you are? I can take care of myself, Dedue.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|In any case, we won't let you down this month, Professor. You can rely on us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|Hey, Teach. Is it OK for you to be out on your own right now? Just…please be careful not to topple over again. You scared us nearly to death. Anyway… Doesn't Rhea want something from you? Sounds important. I'm glad I'll be there to witness the ritual at the Holy Tomb. I want to see whether or not something happens with my own eyes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|I always knew there was something special about you, but you've only gotten more and more extraordinary the longer I've know you. That transformation was just the beginning, wasn't it? I have a feeling that things will only grow more dire from here on out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ferdinand|Edelgard and Hubert have been busier than usual. Constantly coming and going, in and out of Garreg Mach. Perhaps they are doing something in the Empire? As the legitimate heir of the Aegir family, I have not heard anything about it. But if it were significant, I am sure my father would have told me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Linhardt|How are you, Professor? Did Hanneman make his, I will do no harm speech or promise this won't hurt a bit when he asked to study you? Both? I've a bit of research I'd like to perform. Nothing so crass as Hanneman's poking, prodding, and drawing of blood. No, I wish to investigate Crest power itself. Crest power must have some kind of limit, right? Lady Rhea says any limits must be the protection of the goddess, but that doesn't quite answer it for me. Hmm...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Caspar|You're so strong now! I'm starting to understand why you were appointed professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Caspar|I thought I was stronger, but I still have such a long way to go.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Try to catch up to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Caspar|Oh, I will. I still plan on beating you some day!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I'll help you get there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Caspar|You'd better not go easy on me. I need your training to be strict if I'm gonna get any better!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Bernadetta|So hungry... Oh, is that you, Professor? Sorry. I'm really not feeling well this month. Even leaving my room for dinner is just too much. It's got nothing to do with your, um...changes. So, um, don't open the door, please!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dorothea|Recently, Professor, I feel as though you've been a bit distant. It's like you're sort of floating above the clouds, separate from other people... And like you've got no interest at all in ever coming back down. How can I help?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I'm not being distant, so don't worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I don't know what to say to that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dorothea|Hey, don't worry. I thought maybe I'd ask and see what you'd say.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Petra|In Brigid, we have legends. Stories containing people who have a spirit living inside of them. Those spirit people have much strength. They are maybe able to fly in the air or race across the ocean. Hair that shines and eyes that glow... They have qualities that are not unlike what you are looking like, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I can't fly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Petra|Are you knowing that for certain? Maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Perhaps.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Petra|Do not have doubt, Professor. The powers you have are like the powers of the legends.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Felix|Hurry up and cage the wild boar. Look, he's losing his grip. Even in his swordplay, he's getting sloppy. If he keeps progressing like this, he's going to get himself killed. Kronya, Solon... They're dead, but we still have a glut of enemies. We still have to take down the Death Knight and the Flame Emperor. Our next battle is fast approaching. I'm ready for it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ashe|I can't even imagine what it must be like inside the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I don't know either.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ashe|Well, it's probably a grave, that much is for sure. And it's likely underground. Beyond that, who knows?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|It's just a place to bury people.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ashe|I guess you're right. Holy or not, all graves are kind of the same, aren't they?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ashe|I can't help but wonder though... Just what kind of ritual is this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain|I swear, it's like you're an entirely different person.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I haven't changed on the inside.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain|Heh, I guess you're right. If I look hard, I can still tell it's you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Isn't it weird?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain| No, not at all! I'm just not used to it. It really suits you though.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain| It's not weird at all. It's... You're somehow even more beautiful than before. I'm joking! I'm joking! Don't get mad.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ingrid|You've been granted this power by the goddess herself. Truly, you must be a very special individual. Maybe Seiros transformed before receiving her revelation too!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Mercedes|Hmm. I haven't heard anything about that before... Maybe that part never found its way into the legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ingrid|It is told that Seiros had a revelation instructing her to use her power for good, and to lead the people of Fódlan to salvation... I wonder what sort of revelation you might have, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Annette|Bah! Professor! Sorry, this will take some getting used to... Your hair and eye color are completely different! You just don't look like yourself anymore.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|It's only my appearance that has changed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Annette|Of course. You're right. I'm just being silly, as usual.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Maybe I am a different person...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Annette|Don't scare me like that! You are still you...right? You are, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lorenz|To be honest, I cannot keep up with all that's been happening recently. Monica was actually Kronya. Tomas was actually Solon. Who were these people? What about you, Professor? You are a true ally, yes?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|That's my intention.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lorenz|Not the most convincing answer you could have given. Still, I simply must take you at your word.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lorenz|Pull yourself together! It is still your duty to lead us, is it not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Raphael|You look so...different. You're still our professor in there, right? Did anything else change besides your hair and eyes? Are your arms bigger? How do your abs look?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I've changed quite a bit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Raphael|Really?! You gotta teach me how to do that!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I haven't changed that much.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Raphael|That's disappointing. What's even the point?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ignatz|So, this month's mission is to take part in a ritual at the Holy Tomb, where you will receive a revelation from the goddess herself. What if she really appears? What if I finally get to gaze upon her radiance? I've always imagined the goddess--how beautiful she must be!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ignatz|You're going to the ritual at the Holy Tomb, right? I hear that a revelation from the goddess is expected. What if she shows herself? I'll be so jealous!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lysithea|Your hair! And your eyes! What happened to you?! You didn't lose something as a result of gaining those powers, did you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Don't worry—I'm fine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lysithea|I see. Well, that makes me feel better. But still, be careful.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I don't know yet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lysithea|Sometimes our frail bodies don’t do well with excess power… So don’t push yourself too hard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Marianne|Long ago, Saint Seiros was gifted with a divine revelation from the goddess, as well as incredible power. Is that what happened to you too, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hilda|No way! The professor transformed before receiving any kind of divine revelation, right? Still, I wonder. Does the fact that you've changed really mean you've been granted some kind of power?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Marianne|If that's the case, then what sort of revelation can be gained from the ritual?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hilda|I'm guessing the revelation will just be a gentle reminder to use this new power to save the people of Fódlan. What else is there to say? You don't actually believe we're going to hear the voice of the goddess, do you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Leonie|When you changed, even the other professors were taken completely by surprise. There's a ritual at the Holy Tomb this month, isn't there? I wonder what will happen with that. I'm sure you'll be all right. But don't lose sight of who you really are, OK? However you may change, and whatever new power goes along with those changes--you'll still be the same person, deep down. Remember that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|You haven't a thing to worry about. You have been gifted the power of the goddess. Furthermore, you have overcome the death of your father, Jeralt...and you have destroyed countless of our wicked foes. I am proud...so very proud of who you have become.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Thank you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Once we finish the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum, all will be well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I'm uneasy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|That is understandable. Just know that your unease should disappear the moment we conclude the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|Hmm... Ah. It is you. I am sorry, but I have a lot on my mind. I would prefer to be alone right now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flayn|Professor, I am so happy. Your new hair and eye color suit you well. We make quite the pair! But...recently I sense that things are a bit strained between Lady Rhea and my brother. She wants to do something at the Holy Tomb. I do not know what, but... Hm. Whenever it has concluded, I hope they will return to their friendship, as it has always been...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Alois|Captain... Oh, Professor! How long have you been standing there? I didn't see you. I was just sorting through Captain Jeralt's belongings. I... Haven't made much progress. I keep finding things that bring back memories. Clearing out this room of his belongings again, it's... It's not easy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Catherine|In our battle last month, we really cut the enemy down to size. But there are other enemies we have yet to hunt down, not the least the Flame Emperor. Once we've crushed them all, we can return to our peaceful lives at the monastery. It will happen soon. I have a feeling something big is coming.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Shamir|People who live an inordinately long time, people whose hair changes color, and those odd Heroes' Relics... Is Fódlan some mystical land full of inhuman creatures?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|It's not like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Shamir|You still look human. For now, at least.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Is the world different outside Fódlan?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Shamir|You should see for yourself. I'd recommend exploring west of the Empire.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Gilbert|Sometimes, I find myself thinking I should leave Garreg Mach and return to my home... Where I should have been all along.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Where you should have been?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Gilbert|Ignore me. I'm sorry...it's a silly thing. An old man's ramblings, and nothing more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I won't stop you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Gilbert|I hear that Lady Rhea will accompany you for this month's task. She's the pillar that supports the hearts of Fódlan's people. Her safety is paramount. I hope there are no complications...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hanneman|Are you positive? Really? Your appearance is due to the influence of the Crest of Flames? Intriguing. Unfortunately, I have found no record of Nemesis's hair and eye color ever changing. However... If that transformation was brought on, in part, by the power of the Crest, that would be most... Well, I suppose interesting is too small a word. Still, it would be an absolutely exceptional discovery. To know for certain, we must investigate further. So, clothes off!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hanneman|What? A full physical is in order, yes? We need to know if this transformation affected you adversely. Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Manuela|The Holy Tomb, huh? I've worked here for years, and this is the first I've heard of it. I mean, it does make some sense. Sort of. Something about it is still weird. I understand now why they'd build the monastery in the mountainous center of Fódlan. Although... When the monastery was built, the Kingdom and the Alliance weren't even around yet. But look how cleverly it was placed right in the middle of the Empire, Kingdom, and Alliance. That's weird, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Cyril|When I first saw you, Professor, with that hair color and that eye color? I thought you looked kind of like Lady Rhea. Like maybe you could be related. I like the way it looks! I wonder if I could change my hair color too... Maybe if I tried hard enough. If I thought real hard about it, I mean.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|That would be exciting, wouldn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Cyril|All I need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape, right? Just like you did.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|You don't need to do that, Cyril.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Cyril|I might not need to, but I still wanna.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Anna|Hey, Professor. You seem...different. Lots of things seem...different around here lately. I've noticed it. Have you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Although I suppose...you are something to report! For a moment, I thought you were someone suspicious! Lucky for you, I am quite perceptive. It took only that single moment for me to recognize you.  The professor went out and got some new power!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Professor, will you join me? There's something I must do. It will take a few days, but I promise we'll be back in time for the ceremony at the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Where are we going?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|It's meant to be a secret, but...I'm going to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. There is something I must do there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I'll go with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Thank you, my teacher.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Father, forgive me for asking this of you. I know how much pain you're in--how the burden of the throne weighs heavily on you--and so--|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Emperor Ionius Ix|There is no need to apologize, Edelgard. You must know...  that I do not have much time left in this world. The time has come.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Thank you, Father. Now, to complete the Imperial succession, you must relinquish your crown here in the throne room. The archbishop of the Church of Seiros would normally act as witness, but my professor will fill that role instead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Emperor Ionius Ix|Edelgard...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|From this day forward, the weight of the Empire's future shall rest upon my shoulders. All that I do will be for the benefit of the people of Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Emperor Ionius Ix|Edelgard von Hresvelg, the crown is yours. By the covenant between the red blood and the white sword, and by the double-headed eagle upon your head, I hereby pronounce you the new emperor. Are you prepared to take those responsibilities as your own?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|In accordance with the ancient covenant, and in keeping with the Hresvelg legacy... I swear that upon this throne, I shall use my reign to lead Fódlan to a new dawn and achieve peace for all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Emperor Ionius Ix|The Imperial succession is complete.  My daughter, I regret that I could not do more for you. When you were stolen away to the Kingdom, when the prime minister did those horrible things, I could only watch in horror.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|I-- I understand, Father. In those dark times, your eyes and your fists were my salvation. Within your eyes, I saw true care. And upon your fists clenched tight with indignity, I saw the blood that dripped and fell. Even as I bled, I felt that you, too, must also be bleeding.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Duke Aegir|Your Majesty! You must not leave your sleeping chambers in your condition.  Ah, Edelgard. I did not expect to find Your Highness here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Prime Minister, you have misspoken. I am no longer Your Highness but rather...Your Majesty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Duke Aegir|I-Impossible!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Emperor Ionius Ix|It is true. Edelgard is the new emperor of the Adrestian Empire. We will summon the officials,  and prepare an ordinance at once. And you, Prime Minister--|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|--are dismissed. It will be some time before you are allowed to make contact with the outside world again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Duke Aegir|No! How can this be?! I- Understood, Your Majesty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Emperor Ionius Ix|Edelgard... My dear El, I leave the fate of Fódlan...  in your capable hands.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Father...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Thank you for staying by my side, Professor. Now that I'm the emperor, it's time to grasp my destiny. After the ceremony at the Holy Tomb, I must return to Enbarr. This may be the last we see of each other. We are out of time, my teacher. Everyone is waiting for us. We must go.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|A revelation from the goddess... To think we'll have the honor of attending such a historical event.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|I hear the archbishop will accompany us to the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ingrid|If something happens to her, all of Fódlan will suffer. We must protect her at all costs.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|This may sound mad, but perhaps we don't have to worry so much about that. Lady Rhea has said before that she is capable of protecting herself. I have a felling that is true. I thought it was a strange thing for her to say. and beyond that, her movements bring to mind a great warrior with an extensive military background.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Who is Rhea, really?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|If so, we have nothing to fear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|I wonder. Mind it's also possible that I'm way off track. Regardless, perhaps we should brace ourselves for anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ashe|I never imagined attending a ceremony for real revelation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Mercedes|I wonder what the ceremony will be like. I'm so nervous. I'm not ready for this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Felix|There's no chance for battle unless something goes terribly wrong, right? How boring.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain|If you keep saying things like that, something bad is bound to happen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Annette| What's wrong, Flayn? You look like you have something on your mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flayn|Who, me? No, it is nothing. May we all see this through to the end.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue| Your Highness, I will protect you no matter what.  Your Highness?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Lost in thought?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|You haven't seemed like yourself lately...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Hm? Ah, I suppose you could say that. Nothing to worry about. It's about time for Lady Rhea to arrive. Let's all steel ourselves for whatever may occur at this ceremony.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|You're going to receive the goddess's revelation at the Holy Tomb? That's news to me. I did not see that coming.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hilda|Lady Rhea's going too, right? I hear it will be well-guarded, but it is that really okay?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ignatz|If Solon's allies are still around, it's certainly true that we don't know when or where they may appear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Leonie|I don't know what type of place this Holy Tomb is, but we should be cautious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Raphael|If something happens, we'll have to take matters into our own hands.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hilda|What do you think, Professor? Is it really okay for Lady Rhea to attend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I'm worried.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|It seems to be tightly sealed, I'll give you that. We should be fine as long as nothing goes terribly wrong. Yep… Just as long as nothing goes wrong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|It's encouraging.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|Leave it to our fearless leader to shrewdly factor in Rhea's fighting ability. You're bold, Teach. I love it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|Well, the truth is, we won't know what's going on until it happens. All we can do is stay on our guard and play it by ear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lorenz|That's quite enough babbling, Claude. There is nobody more unfit for a holy ceremony than you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Marianne|Um, divine punishment won't strike us for setting foot in the Holy Tomb, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lysithea|Good grief. Why are you always so negative?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lysithea|Hm? Flayn, is something on your mind?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flayn|Who, me? No, it is nothing. May we all see this through to the end.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|It still doesn't make sense to me. A goddess was living inside Teach, right? But now there's a ceremony to receive a revelation or whatever. How could that be necessary anymore? There must be another objective.  It's pointless to speculate about it now. We'll know the answer soon enough. There isn't any danger for us students, but… be careful, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|To think there was such a vast space beneath the monastery all this time. It's hard imagine that any of these enormous contraptions are of this world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|This is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest, along with her children.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|It is said that our creator, the goddess Sothis, sat upon this very throne. Professor, do you recognize this throne?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|So long... I have waited so very long for this day. Sit upon the throne. I have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I do not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|There is no need to hide anything from me. You have seen it, haven’t you? In a dream...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Well?  It was supposed to be but a step away. What could possibly be missing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard| Stop right there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Metodey| Don't move, any of you. If you move, your lives will be forfeit. Thank you ever so much for guiding us this far. The Imperial army will now take possession of everything in the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dorothea|What's the Imperial army doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ferdinand|Wait! Does he work for the Flame Emperor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Linhardt|So the Flame Emperor's connected to the Empire. I never thought that possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Bernadetta|Edelgard, did you know about this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Yes. In fact, I gave the order. I am the Flame Emperor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hubert|I guess that's the end of play-at-school, Lady Edelgard. I mean, Your Majesty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Metody|Get to work, everyone! The Crest Stones belong to us now! And take those filthy bones, too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Insolence! You will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place.  Professor, destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Caspar|Wait! What's the meaning of this, Edelgard?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Petra| You... made use of us? Why?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|I'm sorry, my teacher. I cut this path, and now I must follow it. My friends, I ask that all of you stay back. It is not my intention to fight you.  By order of the Adrestian emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, I command you to collect the Crest Stones! If anyone attempts to stop us, kill them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Incredible. To think such a vast space has been hiding beneath the monastery all this time. I wonder what powers that giant mechanism that descends beneath the ground.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|This is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest, along with her children.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|It is said that our creator, the goddess Sothis, sat upon this very throne. Professor, do you recognize this throne?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|So long... I have waited so very long for this day. Sit upon the throne. I have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I do not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|There is no need to hide anything from me. You have seen it, haven’t you? In a dream...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Well?  It was supposed to be but a step away. What could possibly be missing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Halt! Reveal yourself!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Metodey| Don't move, any of you. If you move, your lives will be forfeit. Thank you ever so much for guiding us this far. The Imperial army will now take possession of everything in the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|Why is the Imperial Army here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ingrid|This can't be. How did they get into Garreg Mach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain|Even the Flame Emperor is here. That can only mean--|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Felix|The Flame Emperor is connected to the Empire. What do you know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|I never imagined you'd have the nerve to return here. What are you after, Flame Emperor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|Is it not obvious? The Holy Tomb contains great power; the power to rule all of Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|And to attain that power, you'll trample anything that stands in your way, just like you did in Duscur!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|I had nothing to do with that.  Quickly, retrieve the Crest Stones! Kill for them if you must.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Insolence! You will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place.  Professor, destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|That mechanism for descending underground back there... What powers it? When I tried to come by myself, it wouldn't even budge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|This is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest, along with her children.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|It is said that our creator, the goddess Sothis, sat upon this very throne. Professor, do you recognize this throne?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|So long... I have waited so very long for this day. Sit upon the throne. I have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I do not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|There is no need to hide anything from me. You have seen it, haven’t you? In a dream...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Well?  It was supposed to be but a step away. What could possibly be missing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|Sorry to disturb you when you're distressed, Archbishop, but it seems some uninvited guests have arrived.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Metodey| Don't move, any of you. If you move, your lives will be forfeit. Thank you ever so much for guiding us this far. The Imperial army will now take possession of everything in the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ignatz|The Imperial Army? What are they doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lysithea|So, they knew we were heading to the Holy Tomb and followed us here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hilda|Hey, who is that standing next to the angry guy? Could that be--|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|The Flame Emperor. I see. So you've been allied with the Empire from the beginning.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Leonie|What are they doing here? What do they hope to gain?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|There's only one goal for grave robbers like these, right, Flame Emperor? You're here to steal the treasure that rests within the Holy Tomb.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|For a fool, you catch on quickly. Those Crest Stones will be ours. That infernal power, which is masquerading as a medicine but is truly a poison, will plague this world no longer.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Insolence! You will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place.  Professor, destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|I will not allow such violence from the Empire! Strike down the rebels and protect the Holy Tomb!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Metodey|The Crest Stones are in the caskets! Open every last one of them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|The Holy Tomb must not be desecrated! Protect as many of the Crest Stones as you can!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Heretics! What could be gained from desecrating these tombs and disgracing the dead?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|I guess we're fighting over who gets those Crest Stones… What in the world do they intend to use them for, anyway?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Take away every last one of those Crest Stones.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|That is enough! Do you even know what those stones are?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|Take away the Crest Stones. All of them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|That is enough! Do you even know what those stones are?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Metodey|I'm told it's fine to kill those who resist. Now then, how shall I cook you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Metodey|Wait... No! I was just following orders! I just... Graaargh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Despite what I said, I have no intention of killing you. So why not stand down and get out of my way?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|So the end has come...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Professor, I will make no excuses. Thank you for all that you did for me. In truth-- No. Let's leave it at that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|You could have had a peaceful life... Why did you have to come to Garreg Mach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|You wish to interfere? Then your life is forfeit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|You are the one person I did not wish to make an enemy of...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Do not try to say you have forgotten... Do you know just how many people died in Duscur?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|Why bother with this? Stay silent and fight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|So you want to turn your eyes away from the lives you have trampled? Dastard! You are a monster. The lowliest beast I have ever known.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|So, you're the fabled Flame Emperor? Go ahead and enlighten me. What are you planning to do with the Crest Stones? What did you use Flayn's blood for? Who's Kronya? Who's Solon?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|Silence. There is no need for you to know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|Is it that mask that's to blame for your curtness? If so, maybe I should rip it off and ask again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Flame Emperor|Ugh...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|So the end has come...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|Is this some sick joke? The Flame Emperor is actually Edelgard?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Is this some kind of twisted joke?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|I've been looking for you... I will take that head from your shoulders, and hang it from the gates of Enbarr!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Imperial Soldier|Stop right there!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Before I break your neck, there is one thing I must ask you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Stay out of my way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|I don't recall giving you permission to speak. Answer my question. That is all you have left to do. Flame Emperor...no. Edelgard. Tell me now. Why did you cause such a tragedy?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|You killed your own mother, and yet you haven't even had the decency to stop and consider the reasons behind your actions. Have you?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|I already told you, I had nothing to do with that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Ha! It was foolish to think I could reason with a lowly beast.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Imperial Soldier|Your Majesty, now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|You are a monster...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Come, Hubert!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished! You have defiled the Holy Tomb, dishonored the goddess, and humiliated your brethren. That crime will never be erased, even if you burn in the eternal flames, and spill all of your blood into the goddess's soil!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|Ngah...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Are you OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|I can't believe it. Edelgard...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|We weren't able to defeat her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|Your Highness...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|I will kill Edelgard. With my own hands. I swear it!  Let's return to the monastery, Professor. It is clear what must be done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|You have disappointed me, Edelgard. To think that a descendant of House Hresvelg would dare betray the holy church...  Professor, kill Edelgard at once. She is a danger to all of Fódlan. Such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|I have achieved my objective. I will retreat. Farewell, Professor. If we meet again, it will be on the battlefield.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Come, Hubert!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished! You have defiled the Holy Tomb, dishonored the goddess, and humiliated your brethren. That crime will never be erased, even if you burn in the eternal flames, and spill all of your blood into the goddess's soil!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|I'm not exactly on friendly terms with the princess, but I do have a few questions for her. Edelgard said that the Crest Stones represent power. That means she knows how to use them. She almost certainly knows other secrets of Fódlan as well... Once things calm down a bit, there's a lot more that Rhea needs to tell us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|I just hope there's still time. I have this strange feeling... that history is being written. That an age of anarchy is upon us. Let's hope I'm mistaken.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|You have disappointed me, Edelgard. To think that a descendant of House Hresvelg would dare betray the holy church...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|So, it is my teacher who stands in my way. I always knew it would come to this...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Professor, kill Edelgard at once. She is a danger to all of Fódlan. Such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|I will withdraw... for now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Come, Hubert!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished! You have defiled the Holy Tomb, dishonored the goddess, and humiliated your brethren. That crime will never be erased, even if you burn in the eternal flames, and spill all of your blood into the goddess's soil!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|You... How dare you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard| My teacher, I-- Thank you! But are you certain that-- No, now isn't the time for discussion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hubert|Words cannot properly express my gratitude, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Rhea|So, this is the choice you have made. You are just another failure. Your presence soils this Holy Tomb, and disgraces my brethren. I will not allow one who would lend our enemies strength... to wield the power of the goddess Sothis. I have passed judgement. And now, I shall rip your chest open... and TAKE BACK YOUR HEART MYSELF!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hubert| That must be the Immaculate One...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|Yes. The monsters that have controlled Fódlan in secret for far too long. Rhea is their leader.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hubert|There is no time to waste. Your Majesty, Professor, we must escape while we can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|Edelgard and Hubert have disappeared. They will surely return to the Empire. The knights have been dispatched to search and investigate. If there is any movement, we will know. We cannot ignore the possibility that there will soon be open hostilities between us and the Imperial army. When that happens, are you prepared to fight your own? If you wish to return to the Empire, I will not stop you. That is your choice to make.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ferdinand|If Edelgard is acting afoul, then we have no choice but to strike her down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Caspar|It's up to us to stop them! We have a war on our hands!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Linhardt|I have no interest in fighting, not even for her. And yet--|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Bernadetta|How are we supposed to decide just like that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dorothea|Edie, Hubie, I'm sorry about this, but... I'm siding with the professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Petra|Her doings are wrong. It is our duty to make everything right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|I am sure you all have much on your mind. I encourage you to confer with your professor and make a decision. You have until the fighting commences.  Professor, I am depending on your strength for the safety of Fódlan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Edelgard|The leaders of the church have misused its creed to fulfill their true desire - to rule the world. They have fooled the people of Fódlan. Long ago, they divided the Empire to create a Kingdom, and then, divided that Kingdom to create an Alliance. They did all of this to make the masses bicker amongst themselves. They caused instability in order to reinforce their own authority. They gathered gold and lived in extravagance. How? By preying on the devotion of those who wished for the goddess's salvation! Those corrupt hypocrites cannot lead Fódlan to true peace! Their foul belief system must be torn asunder so that true wisdom may finally prevail! And so, I have decided-- by order of the Adrestian Emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg-- the Empire hereby declares war on the Church of Seiros!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|I cannot believe it... Let us recount the situation as it stands, Professor. After you returned from the Holy Tomb... the Adrestian Empire declared war upon the Church of Seiros, as well as our allies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Declared war?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Seteth|Edelgard demanded her own father relinquish the throne, and then assumed the position of emperor. She has deemed the Church of Seiros to be an evil of this world, and is calling upon the people of Fódlan to help her tear it down. I must discuss our response to this declaration with the archbishop after the knights return from their investigation. Until then, watch over the students. See that they remain calm.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Felix|So... He's finally shown his true face. The same Dimitri I've seen once before–a beast who loves spilling blood.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ingrid|You're wrong! I'm sure of it. There has to be an explanation...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain|I knew he'd been carrying the burden of that tragedy. I understand his thirst for revenge. His family and closest friends...all massacred right in front of him. But...it still doesn't add up. There must be more that we don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Mercedes|That's true. Dimitri didn't come unhinged until after the Flame Emperor was unmasked...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ashe|You don't think...there's some connection between those two...do you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|Professor. The Empire has declared war on the Church of Seiros.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain|We knew this day would come, sooner or later.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Annette|What's going to happen?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Don't worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|We need more information.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ingrid|We can't afford to be optimistic. It's entirely possible the Kingdom will be invaded.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Sylvain|Settle yourself, Ingrid. We need to carefully consider our options.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Ashe|We can't just act rashly. That will only make things worse.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dedue|One we've ascertained the situation, we must return to Fhirdiad.  Your Highness...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Dimitri|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|I heard what happened, Teach. The princess-- well, the emperor now-- she really did it, didn't she? The lords and dukes of both the Kingdom and the Alliance have been called out, and now have to choose between the Church and the Empire. The seed of conflict was always there, and now we find ourselves in the middle of a war that will tear Fódlan in two.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Lysithea|The Empire is rash, but I never thought it would come to this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Leonie|How could something like this happen? I hope everyone back home is safe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Hilda|I'm sure it's mass confusion at home right now. My brother must be worried sick about me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Only time will tell.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Byleth|Let's calm down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|11-ThroneOfKnowledge|Claude|You're absolutely right, Teach. I'm sure a lot of us are worried about our homes, but... all we can do now is prepare for battle... and tread carefully.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Shamir|That's what we're dealing with. Is there no chance it's an infectious disease?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Manuela|There are no absolutes in medicine, but the chances are extremely slim. Restless movements, fits of violence, becoming bedridden or even impossible to wake... With symptoms that varied, there are only a few possibilities. It's either a mixture of poisons or magic. And dark magic, at that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|You're talking about Remire Village, aren't you, Manuela?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Manuela|Oh my, if it isn't Jeralt. Tell me, what was the first thing you heard?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Everything after you mentioned that it's not likely it's an infectious disease. My child and I owe the people of Remire Village. If something's happening there, we must help them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Shamir|We scouted the area ourselves. Speak with the knights. Hear what they have to say. I must go. Thank you for your help, Manuela.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Manuela|You know, I'm more than willing to go with you to Remire Village... After all, I owe you my life. If you'd like, I bet we could even manage the mission all by ourselves. Just the two of us...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|That's nice of you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Manuela|Professor! A bit of a tease, are we? A girl could get used to this side of you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I'm afraid not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Manuela|You're saying no? Well, aren't you just a great, big bore.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Nice try, but I'll be going to the village as well. Enough nonsense. It's time to move out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Manuela|As you like. Good-bye, Jeralt. Good-bye, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|I'll be in my office making preparations. What about you? If you have the time, it would be helpful if you could go ahead and talk to the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Hey! What's wrong?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I'm OK.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I just got a little dizzy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|If anything feels off, return to the infirmary. No need to just grin and bear it. Got it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|Ugh... What could have caused such dizziness? I felt it too. Actually... I've felt that way before...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|You look unwell. It's because of what happened, isn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Don't speak of it aloud.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|You can't change the past. For now, all we can do is use it to our advantage.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|I know that. I also know that I must steel myself to ascend the Imperial throne.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|Those preparations are going well. We... Someone is coming.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Professor, I heard about our mission for this month. Something terrible is happening in Remire Village. That's where you were when fate sent you our way. This feels...preordained.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|Are the knights making progress with their investigation?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|They are.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|If what is happening there is by design, there must be someone pulling the strings. There is the Death Knight, of course. And the mysterious mages who were implicated with the Western Church. They showed up when Flayn was kidnapped as well. And now there is another strange occurrence near the monastery... It seems an unknown organization hopes to make the monastery its stage for something.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Do you believe that all of these incidents are connected, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|That is the logical conclusion, but I'm not so sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I do not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Oh? I'm surprised to hear you say that, but actually, I agree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|It certainly appears that all of the events surrounding the monastery are connected by a single thread. However... I think it's possible that it may just be a result of different motives overlapping. Remember, Professor... If you think of people as simply enemies or allies, it may be impossible to grasp the truth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|I see. So you'll be staying here for some time, then. Honestly, I'm surprised. I've heard it's been a few years since you last donated to the church.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lord Arundel|That was merely because of the financial situation of my territory. I assure you, it has nothing to do with my dedication to the church. By the way, Dimitri... Isn't Edelgard currently enrolled at the Officers Academy as well?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Yes. She's in the Black Eagle House. I don't believe she has any plans to leave anytime soon. Why not pay her a visit?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lord Arundel|I may do just that. It's nice to stay in touch with my dear niece every now and then. Of course I'm also delighted that I was able to speak with my nephew, as well. Whether through marriage or otherwise, family is family, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Of course. The feeling is mutual.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Professor... If you were watching, you should have made your presence known.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Who was that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|That was Lord Arundel, the Regent for the Empire. He is also Edelgard's uncle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|An acquaintance of yours?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|He called you his nephew...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|My stepmother was his younger sister. We are not related by blood, but he is technically my uncle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|In other words...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|So, you and Edelgard...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Yes. My stepmother was Edelgard's birth mother. Edelgard and I are siblings by marriage. We can delve into that topic another time. For now, let's make preparations to investigate what's happening in that village.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|Oh dear. The princess of the Empire and the Kingdom's prince are kin! How very odd.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|So that's why he was worried about her...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|All beings are attached somehow to those who are their family. Yes...even I. I must have had a family too... I wish I could remember them. My family... I wonder who and where they are, and what they're doing now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I find it odd as well...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|They likely harbor knowledge they do not wish to share. Oh yes, I'm sure of it. But I suppose we must wait until the time of truth arrives...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|In any case... About this Arundel. You've heard that name before, correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|In the library.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|Quite true! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|In the office.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|Your memory is worse than mine! The library! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been. Don't you recall?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|I thought that Arundel had died... And yet, not so. He seems alive and well. I wonder what the prince had hoped to learn from reading of his uncle's charity... So many things the prince has yet to tell... How bothersome...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Tomas doesn't seem to be here... Oh well, that's fine. I've been researching the Heroes' Relics a lot since we last spoke to him. I found out something interesting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Why have you been researching them?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Why? Do you have to ask? Trust me, what really matters is what I found out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Something interesting?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|It's about the connection between Crests and the Heroes' Relics. The Crest Stone of each Relic is carved with a specific Crest-the one that has the ability to wield it properly. The Crests are the keys. You need the right one to safely use a Hero's Relic. The only thing I can't figure out is...why doesn't the Sword of the Creator have a Crest Stone bearing a Crest?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It's by the whim of the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Hey, now! No need to write off my findings by saying it's a mere whim of the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It had one in the past.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Precisely. At least, that's my current guess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|There's more. I believe the Crest Stones might be the source of the Relics' inhuman power. When Miklan transformed into a Black Beast, he was taken over by something that originated from the Crest Stone. And the Crest Stone was on his body. It all seems to add up. Now, look at this picture I found in the library.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|That creature is called the Immaculate One, who was supposedly sent by the goddess to save the followers of Seiros. See the pattern on its brow, and the faint circular boundary? Isn't it possible that's a Crest Stone? If all this is true, then Crest Stones are what power the ability to assume massive forms like that of the Immaculate One. And maybe the Heroes' Relics can harness that transformative power...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|Oh. It is you. Have you seen Tomas recently?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|No such luck. I was hoping to speak with him myself, but he seems to be out on the town.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|I see. Well... Hm?! Where did you find that picture?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|It was in the library. Why do you ask? Is it something my youthful eyes shouldn't be seeing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|No, of course not. However, that is not part of this library's collection. It must belong to Tomas. It would be problematic if it got mixed in with the other books. I will take possession of it for now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude| Take it away where no one can see it, you mean...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|What was that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|That's what Tomas said. He said records that the monastery doesn't approve of tend to disappear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|Tomas said that? Preposterous. I have far too much to accomplish to waste time with this foolishness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|He was certainly in a hurry. I wonder if he's off to confront Tomas. Well, he took the picture, so I guess that's that for now. I'll see you later, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|So, the church is hiding something after all. Some massive secret about Relics and Crests. A secret that must have something to do with the professor's true identity...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|I do not know why it is so, but being here makes me feel quite...unwell. I am so sleepy...and a bit... It is a struggle merely to stay conscious... Are you feeling the same?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I am.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|And yet, it feels familiar... As though pulled from a corner of my memory, from a time long ago... I simply cannot fathom it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I am not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|Why must you be so difficult! I know the entire contents of your heart and soul, so you should know there is no fooling me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|They say that things rarely if ever go according to plan. Still, plan we must. After all, if we don't effectively force things to go our way, nothing will be achieved. How about you, Professor? Are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I am.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Your character must be stronger than most.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I am not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|That's surprising... but I suppose it's possible you're telling the truth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|They say that things rarely if ever go according to plan. Still, plan we must. After all, if we don't effectively force things to go our way, nothing will be achieved. How about you, Professor? Are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|I'm sorry to ask this of you...but I would deeply appreciate it if you would promise to keep my association with Edelgard to yourself. It is a...complicated history, what she and I share.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Professor, you seem unwell. How are you faring? If you're not feeling well, I'd strongly recommend some rest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Even if I spend all my time rummaging through this library, there's a limit to the knowledge that can be gained. Apparently, it only contains books whose contents have been deemed appropriate by the church. If only Tomas were around. I bet he has some interesting stories he could regale us with…|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|What in the world is happening in Remire Village? I hear even the knights have been dispatched. I hope it's nothing too serious… After all, that's where we first met. I have valued memories of that place.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|Need something, Professor? I was just asking Monica here to be less demanding of Lady Edelgard's time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Monica|Hey, it's not like I'm bothering her! Sorry for the ruckus, Professor. Please don't worry about it too much. Nooothing to worry about here!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|Ugh. I wish you would worry about it a little more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ferdinand|Remire Village... Is that not where you met Edelgard? If you had not been there, something terrible could have happened. Did one of the house leaders know that mercenaries were staying in Remire Village? I wonder... It will remain a mystery for now. All we can do at this point is speculate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Linhardt|I fear I may become a social recluse soon... My life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall. Although, I guess a real recluse wouldn't leave their room, eh? That would be me if you weren't my teacher, locked away in my room, reading napping, never to be seen. You know I never see Bernadetta outside of class. I wonder what it is that she does in her room all day.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Linhardt|I fear I may become a social recluse soon... My life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall. Although, I guess a real recluse wouldn't leave their room, eh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Caspar|Hey, Professor. Did you see that my father came by during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? He left soon after, but I saw him talking to Edelgard first. I wonder what they could have to talk about.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Your father?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Caspar|Yeah, he's pretty important in the Empire. I thought I mentioned it to you before? He's the Minister of Military Affairs.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Empire business, perhaps?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Caspar|I guess that would make sense. He is the Minister of Military Affairs, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Caspar|Still though... I could've sworn those two didn't get along.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Bernadetta|What is it? Sorry, I've, um... I've got a cold.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Get well soon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Bernadetta|Um. Thanks.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|No, you don't.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Bernadetta|How did you know? My act was perfect. Alas, 'tis no mere illness of the body, but a malign affliction of mine soul! So, um, back to bed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dorothea|Congratulations on winning the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Did you get a special reward? I certainly feel like I earned a special reward. Don't you, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|No. Winning is its own reward.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dorothea|I was afraid you might say that. I do wish you'd dote on me just a bit more...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dorothea|Aww... Disappointing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Petra|This is a place of mysteriousness. I have awareness of how much difference every part of the world is. In a place alike to this place, you can imagine the goddess of Fódlan truly existing. At times, I miss those places in Brigid. At times... I am missing those places so painfully.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|All this month, His Highness has been going out late into the night. He will not speak of it to me. Professor, do you happen to know anything?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|As I recall...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|Lord Arundel is here? That may well explain it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|I see. I am sorry to trouble you with questions.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|His Highness's headaches have been growing steadily worse. I would prefer that he retire to bed early.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|Investigating Remire village? Be on your guard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ingrid|You know, Professor–the tournament fish, and the meal we indulged in after the Battle of the Eagle and Lion... Why, all of the food I've eaten in this monastery has been absolutely delectable. Every last bite of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Felix|Food really is the only thing you think about, huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ingrid|Hardly! I think about all sorts of things.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Felix|Oh! Like tomorrow's menu, for instance?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ashe|I'm worried about Remire. That affliction is a little too mysterious for my liking. I'm pretty sure it's not normal.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I've heard it's not an ordinary disease.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ashe|Then what could it be?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I've heard it's the work of a cursed specter.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ashe|Wh-what?! Ah! Come on, don't tease me. But what if it really was something like that? How could we hope to stop it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sylvain|I wonder how Remire Village is faring. Hopefully we're not dealing with some new epidemic. It wouldn't be unheard of. Almost 20 years ago, a terrible plague blazed through Faerghus. It even hit the capital city, taking the queen consort's life...or so I heard. The whole Kingdom was in an uproar over that loss. The person who saved the Kingdom wasn't a doctor but a holy woman–the fair Lady Cornelia. After that, she was awarded the honor of being a mage in the service of the royal family. She sounds like an amazing woman, but... She must be pretty old by now. But hey, maybe she's aged like a fine wine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Mercedes|Oh, goodness. Is something the matter, Professor? You look a little pale... Please be careful. It's so easy to catch a cold this time of year.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Annette|Hmm... The librarian is always out and about these days. And just when I had some questions about a book I'd borrowed... Ugh, now I'm so curious about where he's gone off to! He'd better come back soon...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lorenz|How are you feeling, Professor? You look rather ill, if you don't mind my saying so. Are you sick? If so, I would urge you not to push yourself too hard. Take some rest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Nothing gets by you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lorenz|Just my natural talent. Nothing out of the ordinary. Enough wit, now. You should lie down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|What an unexpected kindness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lorenz|What is that supposed to mean? Never mind. If you're not feeling well, you should stop trying to walk it off and simply lie down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Raphael|Hey, Professor. Can I get your advice on something? I just don't know what to do anymore. I used to think they were the best, but now I can't even stand looking at them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It's OK to be worried.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Raphael|But worrying about it won't solve my problems! What if I can never eat fish again?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Time heals all wounds.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Raphael|Good point, Professor. I think I need to see other meats right now. Then I can come back to fish when I'm good and ready!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ignatz|Ah, Professor! The Battle of the Eagle and Lion was such good fun, don't you think?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hilda|Ignatz, how long are you going to keep harping on about the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ignatz|Aw, come on, let me gush! Did you see how the house leaders came together after the battle? What an incredible thing to witness! Harmony, even after something so hard-fought.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hilda|True. If they can keep playing nice, perhaps there will be peace in Fódlan after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lysithea|I heard about Remire Village from some of the knights. It's certainly troubling. If it's a contagion, we at Garreg Mach should be on the lookout as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I don't believe it is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lysithea|Oh? Well, that's better, but I wonder what the real cause could be... Your words are oddly persuasive, Professor. Even if they're not exactly based on anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I'll handle it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lysithea|Your words are oddly persuasive, Professor. Even if they're not exactly based on anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Marianne|Good day, Professor. Well then, I should go.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Leonie|Professor! Captain Jeralt just told me. Remire Village is in a bad way, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|The situation there is worrying, yes... But tell me, how is your vertigo?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I'm all right now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Leonie|Were you not feeling OK? You seem fine to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|I hope you're not just saying that. We can't have you putting on a brave face only to fall in battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Still a little unsteady.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Leonie|Are you not feeling OK? You should get some rest!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Hm. If you must go to the village, make sure you're in good health before we depart.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|Professor... Do you ever wish you could return to your life as a mercenary?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|I thought you might. Traveling the world, just you and Jeralt... How lovely it must have been.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I do not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|Is that so? I suppose you have become accustomed to your new line of work. This month's assignment will again take you outside of Garreg Mach...to Remire Village.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|It was in Remire that you first met Alois and the rest of his order, was it not? Half a year has come and gone since then. How quickly time passes...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|What is it? I am in the middle of my daily duties. I assume you know by now that the Four Saints are all important figures in the teachings of Seiros... Still, I have a particular fondness for Saint Cethleann.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flayn|I am so happy to be part of your class, Professor. I honestly cannot recall the last time I interacted with others on a daily basis like this... It reminds me of when I was a child. Ha, that was so very long ago now...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|How long ago?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flayn|Oh, I mean, very. Very, very, very long ago.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|You're still a child.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flayn|Despite how young I may appear to you, I'm quite mature. You may be surprised, you know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Alois|I'm going to catch me some mighty fish, just you wait and see! I didn't catch a single fish last month. But this month! This month!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Time to give up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Alois|That's exactly what Captain Jeralt said!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Maybe you're doing something wrong?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Alois|I'm casting my line just as the captain taught me all those years ago...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Alois|You're going with the captain to investigate Remire Village, aren't you? It feels like so long ago that you two came here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Catherine|Of the four or five years since I started here, this is certainly the busiest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Shamir|It was four. I've been here five.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Catherine|Oh, what's a year here or there? Don' t be petty now, Shamir.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Shamir|You count your enemies the same way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Catherine|If I take care of them quickly, what does it matter how many there are? Oh, sorry! We didn't mean to ignore you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Shamir|As you were saying, it's been a busy year. There never seem to be enough hands for the work.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Catherine|That reminds me, do you have that thing? If you do, we want it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Shamir|Want? No. We need it. Give it to me, not her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Catherine|Hey now, I'm the one who brought it up. We may be friends, but that's just rude.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Gilbert|Professor? Tell me, is this about Remire? There are more villagers acting strangely today than yesterday. Knights have been dispatched, yet... The underlying cause is as yet unclear, and the most anyone can do is stand back and watch. It is most distressing. Professor, what do you think about all this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Some kind of illness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Gilbert|If it were indeed a disease, why would it only affect the villagers, and not infect the knights stationed there?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Some kind of conspiracy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Gilbert|In that case, we should strengthen the guards. If you visit the village, Professor, please...take care.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Punishment from the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Gilbert|The goddess?! You have spoken near blasphemy, and I would suggest a hasty apology!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hanneman|I thought we might make it through last month in peace, but no. Another incident just had to arise, didn't it? If only this debacle had to do with Crests. Why, I'd have gone and dealt with it in an instant.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Manuela|I know you figure medicine and magical healing are two ways to do the same thing, but it's way deeper than that. Medicine is all about preventing infection and suppressing symptoms with, well, medicine... That's probably obvious. But magical healing is focused on closing up wounds faster, raising a body's vital energy, stuff like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Cyril|The knights go out from Garreg Mach to take on all kinds of other duties. I'd sure like a job like that one day. Then again, I don't know... Serving Lady Rhea here is pretty good.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Oh, except that Tomas departed the monastery and is yet to return. Consider that reported. He's been gone for periods of time before and has always returned, so I'm not too worried. Still... I wonder what in the world he's doing out there!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|We've got to go. Now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|What's going on?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|OK.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|The situation in Remire Village has changed drastically. We don't know much more than that. We're hearing reports that the villagers are killing each other. Some say houses are burning. Regardless, we need to move.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rampaging Villager|Kill! Kill! Ahhhh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rampaging Villager|Haha... Hahaha... Hrngyarhh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Village Child|Help! Somebody, please help!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|What's going on here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|This is horrific. It's even more revolting...more terrible than I expected.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I'm revolted too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It really is horrifying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|True, but if we are not careful how we proceed, we will only increase the death toll.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Caspar|The villagers are all attacking each other! Let's knock them all out, one by one!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Linhardt| Always so reckless. You do know that if we mess up, we will either kill or be killed, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ferdinand|Still, we cannot just stand here twiddling our thumbs and doing nothing!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Bernadetta|I'd r-really like to go home now...but there's no time for thoughts like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dorothea|We have to help them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Petra|I am waiting for your orders with full readiness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Wait. Those people over there... They seem to be observing the chaos. They must be behind this. Eliminate them and rescue all of the unafflicted villagers.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri| Ungh...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|What's wrong with you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Are you OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|I... Don't worry about me. I'm fine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Don't waste your time on me. Saving the village is far more important. We haven't a moment to lose!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|What can we do amidst such confusion?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Felix|We'll have to take up arms against the villagers who are rampaging. If we strike carefully, it should be possible to spare their lives.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Mercedes|Oh dear... Isn't there a more peaceful way to deal with this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ingrid|No matter how long it takes, we'll need to check and rescue them all, one at a time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ashe|Those who have gone made may be victims themselves. Is it possible to save them?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Annette|Well, saving the poor people who aren't crazy is definitely our top priority! Let's get on with it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sylvain|Slow down, Annette. It won't do anyone any good if we panic and get injured ourselves.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|Isn't that... Your Highness. Suspicious figures spotted in the village. They seem to be...watching the chaos.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Are they the ones responsible for this madness? If so...it's clear what must be done. Kill them all. Don't let a single one of them escape. Sever their limbs and crush their wicked skulls!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|This is unbelievable... There's no way to tell who's lost their mind from who's mad with fear...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hilda|If we don't act quickly, things are just going to keep getting worse!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It's horrifying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hilda|I really don't want to get involved here...but we can't leave these people on their own, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|What can we do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Raphael|How about we hit them hard enough to knock them out, but not hard enough to kill them?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Ignatz|That's too reckless! But... I'll admit, I can't think of a better option.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Marianne|If some must die, just know it was by the will of the goddess...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Leonie|Stop that, Marianne! We have to save all of them. There's no way this madness is by the will of the goddess!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lorenz|Nobles are responsible for the safety of commoners. By the honor of House Gloucester, I swear that I will save them all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lysithea|Claude. There are some strange-looking people here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|So you noticed too. Look. There's a suspicious group hiding amongst the villagers. Could they be the culprits? If so...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|They will not be forgiven.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I won't let them escape.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|There you have it. Our objective is clear. Take down that suspicious group and rescue the villagers.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|There are some suspicious looking ruffians out there, but our top priority is to rescue the villagers! Got it? I'll rein in the villagers who've turned violent. You focus on rescuing the others.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|The one giving commands in the back... I'm certain that's Tomas, the librarian.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|The one giving orders to the others...isn't that Tomas, the librarian?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|It can't be… The one giving orders to the weird ruffians… Isn't that Tomas?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Tomas, what are you doing here? Dare I even ask?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Tomas. What are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Tomas! What in the world are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Tomas|I'm not Tomas. My name is Solon, the savior of all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Solon|What's the matter? So shocked you can't even speak? You were so easily fooled by my disguise… I was hiding away in Garreg Mach to get the blood of that little girl called Flayn. With her blood, we'll be one step closer to realizing our goal.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Death Knight|I'll have a bit of fun here too…|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|That's the Death Knight! He must be an ally of Tomas...or Solon, or whoever he is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Solon|They charge in without any plan whatsoever. Beasts, all of them... The experiment is over. Kill them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Solon, what have you done?! You will not escape punishment!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|... I will cut you to shreds!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|You monster! We could have saved them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rampaging Villager|Kill! Kill!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Villager|Th-thank you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|We've rescued as many as we can. Now it's time to capture Solon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Solon|Ah, the cursed Fell Star... This will be a fine opportunity to measure your power.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Solon|You are but a savage, insignificant beast... Yet you think you can kill me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Tomas! No... Solon, I will stop you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Solon|What?! If you insist on turning your blade against me, then expect no mercy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Death Knight|My pleasure... Do your best to kill me with that blade...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Death Knight|You are not the one I crave...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Death Knight|My blade craves their flesh... The weak will eventually die...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Death Knight|What are you trying to do here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|You're the one who should be answering that question. Stay out of my way!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|The Death Knight was just a distraction. Let's concentrate on killing Solon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|We let him get away... That doesn't matter now. Our top priority is to kill Solon!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|What does he want, anyway? In any case, we need to take care of Solon!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Why have you gone after this village? What are you planning?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Solon|Heh, I could have conducted this experiment on any test subjects. Now that I have what I came for, I must bid you farewell.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Wait! Damn it, he's gone...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|We let him get away... I'll survey the village. There may still be enemies in hiding.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|I...will survey the village. There may still be some survivors.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|It's over… All we can do now is focus on our next move. I'll have a look around the village. There may still be people who need our help.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|It looks like we somehow managed to sort things out. And casualties were...kept to a minimum. They said they weren't picky about who they used as their "test subjects." Because of them, the people of Remire Village...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|There you are.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|That armor. So, you're the Flame Emperor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|Yes. I believe you have met my subordinate, the Death Knight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Oh, we've met him all right. But back to you. You're the one responsible for the destruction of this village.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|Do not get the wrong idea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|What in blazes does that mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|It is true that I am working with Solon. But that does not mean our objectives are the same. Had I known they planned to do this, I would have stopped it. You have my word.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Your words are meaningless. Now, I'll have to insist you accompany us back to the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|I cannot abide that. However, if you wish to join forces, I will hear your plea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|What?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|If left to their own devices, they will commit countless more violent acts like this one. Do you not wish to prevent that? With the Sword of the Creator on our side, Solon would not be a threat...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I will join your cause.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|You are lying. I can see that you cannot contain your fury toward me. Pity.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I must refuse.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|Pity. Though not unexpected.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flame Emperor|Pray that you do not live to regret your choice.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hubert|Jeralt, Professor! Have you seen Lady Edelgard?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dedue|Jeralt. Professor. Have you seen His Highness?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Hilda|Jeralt! Professor! Have you seen Claude?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|What's wrong, kid? Huh? Damn it! He's gone...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Hey. I've been meaning to talk to you. Since coming to the monastery...you've changed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Changed?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|How so?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|You've been angry since we first arrived in Remire Village. And you look so happy when you're instructing the brats. Before the monastery, I'd never seen you bear your emotions like that. Not once.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|You might be right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It's thanks to the students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Then perhaps it's a good thing we came to the monastery, if only so I could see your face lit up like that. Or maybe there was never any reason for us to leave the monastery in the first place...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|A reason to leave?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Wasn't I born after you left the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Jeralt|Ah... I've put my foot in my mouth, haven't I? Though I suppose it may be nearly that time... Come to my office when you next have a moment to spare. There's something I need to tell you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|Just what was that about? I can't recall a time of old when you were at the monastery... I wonder what is hiding in the mist that is your past...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Professor, I don't know if this is appropriate to say, but...admirable work out there. I really believe we did all that we could.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I wish that were true.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Jeralt said the same thing. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I wasn't strong enough.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|No mortal is all powerful. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|I hear the so-called "Flame Emperor" appeared in Remire Village as well. Hubert told me that you spoke with him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|He said he wasn't involved in this incident.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|And do you believe him, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I believe him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Oh? But how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I don't believe him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|That makes sense. It's hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how they're connected to all this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Even if his words are true, his objectives are still unclear. But if the Flame Emperor should someday reveal his true intentions... Maybe then he will appear before you without his mask, and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|He asked me to join forces with him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Really? Is that what you want, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Oh? But how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I do not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|That makes sense. It's hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how they're connected to all this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|Even if he wants you as an ally, his objectives are still unclear. If the Flame Emperor truly wishes to make use of your power... Perhaps someday he will appear before you without his mask, and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Monica|Edel! I need to ask you something! Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I interrupt?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Edelgard|No, not at all. If you'll excuse me, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Professor... I...I'm sorry you saw that side of me in the village. It must have been quite a shock to you and the others. I'm mortified by my behavior. When I saw the chaos and violence there...my mind just went completely dark.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I felt the same.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|I see... So that happens to you as well, then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|You weren't yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|I see why you would say that. I always strive to keep my emotions at bay, but... Sometimes the darkness takes hold and...it's impossible to suppress. It just shows you how lacking I am... I have much to learn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|I've told you before...that some day we may find ourselves facing something we simply cannot accept. That's what the chaos in Remire Village was to me. Solon and the Flame Emperor are both beasts who must be eliminated. Demons who kill the innocent. They aren't even human at this point.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|The Flame Emperor said he wasn't involved.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|And you believed him?! He doesn't deserve our forgiveness. He became an accomplice when he refused to turn himself in and return with us to the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Where is this anger coming from?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|It must be hard to fathom. It's true that I don't have any strong connection to those villagers. And yet...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|You see, Professor... I saw the same flames of torment just four years ago...in Duscur.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Kingdom General|Please! Have mercy!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Kingdom Soldier|Gah, the pain! Make the burning stop! Help me... Somebody...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Lambert|Avenge us! Those who killed us... Tear them apart! Destroy them all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Ugh... Gah... My father...my stepmother... Four years ago, they lost their lives to those flames. I'll never forget... I still remember their faces. Their screams. The tortured last moments of every person who died that day... But right now...all that matters is that we do whatever we can to help the surviving villagers get back to their normal lives.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Dimitri|Thank you. For everything.  There's a reason that I came to the Officers Academy. Just one reason. I came here for revenge. And one day, I will have it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Hey, Teach. That assignment wasn't my favorite, I've got to admit. I suppose pretending to be unaffected doesn't do anyone any good. That was terrible to behold. It's always hard to see innocents die.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I wasn't strong enough.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Hey, all you can do is keep smiling. Keep marching. That's part of a leader's job. You can't give in to despair. Not just for me or for you, but for all of us in the Golden Deer House. We have to keep smiling so the others can move forward too. As long as we don't show that we're disheartened, they'll know they can make it too. That's what matters.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Sorry for getting ahead of myself, Teach. That's how I feel, but how you handle it is really up to you. By the way... I hear that guy who calls himself the Flame Emperor showed up in Remire Village. I couldn't believe it when Hilda told me the news. What could he be after?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|The Heroes' Relics.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Maybe. After all, he was after the Sword of the Creator in the Holy Mausoleum... But then they kidnapped Flayn and used her blood for their recent attack. Based on that, we should probably assume that their true objective is something other than the Relics. Don't you think?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|You have a point.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|What do they want with Flayn's blood?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|They called this incident "an experiment." And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. Sadly, that's all we can assume. There are far too many things we still don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|World domination.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Ha! I know I just laughed, but that really isn't funny, Teach. World domination... Hm. OK, actually... I wonder. They called this incident "an experiment." And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. I hate to even consider it, but if they can replicate the incident at Remire Village on an even larger scale... If we're not careful, we'll have a full-scale war on our hands. Then world domination wouldn't be a joke anymore.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|I was afraid you'd say that. Frankly, there's way too much that we still don't know. They called this incident "an experiment." And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. Sadly, that's all we can assume.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Flayn! Your timing is impeccable. Would you care to join us for a while, fair lady?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Flayn|Wha--? Why?! Oh my!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Damn. She gave us the slip. In any case, I doubt she knows the full story. It seems more like she has something on her mind that she can't divulge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|You're pushing too hard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|We can't go easy on her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Whoa, there. Settle yourself, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Claude|Seems like it would be better to push Seteth for an explanation. Or, best of all, to go above his head and ask Rhea... Now that we know Tomas was an enemy, we can't be sure that exposing the church's secrets would be to our benefit. Where are the answers I seek? Where are they...|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|You did well handling that awful business in Remire Village. I am certain the goddess shares in our grief at the senselessness of that calamity. More importantly, I was shocked to hear that our own Tomas was actually a dark mage. I must reflect on our blindness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|You surely must! You failed to notice that a rat was hiding in your home. Pathetic! Who are these wicked foes? How did Tomas escape your gaze?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Who are these villains?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|Why did Tomas come to the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|Tomas came to the monastery 40 years ago, by recommendation of House Ordelia of the Alliance. Around eight years ago he went back to House Ordelia before returning to the monastery once again just last year. After having worked at Garreg Mach for decades, why would he betray us now? Just what did he hope to accomplish? Jeritza became a professor at the Officers Academy because of a recommendation from the Imperial nobility. Supposing that he is the Death Knight, that means that our enemy is an organization that has taken root in at least two territories.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|In the long history of the Church of Seiros... No, long before even that... There have been an endless number of threats to the peace of Fódlan. Yet, those who oppose us still operate in the shadows, their identities a mystery. I believe that Solon and the Death Knight are merely one part of a much larger whole.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|A threat to Fódlan's peace? That means we have no choice. We have to stop them all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|What now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|Without knowing what their objective is, we cannot afford to act recklessly. The knights will investigate. For now, you and your class should focus on your training.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|They must be stopped.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|I have truly come to rely on you. I believe that the monastery will remain safe so long as we have you. We do not yet know the enemy's objective or whereabouts. For now, please devote yourself to preparing for whatever comes next.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Seteth|That is all for today.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|Professor. Please wait. I know there is much that you still do not understand. However, one thing is clear. You possess great power. I believe that you are destined to be a source of great hope for all. In any case, I expect great things from you. Walk this world proudly, dear Professor. May the goddess Sothis protect you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|The goddess Sothis?! Is that what she just said?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|Is something the matter?|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|It's nothing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|I see. In that case, farewell.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Byleth|I had never heard the name of the goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Rhea|I see. Sothis is the goddess's true name. Please do not use it carelessly. Farewell.|
FE16WhiteClouds|08-TheFlameInTheDarkness|Sothis|Do not say something that we may regret! She... I... What exactly am I? For now, let's leave this place. Please... Go!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Professor, you already know about the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Only the name.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I can't recall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I see. In that case, allow me to fill you in. It's a large-scale mock battle between the rival houses that takes place every year.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert|Its scale is incomparable to the mock battle we fought during the Great Tree Moon. It will take place in the vast Gronder Field. That is in Empire territory to the southeast of Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Whichever house defeats the most opponents wins. Of course, the professors also fight alongside their respective houses.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert|Well, usually. Professor Manuela is being prudent. She will not be participating this year. Since his long-time rival will be absent, Professor Hanneman has also declined.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|In that case, I must sit out too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|What should I do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Oh, don't worry about us. You know you wanna see the kids in action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert|Are you feeling any better, Professor Manuela?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|If I'm the only professor present...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|This doesn't seem fair...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Oh my, look at you. If you're as confident as all that, my students will walk all over you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is finally upon us! This is our chance to show off the results of your expert training, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Battle of the Eagle and Lion?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Have Lady Rhea and Seteth really not filled you in? Well, if that's the case, I'm happy to explain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|It slipped my mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Haha, I highly doubt that. If you don't mind, I'd be happy to explain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|The Battle of the Eagle and Lion takes place every year during the Wyvern Moon. It can best be described as a mock battle between the three houses.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|Much like the one we had during the Great Tree Moon. Do you remember, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Yes, I remember.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I remember our celebration most of all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|It was certainly an unforgettable time. I've never seen anyone put away as much victory food as you did that night, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|This battle will take place in Empire territory, at Gronder Field. In other words, far removed from the monastery. It's a mock battle between the three houses. The house that defeats the most opponents wins.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|Your Highness, if the rumors are true, I believe Professor Manuela and Professor Hanneman will not be joining us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Ah, yes, right you are. Given recent events, Professor Manuela has opted to sit this one out. Since she won't be present, Professor Hanneman has decided to skip this year as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|In that case, I must sit out too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|What should I do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Oh, don't worry about us. You know you wanna see the kids in action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Professor Manuela! Are you feeling better already?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|In that case, perhaps it is best that you sit this one out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|If I'm the only professor present...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|This doesn't seem fair...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Oh my, look at you. If you're as confident as all that, my students will walk all over you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|It's finally time! The Battle of the Eagle and Lion at Gronder Field is this month. Don't tell me you forgot, Teach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|It slipped my mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|You're kidding! Come on, Teach, I need you to keep it together for me. Don't lose focus when it counts.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I know little about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|You're kidding! Didn't Rhea or Seteth fill you in? Guess I have to do everything myself around here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is one of the academy's annual traditions. It's a huge mock battle between the three rival houses.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|But you know all about rivalry battles, Professor. There was one right after you got here, remember? I hear the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field, far away from Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|The house that defeats most opponents wins. It's a three-way battle that relies heavily on strategy. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Hey Claude, what about Professor Manuela? Do you think she'll be able to join us despite her injuries?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|I'm afraid she's sitting this one out, as is Professor Hanneman.  "As my persistent rival will not be present, it only goes to follow that I must also sit out this year's battle. Now leave me be, Claude!"|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|In that case, I must sit out too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|What should I do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Oh, don't worry about us. You know you wanna see the kids in action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|If it isn't our own Professor Manuela! All things considered, you're looking well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Does that mean you really won't be joining us for the battle?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|If I'm the only professor present...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|This doesn't seem fair...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|Oh my, look at you. If you're as confident as all that, my students will walk all over you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sothis|Hmph. This monastery is more dangerous than I expected. It's likely that our foes have infiltrated the ranks of the teachers... And there may be others of questionable character about as well! If you ask me, there is something amiss about that old man...Tomas.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monica|What do you say, Edel? Shall we meet up in the library later to... Oh! Hello, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Do you need something? I'm a little busy at the moment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monica|Sorry, Professor! I've got a lot of questions to ask Edel here. Since I couldn't graduate last year, I really want to make sure I can do so this year. Don't worry. I won't participate in any assignments so as not to take any attention away from the younger students. I look forward to learning from you, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monica|What do you say, Edel? Shall we meet up in the library later to... Oh! Hello, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Do you need something? I'm a little busy at the moment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monica|Sorry, Professor! I've got a lot of questions to ask Edel here. Since I couldn't graduate last year, I really want to make sure I can do so this year.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|The Battle of the Eagle and Lion... Its name comes from the war in which the Kingdom won its independence from the Empire. It's imperative that we fight our best. We must live up to the legacy of the King of Lions.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|To hold a fishing tournament at a time like this... Participate if you must, but I urge you not to lose sight of our goal. As for me, I won't be joining in. I'm so focused on the battle ahead, I fear I would snap my poor rod right in half.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Flayn and...Monica, was it? I'm glad they were returned safe and sound.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Going all the way to the Empire for a mock battle? This is serious business. And there's a reward to be had as well. I'd really like to win this thing. Everyone else seems to be raring to go too. We're all looking to you to guide us, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Going all the way to the Empire for a mock battle? This is serious business. And there's a reward to be had as well. I'd really like to win this thing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Seteth, that stubborn goat. Holding a fishing tournament now? Just last month he looked like death warmed over.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert|The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is a free-for-all contest among the three classes. If you are victorious, the archbishop will no doubt present you with a reward.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Consider me motivated.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'm not interest in rewards.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert|Just what I thought you'd say.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ferdinand|You know, the Empire used to control all of Fódlan. But after the civil war, the northern region split off and became the Kingdom. Later, the eastern part of the Kingdom seceded to become the Alliance. There are three powers today, but a thousand years ago, we were all united as one. Even now, among the nobles of the Empire, there are some who dream of reunifying Fódlan...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Linhardt|I'm just absolutely exhausted. I swear to you, Professor, every month we're worked harder than the month before. I had imagined the academy as a chance to possibly relax before our lives began in earnest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|You came to the academy to relax?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Linhardt|After graduating, we'll enter into noble society, which mean contending with all the intrigues and dramas that entails. I want to just...postpone life for a bit. Fish... Nap under a tree... Skip out on lectures and– Well, not on your lectures of course, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|It is what it is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Linhardt|Agreed. That's the Church of Seiros for you. What is it they say? "Those with power are obliged to use it."|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Caspar|Are you gonna participate in the fishing tournament, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|Hi, Professor. Want to know something? Gronder is in the territory of House Bergliez, in the Empire. That's right next to my home, the region of House Varley! Oh. Oh no. What if– What if my parents come to watch?! Aaah!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Calm down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|I'm calm! Of course I'm calm! Why wouldn't I be calm? Ugggh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I don't think nobles are allowed to watch.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|Really? Are you sure?! You wouldn't say that if you weren't completely sure, right?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dorothea|Fishing? No thanks. I tried it once, and...ugh. Gross. I don't even really like to eat fish, let alone catch and gut them. Besides, who can think about fishing right now? The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is coming up soon. Feeling confident?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Very.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dorothea|That's the spirit!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Not really.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dorothea|Oh, have a little faith in yourself, Professor. You'll do fine, I'm sure of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Petra|I fished with frequency back in Brigid. I will not have losing. Will you be trying to fish too?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|The Battle of the Eagle and Lion draws near. His Highness insists upon training well into the night. He has said it is nothing to worry about. But how could I not be concerned?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|Did you want something?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|Ever since the tournament, the kitchen is completely overtaken with fish. The cooks cannot keep up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Felix|I'm not interested in glory or prizes. All I want is a formidable enemy to sink my teeth into. As far as I can see, there are only a couple of opponents worth my time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Felix|Since we were little, Ingrid's always gotten this odd look in her eye when someone brings up food.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ashe|You know, I'm pretty good at fishing. My older brother used to take me out. Why don't you give it a try too? They say we can eat whatever we catch!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sylvain|A fishing tournament, huh? Sounds fun, but not as fun as reeling in the ladies. Heh! Just kidding, of course. The most important thing right now is preparing for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. After all, the ladies love nothing more than a winner. And around here, there's no bigger game.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|That's the wrong reason to compete.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sylvain|Everyone has their own reasons to fight. At least I'm honest about mine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'm sure they do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sylvain|I knew you'd understand, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Mercedes|Hmm... Ah! I'm so sorry! I was lost in thought.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|You seem a bit down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Mercedes|It's very kind of you to be concerned, but I promise that I'm fine. I was just thinking... The Death Knight's true identity. Could it actually be Professor Jeritza?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|What were you thinking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Mercedes|The Death Knight's true identity. Could it actually be Professor Jeritza?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Annette|Gronder Field is in the Empire, right? I wonder how we'll get there. I thought I heard that there's no path that goes straight from the monastery to the Empire... Oh! Perhaps we'll travel through Alliance territory. Yes, I see, from the east, we would go...hm, there! Ah, yes, that must be it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ingrid|Holding such a frivolous and downright ridiculous event so close to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion... It's absolutely absurd. Although...they did say we could eat whatever we catch. I'm a sucker for a good meal...I just couldn't resist.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lorenz|I received a rare letter from my father recently. He said that he is praying for the Golden Deer House to emerge victorious. Insistently praying. My father attended the Officers Academy, and won a glorious victory in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. I think he is quite proud of that, even to this day. I suppose that shows how great an honor it truly is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Raphael|Hey, Professor! Did you hear about the fishing tournament? You get to fish in the pond as much as you want. The more you catch, the more you get to eat!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ignatz|Sometimes it's nice to dangle a fishing line and let your mind wander. I'd love to spend some time lounging around by a scenic river or lake.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lysithea|Why would we go all the way to Gronder Field? It's idiocy to travel that far. It may be a tradition, but it takes forever to get there and is exhausting. So pointless. I guess there's nothing to be done about it. Even by you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Marianne|Excuse me, Professor. Um, do you think it would reflect poorly on me if I chose not to take part in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Yes, it would.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Marianne|Oh, I see...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Don't you want to participate?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Marianne|Well, I don't really want to leave the monastery...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Marianne|I'm not very confident, but I'll try my best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Professor, do you have a second? It's about Monica. Does she seem...off to you? She was imprisoned for a long time, but she seems to have recovered almost instantly, and she's been bizarrely cheerful.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Now that you mention it...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|You see what I mean? I wonder if she's straining to seem happy, just to make people comfortable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|She's moving on. Isn't that a good thing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|I guess you're right. It just seems fast, doesn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Hmm... And why is she so close to Edelgard anyway?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Leonie|Why are they having a fishing tournament now? Are they just giving up on the battle of the Eagle and Lion?! You're not condoning this, right? Are you?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Yes, I'm taking part.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Leonie|What?! If you've got all this free time, shouldn't you be spending it on your students?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|No, I'm not taking part.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Leonie|Good. I'm looking forward to seeing you in action. I hope Captain Jeralt will be watching.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|The situation last month was dire indeed. The students endured great hardship. I hope you are able to put all of that behind you so that you may focus on this month's assignment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|A most reassuring response. I trust that your class is in good hands.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|It will be difficult.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|That is to be expected. I, too, cannot quite shake that feeling of unease. Even so, we must both strive to put that nasty business behind us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|I look forward to seeing your skills on display at the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|I have something to ask of you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|What is it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|I have not even told you what my request is yet! Well, fine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|Flayn has been through an awful lot this past month. To make up for that, I have decided to give her whatever she wants. I asked her what she would like, and she expressed a desire for a feast of fish. Since I'm sure the students would be interested, I have decided to hold a fishing tournament here at the monastery. I have left all of the specifics to Shamir. Please, enter and put in your best effort.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|I hear that you participated in the fishing tournament. I appreciate you taking the time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Flayn|I told my brother I had a craving for some tasty fish. I did not realize when I did that it would turn into...well, this. My apologies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Alois|I'm going to catch me some mighty fish, just you wait and see! Er, but they haven't been biting...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Your shouting is scaring the fish.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Alois|What shouting? Everyone told me I was too loud, so I've been using my quiet voice.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Maybe the fish are frightened by you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Alois|I didn't think of that. Ah, the truth is right in front of me...  Just kidding. As though a fish is smart enough to be afraid of me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Catherine|Can you believe what Seteth said? "Catch some tasty fish for Flayn." I'm her bodyguard!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Shamir|Welcome to the monastery fishing tournament. You look confused. Didn't Seteth tell you about it? Just catch whatever fish Flayn requests. Show any fish you catch to Flayn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Shamir|The fishing tournament is over. I heard you did some fishing, and that Flayn is happy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Gilbert|Professor, has Seteth told you? We're to have a fishing tournament. Given the events of the last month, I believe this is just the sort of distraction we need, staff and student alike.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Will you take part?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Gilbert|I'm afraid I am not one for festivities. I do enjoy a spot of fishing, though.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Are you good at fishing?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Gilbert|I do enjoy the sport, yet I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Gilbert|I believe it best that I stick to quietly fishing by myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Jeralt|The recent happenings at the monastery... There is something going on behind the scenes here. I've been commissioned to investigate as well. As I've already mentioned, this month I'm off to the Kingdom. You be on your guard, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'm not worried.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Jeralt|Well, I hope you're right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'm more worried about you than myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Jeralt| Perhaps I've gotten into your head too much! I won't go dying on you. I've stayed alive this long, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Jeralt|How are preparations for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion going? Hm? Fishing? Taking it easy, are you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|I don' t know if you've heard, but Flayn is very special. Her blood carries a rare Crest... Oh, the lengths to which she could advance my research, if only I was allowed to study her! If only it weren't for Seteth's strict orders! He protects his sister with unusual zeal.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|You should give up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|I dislike it, but I agree. The time I would spend begging him and accomplishing nothing would be better spent on other research.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Maybe you can convince him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hanneman|Have you ever tried convincing Seteth of anything? I'm not sure I could convince the man the sky is blue if he hadn't already looked up for himself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|I always thought I was pretty good, you know? Then I go and get stabbed. Ugh... But my opponent was the Death Knight, so I figure I did pretty well to only get stabbed. I wonder if it's true that he is actually Jeritza... Whoever he is...I'm going to make him pay. It turns out that when I get stabbed, I get really mad!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|He hurt you this time. Next time he may kill you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'll help you get revenge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Manuela|I'm not going to let him get the better of me again!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Tomas|When you feel that first refreshing breeze upon your face, you know it is almost time for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Gronder Field is within the Empire, but the path there from the monastery necessitates passing through Alliance territory. Fódlan's biggest river, the Airmid River, flows along the border between the Empire and the Alliance. You will have to cross one of the largest bridges upon that river, the Great Bridge of Myrddin.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Cyril|Fódlan is big. It's not as big as Almyra is, but it's still pretty big.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Do you want to travel around Fódlan someday?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Cyril|Travel? I don't know... Never thought about it, I guess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Do you want to go home to Almyra?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Cyril|Why do you think I would want to do that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Young Monica disappeared last year. I thought she had simply run along home. But it turns out she was kidnapped! I can't believe it. How awful it must have been for the poor thing. They say her personality is completely changed, but at least she seems more cheerful than before. Grateful to be alive, perhaps?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monk|Ah, I see. So you are Jeralt's child. You so resemble your mother.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Did you know my mother?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monk|I did indeed. I was acquainted with your parents. I've been wanting to speak with you for a while now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Who might you be?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monk|I am nothing more than a common monk. I knew your parents...once upon a time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Monk|I've been gone from the monastery for some time now because... Well, it matters not. Might I...ask a favor? Do you mind terribly picking up some fresh flowers to place upon your mother's grave? I am certain she'd be deeply moved to receive a gift from you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Caspar|Gronder Field is in the Empire. It's actually part of my family's territory - House Bergliez. It is the largest field in all of Fódlan. The grain it produces sustains the whole Empire. Wait... I sure hope we don't destroy all that grain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert|It is considered the most suitable place for a large-scale battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Professor, if it were up to you, how would you approach this battle?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I would fight them head-on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I would surprise them with clever schemes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|That sounds like a certain someone we both know. But as you wish. We'll use whatever strategy you think is best. If the Black Eagle House bands together, we won't lose.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert|Our strength is superior. So if we do lose, it would be on your shoulders, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ferdinand|If you're not confident you can do this, just sit back and leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hubert| The most you will do is make things worse. You'll just get in Lady Edelgard's way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Caspar|Are you two about to fight? Haha! Count me in! Wait, no. I think we all need to calm down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Petra|We have no lack of opponents. I am ready to go hunting for our enemies!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dorothea|Hunting isn't exactly... Well, I guess they're pretty similar, actually.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|I'm just gonna hide in the fort and cheer everyone on. There, um, is a fort, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Linhardt|Sure, but it's deep in enemy territory. How kind of you to offer to cut through for us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|What?! No! That's not what I meant! Ugh, good work Bernie...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Linhardt|This will be your first battle, won't it, Flayn? You don't seem nervous at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Flayn|Haha, I shall give it my all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Our battle will begin shortly. The flag of the Black Eagles will soon grace Gronder Field!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|So, this is to be our battlefield...Gronder Field. Are you feeling confident, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Very.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Excellent. That's most reassuring.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'm not so sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|We've seen your power firsthand, so we know better than anyone what you're capable of. Beyond that, we believe in you. If it's not too big a burden, I ask that you believe in us as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|We can win. I'm sure of it. After all, it's not as though we've spent the last half-year sitting idle. And I'm feeling stronger this moon. As though I could conquer a thousand opponents all on my own.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|That's reassuring.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|You can depend on me. I hope you know that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Don't get carried away...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I'm only joking, of course... But perhaps it isn't a laughing matter. I beg your forgiveness. I must practice levity so that I can provide a more enjoyable joke when the opportunity next presents itself. After all, I hear that telling jokes is a good way to calm the nerves before heading into battle. Still...I find it quite difficult.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Well, it's about time for the battle to begin. Everyone, brace yourselves.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Felix|Hmph. All I'm worried about is finding someone worthy to cross swords with.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Mercedes|We've prepared and trained a great deal. We should be fine, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Annette|You're always so carefree, Mercie! Don't forget we need to try our hardest out there so we can win!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ashe|This is our chance to show how hard we've been working! Let's do our best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sylvain|If I emerge victorious in the lauded Battle of the Eagle and Lion, the ladies are sure to take notice. I'll have to go into hiding.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ingrid|Ugh, is that all you think about? Actually, as long as you try your hardest, frame it however you like.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Flayn|Haha, I shall give it my all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|No matter the battle, I will never falter.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|We're counting on your guidance, Professor. Let's show the world what the Blue Lions are made of!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|So this is Gronder Field... Hey, Teach. Not a bad place to wage war, is it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|How so?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Absolutely.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|I knew you'd understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Plenty of places to hide, and our pick of paths to advance through. It's the perfect battlefield for our tactics. I have my eye on that low hill over there. See it? It's the ideal spot to lure our enemies to, and then surround them with fire.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|It's risky.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Fire is unacceptable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Gotcha, Teach! I know, I know. We want all students to make it back to the monastery. With you in command, we can't lose. The Imperial princess and the crown prince don't stand a chance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Professor! Claude! What are you two talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lorenz|What do you expect? It's Claude. I expect he was foisting more of his ill-advised schemes on our poor professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Oh, you have me all figured out, Lorenz. You know me better than I know myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ignatz|Win or lose, it's an honor just to participate in the legendary Battle of the Eagle and Lion!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Leonie|We've got to win so we can show Captain Jeralt what we're made of!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Raphael|Yes! I'm ready! Let's go!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Flayn|Haha, I shall give it my all!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Marianne|I'll just...stay quiet and follow along so I don't get in anyone's way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lysithea|That will not be acceptable, Marianne. The whole point of this exercise is for each house to act as one.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Do your best! I can't wait to see how well everyone does.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|All right, sounds like Hilda will be taking control of a central hill and watching the battle from there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|It's almost time. Come on, Teach! The battle starts now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|You all should know... I am not about to go easy on you today.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|As long as we can pull off the win, it doesn't matter how.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Our victory must be absolute...no matter what it may take.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|It is time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Forward! now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|For honor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is set to begin at long last. Everyone, show off the results of your dedicated training!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Remember, we're not just fighting for honor. There's a prize at stake!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|It's almost time to begin. Steel yourselves, everyone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|The Black Eagles and Blue Lions are fighting... Maybe we can sneak right past them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lorenz|A stronghold for me to seize? Splendid!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|There goes Lorenz, acting on his own... Guess we've got no choice but to capture the central hill and cover him!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|This could be our chance! Dedue, cut through the Golden Deer!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Ingrid, make use of your mobility—circle back behind the Black Eagles!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Mobile force, you move up as well! Circle around to the rear of the Black Eagles!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|If you intend to act, do it now. Hubert! Head toward the Golden Deer!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Ferdinand, circle around to the back of the Blue Lions.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Mobile force, you move up as well. Circle around behind the Blue Lions.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|The Black Eagles and the Golden Deer are already in battle? We should take this chance to break through the Black Eagle's flank.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|I will draw the Black Eagles out, Your Highness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Yes, and while you are doing so, we will take control of the central hill.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|If you stand in my way, I will cut you down until you have no blood left to bleed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|What? I was just trying to rally your spirits. Now, to victory!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Hey Princess! Heads up! There's a rat right by your Imperial feet...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|BAH! I—Huh. How dare you make a fool of me. You will not rile me with such childish tactics.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Ah, so the sheer terror in your eyes was... something else entirely. My mistake. Anyway, it was only a joke.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|You really hope to unsettle me with childish jokes? It won't work. You must stand and fight!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|So, it is time to cross blades... I never imagined such a day would come to pass.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|If the Empire and the Kingdom go to war, we'll be able to fight as much as we please.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I am sorry, but that is not something to joke about. The thought of fighting you is troubling at best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|In that case, I wonder when you'll be able to stomach facing me in battle... Do you need a few moments?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|This is a great chance for me to find out if the Sword of the Creator really is all it's cracked up to be. On that note, you'd better not surrender too quickly!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Hey, Your Royalness! If you promise to let me have the prize, I'll let you take the honor of victory. Do we have a deal?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Enough of your foolishness! I– Wait a moment. You are trying to anger me, is that it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Saw right through me, did you? Well, if there's no deal, I'll just have to win this thing fair and square!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I will happily face you, here and now. Do not hold back, Claude!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|How far can I push myself with you as my foe... This will be a great chance to test our mettle. Do not underestimate me, Professor, or you will fail!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I'm sorry, but I must retreat... You should have no trouble winning. Don't give up!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I hate to admit it...but it seems this is as far as the Black Eagle House goes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Sorry, but it's about time I make my exit… The rest of you...please, finish the job!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|I hate to say it, but it seems we're at a stalemate. Looks like the Golden Deer won't be winning this round…|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I fear I cannot fight any longer. I'm sorry, everyone… Please continue onward to victory!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I suppose my training wasn't enough… The Blue Lions have no choice but to retreat.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are... The Black Eagles!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Thank you for your hard work, everyone! I daresay that prize is as good as ours.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are… The Golden Deer!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|A victory worthy of a feast! We did so well, there's no way we didn't secure that prize.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are... The Blue Lions!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|We won! And judging by our performance, I'm certain we have earned the prize as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Edelgard. Professor. That was a spectacular battle. You both fought exceptionally well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Complete and utter defeat... I would hate to make an enemy of you two.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|No need to get carried away with praise. I know you both feel we won by a paper-thin margin. And I won't deny it. If we were to fight again, there's no telling who would prevail. What do you think, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|The Blue Lion House was very strong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I am honored to hear you say that. Still, I must continue to train rigorously.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|The Golden Deer House was very strong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|I'm honored! And I'll level with you - I think that margin is at least as wide as two sheets of paper. I mean that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|They were nothing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Professor?! Well, I suppose it's OK to let victory go to your head just this once.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|In any case, I hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Agreed. I would hate to know a future in which I'm forced to cross swords with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|True. Although the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was originally named after a war between the Empire and the Kingdom. But that's all in the past. I'm sure even the name will one day fade from the pages of history.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I hope so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Let's do our best to get along.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|How admirable, Teach! On that note, I have a proposition. When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a "grand" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|It would be a fine opportunity to know each other better. Count me in.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|So be it. Let's plan to meet up on the night we return. Is that OK with you, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'm looking forward to it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|We'll celebrate our victory.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|What's gotten into you today? I'm not used to seeing you this excited.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard| Seeing such a big smile on your face is a rare gift... It makes me feel like I can maybe relax a little too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Well done, Your Princeliness. I'm certainly not in any hurry to get on your bad side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I assumed you would attack us head-on. I clearly need to rethink my opinion of you. Well done, Dimitri.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|You both deserve equal praise for a battle well fought. All three houses did extremely well. Don't you agree, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|The Black Eagle House was very strong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Not strong enough, clearly. If there's ever a next time, know that I plan to wipe that smile from your face.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|The Golden Deer House was very strong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|It's an honor to hear that from a fighter such as yourself! But there's no getting around it. The Blue Lions were better prepared.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|They were nothing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|It only seemed that way because of the caliber of your command. Even now, we must not allow ourselves to become complacent.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|In any case, I hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I wouldn't mind. I'll accept a challenge from either of you at any time. Heh, I'm kidding, of course!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|That is nothing to joke about. The true Battle of the Eagle and Lion is best left in the past. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually change the name of this mock battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I hope so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Let's do our best to get along.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|How admirable, Teach! On that note, I have a proposition. When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a "grand" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|You really value that kind of thing, don't you? Well, I suppose no harm can come from it. Count me in.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I have no objections either. And you, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I'm looking forward to it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|We'll celebrate our victory.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Oh! Well, I'm not sure that's the point... Uh, Professor? Was that...a joke?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|You look so...happy. I love seeing you like this. I suppose that look on your face is just another boon from this glorious day. Perhaps the best one of all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Well done, Claude. I see your schemes are not to be underestimated.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Yes, I must wholeheartedly agree. As ever, I have proven to be no match for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|It is the utmost honor to receive praise from your royal–  I'm kidding, of course. Really, though, I was lucky to have Teach on my side. In all honesty, you two made me work for it. If I had to face you again, there's no telling which way it would go. What do you think, Teach? How did the other houses fare?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|The Blue Lion House was very strong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I appreciate that. Still, it is clear that I must continue to be rigorous in my training.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|The Black Eagle House was very strong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Not strong enough, clearly. If there's ever a next time, know that I plan to wipe that smile from your face.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|They were nothing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Too true, Teach! That just about sums it up. Oh, I'm sorry. That's probably too hard for the losers to hear, isn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|In any case, I hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Agreed. I would hate to know a future in which I'm forced to cross swords with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I wouldn't mind. I'll accept a challenge from either of you at any time. Heh, I'm kidding, of course!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Well, now that the three-way battle has ended in an Alliance victory, I daresay it's time for some post-battle reconciliation. The victor has but one request. Hear me out... When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a "grand" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Hmph. I accept your proposition. Please notify me once your preparations are complete.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|It seems I have no choice but to drown my sorrow at losing in overindulgence. I'll help you with the preparations.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|It's not a feast if you don't eat too much! Leave it to the Imperial princess to say such wonderful things.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|That's not exactly what I said, but... Ugh, forget it. Laugh all you want.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Oh, if you insist! Hahahaha! Hey, Teach. Looks like you're having a good time too. Seeing you smile like that means we've got no choice but to have a great time tonight. Let's get going!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|It's finally over... There were way too many strangers at that feast.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Petra|Put your chin high, Bernie. It was a chance for you to have growth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|But... but everyone was acting so friendly! It was overwhelming...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Caspar|Linhardt, I wasn't done talking to you! If those Alliance guys came at it from here and those Kingdom guys came from there-|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Linhardt|I know, I know. We'd have been able to take them all out at once. I heard you. I'm going to bed now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dorothea|Did anyone get the feeling that there were already couples forming? That's not really fair, is it? I wanted to sneak off with someone too...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ferdinand|I was hoping for some tea after our meal anyway. Would you care to join me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dorothea|I suppose I can settle for you just this once, Ferdie.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|Until today, I thought it would fall to me to command and guide our ranks all by myself. But with you leading us, I've gotten to experience what it's like to fight alongside everyone... And I've realized... how happy it makes me, fighting under your command. The emperor doesn't take orders from anyone. It's their duty to stand alone and lead the entire Empire. But maybe it's better to have someone to rely on... so that you can support and guide each other through the darkness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Am I that someone?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I am unfit to guide an emperor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I may be heir to the Imperial throne, but first and foremost, I'm your grateful student. That will never change, even when I fulfill my destiny and become the emperor. I told you long ago that I wished to enlist you in the service of the Empire. Well, I take it back. Now I wish only for your continued guidance during my eventual reign.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Linhardt|Don't just hide away in the corner, Professor. You're the reason we're celebrating.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Bernadetta|It's because of you that I've had the courage to leave my room for a bit each day.  I'm...I'm so grateful, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ferdinand|We were all just discussing how well you led us. Remarkable!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Petra| Your guidance is without parallel, Professor.  I have had practicing of that phrase.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Caspar|Your training's been top notch. Really!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dorothea|Whatever would we do without you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Flayn|I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Edelgard|I feel the same... You are something special, my teacher.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I had a wonderful time today, Professor. As usual, I was astonished by how much you ate in the name of celebration! Really, though, I must thank you again. Our victory in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was thanks, in no small part, to you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|We all did our part.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Yes, that is true, but it was your instruction that allowed us to reach our full potential.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|I agree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|That's the spirit! There's nothing wrong with acknowledging your own strengths every now and then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|I feel silly admitting this now, but when you first came to lead our class...you unnerved me. You never smiled, and you never showed anger either. And yet, you didn't appear to be suppressing your emotions. They just...weren't there. At first I thought perhaps you just didn't care for us, but I soon concluded that wasn't the case at all. For the longest time I just couldn't tell what you were thinking. It was as though you had no humanity whatsoever...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|That stings.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|And now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|You're different now. In the half-year we've spent together, I've seen the glow of humanity in your eyes and in your actions countless times. I am truly grateful to have had the chance to spend this time with you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sylvain|What are you two talking about? How dare you get chummy without us!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sylvain|Getting cozy, are we? Mind if I cut in?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dedue|That's enough, Sylvain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Mercedes|Oh please, I would love to join you as well! I have so many things I wish to talk to you about, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Annette|Oh, me too! I have so much to tell you! And I want to thank you too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ashe|Honestly Professor? I was only able to achieve so much because you were with us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ingrid|Ashe is right. You're irreplaceable to us, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Annette|Yes, that! Without you, the Blue Lions... Well, we wouldn't even be the Blue Lions at all! Except for the blue part. Because we'd be sad.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Felix|I suppose...there are worse things than fighting at your side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Flayn|I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Haha, as you can see, you have our trust, as well as our admiration. I look forward to spending the rest of the year with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|As do I.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Dimitri|Good. Then let's give it our all this year! Anyhow... It's getting late. We had better return to our quarters and get some rest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Ugh, I can't believe our house leader ate so much he passed out. I guess he should just...sleep it off? Oh, Professor! Great work today!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ignatz|As long as we have you and Claude, the Golden Deer House is unstoppable!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lorenz|I am sure we did not require Claude for our victory, but it certainly would not have been possible without our professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lysithea|Haha! I'm so please to be in your class, Professor. You truly bring out the best in us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Raphael|Let's keep fighting! And winning!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Leonie|I knew the tactics you learned from the captain would be something else. I better work harder to catch up!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Flayn|I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Marianne|Because of you, I managed to get through the fight without feeling like a burden. Thank you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|I hear Lady Rhea and Seteth are singing your praises too!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|You all worked hard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|You're always so modest!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Our opponents were strong too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Well, I certainly can't deny that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|Just wait until you see my true power.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Oh, wow! I don't doubt it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|You really showed them, Teach! I would really hate to be on your bad side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Oh, look. Claude has been revived.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|Your tactics were ingenious, and you've somehow mastered the power of the King of Liberation's Relic. You really are incredible. Though you can be a bit absentminded at times. Your mind is like a giant bowl with a tiny crack in it...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|Claude, saying that only makes your own mind bowl seem tiny.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|How dare you! My bowl is much bigger than Teach's! Unfortunately, it doesn't just have a crack. The whole bottom of my bowl is missing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lysithea|In other words, you are the absentminded one, not our professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Ignatz|That's true. He just admitted it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Marianne|Hehe!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Leonie|It's unusual to hear you laughing, Marianne. Your smile is really cute.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Lorenz|I agree. You really don't know how beauti-- Eh... Never mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Hilda|It feels so great to laugh and joke around like this, doesn't it?  Hm? Well, look at that. Someone's having a secret rendezvous in the courtyard...|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Claude|All joking aside, I'm having trouble sizing you up, Teach. The honest truth is that I'd hate to have you as an enemy. If possible, I wish for you to fight by my side. If I could use the Sword of the Creator, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. I bet if I could use it, you would trust me to... Right? That selflessness may be what I like best about you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|You fought bravely during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|Comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the Great Tree Moon, the students have grown significantly. I suppose I should praise your efforts.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|I can only call your deeds during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion...quite versatile.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|Comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the Great Tree Moon, the students have grown significantly. It is clear that this is a result of your guidance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|In appreciation of your efforts, and to show our high hopes for the future of your students, I award you with this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|Please continue to instruct your students as a model teacher.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sothis|So! You've made good use of all my power after all. I would have been upset if you had failed at such an easy task!|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|It pains me to assign such a disturbing mission to you during such a blessed moment in time... However, next month your assignment will be to journey to Remire Village to investigate an abnormal occurrence there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Sothis|Remire Village... If I recall, you've been there with your father many times.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Byleth|An abnormal occurrence?|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Seteth|I have yet to ascertain the details, but it would seem the villages have been acting strangely. I have already dispatched the knights to verify the authenticity of this information. They should be back shortly. I suggest you begin by finding out what they have discovered.|
FE16WhiteClouds|07-FieldOfTheEagleAndLion|Rhea|I pray this is not a bad omen... May the goddess protect you all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|Professor, I have a new mission for your students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|We have received reports that Lord Lonato has rallied troops against the Holy Church of Seiros.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Who is Lord Lonato?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Why would he do that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|Lord Lonato is a minor lord of the Kingdom. He has been showing hostility towards the church for some time now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|A vanguard unit from the Knights of Seiros is already on its way to his stronghold, Castle Gaspard. Lord Lonato's army is nothing compared to the knights. It's quite possible the rebellion has already been suppressed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|Even so, I would like for your class to travel with the knights' rear guard to deal with the aftermath.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|War zones are unpredictable. We do not expect you will have cause to battle, but be prepared for the worst.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Excuse me. You sent for me, Lady Rhea?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|This is Catherine. She will be leading the knights whom you will be accompanying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Nice to meet you. We've heard a lot about you. If you need anything, just ask.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|She is one of our bravest knights, and that is no small feat. Only an exceptional few have what it takes to join the Knights of Seiros. This mission should prove useful in demonstrating to the students how foolish it would be to ever turn their blades on the Church...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Sothis|You have spent quite some time in here, engaging in such idle chatter. Do you not know that we do not have a moment left to waste?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I had forgotten.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Sothis|Forgotten? I don't believe that is the truth. No, it is more likely you were dreaming the whole day away. You must try harder from now on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I should have listened more intently.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Sothis|You must try harder from now on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|Even within the Knights of Seiros, Catherine is the strongest. By a large margin from what I've gathered. Why not seek her out as a sparring partner, professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|Lord Lonato must know that his efforts are futile...yet he can't help but fight. If I were in that situation, I would do whatever it took to ensure victory. You can count on that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|Doubtless, there are times when one must take up their blade, even if there's no chance of winning. But this... It's downright senseless. Lord Lonato knows better. If he had enough allies to back his rebellion, it would be a different matter...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Allies?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|How so?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|Ah, my apologies. I was just thinking aloud. This whole situation is a bit too strange for my liking. Even with the necessary preparations in place, there is always a chance that something unexpected will occur. Please be ready for anything, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|After Faerghus lost its king, there were many rebellions. It is likely Lord Lonato's provocations are related. How frustrating that I am too young to take the throne. Rendered powerless by age... If the throne is vacant much longer, the Kingdom will fall to ruin!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|First that bandit business, and now a noble rebellion? Are we ever gonna do anything but find and subdue people? Well, if we're just going to tie up loose ends, at least it'll be pretty safe. I don't mind stretching my legs for this one. And if Catherine's going, too, there's a good chance we'll get a look at her Relic in action.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Hey, Teach. There's some minor noble rebelling in Faerghus, right? He has no chance of winning. I wonder what he hopes to achieve... Huh? Are you going along to help? Sounds like an easy victory, but good luck out there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hubert|Something about this situation doesn't feel right. Why would a minor lord raise an army against a foe he cannot possibly hope to defeat?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ferdinand|My central duty as a noble is to protect the commonfolk. I abhor those like Lord Lonato, who deliberately shatter the peace. Utterly disgraceful.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|He must have his reasons.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I hope no one is hurt.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ferdinand|You have a kind soul, Professor. Now I feel a little sheepish for showing anger and not empathy. I apologize for my impetuousness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ferdinand|I heard about your class's assignment, by the way. Good luck subduing those treasonous nobles!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Linhardt|Professor, I feel I must speak to you about Caspar's eating habits. I've never seen the likes of it. He inhales entire plates of food in mere seconds.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Sounds unhealthy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Linhardt|Hence my mentioning it to you. Good luck with him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|He must have a healthy appetite.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Linhardt|If that is a polite way of calling him a goat, I'm inclined to agree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Caspar|Today's meal was delicious! Linhardt keeps bothering me about eating too fast. Says I'm gonna choke or something.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|It's not safe to each so quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Caspar|You're really gonna agree with that guy? Why is no one here on my side?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|When you're busy there's no alternative.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Caspar|Absolutely! I knew you'd see things my way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Bernadetta|♪Hm hm-hm hm-hm... ♪ H-huh?! Um, is someone there? What do you want?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dorothea|Professor, about this month's assignment... Raising an army against the church? Really? Though it looks like we won't be fighting, it's still quite unsettling. My understanding is that it will all be subdued rather quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dorothea|Are you going to fight alongside the Knights of Seiros? Hmm... Let me know if you meet anyone I might be interested in, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Petra|The plants of Fódlan are different ones than in Brigid. And people here are unknowing of the spirits who watch over the earth and bless it. Only the goddess is known. Is that factual?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Petra|This flower is one that is eating insects. Is that factual too? I am wondering who watches over the plants in Fódlan...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dedue|His Highness is strong. But on the front lines, anything can happen. Losing him would be devastating for Faerghus. I hope the church understands that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dedue|Best be on your guard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Felix|Catherine, hm? Her skill is impressive, I'll admit. So is her sword. But I think she's hiding something. Nobody knows anything about her past. You should spar with her. She's strong. Stronger than you are, I'd bet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|Ngh... Please, Professor, there must be some mistake. Lonato would never raise arms against the church. At least, he never said anything to me about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|What's going to happen to Lonato? If he's killed, I... I don't know how I'll live with that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Sylvain|Professor, have you seen Felix around? I swear, as soon as you take your eyes off him–poof–he's gone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I saw him at the training ground.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Sylvain|Ah, of course he's there. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I saw him at the dining hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Sylvain|Ah, right, it is meal time. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Sylvain|Don't you love looking after horses? I do. They repay your absolute love and trust with the same. I wish girls were so easy to deal with...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Mercedes|I've heard whispers about Lord Lonato. They say he is a very kind and gentle lord. Why would such a kind man suddenly raise an army? Oh, Professor. You were working late last night, weren't you? You shouldn't overdo it. A ghost might rise up from the well to get you if you stay you too late! Or so I'm told.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Annette|We're going on a mission with the knights, right? I wonder if... Oh... Sorry! It's nothing. I was just wondering if someone I've been searching for might be among them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|You're looking for a knight?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Annette|Yes. Well...maybe? If he's here, he's probably a knight. Though it's also possible he became a monk...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I hope you find whomever you're looking for.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Annette|Thank you. I'm definitely going to find him one of these days!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Annette|To be honest, I've felt a bit lost here at the monastery. At a loss for what to do. Thankfully, a sweet young girl reached out and offered help. I believe she's Seteth's little sister.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ingrid|Why does His Highness take the side of the people of Duscur? I just don't understand it. Only four years ago, they murdered our king and slaughtered the soldiers and knights who were with him, all of whom were innocent. Even if he can forgive them, I can't–not ever. What they've done is against all codes of honor and ethics.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ingrid|We are truly blessed with how fertile the monastery grounds are. Every day, there's something new to harvest!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lorenz|It's a noble's duty to protect the commonfolk, not to endanger them by rallying armies in such a feckless and improper manner. Abuse of that kind is no better than slavery. A proper noble must guard the people from such a fate, wouldn't you say?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I agree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lorenz|Precisely why true nobility is well respected.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|We don't know all the details yet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lorenz|There can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation. Let us put an end to this quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Raphael|Hey, Professor! Do you happen to have any food on you? I'm starving! No matter how much I eat before I train, I'm always so hungry after. My muscles must be going through a growth spurt!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ignatz|This place has so many breathtaking works of art. I feel like I'm living in a museum. Each piece can teach us about styles and techniques from a thousand years ago!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Do you know a lot about art?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ignatz|I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art, but I won't pretend to be an expert.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Do you like art?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ignatz|Oh yes, very much. I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lysithea|Ah, Professor. It would seem that a minor lord in Faerghus is raising an army… This poses a threat, obviously. But not one for the Kingdom—for the church. I mean, Faerghus doesn’t even have a king at present. There’s something…unsettling about this army. You had better ensure we’re fully prepared.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lysithea|The monastery grounds are far too spread out. Feels like it takes hours to get from one area to another. And, no, that's not because I'm getting lost. I'm a fully capable, mature person! Who never gets lost.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Marianne|Oh. Hello, Professor... Um. Was there something you needed?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I came to see the horses.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Marianne|Oh! You like horses? I like them too. They're such kind creatures.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I'm just looking around.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Marianne|I see. I won't bother you, then...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hilda|Professor, your clothes are a bit dirty. If you don't pay attention to your hygiene, the girls won't like you! I hate when my clothes get dirty. That's one of the many reasons I find it best to train as little as possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hilda|Professor, your clothes are a bit dirty. I'd have expected you to be more careful, seeing as how you're a professor and all. I hate when my clothes get dirty. That's one of the many reasons I find it best to train as little as possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Leonie|I'm studying here so I can be the best there is, just like Captain Jeralt. Do you think I've got it in me to be a top tier mercenary, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|That depends on how hard you work.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Leonie|I'm going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here, I can tell you that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|You really want to bring the money in, huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Leonie|I do! Though, it's about so much more than being rich. It's about honor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|Pointing a sword at the Holy Church of Seiros is akin to pointing a sword at the goddess herself. Meting out appropriate punishments to the sinful... It is a sacred duty with which we have been entrusted. As a member of the church yourself, I hope that you will take that to heart.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|If you have a moment, I would like to have a word. It has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have been making advances towards Flayn. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Not at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Actually...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|If you do see anyone getting too close with Flayn, please, inform me of it at once.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Flayn|If the flowers within the greenhouse are removed, they will soon wilt and whither... Is that not so, Professor? I feel I can empathize with them... The flowers. Flowers that thrive–despite their environment–are truly inspiring, are they not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Alois|Past here is the Holy Mausoleum, where the saints of the Church of Seiros slumber. Sorry, but only a select few members of the church are allowed entry. It's open to the public on only one day of the year, for the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Here to train? You really are as hardworking as they say.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|That's an overstatement. I'm just me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Spoken like a true hard worker.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|That's right. I'm a force of nature.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Huh. Maybe the gossip's wrong. Hardworking people usually don't like to make a big fuss about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Jeritza|What? I desired fresh air.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|That's not like you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Jeritza|True...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|The wind feels nice.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Jeritza|Hmph.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Jeralt|Castle Gaspard, eh? I've been there once before. Many years ago... It was by request of the son of that family... Christophe, I think it was.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hanneman|I'm sorry, but I must vent to someone, Professor. You're familiar with Manuela's slovenly behavior, yes? That woman! She borrowed a book last week and returned it with stains of unknown origin on the cover, and several pages either folded or torn. Just now, she dropped a sandwich on the floor, picked it up and kept eating. When she saw my shock, she said simply, "Three second rule." Ugh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Manuela|Did you hear? There's news of someone in the Kingdom raising an army. The Kingdom, the Empire, the Alliance... They do love a good war, don't they? Spilling the blood of young men and women...and for what? Just to enjoy the horror of it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Tomas|Professor, I heard that you may battle alongside Catherine. Even among the knights, she is something special⁠—a holy knight who is able to wield a Hero's Relic. Still...she can be a mite difficult.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Anna|Hey, Professor. How's it going? Making lots of coin? I'd love to catch up, but I'm super busy right now. Working. For money. You understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Have you talked with Catherine yet? If the knights are the cream of the crop, she's the cream of the cream. Oh, and that Relic of hers! I hear it's nothing short of amazing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Knight Of Seiros|Since we're heading to Castle Gaspard, that means we'll be passing through Magdred Way. The road is well known for its beautiful surroundings. Depending on the time of year, it can be incredibly foggy, though. When it's like that you can't enjoy the lovely scenery... Lucky for us, it shouldn't be too foggy while we're there. Not that we'll have time for sightseeing anyway.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Knight Of Seiros|I hear that Lord Lonato served the king of Faerghus's older brother when he was younger. Or something like that. He already had status and prestige, so why raise a rebellion? Eh, I guess it's none of my business.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Knight Of Seiros|Catherine has invited me to train with her. How much do you think I should train before I'm ready to train with someone that strong?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Monk|Lord Lonato... He used to stay at the monastery rather frequently. He was such as pious man. A true believer... Such a terrible shame. I wonder what changed him...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Monk|Next month is when a very important ceremony will be taking place at the monastery. Pilgrims from all corners of Fódlan have already started to gather in anticipation. I pray that you are able to nip this trouble in the bud as soon as possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Shifty Merchant|Things we can't obtain here are likely obtainable by way of the underground. Are you unfamiliar with Garreg Mach's underground? The place is an absolute paradise for those who can't stay above ground.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Monk|Those Abyssian idiots. All they ever do is cause trouble. We'd best purge the entire underbelly of Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hubert|No matter how powerful our enemies may be, there is no need to worry so long as we're with Catherine, the mighty wielder of Thunderbrand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Thunderbrand?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|What are you talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hubert|One must wonder why Lord Lonato would incite such a reckless rebellion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|It all goes back to the Tragedy of Duscur...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I've heard of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|I remember that day well. No one saw it coming.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I don't know much about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|Roughly four years ago, the king of Faerghus was murdered by the people of Duscur. I believe that about sums it up, correct?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|To put it simply, yes. But there's more to that story. They had accomplices within the Kingdom as well. Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was one of them, and so he was handed over to the church for execution.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|The church executes criminals?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Why was the king targeted?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|I have to say... It's a real honor to accompany such a brave and distinguished knight. None other than Catherine, wielder of Thunderbrand!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Thunderbrand?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|Why would Lonato incite such a reckless rebellion?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|You should know more about that than any of us, Ashe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|Well, I don't. Lonato never mentioned anything of the like to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|He probably didn't want you getting caught up in his own personal vendetta.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Is Ashe related to Lord Lonato?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|I'm Lonato's adopted son. He raised me as though I were his own blood. He was always so kind. I don't understand... I guess it has to do with Christophe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|What vendetta?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|How much do you know about the Tragedy of Duscur, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I've heard of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I don't know much about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|It's when the king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus was...was murdered by the people of Duscur. It happened about four years ago...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|It's OK, Catherine. Please, go on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Right. Well, Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was accused of being involved in that whole awful affair. He was executed by the church.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|The church executes prisoners?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Why was the king targeted?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|It really is an honor to accompany Catherine, wielder of Thunderbrand. I hear you're intimidating enough to silence the howling winds!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Thunderbrand?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Why would Lonato incite such a reckless rebellion? He had to have known he had no chance of winning.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|It all goes back to the Tragedy of Duscur...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I've heard of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I don't know much about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|You must be joking. Where have you been traveling that news of it didn't reach you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|It happened about four years ago. The king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus was murdered by the people of Duscur. That about covers it, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|To put it simply, yes. But there's more to that story. They had accomplices within the Kingdom as well. Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was one of them, and so he was handed over to the church for execution.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|The church executes criminals?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Why was the king targeted?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Whatever the truth behind that incident may be, Lord Lonato has harbored resentment to the church ever since. Well... To be more specific, his grudge isn't only against the church. It's also against the one who turned Christophe over to them...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Church Soldier|Report! The enemy is approaching! They can't be avoided. Their numbers are far greatly than we predicted. They used the fog to slip past the knights' perimeter!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|It looks like our mission just changed, Professor. Everyone, prepare for battle!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|With this fog, it's impossible to tell where the enemy might be...or how many of them there are. The enemy could be trying to surround us, but they shouldn't have enough soldiers to form a tight circle. Take down anyone who breaks through the fog, and let's push through!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|That smell... It's fresh blood. It seems the battle has already started within the fog.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|Shouting from within the fog... It seems the knights are already battling.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|The conditions are the same for both sides... But we're at a disadvantage for not knowing the terrain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Proceed with caution! Wait for them to enter your field of view.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Narration|You can earn a reward if your allies do not suffer heavy losses. Be careful not to let your allies flee!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Militia| Lord Lonato doesn't deserve such sadness and anger... Now it's your turn to suffer!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|  Why, Lonato? Why did you drag so many others into this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Militia|You would think we're just gonna do nothing while you try to kill our lord?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Narration|The fog is lifting as a result of the Dark Mage being defeated! It seems the fog was being caused by magic.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Gaspard Commander|I won't let you anywhere near Lord Lonato!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato| It's you. Thunderstrike Cassandra! It was your wretched zealotry that killed my son!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine| The only name I answer to is "Catherine". Prepare to taste the blade of one who serves the goddess. Now you face a Knight of Seiros!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato| The fog has cleared. There's nothing left to hide you or the filthy Central Church from the judgement of the goddess!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Militia|Lord Lonato... Please, don't die...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|I'm sorry, but I don't believe Lord Lonato has the strength to carry on.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|I am sorry... But did you really think you would get away with this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude| The nobles start the war, but it's the commoners who spill their blood first...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato| You have been deceived by that witch... I will show you the truth!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato| You! I will be the one to kill you, no other!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine| You have lost all sense of justice.  You want to fight me? So be it. I'll send you to meet your goddess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato| Stand down, Ashe. I must destroy these evil-doers by any means necessary!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe| Please surrender, Lonato! Whatever your reason for doing this, we can still talk it out!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato| Rhea is an infidel who has deceived the people and desecrated the goddess! We have virtue and the goddess herself on our side!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe| Even if all that's true, dragging the townsfolk into it like this isn't right!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato| Enough. If that is how you feel, prepare yourself! I'm putting an end to this!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato|I apologize, Your Highness. It is regrettable that we should cross swords like this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|Lonato, I sympathize with your position. I really do. I have no wish to kill you, but I am afraid you have left me no choice. Please...forgive me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato|Your Highness... I cannot stop here. For my child, and for the people of Fódlan. If you will not stand aside, then I have no choice but to cut you down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Lonato|  That vile woman... Christophe... Forgive me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|  Lonato, I...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine| I never thought I'd see Lonato meet this fate.  Well done, everyone. Let's gather our troops and go.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Caspar|Damn it! It was all so pointless. I've never seen so many people utterly heartbroken...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ferdinand|Forcing innocent citizens to risk their lives... That man was not a noble, but a monster.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hubert|What could have pushed Lord Lonato to this point?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|Everyone was a bit shaken by the militia fighting alongside our enemies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|No use dwelling on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|That is the reality of battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|If only everyone could face reality so unflinchingly. The commoners who allied themselves with Lord Lonato believed they were fighting for a just cause. It would be disrespectful to consider them simply victims when they died for what they believed in. Still, we have no choice but to eliminate those who cling to unreasonable ideas of justice. Even if our enemies are the gods themselves...we must never lose sight of our goal.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|That's taking it a bit far.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|Is it? Such a day may come, whether you expect it or not. You should be ready.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Agreed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|I'm surprised to hear you say that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Edelgard|Really, I'm just like Lonato. I, too, will be the sort of ruler who's willing to risk the lives of my citizens in service of a higher cause. It's not possible to change the world without sacrifice. Dying for the greater good is not a death in vain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Professor... I'm afraid this incident is far more serious than anticipated.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|Why... Why did this happen? Lonato was always such a kind man... Everyone in the village was...was so nice to me. And I...I killed them. I killed them all! I had to, I know I had to... I know that! But still... What does that make me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|Please, don't beat yourself up, Ashe. We did what had to be done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ashe|I'm...I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bothering you. I'm...I'm going to check on the town. I hope my brother and sister are OK.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|That...that was my first time killing civilians too... Those who I'm sworn to protect.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|It was a necessary sacrifice.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|That is the reality of war.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Dimitri|Are you insane?! Those weren't knights or soldiers, but fathers and sons! We...we shouldn't have killed them. We should have found another way... I...I'm sorry. It's not fair for me to blame you for the circumstance. I know that if we hadn't...done what we did, even more civilian lives would have been lost. At least, my mind understands that. But...my heart... Professor... Those in power, no matter the era, always claim they fight for a just cause. That they take life to protect it. But... Is it truly OK to take any life you please, all in service of some implacable "just cause"? Lord Lonato didn't take up arms out of a lust for power. He simply believed his cause to be just. Who's to say it wasn't? Maybe we didn't have to cut him down like that. Maybe we could have reached a mutual understanding...found a path of peace. I...I have to believe that. Perhaps the notion sounds laughable to you. Mere lip service to naive ideals. But I can't believe otherwise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Sorry to intrude, but this incident may be more serious than anticipated.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Nice work, Teach. Still...that fight left a foul taste in my mouth. That aside, did you see how Catherine fought?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|She's incredible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Agreed. I thought the power of the Heroes' Relics must be exaggerated, but I was clearly wrong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I'm stronger.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Ha! I love the confidence, Teach. But you're no match for the Heroes' Relics. They're on a whole different level.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Makes you wonder about that legend...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|What legend?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Oh, it's nothing. Just the usual fanciful nonsense. An ancient Relic that once cut a mountain in half with a single swing. That's what they say, anyway. But as amazing as Thunderbrand is, I don't think it fits that description. Apparently, Relics can harness tremendous power for those with a compatible Crest. Though you can technically use one so long as you have any Crest at all. I dunno. Long story short, I'd like to try cutting a mountain in half someday.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hilda|Ooh! Are you talking about Relics? You'll be able to wield one soon, Claude! I just know it! After all, you've already been selected as the next head of House Riegan!|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Easy there, Hilda. I don't know how apt "soon" is. My grandfather is still unbearably healthy. Oh? Is this news to you, Teach? Yours truly was recently recognized as a legitimate child of House Riegan. They possess one of the Heroes' Relics too, though I've yet to see it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Just recently?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|I officially joined House Riegan only last year. Before then, I lived with my father.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|You haven't seen it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|I was raised by my father. House Riegan is on my mother's side of the family.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|When I learned that my mother was the daughter of an Alliance noble, I was so surprised I thought the whole world was pulling a fast one on me for a week.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hilda|So that means your mother is Duke Riegan's daughter, right? Where is she now?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|I can't say. My mother's currently living in a different world than the one she grew up in and has no desire to return home.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Hilda|Um, OK. You sure have a lot of secrets, don't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|I'm just keeping a promise to my parents. Make of that whatever you will. In exchange for my so-called secrecy, I'm free to do as I please, which is why I decided to see what the other side of my family was like. That's how I found out about this strange Crest I bear...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Leonie|Professor, Claude. It sounds like the troops will be withdrawing soon. We should return as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Ignatz|We won. We should be celebrating. Instead, we're heading back with heavy hearts...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Claude|Whoa there! What's the matter? You look as sad as a kitten without any yarn. If we hadn't done what we did, the rebel army would have followed this road all the way to the monastery. And they would have crushed all the little villages along the way. We stopped that from happening. You should be proud.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|Sorry to intrude, but this incident may be more serious than anticipated.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Catherine|I found this on Lord Lonato. It's a note that mentions a plan to assassinate Lady Rhea. We can't tell who sent it, so the source is suspect, but the content is too disturbing to ignore. We must report this to Lady Rhea right away. I hope that it's nothing...|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|I am glad to see that you have returned safely. The goddess is gracious with her divine protection. But it was not only her divine protection that shielded you, was it? You are just as skilled as I had hoped.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|My students deserve the praise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|I am not so sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|I still have much to learn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|There is no need for modesty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|I heard some of the students were...hesitant about fighting militia. However, we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers, even if those sinners are civilians. I pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|Our real concern is what Catherine reported. The secret message that was in Lord Lonato's possession. It contained a deplorable plot to target the archbishop on the day of the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth. The plan seems unrealistic at best, but a threat is a threat. We must maintain constant vigilance. To that end, I would like for you and your students to help with security on the day of the ritual.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|You can count on us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|We won't let her down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Byleth|Won't that endanger the students?|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|Even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best, they should be fine so long as they have you on their side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|The Rite of Rebirth is of paramount importance. It is when the Church of Seiros and its believers unite to pray for the return of the goddess. The archbishop and I will be confined to the Goddess Tower once the ritual begins. Of course, the knights will be on high alert as well, but there aren't enough of them to keep watch on every corner of the monastery. It is far from ideal to be forced to mobilize students, but the gravity of this situation requires that we all bend to avoid breaking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Rhea|While there is no need to fear for my safety, we cannot turn a blind eye to those who would blaspheme so heinously.|
FE16WhiteClouds|03-MutinyInTheMist|Seteth|With any luck, this will all be for naught. Still, be on your guard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|You're here again... Professor... You've been crying. So even you cry sometimes. Oh... I suppose that was thoughtless of me to say.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Yes, it was.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Long ago, someone said the same to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|It's fine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|My teacher. You're so blinded by grief that you can't see what's going on right in front of you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Are you waiting for time to heal your wounds? Or have you curled up in a corner and lost the will to carry on?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Does it matter?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|It does. You've lost yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|How could you ask me something like that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|It's not like you to speak to me like that. You know I'd never ask you a question without purpose.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Only you can truly understand your own sadness. Others can sympathize or even empathize, but all anyone else can offer are the tears of an outsider looking in. So I have no intention of crying for you, or of standing still with you. All I can do is promise to reach out my hand when the time comes for me to move forward.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|The mysterious organization that was carrying out experiments in Remire Village and the chapel... They're up to something near Garreg Mach. The archbishop has sent the knights to undertake a large-scale investigation. No information has surfaced yet, but our enemies will soon be discovered. When they are, will you lead us into battle? Or will you just sit here with no thought for the future that is fast approaching? My teacher... There is a choice to be made. I hope you make the right one.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|My, my. She really is quite arrogant. She spoke her mind without an ounce of reservation! But she is right. The time has come to stand again. You already know what your answer is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Monica|Oh, thank you. You saved me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Thales|If you were to die, then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed. Preventing that was my only aim. I'm afraid you must remain, Kronya. There is something I need you to do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Monica|Oh, of course. I am always happy to cooperate with Solon. Leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flame Emperor|How annoying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Thales|Flame Emperor... Is she offending you? Unfortunately, we cannot take our eyes off her, so there is nothing to be done. You are our greatest creation. We used the defiled beast's blood as the fuel to your flame, that you may burn even the gods. Now is the time to cleanse Fódlan of that power, and bring forth our salvation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flame Emperor|There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Thales|All so that you may acquire the strength you need. All for a purpose...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|What are you going at this hour? Ooh, I know... You are eavesdropping! I must admit that I approve.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Professor? We must remain quiet...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|I see... The Flame Emperor and Monica...and the mage who rescued Monica.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|It's time for revenge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Not yet, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|What is that guy's name?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|I don't know, but if we keep listening, we might be able to find out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|An unexpected change to hear their plans! Patience, patience!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Monica|Oh, thank you. You saved me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Thales|If you were to die, then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed. Preventing that was my only aim. I'm afraid you must remain, Kronya. There is something I need you to do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Monica|Oh, of course. I am always happy to cooperate with Solon. Leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flame Emperor|How annoying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Thales|Flame Emperor... Is she offending you? Unfortunately, we cannot take our eyes off her, so there is nothing to be done. You are our greatest creation. We used the defiled beast's blood as the fuel to your flame, that you may burn even the gods. Now is the time to cleanse Fódlan of that power, and bring forth our salvation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flame Emperor|There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Thales|All so that you may acquire the strength you need. All for a purpose...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|I've got you... Finally...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Wait.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Don't go out there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Let's keep listening.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|If we don't act now, we'll miss our chance!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flame Emperor| Hmm...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Thales|Hmph. Even if someone has overhead us, there is nothing they can do. There have always been rats in the walls, and there always will be.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flame Emperor|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|No... The dagger...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|What's wrong?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|What about the dagger?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|It...no. Never mind. It couldn't possibly be so. Professor, those are the ones we must destroy. They're the bastards who killed my family and Jeralt. For now, let's return to the monastery and regroup. As for the Flame Emperor's dagger...I'll hold on to it for the time being.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Day 5 of the Garland Moon. I picked some flowers for her and returned home. The look of joy on her face at the sight of these flowers will be even more beautiful than the flowers themselves… Yeesh! That is enough. His entries from before your birth are full of such romantic blatherings as that. Oh… It must be deeply moving you to hear such things, but now is not the time for whimsy. Someone is here. You do not wish for them to see you in this state. So pull yourself together!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|I thought I might find you here, Teach. Not the type to wallow in solitude, eh? That's a relief, let me tell you. So… What were you reading? Is that Jeralt's…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Diary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|So it is.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Love letter.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|The contents are certainly bittersweet… But I think it's Jeralt's diary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Hey, maybe this has some entries from when Jeralt left the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Is that so… He was the captain of the knights, but something made him leave the monastery in a hurry. If it has something to do with your birth, knowing what happened may get us closer to knowing what secrets the church is hiding… Teach… Would you mind letting me read that diary? I know how important it is to you, but I'm not asking lightly. Please, allow me to borrow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You may borrow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|I'm forever in your debt, Teach. If you'd refused, I would've had to sneak in here in the dead of night. I wasn't looking forward to that prospect. Anyway, let me fill you in on what's been going on lately, and not just as thanks for pointing me to that diary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I can't allow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Wait, are you really saying I'm going to have to sneak in here in the dead of night to read it? I know how important it is to you, but I'm not asking lightly. Please, allow me to borrow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Rhea dispatched the knights to various locations in a frantic search for the enemy. There's a rumor that she's already secured some information. Something big is gonna happen soon. That has me wondering… If you find out where the enemy is, what will you do about it? If you ask, I… No, scratch that. All of us students would gladly lend a hand. Even if it means going against Rhea's wishes. Don't forget it. Now go. Everyone's worried about you. You'd better show them you're in good spirits.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|If you must weep, then weep. I shall be here for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Thank you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Well, it would be ridiculous not to feel anything after something like that. Go on and let it out. I am here.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|That won't be necessary.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Are you already past it? You are unflappable. I will give you that much. In that case, I will remain silently supportive. You are right that we must keep moving ever onward.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Professor, I'm so happy to see you. You're finally returning to your old self. To see the light in your eyes again is a gift. It inspires me to carry on as well. As you know, the knights are searching furiously for any trace of the enemies who escaped. I'll inform you immediately if I learn anything relevant.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|What happened to Jeralt... It's terrible. If there's anything I can do, simply ask. Even if what you desire is revenge...I'll gladly lend you my power. We can't let them get away with this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Professor! Welcome back... I was... We all were...  You've been on our minds. Know that your enemies are my enemies. I will do all I can to help you find justice. There is no one else I can... My strength is yours alone. I will fight as you command... I will kill anyone should you ask it of me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|I'm so sorry about what happened to Jeralt... No...of course my sorrow is nothing compared to yours. The knights are even now searching for our enemies' whereabouts. They are to report back the moment they find something. If you desire revenge, Professor...you can count me in.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Hi, Teach. I see the storm in your eyes has passed… You're looking much better. I've been reading Jeralt's diary. The baby he mentions… That's you, isn't it? I can't understand about half of what's written on here… But Jeralt really cherished you. That much is clear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|I haven't lost a parent yet, so I can't even begin to understand how you must be feeling... But even while you're standing still, the world keeps on moving. I always find that oddly comforting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hubert|I've never been much for condolences. How about a little logic, instead? The knights have spread out around Garreg Mach in search of Jeralt's murderers. Thus, the monastery's fighting strength is, for the moment at least, depleted. Perhaps that was the enemy's real objective. We should be prepared for further confrontation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hubert|I've never been much for condolences.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Petra|Professor, please lend us your ears. Ferdinand is saying impossible things.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ferdinand|I do not see what is impossible about it. All I said was that if you want to go back to Brigid, you probably can. You are...the Empire's guest, so to speak. They cannot afford for something bad to happen to you. There would be a diplomatic incident. Someone close to us has turned up dead, so one could argue that you're not safe here anymore.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Petra|You were already told! I am learning here, from the academy. What are you thinking, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You do not have to leave if you do not wish it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You may return home if you please.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Petra|I am not returning to home until I have grabbed my goal! I will not be listening to the words of Ferdinand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ferdinand|No, look, I did not mean to pressure you. Apologies for the misunderstanding.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Linhardt|I slipped quietly into the vault and rummaged about, looking for anything we might find useful. There is a group of people who want to kill us, after all. What? This is no time for asking permission. I learned long ago that one can ask permission or forgiveness. It is rarely useful to request the former. Still, it appears that the knights have already taken everything useful. There were Crest-related objects I thought might be worth studying, so– There you go again with that stern look. Of course I'll put them back when I'm done. Assuming they bear no additional use.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Caspar|I'm not even close to being strong enough. I mean, Jeralt was so much stronger than me, but even he... That's enough. I can't dwell on the past. There's no way to know what my future holds but I do know one thing. Whatever happens, I have to make my own way in this world. I have to keep pushing so I can grow even stronger!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Bernadetta|Professor? I, um, I brought some flowers for Jeralt.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Thank you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Bernadetta|It's the least I can do. Sometimes I feel like all I do is run away...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You're out of your room...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Bernadetta|Hey! Sometimes I go out for, uh...walks...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Bernadetta|Anyway, I'll go lay them out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dorothea|I've sung lyrics lamenting death many times on stage... But when something like this happens in real life... I'm lost. I don't know what to say. But I do know this much... Sir Jeralt must have been very proud to have you as his child.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dedue|It is a shame what happened to Jeralt. I am sorry. There are no words. Leave some flowers on his grave for me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sylvain|Dark expressions don't suit you, Professor. But I'm... Well, I'm glad to see you out in the world again. It seems this month will be a quiet one around here. There aren't many knights around to liven things up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Felix|Most of the knights are gone, seeking out the enemy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sylvain|Isn't that a bit much? I agree it's important, but is it a good idea to neglect the safety of the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Felix|What do you think, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|It would be a shame if we were invaded.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Felix|I agree. We can send some knights after our enemies, but so many? It makes the church seem reckless.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You're worrying too much.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sylvain|Hopefully the knights finish their business and hurry back. I wouldn't mind having a few extra lances around.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ashe|Not just Tomas, but Monica too. We can't be sure who to trust anymore, can we? Who are these people, really? What do they want?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Mercedes|I'm so glad you're OK, Professor. I was so worried!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Annette|Oh, Professor! You must be starving. Mercie and I made some sweets for you. We were thinking that if you were to eat something sweet, it might help you feel better.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Thank you for the thought.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Mercedes|Baking sweets is my specialty. I'm sure they'll do the trick.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I'm fine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Annette|Well, of course you are! And if you have sweets you'll be even more fine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ingrid|I'm so sorry... I never quite know what to say at times like these... Just...don't push yourself too hard too soon. It's OK to allow yourself to be sad right now. Losing someone dear to you... Well, each loss is unique, but it's a feeling I know very well. That said... Professor, I...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Lorenz|There is no one here who has not heard tales of Jeralt's valor. We have suffered a most dear loss. I do not know what the enemy's aim was, but I do know this–after what they have done, we cannot suffer them to live. If there is anything I can do to ensure that justice is brought swiftly, you need only give the word.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Raphael|You've gotta keep yourself active during tough times, Professor. Even if it seems impossible. That's how I got through when I lost my parents. If you need help with anything, just come and see me. Eating and training are my specialties.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ignatz|I'm scared. I feel that I don't understand the world. How could something like that happen to Jeralt? He was so strong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Even though you're scared, push through.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ignatz|You're inspiring, Professor. Ill do my best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|What happens, happens.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ignatz|I suppose, but... Please, take care, Professor! We can't afford to lose you too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Lysithea|I'm sure you will pull through this because you're so strong, Professor. Best to stay calm during such tumultuous and upsetting times. We don't know the nature of our enemies. If we underestimate them, anything could happen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|But if we don't defeat them…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Lysithea|I agree they must be defeated, but I also feel we must approach this with prudence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|We should be careful.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Lysithea|Yes, I agree. I…don't want to lose you too, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hilda|Professor! People are saying horrible things about Marianne. They're saying she's friends with the bad guys. If I hear someone say that, I'll…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Marianne|Leave it alone, Hilda. It doesn't matter.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Just ignore it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Marianne|Of course. Thank you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|We'll defeat the bad guys. We'll show them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hilda|That would be the quickest way to resolve this. Come on Marianne, let's give it our all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Marianne|I'll say a prayer for Jeralt's soul. There's not much else I can do…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hilda|Professor, it seems like you're holding up OK, but… I'm worried about Leonie. She really loved Jeralt. I hope she can bounce back…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Leonie|Captain Jeralt's gone. He's gone. And we'd only just reunited... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sure this is even harder on you. But I just can't– I can't believe...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Professor... How are you holding up? I know how heavily grief weighs upon one's heart... I lost my mother some time ago. It was... Forgive me my moment of weakness. Even all these years later, I cannot recall that time without feeling the pain as if it were brand new. Just know that I am praying for your mind and your heart to find peace.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Seteth|First Tomas, and now Monica. I do have a theory, though I admit it is nothing more than speculation. Both Tomas and Monica have each gone missing at one time or another. It was reported that when Monica returned from her disappearance, she began to act like a completely different person. As if, perhaps, the real Monica had been killed and replaced by an impostor. Thinking of it like that, it is possible that this Solon had been impersonating Tomas for some time. How they managed such a convincing change of appearance, though, I still do not understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flayn|You have lost your father... Now more than ever do I understand how very lucky I am that you were able to save me. Professor, I deeply appreciate what you have done. Thank you. If there is anything at all I can do in return, please tell me, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hanneman|You've lost someone very dear to you... I'm so... You have my sympathy. Manuela and I can take on some of your workload this month. We can't do all the teaching, but at least we can lighten the load for you. I've always seen strength in your eyes. I know you'll recover. You're a very strong person.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Manuela|I have something rather uncomfortable to discuss. It's about the weapon that killed Jeralt. Will you listen?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I'll listen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Manuela|It was a dagger, but I know enough to know it wasn't an ordinary dagger. It wasn't made of iron or steel because... Well, because whatever it was, the wound it left wasn't normal. Who could make a blade like that, do you figure?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I won't listen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Manuela|I see... That's probably for the best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Manuela|I wonder who they were...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Cyril|Oh Goddess, hear my prayer. Please receive this beloved person. When the cold rain washes the body, when the bird and wolf announce the dawn... Receive them into your blue blood. Receive them into a twinkling star. That's a mourning scripture from the Church of Seiros. Lady Rhea taught it to me. I pray that Jeralt is happy in the next world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Anna|I heard Jeralt passed away... My deepest condolences. I knew him long before I ever even met you... He was always so much fun to be around... It's such a loss...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Gatekeeper|Professor... Thank you for all you have done for us. Nothing to report today. *sobs*|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Professor! I know where the enemy is... Where Solon is. They're in a place called the Sealed Forest, close to the monastery. The archbishop is gathering the knights to begin a search. She's doing so in secret, behind our backs.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Why in secret?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|She must be afraid that a thirst for revenge will compel you to seek them out. Now that you know, will you give us the order?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|No. I will not allow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Seteth|This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You can't stop me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Lady Rhea, our professor is not acting out of revenge. Sending us out there is the most strategic move we can make. You can't deny it. Most of the knights are still far away. Not only does our professor wield a Hero's Relic, but there is no one here who is more powerful. Seteth and the few remaining knights can't leave the monastery unattended. We have fought under our teacher's command countless times. We are the most effective army here, and we are already prepared for battle. We have no idea what the enemy is plotting. We must act now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Let's go, my teacher. Whatever happens, do not lose your conviction out there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Professor, have you heard? They say we've finally located the enemy. It seems they're hiding in the sealed forest, right near the monastery. Lady Rhea has summoned all of the knights to return and take them down. And all of this is being done in secret. Why? To keep us...no, to keep you in the dark.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Why the secrecy?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Lady Rhea likely assumed you wouldn't be able to stop yourself from confronting the enemy if you knew their location. But that is not how this story ends, is it? Professor... We're at the ready. Order us to depart, and we'll fight at your side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|No. I will not allow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Seteth|This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You can't stop me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Lady Rhea, Seteth. Please, try to understand our reasoning before you refuse. With most of the knights still far away, we cannot afford for you two to leave the monastery undefended. The enemy's strength is yet unknown. The only warriors who likely stand a chance are those who wield Relics. With all that in mind, it's obvious who should be dispatched, is it not? If the professor leaves, we will go as well. We've already made preparations and are ready to depart at a moment's notice. Surely you must see that we cannot wait any longer for the knights to gather. Please... Do what must be done and give us the order.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|No matter what enemy we face, we will not fail. I promise you that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Teach! Tomas… I mean…Solon and his lackeys. Their whereabouts have been discovered. Apparently they're lurking in the Sealed Forest, not too far from the monastery. Rhea has called back all of the knights who were out searching to round them up. Seems like it could take some time for them to make it back here…but she didn't ask for our help.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Why keep it a secret?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Perhaps to prevent you from running headfirst toward revenge? It's only natural that you would leap at the chance for it. Anyone would.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|No. I will not allow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Seteth|This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|You can't stop me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Listen, Rhea. Erm, Lady Rhea. This move is the most strategic. The military strategy I'm devising will soon echo across Fódlan's history. I'm sure of it. Just think about it. Most of the knights are still far away, and we can't afford to have Seteth and friends abandon the monastery. So the only person who can take action now also happens to be our best commander. It's Teach, and wherever Teach leads, we'll follow. And since you've taught us that this sort of thing is always a possibility, we're already prepared for battle. We can buy the knights more time. Not for revenge, but for a defensive attack on behalf of the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|We have our orders, Teach. Now all that's left is to pull out a miracle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hubert|We are now within the Sealed Forest. We must not let our guard down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Bernadetta|Professor... We'll avenge Jeralt for you, no matter what!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ferdinand|Remember--it is a bad idea to get distracted by revenge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Petra|I have readiness. Our enemies will be taking...we will take our enemies down!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Linhardt|Well, it's not like we have any other missions this month. I suppose this is as good a way as any to spend our energy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Caspar|Linhardt spending energy? We had better finish this fast before the pigs start flying everywhere.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dorothea|Lower your voice. The enemy could be close!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flayn|It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Professor, I know I'm the one who insisted we come here, but don't doubt for a moment that the enemy is waiting for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hubert|Lady Edelgard! What are you saying?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|What other objective could they possibly have? We have no clue what kind of trap is waiting for us. Please be careful, my teacher. We can't afford to lose you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hubert|The enemy is strong, but you will prevail. You must.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dedue|The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Stay alert.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ingrid|This is for Captain Jeralt. I will not falter.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flayn|It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ashe|Leave it to us, Professor. I'll give it my all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sylvain|Fighting Tomas... It will be difficult, that's for certain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Mercedes|I don't really love the idea of fighting people I know...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Annette|We don't have a choice. Even if it's difficult, an enemy is an enemy. We've just got to get it over with!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Felix|Just kill them from behind. As long as you don't see their faces, you won't know if you know them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|We won't know unless we see their face... Yes, I suppose that is true. Professor... I hope you know I meant what I told you before. Your enemy is my enemy. And I will follow you until the end, whatever that end may be.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|That's reassuring.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Let's do our best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Yes...right. We'll fulfill our duty together. We've come this far. We can't stop now. I hope you know that you can rely on us. No matter who the enemy is, we are prepared to cut them down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Yes... No matter who they may be...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Visibility is awful there, so everyone needs to be extra cautious.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hilda|You seem to know a lot about it. It is just a forest, isn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Have you been there too? Oh… Never mind. Listen, just like I told the archbishop, this is not a war of vengeance. It's a riddle, so to speak. Those guys are undoubtedly planning something terrible. We need some kind of clue as to what. The attack on the Holy Mausoleum. That foul business in Remire. The Demonic Beasts at the chapel… It can't go on. We need to figure out their objective and stop them from achieving it. That's our mission.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Lorenz|So, we have our mission now. We had better not fail.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Lysithea|It is a difficult task, but we will succeed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flayn|It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ignatz|An enemy whose objective you don't understand is a frightening prospect.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Raphael|We're gonna destroy 'em! It's our mission!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Leonie|I will have my revenge, whatever it takes. On that, I will never budge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Marianne|Leonie… You will have what you seek.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|I'll admit, vengeance sounds pretty nice. But don't forget that we're here for information. Luckily, we can easily find what we're looking for while getting revenge for Jeralt. Right, Teach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Look there! Demonic Beasts! I suppose they aren't holding back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Demonic Beasts! The enemy was always intending to lure us here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|How kind of them to welcome us with Demonic Beasts. They're not playing around.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Monica|Hello! You're here! Welcome to the forest of death! My name is Kronya. This weakling girl was just a borrowed look for me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|This is what I really look like! Now, you vermin... I'll take down every last one of you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|If this takes too long, I might be forced to escape. Oh, or do you simply intend to let me go? How accommodating of you! As for me, I intend to kill you all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|How cute, you're trying so hard! But now it's time to die!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|You're a fool to be so brazen. You'll never avenge your father at this rate. I'll have to kill you too! With my own hands!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|Huh? What are you-- Are you here to kill me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|I am. Prepare yourself for death while you still can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Leonie|Monica. You'll pay for what you've done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|I told you! I am not Monica, I am Kronya! Do not call me by that fake name!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Leonie|I don't care what you're called. I don't care if it takes my last breath. I'll kill you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|Please! My powers are beyond your comprehension. You're just a filthy worm!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|But how? How could I really lose...to a lowly creature like you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|Well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|Solon! Don't just stand there and stare! I need your help!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|Yes. You most certainly do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|Huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|Have no fear, Kronya. Your sacrifice will help to rid of this world of the filthy vermin that have long infested it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|Solon... Stop this!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|The time has finally come...to unleash the Forbidden Spell of Zahras upon our enemies!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Kronya|Please...help me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|Begone with you...Fell Star.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|That could only have been magic! What happened to our professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world... To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Caspar|You're lying! Our professor is alive, I know it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flayn|That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hubert|It is hard to fathom that our professor would die in a place like this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape... Overwhelmed with hopelessness... It must be torturous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|You're already boasting a victory, but know this--if you did use such devious tricks to stop our professor... I swear that you will regret it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Ferdinand|I cannot help but agree with her this once. Even if our professor is trapped in darkness, that is not the end of their story.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|I will not forgive such arrogance. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|What was that sorcery? What happened to our professor?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world… To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Annette|That's a lie! There's no way the professor is really dead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flayn|That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dedue|I do not believe our professor has fallen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape…Overwhelmed with hopelessness… It must be torturous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dedue|We cannot abandon hope, Your Highness. Our professor lives. I know it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|You're right. We will save the professor. But first, let's destroy this fiend! I'll slice you into a thousand pieces as we watch with horror... You will know true pain before I finally allow you to die!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Hilda|Wh-what was that? Where did you go, Professor?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world… To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Lysithea|I don't believe anything you say! Our professor is still alive!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Flayn|That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|I refuse to believe that Teach would die in a place like this!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape…Overwhelmed with hopelessness… It must be torturous.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Hey, all I hear is good news. Teach is still alive. And if that's true, then there's only one thing to do. Defeat you while we wait for Teach's triumphant return!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Leonie|Prepare yourself. We will avenge our leader here and now!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|You fool!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|What were you thinking, charging right into an enemy's trap? Are you just a boulder that rolls down whatever hill it's on? No, even a boulder has more sense!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I'm sorry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Apologizing won't make things right! This darkness is terrifying!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I can explain...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Excuses won't help us! This darkness is terrifying!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|As you and I are one... I, too, am trapped within this void. But please consider this... This realm of darkness we are in is seperate from the world from which you came. I mean that it would take a god to leave this place. In time, our hearts and minds will cease to be. Are you prepared to die?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I am.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|How very brave of you, to joke at times like these...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I am not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|I thought as much. I also do not wish to die. And yet...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|There is no other choice...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|What choice?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Do you recall your father's diary? He said you were a child who never cried nor laughed. I think I am the one to blame. I must have been asleep, but even then, I feel I was a part of you. I do not know how Rhea managed it, but she allowed me to exist inside of you. The truth is I have always been with you. It is within you that I found my power yet again. The power of a goddess. The power of the progenitor god.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|My name is Sothis. By now you must be well aware of what that means. I am the one who watches over Fódlan and the creatures dwelling there. I am Sothis, she who died then returned.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I can't believe it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Somehow, I know it to be true.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|There is only one thing left to do to save us from this darkness of eternity. I must now use the power of a god. However, I lack a body of my own. And so, I must relinquish all the power that I have...to you. The time has come for you and I to join as one. And when that comes to pass...then I shall disappear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Disappear?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I won't allow it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|When I say disappear, I do not mean that all I am will be no more. My soul will join with yours, and you and I will never be apart. But...I will no longer have a chance to speak with you. I shall miss it. So long have I been on this path with you. Through you, I got to see and hear this world. I even got to chastise you from time to time. I may not have acted like a goddess, but...it was certainly fun. For all that you have done... Thank you. I'm glad that it was you to whom my fate was bound.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Thank you...for everything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Now... We must pray. For if we share this wish, our spirits two will join as one... Your wish...is to return to the forest, stop the enemy, and rescue the little ones. No need for words. I know your heart as though it were my own...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|Your will and mine are now as one. Both sides of time are revealed to you, and you alone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Sothis|You know I am the beginning. What shall you do?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|So the Fell Star consumes even the darkness itself...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Professor... It is you, right? I knew that you would always come back to us. I'd like to ask about your appearance, but for now, let's dispose of our enemies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|It's over. Now, Professor. About your appearance...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Professor... That is you, isn't it? I am glad you are safe. I was sure that you would return. Please tell me all that happened to you later. For now, it's imperative that we kill the demon!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Thales... Does he also serve the Flame Emperor? It can't be...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Teach... You are Teach, right? I always believed in you... I knew you could cut your way out of anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|I guess this is still far from over...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|I have no time to waste on the likes of you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|To think...that I would lose to mere beasts.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|I am terrified by you... Even though an emotion like fear has no place inside me. That means you must be eliminated.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Solon|So this is how it is... I cannot let you live!|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|You stole the words from my mouth. You lost the moment you failed to kill the professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|That hair...and those eyes... You remind me of someone. What happened to you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|The goddess gifted me her power.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|The goddess? I see... Well, I'm happy for you. Your weapon is called the Sword of the Creator, after all. It's no wonder she looks favorably upon you. Just as it was with saint Seiros, no doubt... And just how will you use this new power, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|For the people of the world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Heh, that is so like you to say that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|For my students.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|For us? I see...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|For myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|That is no answer. You must use your power for something greater than yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Tell me... If the world, and your students included, were to divide and go to war with each other, what would you do? In that scenario, each side would represent both the world and your students. Who would you--|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|Professor? Have you...fallen asleep?! This must be a side effect of your recent...changes. I can't just leave you here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Edelgard|I shouldn't ask Hubert to carry you, so I suppose it falls to me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Professor... I'm glad you're OK. And you seem relatively unscathed. I'm...I'm so relieved. What's more, Jeralt's foe is dead. Though we took little satisfaction from it. Professor... I must ask. What happened after we were separated? You look...different.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|The goddess gifted me her power.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|The goddess appeared...and gave you her power? It's as though...the legend of old has been made flesh. It's hard to grasp, in all honestly. But having seen you pierce the sky with my own eyes, I find myself unable to doubt it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|A legend of old?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Yes. The legend of Saint Seiros. It is said that she received a divine revelation from the goddess and was gifted with her power. Long ago, the goddess dispatched Seiros to defeat an evil king who went mad with power. Perhaps the goddess saw the goodness of Seiros within you too, and wished to help you in your quest to defeat evil. Hm. If you're Seiros, granted power by the goddess, then I suppose that makes me... Ah, never mind. I'm getting carried away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Professor! What's wrong?! Are you...uh... Are you asleep? What is happening these days? Well, it matters not. We must get you help, and fast.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Dimitri|Sorry, Professor, but I have no choice but to carry you back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Teach! We won! I'll be honest—when I lost sight of you, I broke into a cold sweat. But Jeralt's killer is dead. All's well that ends well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|That's true.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|True…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|You're kidding, right? I understood putting it off while we were in battle, but now that it's over, just go ahead and spit it out. That hair. Those eyes. That unfathomable power. What happened out there?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|I will tell you…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|You mean to tell me…that an entity who claims to be the goddess was living inside your mind? And it's been that way since you were a baby? And this goddess entrusted all of her goddess-like power to you and then vanished…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|It's a difficult story to swallow, Teach. But the way you look now… I guess I've got no choice but to believe it. How could something like that happen? There must be a clue in Jeralt's diary. If you believe the diary, there's a high possibility that Rhea did something to you when you were born. That's likely when all this began. What in the world happened to you as a baby? And what was Rhea after?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Teach! What's the matter?! Did you trip or… Wait. Are you sleeping? This must be an effect of the goddess's power. I wonder if Teach's body can handle the strain…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Claude|Think, Claude. What now? Should I carry him on my back? Easier said than done…|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea| In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright... On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight...|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Professor. You must remain still.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|Where am I?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Byleth|What happened?|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|Everything is all right. There is no need to worry. Those who are trying to harm you are far away.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|... How lovely...it would be for this moment to last forever... I wish I could hold on to this time we have stolen... that you and I could create a world without end... I have heard whispers of what happened to you. Your appearance... You have received power from the goddess. From the moment you took hold of the Sword of the Creator... I prayed that one day the radiant power of Sothis, which bathes Fódlan in its celestial light, might reside within you. But you are so much more than the light. You are my... Close your eyes, dear one. Sleep, just a while longer.|
FE16WhiteClouds|10-WhereTheGoddessDwells|Rhea|I will be watching over you, always. Always and forever...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Seteth|As you have already been notified, your mission is to subdue some bandits. Our students have been learning about combat through study, but this is a precious opportunity to provide them with practical experience. The knights will support your mission and are prepared to offer their assistance if necessary. In short, this is no mock battle. You must be prepared for anything. You will receive a message from the knights when it is time to depart. Until then, use your time wisely.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|The last time we fought bandits, you saved me. Maybe I can return the favor this time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Let's do our best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Don't get careless.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|The knights are well aware of our enemy's strength. We can count of them to keep the battlefield under control for us. It seems unlikely that we would lose. Still, let's do all we can to prepare.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|This will be our first true battle. I'm looking forward to fighting alongside you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|As am I.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I'm a bit concerned.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|During the mock battle, your commands were thoughtful and thorough, as was your strategy. With you on our side, I'm confident we will prevail. It seems we have some time to spare before our departure. Let's use this opportunity to prepare as best we can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|More bandits? Not very original, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Not interested?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|You need to focus.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Well, as long as you're with us, at least things won't be boring. In fact... It may take a turn for the interesting. And with that, I take my leave to make my final preparations.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeralt|You seem well. Are you adjusting to life at the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I think so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeralt|Oh? I didn't expect that answer. When we were mercenaries, I handled everything. Outside of battle, you didn't have much contact with people, did you? I thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you. But I guess I was wrong to worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Not quite.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeralt|Well, I didn't expect it would be easy on you. When we were mercenaries, I handled everything. Outside of battle, you didn't have much contact with people, did you? I thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you. It seems I was right to worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeralt|By the way, I heard about those bandits. Your first assignment is to take them out, right? That's fairly routine for you by now, but don't forget it's the first real taste of battle for those brats. It'll be tougher to sleep at night if you let one of your little pupils die, so stay vigilant and lead them well. I wish I could offer you my support, but Lady Rhea won't allow it. For now, I'll try to figure out what she wants from you. I don't mind you settling into your life here, but don't let your guard down. Ever.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|... (A girl's voice... What could it mean?)|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|For some students, this will be their first time stepping onto a real battlefield. It's important that they're mentally prepared. As for me? Ha! Do I look green to you? Is there anything you wish to ask me about, regarding spending your time at the monastery or battles?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Just as students have much to learn from other students, professors can also share their knowledge with each other. You should consider seeking instruction from Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela. I think you'll find their insight quite interesting.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Which house a student is assigned to depends on where they're from. That said, each professor has their own area of expertise. So if a student is adamant about it, it is possible to switch someone from one house to another. Pending your approval, of course. If you become closer with the students by partaking in the various activities around the monastery, you'll be able to talk to them about such things.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|You're quite powerful to have beaten us in the mock battle. Such a shame you aren't leading our class...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|We have only just arrived at the academy, and we're already being sent out to take care of bandits. It is a noble mission, but one that will likely require battle. In practice, there is little difference between a battle and a war. Even with the support of the Knights of Seiros, we must still brace ourselves for the challenge. Do you have any other questions about life at the monastery or about battle?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Just as students receive guidance from professors, professors may also guide each other. If you're interested, you should seek out Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|A student's house is determined by their place of origin, but naturally, each individual has their own aptitudes and interests. That said, if a student so desires and their current professor consents, they may transfer from one house to another. If you get to know the students better through the activities at the monastery, they may approach you about this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Your performance in the mock battle was exceptional, Professor. You have inspired me to follow your example and study even more diligently. Perhaps we could train together sometime. I would love to test myself against your sword skills again.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Those bandits really didn't think things through, did they? They had to have known the knights would be after them the moment they entered the monastery's turf. Fine by me, though. I'm raring for some real combat experience. Any chance to grow is a good thing. Is there anything else you want to ask me, Teach? About living at the monastery or combat, anything like that?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Students aren't the only ones who have something to learn from their professors. Professors can also learn from each other. If you want to, you should try trading knowledge with Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|The house a student belongs to is determined by where they're from, but it is possible for someone to switch to a different one. Of course, that's only if the student very strongly wants to make the change and their professor is on board with it. If you do a lot of different activities around the monastery, you'll get closer to students and they may ask you about it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|I hear you've been tasked with hunting down bandits, right? Meanwhile, my class is stuck with a downright peaceful mission. Sounds like you'll be fighting alongside the knights too. Don't let the monastery down, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hubert|I fully accept the necessity of real battle from time to time, but it is still a surprise to be tasked with punishing bandits without warning. It is a rather different sort of mission. It makes me wonder what the archbishop is planning...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hubert|I've heard your class is hunting thieves. That mission is very different from the one we were given.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ferdinand|Do you know of the Aegir family? We have long held the position of prime minister in the Empire. The Empire's power lies with six noble families, my family foremost among them. The full explanation may be time-consuming. I can give you a moment to get ready, if you would like to take notes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I'm not taking notes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I'm ready.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ferdinand|All right. I will list the six great noble families. There's Caspar's father, Count Bergliez, the Minister of Military Affairs. Then there's Linhardt's father, Count Hevring, the Minister of Domestic Affairs. Beradetta's father, Count Varley, is the Minister of Religious Affairs. Hubert's father, Marquis Vestra, is the Minister of the Imperial Household. Finally we have Duke Gerth, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and my own father, Duke Aegir, the Prime Minister. One day, I will take his place as the prime minister of the Empire. I am more talented than anyone in my class — even Edelgard. I will lead the Empire to a bright, enlightened future.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I look forward to that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|That sounds like wishful thinking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ferdinand|There is nothing I cannot achieve.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Linhardt|Swimming through a sea of countless books, tracking down that single sought-after volume... It's absolute bliss. How do the poor fools who spend their days sharpening swords and polishing armor find any joy in life?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Caspar|Hey there, Professor! You here to check in on my training? Oh, that reminds me. I found this small cloth. It's kinda weird. Not really sure what it is, but it works great for wiping up sweat!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Bernadetta|Wh-what is it? I'm not doing anything!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|It's not good to just do nothing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Bernadetta|I'm not bothering anybody...am I?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Hey, what's this cake doing out here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Bernadetta|Cake?! Oh, come on... That's just cruel.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dorothea|Oh, Professor... Hello. I was just looking for my— Well, it's...it's like a pale blue cloth. Have you seen it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Let's search for it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dorothea|Eh? Um... OK...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I'll tell Manuela.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dorothea|Thank you so much.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Petra|Brigid has much more warmth than Fódlan. Even spring here has coolness! And you, Professor? Which do you find is worst? Too hot or too cold weather?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|The cold.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Petra|I have agreeance! In Brigid, I am able to be wearing much lighter clothes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|The heat.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Petra|But you are wearing many things, Professor. If you are not liking the heat, you should be wearing lighter clothes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dedue|It is better if you do not approach me. If you spend too much time around a man of Duscur, there will be rumors.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Felix|For years, the boar prince and I were inseparable. I know him better than almost anyone else. So let me give you some advice. Beneath all that princely polish, he's an animal, nothing more. He's strong and skilled, sure. But don't place your trust in him as a human being. Take care he doesn't chew you up and spit you out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ashe|It's thanks to my adoptive father, Lonato, that a commoner like me is here at the academy. He is the very model of chivalry. Someday I'm going to be just like him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sylvain|Professor, you're the one taking out the bandits? Heh, that's one way to start your career at the academy. I didn't realize they'd order us to risk our lives here. Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sylvain|Our first assignment is to take out some bandits? Did anyone tell Lady Rhea that people's lives are at stake? I lost my own brother to bandits... ...Is something someone has said at some point, I'm sure. OK. Not my finest attempt at humor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Mercedes|The cathedral is nice and quiet. It's so relaxing... Oh, Professor. Did you come to pray to the goddess?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|That's right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Mercedes|Me too! Shall we pray together?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I did not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Mercedes|No? But shall we pray together while you're here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Annette|I've got to find out everyone's likes and dislikes so I know what to cook. Who knows when it will be my turn at kitchen duty! How about you, Professor? Do you like sweet or spicy food?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Sweet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Annette|Ooh, same! I'll definitely remember that!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Spicy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Annette|Spicy? Ooh, your tastes are so mature! I'll definitely remember that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ingrid|Felix, Sylvain and I have known each other since we were children. His Highness, as well. Though I should warn you that both Felix and Sylvain are a bit...challenging at times. The moment I take my eyes off them, they're off causing all kinds of trouble. It's always been that way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ingrid|Now that you're all the way over here, Professor, care to join me in some training? After training, I love tending to the horses or burying myself in a good pile of books. Ahh, there's truly nothing better!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lorenz|It is the duty of every Fódlan noble to demonstrate piety toward Seiros. Have you also come to offer your prayers to the goddess, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lorenz|You don't sound terribly sure. Perhaps you are not of noble birth? After all, devotion is not as essential for a commoner.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Not exactly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lorenz|I see. The truth is, I am not a particularly devoted believer either. But it would be unbecoming for a noble like me to neglect his prayers, wouldn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Raphael|The next assignment is to track down bandits? Sounds like some training is in order! Tell me something, Professor. When it comes to a one-on-one battle, which is better? Strength or skill?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Strength.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Raphael|I knew it! When it's all said and done, muscle always comes out on top.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Skill.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Raphael|You might be right. But when it's all said and done, I still think muscle comes out on top!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ignatz|I'm so glad to be a student here, if only because I get to use this library. Reading books from all the regions of Fódlan... I feel almost like I'm visiting those places myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|You should visit them in person.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ignatz|I'd like to. I don't have many chances to travel...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|You can learn so much from books.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ignatz|I agree! They're brimming with the knowledge and experience of our ancestors.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lysithea|There were way too many vegetables in today's meal. The ratio of vegetables to sweets was completely skewed... Oh! Hi, Professor! Were you just eavesdropping on me? Well...everyone knows a plateful of sweets is far preferred to a plateful of vegetables, regardless of age.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Marianne|Um, Professor? Our next mission is to go after a group of bandits. I'm...not very confident. I'm afraid I'll just hold everyone else back. I should probably stay behind for this one. Or help plan the attack instead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Marianne|Uh. Hello. Um, if you'll excuse me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hilda|I'm bored! Maybe I should go into town... But that would be such a hassle. Oh! Hi, Professor. I'm rather busy right now, so do make it quick.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|You don't look busy to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hilda|Ah, you can tell? I suppose being a professor has taught you how to ferret out time wasters.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|If you're busy, never mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hilda|Are you sure? I thought you'd found me out for a moment there...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Leonie|Professor! Hey, do you know how old Captain Jeralt is?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeralt|That's enough, Leonie. If I don't know, how could my child know?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Leonie|It's not normal to forget your own age, you know. It's kind of worrisome, actually.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeralt|By the time you're forgetting your own age, you're past the point of caring.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Leonie|I guess if you put it that way, you've got a point...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|Thank you for paying me a visit. Is there anything troubling you? Or is there, perhaps, something I can help you with.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I wonder if the students are taking to me...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|You seem to be getting along well with the students. I would advise you to be confident in your abilities. The rest will fall into place in time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|About the teachings of Seiros...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|Believers live their lives by her sacred wisdom. Please use the library's vast resources to learn more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|I can often be found here, so if there is ever anything you need, please do not hesitate to pay me a visit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Seteth|Inside the cathedral, there is a chapel dedicated to the Four Saints. Do you know of them? Saint Indech, Saint Macuil, Saint Cichol, and...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Flayn|Saint Cethleann! Who is your favorite, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Seteth|Now that you are a member of the church, be sure to familiarize yourself with our teachings and traditions.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Alois|Oh, Professor! How are you today? I'm just heading out for a mission. I'll be seeing you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Good luck.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Alois|I don't need luck! This will be a piece of cake. I'll be back before you know it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Be careful.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Alois|What make you say that? Do you know something I don't? Are there supernatural elements at play? Ghosts?! Ah...oh, forget it. I'll be going now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Shamir|Have we met?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Shamir|No. Sorry. Must be my imagination.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeritza|You look bored. Care to duel?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|A duel?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|To the death?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Jeritza|What? I just wanted to spar...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hanneman|Excellent work guiding the students in the mock battle. Taking command like that? Simply splendid. And bearing the unknown Crest's power? Yes! I'm talking about you. Your talents are incredible, and Lady Rhea's insight as to your potential is doubly so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Manuela|You know, Professor, there are some things I'll just never understand. Like the other night, I went on a date with a dashing, handsome, strong, young knight. Oh, I'm a bit weak just remembering him. Anyway... Do you know what that no-good jerk said when we got back to my room? He said, "What a mess. I'm afraid to go in there!" Can you believe it?! You know who cares about keeping everything neat and tidy? Not me, that's who. "Afraid to go in there." Some knight he is!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Tomas|Do you know about the cardinals? They are the ones who run the church. Their identities are a closely guarded secret...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Cyril|That person sure does remind me of somebody, but I can't figure out who. Oh, do ya need me for something? Sorry, but I'm really busy right now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Anna|Hello there! Are you that new professor everyone's talking about? Name's Anna. I'm a merchant who slings wares all around Fódlan... and beyond! I come in here all the time, so I'm sure our paths will cross more. Hopefully much more!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Are you settled in here at the monastery yet? Make sure to have a good look around! There's much to see! Like fish! You do know about the pond behind the dining hall, right? You can fish there! Give it a try!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Knight Of Seiros|We will accompany you on your assignment. We don't want anything to happen to our precious students. If any of you run into trouble, we'll step in and help out!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Knight Of Seiros|The Knights of Seiros are also known as the shining knights. We are the sword and shield of the divine Seiros. There are many orders of knights in the world, but we are the only one that has the honor of bearing the name Seiros. As a member of the church, you should probably study up on the history of Seiros and the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Knight Of Seiros|I hear the Officers Academy of the monastery was founded about two centuries ago. The eastern region of Fódlan was being invaded by Almyra, and so the archbishop of the time took measures to prevent the border from being taken. In order to ensure Fódlan would be safe from potential threats, she deemed it necessary to raise a generation of excellence. That is how the establishment was founded, though its purpose has changed over the years.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Monk|Zanado, the Red Canyon, is a place of great significance to the Church of Seiros. Even members of the church are forbidden from entering without permission. To go trampling around in there, causing trouble... Those bandits truly are morally reprehensible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Student|Brigid, Almyra, Duscur... Even people from far-off lands gather here at the academy. Word of advice, Professor. There are those who don't think kindly of such people.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Perfect timing, Professor. I just received word from the knights. They've located the bandits.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hubert|It seems they have them cornered. They are in Zanado, the Red Canyon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Caspar|I can't wait to get started! I'll strike down those heinous thieves before they know what hit them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ferdinand|Charge ahead if you must, Caspar. Just do not put the rest of us in danger.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Bernadetta|I'm going back. I won't be of any help anyway, and I don't want to get hurt.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dorothea|Don't worry, Bern. It's just some bandits. We'll have no trouble at all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Linhardt|Eh, don't get ahead of yourselves. Unfounded optimism isn't a great strategy. Let's just get this over with.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Petra|There is nothing to get over. We will work with each other to achieve our mission.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|You seem excited to get out there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I'm not sure about this...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|It's time, Professor. Give us our orders, and let's move out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Professor. I just got word from the knights that the last of the thieves have been cornered.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ingrid|Just as planned. They're in Zanado, the Red Canyon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ashe|We certainly can't allow those underhanded thieves to get away. Let's work together and do our best to take them down!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dedue|It matters not who we're up against. They will not harm His Highness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Felix|Hmph. We're just fighting common thieves, right? I don't expect much of a challenge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sylvain|Aren't you a spoilsport. I'm actually quite excited myself. Who knows... There may even be some cute lady thieves.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Annette|Hmm. Well, at any rate, a real battle is a great opportunity for us to see how far we've come.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Mercedes|True. The mock battle was a success. We'll be fine so long as we stay the course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|So much excitement...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I hope everything turns out all right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Perhaps we are a bit overly excited, but remember that we have the knights on our side. All should be well. Ah! And speaking of the knights, I heard that Jeralt is once again one of the Knights of Seiros. Perhaps we'll have the good fortune of seeing you two fight side by side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|This isn't a game.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|We've fought together many times.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Oh, of course. I apologize for letting my childish whims get the better of me. In all honesty, I'm a bit jealous. My parents are no longer around.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|No longer around?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|They...they died. Both of them. I'm all that remains of them now... Anyhow, I'm sorry to bore you with such things. I'd say it's nearly time for us to depart. Eh, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Hey, Teach. Glad you could make it. We've been waiting on you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lorenz|It seems the knights have our foes cornered. They are in Zanado–the Red Canyon.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Raphael|It's bandit time? That sounds like real knight work. Let's get to it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Leonie|I'm itching to put my skills to the test as well. We have to win so Captain Jeralt can see how much I've learned!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ignatz|I thought Jeralt wasn't coming with us. Either way, I'll give it everything I've got.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Marianne|Um... Even if I go, it's not like I'd be of any use...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lysithea|That's enough of that. If we don't work together and give it our all, we are doomed to fail.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hilda|You can be pretty intense sometimes, Lysithea. But I agree! Let's do our best!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Everyone is so eager.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I wonder how we will do...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|If we fight half as well as we chatter, we'll be fine. C'mon, Teach. Lead the way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|So, we are taking children into battle, are we? I am not certain I will be able to sleep soundly after beholding something like that... I shall allow you to turn back the hands of time, but know this power is not infinite!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|So this is the Red Canyon... A ruin of sorts by the look of it. Let's end this quickly. The thieves must have been driven back. Be careful, or the cornered mice might bite us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|The Red Canyon... This is the first time I have ever been here. It's like walking through a ruin. Let's get this battle out of the way, Professor. The thieves must have already been driven back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|So this is the Red Canyon? Doesn't look red to me... Anyway, let's get things started, Teach. Looks like the thieves have been driven back. That's what we last heard, so no surprise there.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|The knights chased us all the way here?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Thief|Chief, let's get out of here! There's no way we can win against them!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|Shut your dumb mouth! Where would we go at this point? You can't be a thief if you fear death!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Professor...I hear there's a back road to the west. Why don't we split up and attack from both the west and the front? If we advance tactfully, we can attack our enemy from both sides. I leave the rest to you. Regardless, we must cross the bridge first.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Regrettable...but there was no other way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hubert|Allow me to clean this up for you, Lady Edelgard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ferdinand|These ruffians are no match for a noble like me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Linhardt|I...I killed them. What have I done? The blood...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Caspar|Are all real battles this exciting? Come on, let's get on to the next one!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Bernadetta|I don't care if they're stealing! Can I go home?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dorothea|So, is making us experience a real battle part of the church's teachings?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Petra|People and beasts are as one. Calm your heart, and do not be worried about this killing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Thank you for leading us, Professor. Though I suppose there was no way we could lose to a familiar foe. In any case, something about this canyon feels...inexplicably strange.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|According to our information, there is a back road to the west. Let's split up and approach from the west and the front. If we advance cleverly, we attack from both sides and gain the advantage. I'll leave the rest to you, Professor. But before all else, we'll need to cross the bridge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|I know they are just thieves, but this never gets easier for me…|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Felix|Finished already? I was hoping for more of a challenge.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ashe|If I’d hesitated… that would’ve been me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sylvain|I had to do it. Don’t hate me, please.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ingrid|I can’t relax here. We need to prepare for our next battle!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Annette|I did it! See? I’m a great fighter!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Mercedes|I hope the goddess blesses them to rest in peace…|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dedue|Still whole and sound, I hope…|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|We have defeated the thieves. We'll follow the knights' instructions for what to do next. You led us well, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|I hear there's a back road to the west. How about we split up and attack from there and from the front? We may be able to corner the enemy by approaching from both sides. In any case, we need to cross the bridge first. I'll leave the details to you, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|We were taken by surprise last time, but... I guess this is what we can expect when battling thieves.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lorenz|It is a noble's duty to guard the welfare of the people. Nothing personal|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Hilda|I was planning to just sit back and watch. But hey, I got one!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Ignatz|I'm sorry... I didn't have a choice.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Raphael|This is my first real fight. I guess I'm pretty strong!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Lysithea|A precious opportunity to test my own strength. I won't make waste of your deaths.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Marianne|Please forgive me, Goddess...and save their souls...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Leonie|This is what I've trained for!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Those thieves ran out of luck when they entered this canyon. They never had a chance. Your leadership was amazing, Teach. Let's leave the rest of the work to the knights.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Thief|We stole this treasure! It's all ours! There's not way we're gonna give it up to some knights!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|Damn, they're coming from the west too! I can't stand these brats!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|Sending these brats instead of the knights means they've underestimated me! Big mistake!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|I should have never listened to that idiot... What a mistake...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|Y-you're... It can't be! The mercenary from before? So what, now you're pals with the knights? I'll kill you and your pesky brats!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Do you really think being born a commoner gives you the right to kill? Despicable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Unfortunately for you, I will not oblige. You will regret all that you have done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Kostas|Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Being noble has nothing to do with who you are as a person or how hard your life is. Your logic is illogical!|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I remember this being a peaceful place...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Since when has it been called the Red Canyon...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|... ?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Hmm... I wonder why it is that you recall this place.  You must be weak of heart. Each time I speak, it scares you so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I'm sorry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Although the battle is at an end, do not feel too at ease.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|You surprised me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Although the battle's at an end, do not feel too at ease.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I'm not scared.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Do you think you can lie to me? It saddens me to know you wish to hide such things from me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Well, anyhow... I am quite fascinated by this place. As far as I can tell, this is your first time here...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Still, it feels familiar.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|How very odd. I wonder if somehow, my memories have... Hmm.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Have you been here before, Sothis?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Here? I daresay it would be impossible to have forgotten such as place as this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|I must admit I am unsure. Beyond the name and this strange feeling of familiarity, I can't seem to remember anything about this place. And yet...a great depth of emotion is tied to that sense of familiarity. Like joy and sorrow. Pain and love. And all things in between... If I was somehow here before, I wonder what took place...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Professor? I was wondering where you were... It's about time we headed back to the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Professor? We should return to the monastery soon. We're all ready for the journey.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Teach? What are you doing here? We should get back to the academy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|It is time to depart. But know that time reveals all things. One day, I will remember that which I have lost... Oh, by the way. It seems you've earned my gratitude. The thieves who came here are no more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Why are you grateful?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Why are you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|I am not sure myself, yet I am grateful all the same. In any case... You must become accustomed to my voice! If you fall down with shock each time I speak, that just won't do.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Oh... You think you're standing strong? Of course you are! It was a jest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|On our way out, I had the chance to observe the Red Canyon... Did you notice anything, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|What are you talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Oh, I suppose it was only me, then.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I did.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Of course. I expected as much.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|The area was covered in ruins, each more curious than the last. They did not match the architectural style of any era or culture within the Empire. Or across all of Fódlan, for that matter. That can only mean one thing... The valley's civilization must have flourished and fallen in the distant past, long before the Empire was established. Who do you think lived there?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Our ancestors.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|A culture long since perished.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Subterranean beings.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard| Heh, it's possible they weren't even human.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Hmm, perhaps their remnants still influence this world...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|We're finally back. I'll leave the report to Lady Rhea in your hands, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Huh... Edelgard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Does the Black Eagle House have a mission to see to? Remember–on a real battlefield, one can never tell what's to come. You can never dismiss the possibility of a worst case scenario. Take care, Edelgard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|There's no need to state the obvious, Dimitri. But tell me... Why the concern? Perhaps you doubt my abilities? If so, your lack of insight is disappointing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|That's...not what I meant. If I've offended you, I hope you'll accept my apology.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Edelgard|Don't worry about it. Professor, we must hurry. Everyone's waiting on you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Manuela|I suppose I should be off too. Try not to let her get to you, Dimitri. I promise you, there's no need for concern.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Hmm...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Why are you so worried?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|I'll tell you all about it...some other time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Puppy love?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Dimitri|Hahaha! Now, that's a lark. I had no idea you had a sense of humor, Professor. I'll tell you all about it...some other time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Hey, Teach. On the way back, you seemed transfixed by the canyon. Did something happen there?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|It's nothing|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Nice try, but you can't get anything past me. You saw something...or felt something. I'm sure of it. But hey, if you don't want to share, that's fine by me. Everyone has their secrets.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Actually...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|It seemed familiar to you? Huh. Can't say the same. Maybe it's a memory from when you were a child. Or from a past life. Anyway, if you can't remember, I guess there isn't really much more to be said.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Claude|Although, I'll admit, there is something about that canyon that has me captivated as well. How did Zanado come to be called the Red Canyon? Nothing there...was actually red...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|So, you have safely disposed of those bandits. I pray that their souls find salvation. But why did they target the students to begin with? We must further investigate the true cause of all that took place. Until we know more, I ask that you support the students and relieve them of any unnecessary worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I will do all that I can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|Good. I have high expectations for you. By the way, how was your time in Zanado? Legend has it, in ancient times, a goddess alighted upon this world in that very canyon. For a goddess from heavens, Zanado could only have been a temporary haven.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|A goddess?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|A temporary haven?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|Long ago, the divine Seiros received a revelation from the goddess. A gift, to help the lost. The goddess is always watching over Fódlan from her kingdom above. However, in ancient times, the goddess graced this world with her presence and offered salvation to the people here. She is the mother of all life, the arbiter of every soul.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I didn't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|My father never told me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|I see. During your time here, I pray that you come to devote yourself to the teachings of Seiros.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Seteth|Uh...Lady Rhea, I am sorry to interrupt. There is something I must ask about in regard to those bandits...|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Rhea|As you wish. We shall continue our discussion when next we meet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|A goddess... I have no memory of her. But then... I have no memory at all! Oh, how bothersome! It is as though I know...and yet I don't. Perhaps Zanado was my home back when the goddess walked the land. If so... What does that make me now? A ghost?|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|That must be it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Are you simple?! That's impossible! I am most certainly alive.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Hmm... No. That cannot be. I am most certainly alive.|
FE16WhiteClouds|02-FamiliarScenery|Sothis|Of course, we also have the mystery of why I'm here with you. Is it somehow connected? Perhaps some past regret is stopping me from moving on, and now I'm forced to stay with you instead... No, that's not it! I can't believe in such a meaningless existence! I... I...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|I have a new mission for you, Professor. I would like for you to take your students into Kingdom territory to eliminate some thieves.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|They stole a Hero's Relic from House Gautier of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus–the Lance of Ruin. Their leader's name is Miklan. He is apparently a disowned son of House Gautier.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Why was he disowned?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|I believe it had something to do with his lack of a Crest. Such happenings are fairly common within the Kingdom.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|The Crestless cannot harness the goddess's power, even if they possess a Relic. Nonetheless, they are still capable of simply wielding those weapons.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Why must the church eliminate him?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|This skirmish involves a holy Relic, and is therefore more than a single noble is capable of resolving.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|The Heroes' Relics are immensely powerful weapons. We must meet this threat with adequate force. Unfortunately, most of the Knights of Seiros are away from the monastery purging the apostates of the Western Church. So we are entrusting you with this mission. After all, you wield the Sword of the Creator, which is more than capable of opposing any Relic.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|The Sword of the Creator is a powerful weapon, well beyond the other Relics. You have nothing to fear. However, to ensure that no harm comes to the students, we will also send the monastery's most skilled individuals to aid you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|I must remind you that you are expected to conduct yourself in a manner befitting the wielder of that holy sword. Also, you should know that Professor Hanneman has been looking for you. That is all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Professor, I heard about our mission for this month. A thief with a Hero's Relic is worrisome, but with you at our side, I'm certain we can handle him. After all, you have the Sword of the Creator. It was allegedly wielded by Nemesis, the King of Liberation. If the legends are true, you hold the power to stand against entire armies. A band of thieves should be nothing. Even the most elite Imperial forces or the Knights of Seiros could not hope to defeat you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Why does it matter?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|I'm just marveling at the potential. Besides, your power does not lie solely in the Sword of the Creator.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|It would never come to that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Is that so? Even if those forces were to hurt someone precious to you? Can you say with full confidence that you would not turn your sword on them if that were to happen? You know, your power does not lie solely in the Sword of the Creator.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|You are stronger and more terrifying than you realize. Professor... When we leave the monastery, will you still think of yourself as my teacher?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|If we left the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Never mind. I'm being thoughtless with my words. For now, let's just focus on the problem at hand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|I heard about our mission for this month. So... We are to eradicate thieves in Kingdom territory. I'm sorry for dragging into the Kingdom's petty squabbles. This should not be your burden to bear, but my own...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I'm happy to help.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|It's just a job.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Thank you, Professor. Hearing you say that puts my mind at ease.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Hm?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|Your Highness? Ah, it's been ages!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|It's been a long time! Two years, if I'm not mistaken.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|Indeed, Your Highness. You've grown so much in those years. I hardly recognize you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Who's this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|A friend of yours?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|This is Rodrigue, an old friend of my father's. I believe I've mentioned him, if you recall. When my father died four years ago, he looked after me as though I were his own son.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue| You flatter me, Your Highness. It was my honor to care for such a fine, young man. It's nice to finally meet you, Professor. My son, Felix, has mentioned you on occasion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|What brings you to the monastery, Rodrigue? Is it the thieves plaguing the Kingdom?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|I'm afraid so. This is not merely a problem for House Gautier, but for everyone. The thieves have set up their headquarters in Fraldarius territory, and are mercilessly pillaging the villages of that area. You have our full support in stopping those dastards. I thank you for your help, both of you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Hey, Teach. I gotta say, I never would've guessed you were a descendant of the King of Liberation. You didn't forget, did you? That story I told you about a Relic that could cut a mountain in half? That Relic was the Sword of the Creator! The very same used by Nemesis, the King of Liberation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|What are you talking about?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I'm not his descendant.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Don't be coy, Teach. The Sword of the Creator could only be wielded by Nemesis. If you can use it too, that can only mean you have that bloodline's Crest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I don't understand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Fine, keep your secrets. But just so you know, "I don't understand" isn't gonna cut it here at the monastery. Speaking of, Professor Hanneman has been looking for you. He probably wants to examine your Crest with those crazy instruments of his. Actually...sounds amusing. Maybe I'll tag along.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Judith|If it isn't my little Claude! What has you so worked up?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Judith?! What are you doing here?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Judith|That's Lady Judith to you, boy. I told you, until you're in charge, I expect you to address me with all due respect. Anyway, I'm here to retrieve you. Duke Riegan's condition has taken a turn for the worse.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Are you saying the old man's on his death bed?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Judith|No, it's not that bad. But in the state he's in, he won't be able to participate in the next roundtable conference. He wants you to go in his stead. I volunteered to play the messenger.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Well, thanks for that. Oh, and Teach, this is Judith. Also known as the Hero of House Daphnel.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Judith|So you're little Claude's teacher, are you? How much trouble has he been giving you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Plenty.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Not too much.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|If her nickname didn't give it away, you should know that Judith...er, Lady Judith is the leader of the famous House Daphnel of the Leicester Alliance. She used to be a big deal at the roundtable conferences, but it seems of late she's been reduced to a mere–|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Judith|You had better shut that mouth before I put my boot in it, you tactless nuisance! Now come on. Let's get going. Sorry, Professor, but I need to borrow the boy for a bit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|I suppose we'll have to finish our chat later. Sorry, Teach. But don't you worry. I'll be back in time for our next mission. All right, Judith. Let's get going.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Judith|It's Lady... Ah, I suppose you are the active leader for the time being. Fair enough, boy. Fair enough.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hanneman|Good of you to come, Professor. I've heard much about you lately. Specifically, that you were able to awaken the Sword of the Creator's power. Thusly, it seems the true nature of your Crest has been uncovered. I had, of course, seen your Crest before. However, at first, I failed to recognize its true nature. Eventually, it dawned on me that what is visible is perhaps merely a small part of a greater whole. In other words, your Crest is too significant to be detected when using normal instruments. After this discovery, I began researching Crests that might fit that description, which allowed for a temporary hypothesis. However, I could not be certain. The Crest my conclusions led me to was far too unusual. A Crest thought to have disappeared in this world in the millennium since the fall of Nemesis, the King of Liberation. The Crest of Flames. That is what you possess.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|The Crest of Flames...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hanneman|Your ability to wield the Sword of the Creator has unequivocally proven my hypothesis. A legendary power, dormant since time immemorial, and now resurrected... There can be no doubt that this ancient power resides within you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|A stone? A stone... I do not understand. Yet as I think of it, the pounding in my chest grows faster still. But is that me...or is it you? Hmm...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|For a Hero's Relic to be stolen... It's unheard of.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hubert|And just last month, the Sword of the Creator was almost stolen too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Also quite unheard of. What imprudence.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hubert|For House Gautier to invite us on to their land, they must be desperate. But at least we'll have the stalwart knights ready to stand around and watch us do all the work.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Say, I hear that a Knight of Seiros named Gilbert will be joining us for our mission this moon. He is skilled, which is surely a boon for us. Still... That was not very thoughtful of Lady Rhea.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Do you know him?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Ahh, well... No, I do not. Not really. All I will say is that we have trained together a few times in the past.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Do you have history with him?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|No... It's nothing. In any case, you should at least introduce yourself to him before we depart.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|House Gautier is Sylvain's home. It would be nice if you could check on him as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|I am sorry that the Kingdom's unrest did not stop with Lord Lonato... Professor... The Heroes' Relics are incredibly powerful. Please be on your guard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Oof. This wasn't the first time I've taken part in an Alliance roundtable conference, but it was still exhausting. There's not enough cooperation in that group, especially from Lorenz's father. But at least my grandfather was surprisingly alert. Judging by that, I'd say he's got at least five more years in him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Hey, Teach. I hear you were able to use the Sword of the Creator. That means... What does that mean? Could it mean that you're a descendant of Nemesis, the King of Liberation?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Ferdinand|The coffin of Seiros in the Holy Mausoleum should have held her remains. Instead, they say, it held the Sword of the Creator. What could it mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Linhardt|Swinging a sword about in the Holy Mausoleum? The potential for damage is too great to imagine. I sincerely hope the saints' coffins were not damaged.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|They didn't.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|One might've been scratched.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Linhardt|Were you using magic? I've heard you weren't, but– Ugh! It's torture not being able to go inside the Holy Mausoleum for an entire year.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Linhardt|You and your class were at that fight in the Holy Mausoleum, right? I sincerely hope the holy artifacts are unscathed. I admit I wish I could've been there to see it all, even if it does make me queasy. But I was there too early. I'd gone first thing in the morning. At noon, one of the monks chased me out saying I'd been there too long. Who were they to decide when I've been somewhere too long?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Caspar|I heard a relic was stolen. If this had something to do with a family conflict, I don't think I could choose a side.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Even if there's a clear guilty party?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Caspar|I think I'd be a pretty good judge of that!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|We can't allow a Hero's Relic to be stolen.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Caspar|What if it's some kind of powerful weapon? I want one too!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Caspar|I know Relics aren't easy to come by, but I'd still like to get my hands on one...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Caspar|I'm gonna keep training until I can beat you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Bernadetta| I'm not secretly eating cake!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I can sense it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Bernadetta|Hmm... OK, what's Bernie doing right now? Oh, fine. You got me. But keep it a secret, all right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I'll take your word for it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Bernadetta|You're getting pretty good at talking through the door, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dorothea|So, you have a Crest too, eh, Professor? Does that mean you're descended from nobility? You've certainly got the look for it... I sure do wish there were more nobles like you, Professor. A teacher, a mercenary, and so very mysterious... How could a girl ever get enough?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Petra|I have never had goings to the Kingdom's north. I hear the people of north are cold and have much loneliness. Professor, I hear you have had work...have worked as a mercenary in the Kingdom. Did you find joy in this? You cannot remember? Is that having possibility? I have amazement...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dedue|I know Lord Rodrigue. He paid repeated visits to His Highness after the previous king was killed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dedue|The Western Church. The Central Church. They believe in the same goddess, but oppose one another. Fódlan is a complicated place.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Felix|Have you seen a man who looks like me? He's middle-aged and relatively tall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I have.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I have not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Felix|If you get the chance, tell him I've gone out. OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Felix|Think of it! The Sword of the Creator, belonging to the ancient King Nemesis. You have to master it as soon as you can. I can't wait to face off against such a legendary weapon!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Ashe|So the whole plan to attack the monastery was some plot devised by the Western Church? That means they used Lonato. What right do they have to drag a good man like that into their schemes?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Ashe|There's going to be a big investigation into the Western Church soon. I wish I could be a part of it. I want to hear for myself why Lonato had to die.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|I'm so sorry my older brother is causing you all this hassle, Professor. Don't misunderstand, I always thought he was a piece of garbage, but I never thought he'd steal the Relic. I can't wait to see his face when he realizes I'm in the group that was sent to take him down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|I can't believe my own brother is the leader of the bandits. House Gautier is my true home…and his. Please, Professor. He really is one of the worst people I've ever known, but we still… We share the same blood. We're still family.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Mercedes|Isn't it strange? Saint Seiros's body was missing from her coffin, but they found a sword in its place... Do you think she moved from her coffin and left the sword behind?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Mercedes|Professor! You looked like a natural wielding the Sword of the Creator! It's strange though, isn't it? The last owner of the sword was Nemesis, but I thought he didn't have any descendants…|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Annette|Hey, Professor? Did you happen to see that man I was looking for earlier? I just spotted him by the dining hall, but then he ran away!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Who is he to you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Annette|He... To be honest, he's my father. He's using a different name now, but there's no mistaking it. It's him. I know it is!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I might have seen him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Annette|Oh? You saw him by the entrance to the monastery? Thank you, Professor!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Annette|Father... I've found you at last!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Annette|Professor! If you're heading to the Kingdom, I would recommend taking a coat. It's chilly, even at this time of year. It also rains a fair bit. Don't get caught out there without protection, or you're sure to catch a cold!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Ingrid|Wow, Lord Rodrigue in the flesh... What is Felix doing? This is such a rare opportunity for him to see his family...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Ingrid|Professor, please leave Sylvain alone for the time being. The thing is, the bandits' leader who stole the Relic...is Sylvain's disinherited older brother.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Lorenz|I have heard that someone from House Gautier, one of the Kingdom of Faerghus's noble families, is causing some sort of commotion. What a complete disgrace to the nobility.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Raphael|Hey, Professor. Don't you think everyone's making too big a fuss over these Crests or Heroes' Relics or whatever they're called? How important can that stuff really be?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|It's very important.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I'm not sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Raphael|Personally, I don't even care that I don't have a Crest. I'll take muscles over Crests any day. Heck, I'll take muscles over a hot meal! Actually...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Ignatz|Don't you think Professor Hanneman's been acting a bit...strange? Maybe he's made some kind of big discovery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Lysithea|Is it true that Lady Rhea entrusted the Sword of the Creator to you? I can hardly even fathom you being capable of wielding something of such power. Just who are you, anyway?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Lysithea|Aristocrats are fools–-allowing their lives to be dictated by their Crests. Though...I suppose I am much the same in that regard...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Marianne|Some people are unhappy because they don't have the Crest they want... And some are unhappy because they have a Crest they never asked for.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hilda|I thought school life would be peaceful and quiet, with a sprinkle of drama to keep things interesting. But since you arrived, it's been one thing after another. Is that just a coincidence, I wonder?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I believe so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hilda|Oh, I was just kidding! Anyway, as I said before, I do like having a little drama in my life.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Maybe. Maybe not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hilda|What do you mean? I don't like the way you said that. Stop trying to spook me!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Leonie|Captain Jeralt was all furrowed brow earlier. Do you know what's got him so concerned? If there's a problem, I want to help any way I can.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Leonie|OK. I doubt there's anything I can do for him, but I figured I'd ask anyway.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Why don't you ask him yourself?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Leonie|I did, but he just dodged the question. Still, it's worrying to see him like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|You must be rather bewildered by the power that was hidden within. However, know that I believe in you. I have no doubt that you will use that power justly. You will most certainly fulfill the grand destiny that the goddess has seen fit to grant you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|Ah, Professor. Jeralt was looking for you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Where is he?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|It seems he has gone off somewhere. If he is not in his room, then surely someone has seen him. Ask around.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|How are you managing the Sword of the Creator? No problems? I hope you have not left it lying somewhere unattended or anything foolish like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|No problems.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I'm not quite used to it yet.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|You will need the sword's power on your next mission. I trust you will handle it without much issue.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Flayn|Why is that fish so...still? Wait-–is it swimming sideways?! Perhaps... Perhaps it is resigned to its woeful fate of being plucked from the water and eaten... Ah, Professor. You are so outgoing with all of the students. I would like to have more opportunities to connect with you, though I am certain my brother would disapprove.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Catherine|You acquitted yourself honorably last month. To think they'd go into the Holy Mausoleum and assault the Goddess Tower... I cannot imagine the Western Church is acting on its own. Someone must have been helping them. As for the masked knight who escaped, his days are numbered. I hope we find him soon, so I can kill him myself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|Hail, Professor. If I may introduce myself, I am Gilbert. My life has been spent as a dedicated knight. I am to accompany you on your assignment. I may have slowed a step in recent years, but I pledge to you the full extent of my abilities.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Aren't you too formal?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|I beg your pardon, but such is my nature.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|It's a pleasure to meet you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|No, Professor. The pleasure is all mine, I assure you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Jeritza|Mercedes... Her face looks...familiar...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hanneman|Oh my...the Crest of Flames? Could it really... Yes, the actual Crest of Flames! No, that is quite enough. I should compose myself. I must remain objective in my research. Objective. Professional.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Excitement is understandable.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I respect your self control.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hanneman|The scandal with the Western Church troubles me. We cannot afford to let ourselves be swept along, and yet...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Manuela|It's awful, just awful what happened with the Rite of Rebirth. The infirmary... Well, it was a mess. Things are finally calm again, and so I've come here to unwind. Let me tell you, I put all of my knowledge to use keeping those kids alive. Still, the truth of it is that when someone faces death for the first time...well, they figure out who they are. They learn if they can do it again. We can't lose them, Professor. Not to battle, or to cowardice. If you can keep them going, then I will too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I will protect them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I will try my best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Tomas|The head of the Western Church holds the title of bishop. That's not as distinguished as an archbishop such as Lady Rhea, but it still comes with a fair amount of authority. If someone in that position plotted an assassin, I cannot help but think it must have been instigated by some outside force. There are bishops in the Eastern Church as well, but to speak frankly, they do not have much impact. They are under the influence of both the archbishop and the Leicester Alliance, so their ability to voice grievances is quite limited.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Cyril|I hear about the things you did. I'm so glad Lady Rhea's safe. I figure you're a great person after all, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Anna|I've been hearing a lot about you lately. Word on the street is you wield some amazing sword. If you ever want to sell it to me, I'd pay top G! Just kidding. Sorta. It's, uh, not for sale, is it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|Professor. Have you seen my son, perchance? I have need of him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|He went out.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|Is that so? That is too bad.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I believe he's in his quarters.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|Is that so? Thank you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|I must ask him not to distract you, Professor, nor His Highness from the matter at hand.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rodrigue|I am Rodrigue Achille Fraldarius. I bear the great honor of serving as a lord in the Kingdom of Faerghus. I have come in Margrave Gautier's stead to retrieve their stolen Relic. However... As I hear it, a group of students is to attend to this matter. I sincerely hope no harm comes to any of them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Oh! Come to think of it, last month there was something to report, wasn't there? Thanks to you, I hear that everything was resolved. I never realized that bandits had entered... I'm not a great guard after all, am I? I hope you will forgive me one day.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|This weather is unfortunate. Those villagers were right when they said a storm was brewing. But they were more afraid of an attack than they were of the storm. Let's end this quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hubert|The thieves have taken Conand Tower as their base... There it is in the distance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Miklan must be more skilled than your average thief to have overtaken a place like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|This area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago. That's when invasions from the north were at their peak. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|You know your history, Gilbert. If I recall correctly, you're from the Kingdom aren't you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|I left my home long ago. If you have any questions about the mission, I'd be happy to answer them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|What do you know about House Gautier?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|What do you know about the leader of the thieves?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|House Gautier has always placed great importance on whether or not someone bears a Crest. Margrave Gautier has two sons. A Crest never manifested for his eldest. It's not hard to imagine why he left and wound up in this sort of life.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|There's no reason that Crests should have the power to dictate someone's destiny. Don't you agree, Gilbert? He was just another victim of cruel fate. Forsaken by the goddess, who now demands his execution.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|It should be in our sights soon, Professor. The abandoned tower those thieves are using as a base... Conand Tower.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|This area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago. That's when invasions from the north were at their peak. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|You're very well informed, Gilbert. Please, tell us more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|Well, I... Ah. You're joking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Professor. Did you see the local villages? They were in rough shape, no doubt because of the thief attacks. They're not going to make it through the winter in that condition. If the thieves had taken up pillaging in order to survive, that would be deplorable...but understandable. But this... This is something else entirely. It looks as though they destroyed those villages purely for pleasure. No matter what their reasons may be, that sort of behavior cannot be allowed. Ever.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|Don't bother losing your head over those lowlifes, Your Highness. It's wasted effort.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Sylvain... The thieves' leader...the one who stole the Relic. Word has it he's your older brother. I know he's been disowned, but...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|He is no longer a member of House Gautier...or my brother. He's nothing more than a common thief.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Are you sure about that? It would be understandable to find this situation...well, regrettable, to say the least.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|Regrets? Heh, you must be joking. You know we're far past the point of regret. And it always falls on the younger brother to clean up the mistakes of their elders, doesn't it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|This rain threatens a coming storm. We must hurry and begin our war council before the heavens let loose.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Say, Teach. This must be the tower, don't you think? Even for a tower, it's pretty.. er, towering.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|It's more like a fortress.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|It would prove difficult to attack.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|It's a remnant of ancient wars... These thieves certainly found themselves a great place to nest. I hear their leader, Miklan, is a former noble. It makes sense he would already know about this place.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|Several hundred years ago, this was an important stronghold for diffusing invasions from the north. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Gilbert, isn't it? You hail from the Kingdom, right? No wonder you're so knowledgeable. While we're chatting so amicably... Do you mind if I ask some questions?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|I don't mind. If I can answer them, I will.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Have you ever seen the Lance of Ruin?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|I have. A long time ago. It was an impressive, if not eerily ominous, weapon to behold. According to Margrave Gautier, Miklan has used the lance to turn the tables on his pursuers.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Is that right? Then those without a Crest can use it as well... Interesting. As far as I knew, that wasn't possible. And then we have the mythical Sword of the Creator, which can't be used by anyone except Teach, Crest or no Crest. Maybe you're just that special, Teach. Or maybe there's something you're not telling us. Either way, I expect big things from you in this battle.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Leave it to me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Ha! I love a good show of confidence. I'll do my best too. You can count on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I'm relying on you, Claude.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Are you now? Then why don't you hand over the Sword of the Creator for a bit? Then again, it would just be a heavy blade in my hands. There's no justice in this world, Teach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Ugh, the rain is really coming down now. Let's finish this quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|The enemy is close by. We're almost to the top floor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|They have nowhere left to flee, so the situation is in our favor. All we have to do is chase then down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|They are merely thieves, but they have a Hero's Relic. Do not drop your guard.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Phew, why did we have to climb so high before a battle? At least it's better than fighting in heavy rain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|Don't hold back for my sake. My brother is going to pay for everything he's done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rogue|The captain's in trouble! Hurry up, you fools!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|Enemies approach from the lower floor! Watch the rear flank!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rogue|Here we go! Attack them from both sides!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|It's an ambush!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Miklan|So, you think you can take the lance from me, huh? I'll kill you... I'll kill every last one of you!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Miklan|Why have you come, you Crest-bearing fool?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|I'm here for the Lance of Ruin, Miklan. Hand it over. I don't want to humiliate you, but I will.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Miklan|Hmph! Hurry up and die already. If not for you... If it hadn't been for you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|Shut up! I'm so tired of hearing that. You've always blamed me for something that isn't my fault.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Miklan|Not bad for your kind... A bunch of spoiled rotten children.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Miklan|What the hell?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Bandit|Damn! Look at that... I'm outta here!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Bandit|Hold on!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Bandit|No!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Black Beast|Graaaargh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|What the–Miklan?! Is that you?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|That form... Oh my. Is this your first time fighting such a thing? Then listen well to what I say.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Such is the fate of one whose life is corrupted by a Crest Stone... How pitiable. The least we can do is put an end to his suffering.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|So, this is the power of a Hero's Relic. To create such a sinister beast... It has gone too far. I fear all we can do now is put an end to it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|How awful...So the Heroes' Relics are hiding such a terrible power within. I can't even tell friend from foe anymore. I feel for him, but...the best we can do now is finish this quickly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|An evil power has caused them to grow quite large. Their life force is beyond a mortal like yourself. You cannot win unless you fell them twice or even thrice!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|Even if you've cornered one, you cannot let your guard down! Those things are even worse when threatened.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|Can you see that barrier? It is surrounded by great power. You must break through to fight that thing. A strong attack or gambit might help to break through more quickly. If you can break the barrier, that power will have nowhere else to go, and that will likely cause confusions for that thing. It cannot counter while confused, which means that is the best time to attack!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|If you break down all of their barriers, not only will they be confused, they will not be able to move for a short while. Without the power flowing around them, they will not be able to restore their barriers. You might even be able to get something from them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|They have such might that they will not fear you alone. But a battalion could prove useful on that front... Attack them with a gambit to draw their attention and force them to target you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|Be on your guard when they have realized their full power! The damaged caused at times like that is not contained to just one spot. Once they have charged some power ups, their barriers will be restored. You really must pay close attention to those things! Distract them with a gambit, or just take them down before they can attack. In any case, think carefully before you act!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|But you should be conquering that thing instead of talking to me! If you're out of questions, get over there and fight!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|What is that? It's like watching a bad dream come to life.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Black Beast|Graaaargh!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Gilbert|Goddess... The beast is gone, yet Miklan and the Lance remain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|It is done. Let's retrieve the lance and depart at once.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|It's over... Let's retrieve the lance and leave this place.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|We defeated him, somehow... Let's grab the lance and return to the monastery.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|Miklan...my brother...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sothis|That man... His form was changed. It was as though that lance was swallowing him whole. Upon that sight, it makes sense that your students were upset. I wonder if those Relics truly hide such power? Yet even still, that power seems familiar. That form as well... As one who wields the Sword of the Creator... Does that mean you possess that power too?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|Professor, you have returned. The goddess is indeed generous with her divine protection. I have already heard Gilbert's report about what happened. See to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself. People would lose faith in the nobles should rumors spread of one using a Relic and transforming into a monster. All regions of Fódlan would fall into chaos. We must avoid that at all costs. Please ensure the students who accompanied you understand that as well. Have I made myself clear?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Yes, of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Hm...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|His transformation into a Black Beast was nothing short of divine punishment from the goddess. Punishment for someone arrogant and foolish enough to use a Hero's Relic even though they were unworthy and unqualified.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|You knew?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|Of course. That is why we rushed to recover it. Sadly, we did not arrive in time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Will I share the same fate...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|If someone without a Crest were to wield the Relic you possess, they would likely meet the same fate as Miklan. You, however, have been chosen. You are worthy of wielding the Sword of the Creator, so there is no need to worry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|The church will formally return the lance to House Gautier. If you would...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|As you wish.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|You have my gratitude. I can see that I was right to trust you with this. Please report back. I will tell you of your new mission for the coming moon at that time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I will not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|What is the meaning of this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|Ahem, excuse me.  Lady Rhea, I am overjoyed and beyond grateful to you for recovering the Relic of my family, House Gautier. Now, may I please have that lance? I have received direct approval from my father to take possession of it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|As the next head of House Gautier, do you swear that you will never cause such a deplorable incident to transpire?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|On my family's name...and on my brother's life, I swear it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|Very well. However, I have one condition. You must never allow another to wield this lance. Your brother clearly demonstrated what fate awaits those who break that restriction.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Sylvain|Yes. I...I will not soon forget.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|I assume the archbishop was pleased with your performance. Did you return the Lance of Ruin?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I returned it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard| No need to lie, Professor. I saw Sylvain earlier. It was written all over his face.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I did not return it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard| I'm glad. Sylvain must be overjoyed as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard| There's no need to lie, Professor. No one could have expected you to disobey the archbishop.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|I keep thinking about what Gilbert told us...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|About Miklan?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|About House Gautier?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Yes, Miklan was discarded by his family because he was born without a Crest. Eventually he became a masterful thief and gathered enough ruffians to capture a fortress. Right or wrong, he was a gifted leader. He could have been a great asset to Fódlan. What a waste. It's true that a Crest can increase your magical abilities and allow you to wield the full might of a Hero's Relic. But one cannot measure a leader's worth based solely on whether or not they bear a Crest. There are plenty of talented people in this world without one.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I completely agree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Why is everyone obsessed with Crests?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|People believe Crests are blessings from the goddess, that they're necessary to maintain order in Fódlan. But the people are wrong. Crests are to blame for this brutal, irrational world we live in. Their power is granted only to a select few, whom we elevate and allow to rule the world. Have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the Crests? Do that, and people will have no choice but to rise and fall by their own merits.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hubert|Lady Edelgard. I question whether you revealed too much to the professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Perhaps I did.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hubert|It is true that our teacher possesses a rare talent. Even I cannot deny it. The ability to wield the Sword of the Creator is concerning...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|I've already explained this to you. My power alone is insufficient. That's why I'm borrowing power from those people. If our teacher can wield it in my stead... I believe that would be for the best.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Hubert|It's a risk. A dangerous one. You leave me no choice but to take matters into my own hands. Please excuse me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|I can't hide from the truth. I can't do all that I must on my own. If all I can rely on is my own ambition, my path won't be easy. Is it so risky...to reach out my hand? Father... I swear I will not stop until I succeed. My regret. My grief. My whole life. I've thrown it all away...into the darkness...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|Is your meeting over, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|You look troubled.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Are you weary?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|I was just thinking about something. Professor... The possession of Relics and Crests has been highly valued in Faerghus since ancient times. It's far from uncommon for someone to lose their ability to lead their house because they don't bear a Crest. Just like Miklan. It happened to my uncle as well. The eldest child of the king, and yet he never ascended to the throne. All families whose bloodlines carry Crests of the 10 Elites are much the same. But House Gautier takes it a step further, and absolutely requires an heir who possesses a Crest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Why are they so obsessed with it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Why House Gautier in particular?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|To that house, the power of Crests is a necessity, not a luxury. House Gautier holds the most northern territory in the Kingdom, and they have fought with the people to the north for many years. The head of that house is responsible for protecting that territory from fearsome invaders, whom they keep at bay with the power of Crests and Relics. In exchange for that responsibility, they are granted special privileges within the Kingdom.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Their Crests grant them special privileges?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|In a way. That said, ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Strength is strength, with or without a Crest.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|I believe the same. Ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|I believe that Margrave Gautier was wrong to disinherit Miklan because he did not bear a Crest. Still, there is always a reason for why such customs stand the test of time. Imagine what this world would be like if no one placed any stock in Crests... Bloodlines that carry Crests would dwindle. The metaphorical blade used to oppose threats would eventually rest. This same argument has been made time and time again across the years. Both sides are at once right and wrong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|What do you believe, Dimitri?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Dimitri|I believe those with Crests and those without should acknowledge the others' strengths and learn to respect each other based on personal merits. And that doesn't apply only to Crests. The same holds true for lineage, race, faith, ideologies... If we could just accept each other and make mutual concessions, one step at a time... Perhaps... Who knows if that's even possible. Everyone has something that is unacceptable within them. I certainly do, and I'd wager you do as well. I wonder which is best, Professor... To cut away that which is unacceptable, or to find a way to accept it anyway...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Nice work, Teach. It's thanks to you that we successfully completed our mission. As for Miklan... I wonder if he really believed he could wield a Relic.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Hard to say.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|I bet he just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew he couldn't use it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I doubt it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Agreed. He probably just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew it was futile.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Though I'm sure he wasn't counting on turning into a monster like that... I wonder if that monster represents another aspect of the Heroes' Relics. What a strange and terrifying power.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I don't know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|It seems so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Tomas|Stories of misfortune have followed the Heroes' Relics since ancient times.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Tomas! You've caught me by surprise. That's not easy to do. Though I suppose I should've expected to see our librarian in his library.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Tomas|I am sorry to intrude. I simply heard you speaking of the Heroes' Relics. I can tell you more about them, if you'd like. The story goes that Nemesis was corrupted by evil because of the Sword of the Creator. Other Heroes also lost themselves by continuing to use the Relics...transforming into Black Beasts with twisted souls. There used to be a great many records regarding the dark history of the Relics.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Used to be?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Tomas|They have been destroyed, across all of Fódlan. Stripped from their shelves, including those that resided at this very library.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|You make it sound like the church is covering up the truth. But now that you mention it, Rhea was very specific about not wanting anyone to find out what happened at Conand Tower. Hey Tomas... why are you telling us all this?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Tomas|It seemed like you were searching for answers about the Relics. What is a librarian if not a guide in the search for knowledge. And not only have you been searching, but you have been doing so through the night. I would suggest you stop before the knights notice. And that is enough meddling for today. Please excuse me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|So I've been found out, have I? I suppose I do spend more time at the library than most students. But I won't stop. I can't afford to.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|What are you after?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Teach... You don't really expect me to tell you something so personal like that, do you? Though, I wouldn't mind sharing if you were to tell me some of your secrets in exchange...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|I can't let this exchange pass without comment... If you're sharing secrets, perhaps I can share one as well?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Are you sure you could survive that? I'd say you're the least likely to share secrets out of everyone at the academy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Heh heh, coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment. After all, you're easily the student with the most secrets.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|I'm afraid you overestimate me. My secrets don't amount to much. But back to Teach...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard|Don't try to change the subject, Claude. We're talking about secrets. Yours. Who is your father? And why did you appear so suddenly, as if from nowhere? Duke Riegan's eldest son died in an accident. Having tragically lost other family members as well, he was without an heir. The Alliance would undoubtedly have been shaken if House Riegan had lost its position of leadership. But then you showed up. Why did you return to House Riegan? What brought you to the monastery?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I would like to hear this as well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|He doesn't have have to answer to you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|Alas...to be surrounded by women as lovely as flowers, only to be pricked by their thorns.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|My dream, in truth, is a selfless dream. But I require power to make it a reality. When I learned about the power of my Crest, I knew I had a chance. So I'm chasing that dream. To the bitter end, if need be. I came to this monastery because I thought I might find someone useful. Someone to help me on my path. So, what do you think? If you promise to help me achieve my dream no matter what, I'll promise to tell you anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Edelgard| I have my own dream to tend to. I pray that yours does not interfere with mine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|What about you, Teach?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|If it's a noble dream...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|That may be difficult.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Claude|I see. Well, now isn't the time to discuss this. You are still my Teach, after all.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|Professor, you have done well to complete such a difficult task. You have shown exceptional skill in leading your students. I am forever grateful for the safe return of the Hero's Relic. Just as I expected, you have mastered the Sword of the Creator. Now then, I shall tell you about your mission for the coming month...|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth| Rhe– Archbishop!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|Seteth, what troubles you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|Flayn is missing! I cannot find her anywhere!  Professor, have you seen Flayn recently?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|I have not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|I have searched everywhere! Where could she be?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Byleth|Have you looked everywhere?|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|I have searched every corner I can think of! I could not find her anywhere.|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Seteth|She may be in danger! Oh no... No, no! What am I to do?!|
FE16WhiteClouds|05-TowerOfBlackWinds|Rhea|Calm yourself, Seteth. Professor, we shall continue our discussion another time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Our mission this month is to patrol and set up defenses to stop the assassination plot.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|I wonder if an assassination attempt is truly the goal of our enemy...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|You must sense that something's off about all of this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|It's a distraction.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Yes, I think so too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|A barely concealed secret message, trying to distract us from whatever's really going on. Sloppy, to say the least. And while everyone is out searching for a phantom assassin, they'll be free to accomplish their true goal with ease.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ferdinand|The monastery houses many valuable weapons. Perhaps that is their aim?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dorothea|I hear the monastery has a treasure vault too. Seems like the sort of place a foe would like some alone time in.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Linhardt|Garreg Mach is immense, and not just above ground but below as well. Perhaps their aim lies beneath the monastery...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|It seems to me that we should search the monastery for a clue as to what the enemy might be after. Of course, we must never underestimate the need for preparedness, in case a battle should ensue.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And this young man is-|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|So, our task for this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery, to help put a stop to that assassination plot. The knights will certainly have their hands full protecting Lady Rhea. Perhaps our enemy is counting on that...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|Your Highness, I am curious as to what you mean by that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I agree.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|Please, elaborate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Why would Lord Lonato be carrying around a secret note with an assassination plot written on it? Isn't it possible he hoped to monopolize everyone's attention with this alleged plot...in order to distract from his true aim?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Annette|Maybe they're after the treasure vault. There's also lots of valuable stuff in the library and Professor Hanneman's quarters!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Felix|True. The monastery undoubtedly houses many weapons that rival even the Heroes' Relics.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sylvain|Whatever their aim, we can't allow any harm to come to the ladies of the monastery. I mean, what would I do with my spare time?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|You mean to say we should search the monastery. Try to find what the enemy is truly after.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Yes. And we should be prepared to fight them as well, should it come to that. I wouldn't mind getting in some training, just in case.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And this young man here is–|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|OK... So our task this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery in support of the knights, who are busy trying to stop an assassination plot. Here's the thing. I don't think the bad guys are really trying to assassinate the archbishop.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Come on, Teach. Don't you think that "secret" note Lord Lonato was carrying around was just a little too obvious?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|It's a distraction.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Precisely. That "secret note" with the assassination plot on it... There's just no way that was real.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|People don't just carry around secret notes. Someone wanted us to find it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ignatz|Do you really think the assassination plot is just a distraction?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Oh, yeah. That makes complete sense. But then...what are they really after?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|If I knew that, I wouldn't be so worried. Let's see... It probably involves somewhere that will be empty during the Rite of Rebirth, yeah?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lysithea|Since the ceremony is at the Goddess Tower, it follows that everywhere else at the academy will be severely understaffed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Leonie|Do you think they're after the church's donation money? I hear noble families tend to donate quite generously.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Raphael|My bet's on the dining hall. It's a treasure trove of delicious food. Makes me angry just thinking about them getting their grubby hands on it!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Let's split up and look around! I'll keep an eye on the reception hall.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|You should get in some training if you have the time, Hilda. There's a good chance we'll have to fight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Uh! Well, I'm not the only one who needs to train here! It's not right to single me out like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And that little go-getter there is–|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Cyril|I work for Lady Rhea! And I'm Shamir's apprentice! Oh, the name's Cyril.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|You work for Rhea?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Cyril|Yep. I help Lady Rhea with all kinds of stuff.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Shamir's apprentice?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Cyril|Yep. She's teaching me about the bow and the sword and all kinds of stuff.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Cyril|I've gotta protect Lady Rhea, so that's why I've gotta learn all I can from Shamir.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|Cyril adores Rhea. That aside, if you need anything, ask.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|A Hero's Relic...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Do you know something?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|However could I know something? Still, it is heavy on my mind.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|It represents great power.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|Quite so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|The stone within the sword... A glow of red... Hm? Oh, it is nothing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Our enemy's true target... What could it be? The monastery has been around for nearly a millennium. It's only logical that there are secrets here. We'd better investigate. Would you mind asking around and seeing what you can dig up? Once you've uncovered some leads, we'll regroup.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|We need more information. Is there anyone else you could talk to?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Hmm... There's a place that the church values above all others. On the day of the rite, it will be open to the public. That will make it much easier than usual to access.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The greenhouse?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|You must be joking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Holy Mausoleum?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Precisely.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The dining hall?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|You must be joking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|We can't know for certain, but it's a distinct possibility that the Holy Mausoleum is our enemy's target.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Oh, have you been tasked with guarding the monastery as well? Such a stir over a single letter...but I suppose the archbishop's safety is too important to risk.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|If the enemy's aim lies elsewhere, we had better discern their true intent quickly. As I see it, our best option is to explore every inch of the monastery. We should also speak to everyone here. Let's plan to compare notes once you've got a lead.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Hmm. I'm afraid we'll need more information than that. Is there anyone else you could try speaking to?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|So... There is something that the church values above all else. On the day of the rite, it will be open to the public. That will make gaining entry far easier than usual. You know the place of which I speak...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The greenhouse?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Whatever would make you think that? This is no time for games, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Holy Mausoleum?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Yes, that is the most likely possibility.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The dining hall?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Whatever would make you think that? This is no time for games, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|We do not know their objective, but there is a good chance that our enemy is planning to target the Holy Mausoleum.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|All this talk of assassination plots... It brings back dark memories I prefer to keep buried. I doubt there is any correlation, and yet... Ah, it is nothing. I am sorry for allowing my mind to wander. My focus should be solely on guarding the monastery right now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|To figure out our foe's intentions, we need information. Lot's of it. Or any, at the least. For now, try going around the monastery and looking for suspicious locations. You should also try chatting folks up to see if they know anything. Once we've got things narrowed down, let's meet up and compare notes.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Hmm... We still don't have enough to go on, Teach. Let's try looking around a little more.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Hmm. Something the church values above all else... And on the day of the rite, it'll be open to the public, making it easier than ever to get inside. That's gotta be it, right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The greenhouse?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|That would be a resounding no.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Holy Mausoleum?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Bullseye.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The dining hall?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|That would be a resounding no.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|We don't know the enemy's intentions, not yet. But our best bet is that their target will be the Holy Mausoleum.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|There's been talk of an attempt on Rhea's life. We've been order to help the knights patrol. Could that possibly mean that Rhea isn't beloved by everyone the world over?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|Can you imagine the archbishop being murdered? I prefer not to consider such a gruesome scenario.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Of course not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|Awfully calm, aren't you? I wonder what it takes to rile you up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Frightening thought.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|That easy to get under your skin, is it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ferdinand|Hmm... Setting fire to the stables to distract everyone, to cause a commotion. It is the oldest trick in the book, but I cannot shake the thought that our enemies may attempt it... I will stand guard and watch over the stable...and the knights' horses. They are truly magnificent.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Linhardt|So sleepy... Too sleepy... I found an interesting book in the library. Got so caught up reading it I forgot to sleep... Interesting discovery though–the coffins of the Four Saints in the sanctum each have their Crests carved into them. I'll need to find a way down there to get a look.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Caspar|Oh. Hey, Professor. I was just reading this letter from my father. Do you know him? He's a pretty big deal in the Empire. He only writes to ask how my training's going, or how many monsters I've killed. Stuff like that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Bernadetta|Um... Hi. Right now is, um... Well, right now's OK I guess. If you, um, want to chat...a little.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Didn't I see you in the dining hall last night?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Bernadetta|Hey, I get hungry sometimes. Like anyone else! What? Eating at night is bad for you? There's no way that's true. Wait, really?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dorothea|People die in every battle. And it can be by sword or spear or magic, but... But depending on who it is that died... Depending on who died, it's different.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|It's different if it's someone you know who was lost...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dorothea|I hope nothing bad happens this month.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dorothea|Is it true you got caught in the fighting? I'm so thankful you made it out alive. I don't know what we would do if we lost you...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Petra|In Brigid... assassinations are many. I have also been the targeted back in the past.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|How frightening.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I'm happy you survived.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Petra|The Goddess Tower has an entrance of narrowness. That is most good. The windows are not the most good though. A target of ease for snipers.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Petra|Fighting to stop a murdering is my specialness...no, my specialty. I will show my best work!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|The monks declined my offer of assistance. They said that no one from Duscur is to be trusted, especially now. Given the circumstances, I cannot fault them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Felix|Sending an assassin to the monastery, hm? Hopefully it's someone worth crossing blades with.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I hope so too.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Felix|It seems we're cut from the same cloth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I hope we can avoid bloodshed.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Felix|You're entitled to your opinion.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Felix|Lord Lonato's rebellion may have been quelled, but the unrest in Faerghus isn't dying down anytime soon. The boar prince should hurry up and claim the throne, rather than letting old customs hold him back.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ashe|I can't stop thinking about Lonato... I'm sorry, Professor. I know this isn't the time, but... I just can't get past it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|There's nothing to be done.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Pull yourself together.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ashe|Thank you. No matter what happens, I promise you I'll do my part. I checked on my brother and sister who were living in Castle Gaspard. Thankfully they're all right. I was worried because they're both so young, but the church in the castle town offered to take them in. That much, at least, is a big relief.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sylvain|No classes on a festival day! I thought I'd get to spend all day relaxing in the company of some lovely ladies, but now this has happened. Hey, Professor, I know there's talk of an assassination attempt, but do you really think they'll do it on the day of the Rite of Rebirth? I feel like security would be looser some other time. Is there some reason why it has to happen on that day?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mercedes|The monastery holds many treasures. Maybe the enemy is after one of those? Even so, the idea of stealing from the church is just horrible...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Annette|I bought the ingredients for making some sweet treats I can't wait to eats! Huh? Oh! I know it looks like I'm fooling around, but I'm not. I'm preparing for potential battle during my patrol by making sure I have plenty of food I can eat while walking. Smart, huh?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Good thinking.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Annette|I know! Once they're ready, I promise to share some with you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|You're making patrol sweets?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Annette|I just thought I'd be more alert if I had something sweet in my tummy. Oh, wait! Was it spicy food that you liked, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Annette|Have you heard? Rumor has it that death himself has been appearing in Garreg Mach. They say he appears every night and kidnaps folks. I wonder what happens to them…|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ingrid|Professor, while the investigation is important, don't forget to make time for your training. If we have to battle and cannot win, all will be lost. We don't know who our enemy is, so we must be prepared for anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ingrid|Lady Rhea lifts the spirits of all the people of Fódlan. We cannot allow her to come to any harm.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lorenz|Are we really just taking Claude's word for it? If so, I doubt anything will come of this. It is all probably just some sort of distasteful joke. I find it highly unlikely that anyone would be foolish enough to barge in here and cause a disturbance.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lorenz|The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is the most significant ritual for the Church of Seiros. Could it be that someone has spread these rumors of an assassination plot merely with the intention to hinder the celebration?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Raphael|I bet the enemy's using this assassination nonsense just to sneak in and raid the pantry. What do you think, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|You may be right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Raphael|Oh, I'm right all right. My animal instinct is telling me that the enemy is after our best meats.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I don't think so.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Raphael|You don't think so? Then dinner's on you if it turns out I was right!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ignatz|The monastery's so big. How can we narrow down the list of possible targets? The only places I can think of are the vault and the library, and… I guess that's it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ignatz|With the whole monastery preparing for the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth this month, it feels like everyone's a little on edge…|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lysithea|I don't know who to blame for all this commotion, but it's frankly a huge inconvenience. With everyone stuck on guard duty, our study and training time has been drastically reduced.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Some things are more important than that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lysithea|Yes, yes, I understand that. But it doesn't change the fact that it's a royal pain.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I agree--it's very inconvenient.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lysithea|Indeed. For now, let's do all we can to find and dispose of our enemy.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Marianne|It seems there were forces opposing the church, beyond Lord Lonato... I never thought such forces could exist in this world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|It makes sense that the church has enemies.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Marianne|I don't understand. What would they have against the church?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|We only know a small part of this world.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Marianne|I suppose that may be true...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Hello! I'm in charge of managing all records for the Golden Deer House. Oh, but I don't have any information of note right now. Go ahead and continue your investigation. And put a little extra effort into it, please!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Did you know that, on the last day of the rite, the monastery's open to the general public? It's kinda fun. It makes the place feel like a festival.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Leonie|Seems like donations to the monastery aren't actually kept here. That means the enemy isn't likely to be interested in money. We should turn our attention elsewhere. Then again, I guess some of the plants in the greenhouse could sell for a lot. But that can't really be it, can it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Leonie|Hey, did you hear? A knight wielding a scythe is roaming around town at night. If he's a villain, I'd like to get the measure of him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|Hmm... Might you have come looking for me because you were worried about my safety?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I was worried.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|I am quite all right. But your concern means a great deal.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The enemy could have other objectives.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|I am aware of the possibility. On the day of the ceremony, I am trusting that you will not allow your attention to wander or wane.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|I've been in town, procuring some supplies for Flayn.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Did you encounter any danger?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|No, but do not concern yourself for my safety. I am very much stronger than I appear.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|What supplies?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|Nothing out of the ordinary. Do not trouble yourself over it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flayn|Professor... I am afraid I have acted a bit childishly toward my brother recently... Given the circumstances, I requested that he provide me with some candies... Silly of me, really. The timing was improper, and I regret it very much now. Oh, but more importantly, this place is off limits, Professor. It is only open to the public on the day of the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Alois|Have you visited the Goddess Tower? It's a sacred place, used for rituals and the like. In general, students aren't allowed entry. But as you'd expect, that rule just excites their curiosity. Some have even tried sneaking in. Well, at least for this month, that kind of behavior is totally unthinkable. We have a lot more security, what with the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth coming up.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Catherine|You'd best keep your distance. In this nervous state, I might just cut you down.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Please don't.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I dare you to try.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Catherine|Oh, come on. I'm only kidding!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Catherine|Hey, Professor. You're good-looking, you know that? At the same time, you look like someone who was born to fight. I bet we'd get along. I'm also good-looking and born to fight, heh? Need any help with your class?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Catherine|Feel free to call on me when a fight's brewing. Thunderbrand and I will be there when you need us.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|You spend too much time roaming the monastery. If you're looking for something, try less aimless wandering.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I was thinking about the enemy's objective.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|Do you even know who the enemy is? You can't know why without knowing who.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I'm not looking for anything.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|Sure.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|It's none of my business anyway. I'm just here to take care of enemies who get too close.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Jeritza|You're skilled. Why won't you battle me? Hmph.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Jeralt|What's the matter? You're running all over creation. Ah... You don't believe Lady Rhea is the real target, do you? Even so, the knights have their orders. We can't abandon our duty to guard Lady Rhea. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is an important event for the Church of Seiros. They say it's the day when the goddess will return to walk among us. Not too likely, if you ask me. Uh... Best if you keep that to yourself.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hanneman|Unbelievable. What a terrifying story. However, an assassination attempt on Lady Rhea is doomed to fail. Pardon? You think the goal may be different than simple assassination? Intriguing. I suppose the priceless objects in this room could perhaps draw thieves. However, there's no one but me who could make use of them...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Manuela|Professor. I hope you're well. As for me, I had a date with a splendid specimen of a knight. But now he's suddenly not in the mood to see me again. I blame all these rumors of a deathly figure showing up in town. Such an uproar must have, beyond reason, drawn his attention away from me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Tomas|I hear you have fought alongside Catherine. I would wager that her power exceeded your expectations. Had you the chance to witness her Relic? Thunderbrand, glowing red... That glow is a sure sign that her blood contains a Crest that harmonizes with that Hero's Relic.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Cyril|Excuse me, Professor? I just wanted to let you know that Lady Rhea is always real concerned with you. She expects great things, I think. Please don't let her down, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Of course not.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Cyril|I hope you're not just saying that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|We'll see...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Cyril|Ya know what? I'm watching you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is this month, right? The monastery gates will be thrown wide open on that day! I'll be working as a guide. I hope I get to guide some lovely ladies around... Heh heh...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Squire|The goddess's home is in the sky! She lives on a bright and shining star! But in the spring, you can't see that star. That means she can't protect Fódlan. That's why we all celebrate the day when her star returns to the sky! That's the day of the Rite of Rebirth! See, see? I've been studying! I know just about everything!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Knight Of Seiros|People seem to think that all the Knights of Seiros are equal, but that isn't quite so. There are many distinguishing ranks within the order. For example, there are squires, who are training to become knights, as well as full knights, like myself. Oh, and then we have the holy knights, such as Catherine. Those are the knights that can wield a Hero's Relic.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Priest|About 20 or so years ago there was a big fire in Garreg Mach. On that day, Captain Jeralt went missing. Everyone thought he was dead... It never occurred to me that he might actually have survived. The truly strange part is that, in all those years, he hasn't changed a bit...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Knight Of Seiros|On the day of the rite, the monastery will be open to the public, including the Holy Mausoleum. The Holy Mausoleum is where the tomb of the divine Seiros lies. There she slumbers, eternally. That's...pretty much all that in there. Just an ancient coffin. It's sealed with a powerful magic, to protect against would-be grave robbers.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Knight Of Seiros|Have you heard of the War of the Eagle and Lion? It was the battle that won the Kingdom its independence from the Empire. Even the Church of Seiros had no choice but to recognize the courage of Loog, the King of Lions, who emerged victorious. The church awarded him a crown and the right to govern the Faerghus region, backing him in his bid to found the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. In return, Loog agreed to make the Church of Seiros the religion of his territory, and permitted them to publicly proselytize across the Kingdom. In the 400 years since, the church and the Kingdom have continued to maintain very close relations.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Knight Of Seiros|Something in the monastery that someone might go after? There's so much here I couldn't possibly name just one. Even this here kitchen contains previous wares. Wine bottles from centuries past and the like. I hear that stuff is fancy, but not very drinkable. I doubt anyone would go to the trouble of stealing it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Monk|It would be terrible if the greenhouse was targeted. The plants in here are incredibly valuable. This place contains the heart of Garreg Mach's 995-year history! So many beautiful flowers... Plants that can save or end lives... They are all my precious children.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Knight Of Seiros|I have heard talk of students wandering the monastery late at night. They wouldn't happen to be from your class, would they? Please keep your students in line, Professor. Kids these days...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Priest|Do you know what this room is? It is the church's treasure vault. I say treasure, but I do not mean silver and gold and jewels. It mostly contains weapons, artifacts, and the like. Anything that would cause too great a stir should it be stolen? No. The church knows better than to store anything too valuable in such an accessible location.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Monk|There are numerous books in this library that you cannot find anywhere else. But once you are here, you can read them easily enough. I doubt someone would go to the trouble of stealing one. Sometimes Seteth will dispose of books that are deemed inappropriate for the monastery, but that's about it. In a way, I suppose that makes those particular volumes more valuable... Right?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Monk|That boy who assists the archbishop... Cyril, I believe? I hear he's originally from a foreign land to the east called Almyra. I know he's still only a child, but I do wonder about his true intentions...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. Are we going to move forward with our plan?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|I believe so. How confident are you in our theory, Professor?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|We're not wrong.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Linhardt|No one's intuition is perfect. It's ridiculous not to have doubts.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|It could go either way.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Bernadetta|Oh, I don't like those odds at all...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I'm a little doubtful...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Petra|You have little doubts? That is good. We have no room for big doubts on this day.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|All that matters is how our enemy makes their move, not how our teacher feels about our plan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flayn|May I let you in on something, Professor? My brother can be a bit...callous. He told me that he was concerned about you, and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|That was said in jest, Flayn. And in confidence. Please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble. As a professor, you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flayn|Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|A coffin. How fascinating.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Hurry, Professor. We must find a place to hide where we can guard the stairs to the Holy Mausoleum. If the enemy moves as predicted, we should be able to cut off their escape path and capture every last one of them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is finally here. Let's move ahead with our plan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|Leave it to me. Professor, Are you in as well?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ingrid|We've narrowed down our objective...kind of. So, let's show everyone that we can carry out our duties better than anyone!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I'm not sure about this.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mercedes|Oh dear. Our professor seems to lack confidence in our plan. That is not very reassuring.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|I'm hungry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Annette|Umm... Oh! Well, I'll be sure to whip you up some tasty treats when this is all over!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|We're counting on you, Professor.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flayn|May I let you in on something, Professor? My brother can be a bit...callous. He told me that he was concerned about you, and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin!|

FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flayn|Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|It's time.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|All right. Let's stick to the plan, and go hide where we can watch over the entrance to the Holy Mausoleum. If anyone suspicious enters, we'll follow them in and take them down. Got it?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|The Rite of Rebirth is finally underway. Time to see if our hunch was right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Ugh, I hope it's not. Then we wouldn't have to fight anyone.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Our hunch is right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ignatz|We've all come to this conclusion together. I'm sure we got it right.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|We are mistaken.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lorenz|Do you really believe that, Professor? Claude certainly looks confident.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Only the goddess knows.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Marianne|Dear Goddess... Please protect us...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Right or wrong, the clock is ticking. All we can do now is stick to the plan.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flayn|May I let you in on something, Professor? My brother can be a bit...callous. He told me that he was concerned about you, and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|That was said in jest, Flayn. And in confidence. Please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble. As a professor, you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flayn|Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Seteth is way too overprotective. He reminds me of my brother.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Come on, Teach. I know a hidden spot where we can monitor the stairs that lead to the Holy Mausoleum. If there's anyone down there, they'll be trapped like the rats they are. We'll just have to take them down without getting bitten.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|We were right. Unwanted gusts have come to visit.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mysterious Mage|Those Central Church dastards have spotted us... Buy me some time while I open the seal on the casket!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Western Church Soldier|I'm on it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|It is as we suspected. The enemy is within.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Our enemy appears to be after the tomb of Saint Seiros in the back. Are they attempting to steal her bones? It would be best to defeat them before the achieve their aim.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Look closely... There are contraptions of some sort on the floor. We must pay attention to our enemies' weapons and advance while attacking them from advantageous positions.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mysterious Mage|Death Knight! Prove your strength and scatter these fools!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Death Knight|I don't take commands. Or waste my time on weaklings.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|That knight is a powerful enemy... Let's do all we can to avoid him.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|The enemy is after the casket of Saint Seiros. Do they intend to steal her bones? We must defeat those enemies before they open the casket.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|But look closely at the ground... There are contraptions of some sort in place. We'll have to look closely at the enemies' weapons and advance while attacking them from the best positions possible.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|That knight looks like he has experience. It would be foolish to challenge him recklessly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Our guess was spot on. Looks like we have company.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Looks like the enemy is going after the casket in the back. Maybe they're going after the saint's bones? Weird. I'd like to defeat them before they can finish the job.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|But did you notice? Look closely at the ground. There's some kind of contraption on certain parts of the floor. The smart move is to advance while finding the best fighting positions we can based on the enemy's weaponry.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|I'm getting a really disturbing vibe from that guy... No one go near the evil-looking knight, OK?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mysterious Mage|The reinforcements haven't arrived?! If they approach from behind, we can attack them from both sides...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mysterious Mage|It's no use! The seal is broken. You can't— Huh? A sword?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Death Knight|Like moths to a flame...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Death Knight|I told you that if you fled, I would not chase you. But it seems you wish to die...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Death Knight|I didn't expect to encounter someone like you... How fortunate.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mysterious Mage|You're too late! The seal will be broken any minute now...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mysterious Mage|It's no use! The seal is broken. You can't– Huh? A sword?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|There's no way around it... I accept your challenge!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Death Knight|Oh? This will be fun...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mercedes|Oh my, how frightening! Won't you please go easy on me?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Death Knight|You... Was this meeting...preordained?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mercedes|Hmm? What do you mean?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Death Knight|That sword is...I see. What a pleasant surprise.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Ugh, he got away! That sword... Why is it –|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|That's the sword that was in the casket. Seems to be shimmering, almost as though...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|He got away... We have no choice but to let them go for now. Professor... The way that sword is glowing. I wonder...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|The jerk got away. Was that magic? We can't even chase after him. Hey, Professor. The way that sword is shining... Do you think it could be...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Catherine|Is the intruder here?! Oh... Looks like you have this under control. You! Round up any stragglers.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Knight Of Seiros|Will do!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|As all of you have committed a breach of faith, the archbishop will now pass judgement.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|Inciting a Kingdom noble to rebel. Unlawful entry. The attempted assassination of the archbishop. An attack on the Holy Mausoleum. It is unnecessary to go on, followers of the Western Church.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Priest|What?! We have nothing to do with the Western Church!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|You have already been identified. Please spare us your second-rate theater.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|Dishonoring a holy ceremony is worthy of death for a member of the church. You are well past the hope of redemption. If you have any grace remaining, you will willingly offer your life as atonement for this crime.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Priest|No! This isn't what we were told would happen! We've been deceived!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Shamir|It's no use arguing. Whatever your excuse, the punishment stands.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|May your souls find peace as they return to the goddess...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Priest|Wait! Please! The goddess would never forgive you for our execution!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Priest|Monster! We know you've already slaughtered many of our fellow brethren like this!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|This concludes the investigation. Please remove these poor, lost souls from my sight.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|That's that, I suppose. The assassination attempt, the attack on the Holy Mausoleum... It was all the Western Church's doing. That masked knight who led the attack somehow managed to disappear without a trace.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|The Church of Seiros clearly isn't as unified as it would hope to appear. It seems the bishop of the Western Church was always opposed to the church being ruled centrally from Garreg Mach. Perhaps they hope to remove the archbishop in order to completely strip the Central Church of its authority.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Western Church...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Central Church?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|Ugh, that's right. Jeralt mentioned that you were raised without any exposure to the church. In order to function more efficiently, the Church of Seiros is split into several smaller entities. The Central Church is the largest and leads the organization from Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|The Western Church extends from Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato rebelled into the far west. They can be found just beyond the most renowned stronghold of the Kingdom, the Fortress City of Arianrhod.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|It seems the knights have been tasked with subduing the leaders of the Western Church. We may be give an opportunity to help them with their mission.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hubert|To think...our own professor was born in Fódlan and yet knew nothing of the church. I never imagined explaining something so basic to an instructor of mine. You're something of a special case, are you not?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Edelgard|How strange that the archbishop would ask someone like that to lead her students. There's clearly more to that decision than we know.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Caspar|Lady Rhea is pretty scary sometimes...but to execute that whole group just like that? It seems harsh, even for her.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Bernadetta|If one of us does something bad, I wonder what she would do to us!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dorothea|Professor... Do you agree with the archbishop's actions?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|There you have it... It seems that the assassination attempt and the attack on the Holy Mausoleum were all the work of the Western Church. As for the masked knight who led the attack... I'm afraid his whereabouts are yet unknown.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|It makes no sense that the Western Church would try such a thing.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|It just goes to show that the Church of Seiros is not completely united. The church is led by those here in Garreg Mach, and the Western Church doesn't have a strong voice on its governing council. I imagine the Western Church has harbored some resentment towards the Central Church for a while now.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Western Church...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Central Church?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Ah, that's right. Jeralt did say that you grew up outside the influence of the church. The Church of Seiros is split into a few branches across Fódlan. The largest being the Central Church, which is headquartered right here at Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|The Western Church lies far to the west of Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato held his rebellion. It's situated on the far side of the Kingdom's most impressive fortress, Arianrhod. I imagine the Western Church's intention was to eliminate Lady Rhea, and the Central Church's authority along with her. Naturally, the knights will be riding out to question the Western Church's top officials. Or rather...to punish them.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|When they do, Your Highness, we will likely be asked to carry out said punishment.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dimitri|Indeed. Now, I don't mean to be rude, Professor, but I must say that your situation is rather unusual. For someone to grow up in Fódlan and yet never have any contact with the Church of Seiros is...it's hard to believe.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Dedue|I wonder why the archbishop would hire someone like that as a professor...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ashe|So...those people from the Western Church were... Um, Lady Rhea had them killed, didn't she?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Mercedes|Well, of course she did. Going against the teachings of Seiros like that. Quite unforgivable!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Ingrid|Those who stray must be punished, I suppose. That said... Professor, I–|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|I suppose that's that. The assassination attempt, the attack on the Holy Mausoleum... Looks like it was all a plot by the Western Church. It's just too bad that that masked knight who was leading the attack got away. Vanished without a trace.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|But why would the Western Church want to attack Lady Rhea?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Why? Take your pick of reasons. Relations with the Western Church aren't exactly friendly.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The Western Church...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|What reasons?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Oh, that's right. Jeralt mentioned that you grew up completely isolated from the church. The Church of Seiros is split into a few different branches across Fódlan. The Central Church is headquartered right here at Garreg Mach.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|Then there's the Western Church. Far west from Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato had his little rebellion, is the Fortress City of Arianrhod. It's the strongest fortress in the Kingdom. On the other side of it is the headquarters of the Western Church.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|Not too smart to bicker with people who worship the same goddess as you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|The bishop of the Western Church must be pretty ambitious. Probably hopes to split off completely. In which case, he'd need to weaken the Central Church's influence. Killing Rhea is certainly one way to do that. To the shock of no one, I hear the knights have been sent to subdue the leaders of the Western Church. We'll probably get a chance to assist.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Hilda|You're an odd one, aren't you, Professor? How'd you make it this far in life without ever interacting with the church? I can't believe someone like you exists in Fódlan. It's too strange!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|If you think that's weird, consider the fact that Rhea hired Teach despite all that.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Raphael|So, those guys they caught... They all got the axe, right? That's brutal.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lysithea|Lady Rhea can be rather intimidating at times. In fact...she can be downright terrifying.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Marianne|Professor. Those who cannot be saved must be delivered to the goddess for judgement. Is that not so?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|There you are, Professor. It seems Lady Rhea would like a word with you. Come with me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lord Arundel|The archbishop lives. Not that I had ever placed much faith in those swine from the Western Church.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flame Emperor|I have news, both good and bad. The remains of Seiros were not in the tomb. However, something else was. The Sword of the Creator.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lord Arundel|Ah, the weapon wielded by that thief, the King of Liberation.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flame Emperor|Thief? Hm. At any rate, it is now in the hands of the academy's new professor. I doubt you will be surprised to hear that the Crest Stone had already been removed from the sword when it was found.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lord Arundel|Hmph. As expected. It would be foolish to keep both in the same location.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flame Emperor|There's more. The professor was able to awaken the sword's true power. Even without the Crest Stone, the sword glowed red. The professor's Crest is compatible. There is no mistaking it.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lord Arundel|Absurd. Using a Relic without its Crest Stone should be impossible... The King of Liberation's bloodline should not even... Hmm.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Flame Emperor|They must be allowed to keep it, for now. I do not have enough information about the professor to act. As for your request, I assent. The Death Knight is at your command. Use him well.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Lord Arundel|Good. I believe I will enjoy this a great deal...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|I cannot thank you enough for defeating those invaders in the Holy Mausoleum, and especially for protecting the Sword of the Creator. That sword is one of the Heroes' Relics, and the most precious artifact in the church's possession. It is also a weapon of terrifying power. For now...I will entrust the sword to you. Please, use it wisely.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|Lady Rhea, wait! Do you truly mean to give the Sword of the Creator to this stranger?! Surely it is not the sort of thing that one hands over so readily, even to someone who has the ability to wield it! If someone like Nemesis were to appear again, all of Fódlan would be consumed by war!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Nemesis?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|Nemesis, the King of Liberation. He is an ancient king of mankind who was defeated by Seiros over a thousand years ago. When Fódlan was attacked by wicked gods, it is said that the goddess gifted Nemesis with the Sword of the Creator. Nemesis used that sword to defeat the wicked gods, saving all of Fódlan. Henceforth he was dubbed the King of Liberation. However, his power began to corrupt him until he, himself, turned to the darkness. Saint Seiros was forced to destroy him. Lady Rhea, I beg you to reconsider. Given a little more time, we could more accurately assess this stranger's abilities.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Rhea|No. I have faith, Seteth. Faith that our friend here will not be corrupted by wickedness. Since the death of Nemesis, none have been able to wield the Sword of the Creator. Now, after all those long years of being sealed away, it has returned and found a new master.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Seteth|I...understand. As you wish, Lady Rhea. There you have it, Professor. See that you do not betray the trust the archbishop has seen fit to bestow upon you.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|The Sword of the Creator. The King of Liberation. Each tale is more confusing than the last! And I really can't read that Rhea at all... That sword is clearly precious... So why is she so keen to gift the thing to you?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|It certainly is strange.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|The sword chose me.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|Is that a fact?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|I feel as though we have become entangled in a mystery... And there is one more thing that has been plaguing me. The Sword of the Creator... It somehow feels distinct from other Relics we have seen. Such as the one that... Oh goodness, what was her name? Ca... Cat...|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Catherine?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|Yes! Her!|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Byleth|Cat?|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|What is wrong with that head of yours? Of course it's not a cat! Her name is Catherine.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Sothis|The Sword of the Creator differs from her Thunderbrand in one key way. It bears a hole...where something should have been, but is no more. I despise not knowing what is going on! It...it frightens me. And yet... I place my trust in you. I must. Whatever comes to pass...please swear to cut a path that is your own.|
FE16WhiteClouds|04-TheGoddess'sRiteOfRebirth|Claude|The Sword of the Creator… Pulled right from the legends. I finally found it, and yet it ended up in Teach's hands. Could I even use it anyway? Damn it. There's no telling what's to come…|
