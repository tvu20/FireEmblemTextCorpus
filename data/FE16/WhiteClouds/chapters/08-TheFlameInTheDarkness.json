It's because of what happened, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Don't speak of it aloud."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "You can't change the past. For now, all we can do is use it to our advantage."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I know that. I also know that I must steel myself to ascend the Imperial throne."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Those preparations are going well. We... Someone is coming."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Professor, I heard about our mission for this month. Something terrible is happening in Remire Village. That's where you were when fate sent you our way. This feels...preordained."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Are the knights making progress with their investigation?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't know."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "They are."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "If what is happening there is by design, there must be someone pulling the strings. There is the Death Knight, of course. And the mysterious mages who were implicated with the Western Church. They showed up when Flayn was kidnapped as well. And now there is another strange occurrence near the monastery... It seems an unknown organization hopes to make the monastery its stage for something."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Do you believe that all of these incidents are connected, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I do."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "That is the logical conclusion, but I'm not so sure."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I do not."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Oh? I'm surprised to hear you say that, but actually, I agree."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "It certainly appears that all of the events surrounding the monastery are connected by a single thread. However... I think it's possible that it may just be a result of different motives overlapping. Remember, Professor... If you think of people as simply enemies or allies, it may be impossible to grasp the truth."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I see. So you'll be staying here for some time, then. Honestly, I'm surprised. I've heard it's been a few years since you last donated to the church."}, {"speaker": "Lord Arundel", "line": "That was merely because of the financial situation of my territory. I assure you, it has nothing to do with my dedication to the church. By the way, Dimitri... Isn't Edelgard currently enrolled at the Officers Academy as well?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Yes. She's in the Black Eagle House. I don't believe she has any plans to leave anytime soon. Why not pay her a visit?"}, {"speaker": "Lord Arundel", "line": "I may do just that. It's nice to stay in touch with my dear niece every now and then. Of course I'm also delighted that I was able to speak with my nephew, as well. Whether through marriage or otherwise, family is family, after all."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Of course. The feeling is mutual."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Professor... If you were watching, you should have made your presence known."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Who was that?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "That was Lord Arundel, the Regent for the Empire. He is also Edelgard's uncle."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "An acquaintance of yours?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He called you his nephew..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "My stepmother was his younger sister. We are not related by blood, but he is technically my uncle."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "In other words..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "So, you and Edelgard..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Yes. My stepmother was Edelgard's birth mother. Edelgard and I are siblings by marriage. We can delve into that topic another time. For now, let's make preparations to investigate what's happening in that village."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Oh dear. The princess of the Empire and the Kingdom's prince are kin! How very odd."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "So that's why he was worried about her..."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "All beings are attached somehow to those who are their family. Yes...even I. I must have had a family too... I wish I could remember them. My family... I wonder who and where they are, and what they're doing now."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I find it odd as well..."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "They likely harbor knowledge they do not wish to share. Oh yes, I'm sure of it. But I suppose we must wait until the time of truth arrives..."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "In any case... About this Arundel. You've heard that name before, correct?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "In the library."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Quite true! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "In the office."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Your memory is worse than mine! The library! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been. Don't you recall?"}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "I thought that Arundel had died... And yet, not so. He seems alive and well. I wonder what the prince had hoped to learn from reading of his uncle's charity... So many things the prince has yet to tell... How bothersome..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Tomas doesn't seem to be here... Oh well, that's fine. I've been researching the Heroes' Relics a lot since we last spoke to him. I found out something interesting."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why have you been researching them?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Why? Do you have to ask? Trust me, what really matters is what I found out."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Something interesting?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "It's about the connection between Crests and the Heroes' Relics. The Crest Stone of each Relic is carved with a specific Crest-the one that has the ability to wield it properly. The Crests are the keys. You need the right one to safely use a Hero's Relic. The only thing I can't figure out is...why doesn't the Sword of the Creator have a Crest Stone bearing a Crest?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's by the whim of the goddess."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Hey, now! No need to write off my findings by saying it's a mere whim of the goddess."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It had one in the past."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Precisely. At least, that's my current guess."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "There's more. I believe the Crest Stones might be the source of the Relics' inhuman power. When Miklan transformed into a Black Beast, he was taken over by something that originated from the Crest Stone. And the Crest Stone was on his body. It all seems to add up. Now, look at this picture I found in the library."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "That creature is called the Immaculate One, who was supposedly sent by the goddess to save the followers of Seiros. See the pattern on its brow, and the faint circular boundary? Isn't it possible that's a Crest Stone? If all this is true, then Crest Stones are what power the ability to assume massive forms like that of the Immaculate One. And maybe the Heroes' Relics can harness that transformative power..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Oh. It is you. Have you seen Tomas recently?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "No such luck. I was hoping to speak with him myself, but he seems to be out on the town."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "I see. Well... Hm?! Where did you find that picture?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "It was in the library. Why do you ask? Is it something my youthful eyes shouldn't be seeing?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "No, of course not. However, that is not part of this library's collection. It must belong to Tomas. It would be problematic if it got mixed in with the other books. I will take possession of it for now."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": " Take it away where no one can see it, you mean..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "What was that?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "That's what Tomas said. He said records that the monastery doesn't approve of tend to disappear."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Tomas said that? Preposterous. I have far too much to accomplish to waste time with this foolishness."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "He was certainly in a hurry. I wonder if he's off to confront Tomas. Well, he took the picture, so I guess that's that for now. I'll see you later, Teach."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "So, the church is hiding something after all. Some massive secret about Relics and Crests. A secret that must have something to do with the professor's true identity..."}], "conversation": [{"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "I do not know why it is so, but being here makes me feel quite...unwell.

Are you feeling the same?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I am."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "And yet, it feels familiar... As though pulled from a corner of my memory, from a time long ago... I simply cannot fathom it."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I am not."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Why must you be so difficult! I know the entire contents of your heart and soul, so you should know there is no fooling me!"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "They say that things rarely if ever go according to plan. Still, plan we must. After all, if we don't effectively force things to go our way, nothing will be achieved. How about you, Professor?

If you're not feeling well, I'd strongly recommend some rest."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Even if I spend all my time rummaging through this library, there's a limit to the knowledge that can be gained. Apparently, it only contains books whose contents have been deemed appropriate by the church. If only Tomas were around.

I was just asking Monica here to be less demanding of Lady Edelgard's time."}, {"speaker": "Monica", "line": "Hey, it's not like I'm bothering her! Sorry for the ruckus, Professor.

I wish you would worry about it a little more."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "Remire Village... Is that not where you met Edelgard?

I certainly feel like I earned a special reward. Don't you, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "No. Winning is its own reward."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "I was afraid you might say that.

I think about all sorts of things."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Oh! Like tomorrow's menu, for instance?"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I'm worried about Remire.

Ah! Come on, don't tease me. But what if it really was something like that? How could we hope to stop it?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "I wonder how Remire Village is faring. Hopefully we're not dealing with some new epidemic. It wouldn't be unheard of. Almost 20 years ago, a terrible plague blazed through Faerghus. It even hit the capital city, taking the queen consort's life...or so I heard. The whole Kingdom was in an uproar over that loss. The person who saved the Kingdom wasn't a doctor but a holy woman\u2013the fair Lady Cornelia. After that, she was awarded the honor of being a mage in the service of the royal family. She sounds like an amazing woman, but... She must be pretty old by now. But hey, maybe she's aged like a fine wine."}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "Oh, goodness. Is something the matter, Professor? You look a little pale... Please be careful. It's so easy to catch a cold this time of year."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Hmm...

If so, I would urge you not to push yourself too hard. Take some rest."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Nothing gets by you."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Just my natural talent. Nothing out of the ordinary. Enough wit, now. You should lie down."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What an unexpected kindness."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "What is that supposed to mean? Never mind. If you're not feeling well, you should stop trying to walk it off and simply lie down."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Hey, Professor. Can I get your advice on something? I just don't know what to do anymore. I used to think they were the best, but now I can't even stand looking at them!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's OK to be worried."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "But worrying about it won't solve my problems! What if I can never eat fish again?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Time heals all wounds."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Good point, Professor. I think I need to see other meats right now.

The Battle of the Eagle and Lion was such good fun, don't you think?"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Ignatz, how long are you going to keep harping on about the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Aw, come on, let me gush! Did you see how the house leaders came together after the battle? What an incredible thing to witness! Harmony, even after something so hard-fought."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "True. If they can keep playing nice, perhaps there will be peace in F\u00f3dlan after all."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I heard about Remire Village from some of the knights. It's certainly troubling. If it's a contagion, we at Garreg Mach should be on the lookout as well."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't believe it is."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Oh? Well, that's better, but I wonder what the real cause could be... Your words are oddly persuasive, Professor.

Do you ever wish you could return to your life as a mercenary?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I do."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "I thought you might. Traveling the world, just you and Jeralt... How lovely it must have been."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I do not."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Is that so? I suppose you have become accustomed to your new line of work.

Half a year has come and gone since then. How quickly time passes..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "What is it? I am in the middle of my daily duties.
