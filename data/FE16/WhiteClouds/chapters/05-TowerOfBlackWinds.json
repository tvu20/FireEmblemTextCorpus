It's not hard to imagine why he left and wound up in this sort of life."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "There's no reason that Crests should have the power to dictate someone's destiny. Don't you agree, Gilbert? He was just another victim of cruel fate. Forsaken by the goddess, who now demands his execution."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "It should be in our sights soon, Professor. The abandoned tower those thieves are using as a base... Conand Tower."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "This area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago. That's when invasions from the north were at their peak.

They were in rough shape, no doubt because of the thief attacks. They're not going to make it through the winter in that condition. If the thieves had taken up pillaging in order to survive, that would be deplorable...but understandable. But this... This is something else entirely. It looks as though they destroyed those villages purely for pleasure. No matter what their reasons may be, that sort of behavior cannot be allowed.

If I can answer them, I will."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Have you ever seen the Lance of Ruin?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "I have. A long time ago.

Interesting. As far as I knew, that wasn't possible. And then we have the mythical Sword of the Creator, which can't be used by anyone except Teach, Crest or no Crest.

No, I do not. Not really. All I will say is that we have trained together a few times in the past."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Do you have history with him?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "No... It's nothing.

The Heroes' Relics are incredibly powerful. Please be on your guard."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Oof. This wasn't the first time I've taken part in an Alliance roundtable conference, but it was still exhausting. There's not enough cooperation in that group, especially from Lorenz's father. But at least my grandfather was surprisingly alert. Judging by that, I'd say he's got at least five more years in him."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Hey, Teach. I hear you were able to use the Sword of the Creator. That means... What does that mean? Could it mean that you're a descendant of Nemesis, the King of Liberation?!"}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "The coffin of Seiros in the Holy Mausoleum should have held her remains. Instead, they say, it held the Sword of the Creator. What could it mean?"}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "Swinging a sword about in the Holy Mausoleum?

It's torture not being able to go inside the Holy Mausoleum for an entire year."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "You and your class were at that fight in the Holy Mausoleum, right? I sincerely hope the holy artifacts are unscathed. I admit I wish I could've been there to see it all, even if it does make me queasy. But I was there too early. I'd gone first thing in the morning. At noon, one of the monks chased me out saying I'd been there too long. Who were they to decide when I've been somewhere too long?"}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "I heard a relic was stolen.

Does that mean you're descended from nobility? You've certainly got the look for it... I sure do wish there were more nobles like you, Professor. A teacher, a mercenary, and so very mysterious... How could a girl ever get enough?"}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "I have never had goings to the Kingdom's north. I hear the people of north are cold and have much loneliness.

I can't wait to face off against such a legendary weapon!"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "So the whole plan to attack the monastery was some plot devised by the Western Church? That means they used Lonato. What right do they have to drag a good man like that into their schemes?!"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "There's going to be a big investigation into the Western Church soon. I wish I could be a part of it. I want to hear for myself why Lonato had to die."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "I'm so sorry my older brother is causing you all this hassle, Professor.

This is such a rare opportunity for him to see his family..."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Professor, please leave Sylvain alone for the time being. The thing is, the bandits' leader who stole the Relic...is Sylvain's disinherited older brother."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "I have heard that someone from House Gautier, one of the Kingdom of Faerghus's noble families, is causing some sort of commotion. What a complete disgrace to the nobility."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Hey, Professor.

Maybe he's made some kind of big discovery."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Is it true that Lady Rhea entrusted the Sword of the Creator to you? I can hardly even fathom you being capable of wielding something of such power. Just who are you, anyway?"}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Aristocrats are fools\u2013-allowing their lives to be dictated by their Crests.

Is that just a coincidence, I wonder?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I believe so."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Oh, I was just kidding! Anyway, as I said before, I do like having a little drama in my life."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe. Maybe not."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "What do you mean?

I doubt there's anything I can do for him, but I figured I'd ask anyway."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why don't you ask him yourself?"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I did, but he just dodged the question. Still, it's worrying to see him like that."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "You must be rather bewildered by the power that was hidden within. However, know that I believe in you. I have no doubt that you will use that power justly. You will most certainly fulfill the grand destiny that the goddess has seen fit to grant you."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Ah, Professor. Jeralt was looking for you."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Where is he?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "It seems he has gone off somewhere. If he is not in his room, then surely someone has seen him. Ask around."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "How are you managing the Sword of the Creator? No problems? I hope you have not left it lying somewhere unattended or anything foolish like that."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "No problems."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm not quite used to it yet."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "You will need the sword's power on your next mission.

Perhaps it is resigned to its woeful fate of being plucked from the water and eaten... Ah, Professor. You are so outgoing with all of the students. I would like to have more opportunities to connect with you, though I am certain my brother would disapprove."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "You acquitted yourself honorably last month. To think they'd go into the Holy Mausoleum and assault the Goddess Tower... I cannot imagine the Western Church is acting on its own. Someone must have been helping them. As for the masked knight who escaped, his days are numbered. I hope we find him soon, so I can kill him myself."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Hail, Professor. If I may introduce myself, I am Gilbert. My life has been spent as a dedicated knight. I am to accompany you on your assignment.

Yes, the actual Crest of Flames! No, that is quite enough. I should compose myself. I must remain objective in my research. Objective.

We cannot afford to let ourselves be swept along, and yet..."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "It's awful, just awful what happened with the Rite of Rebirth. The infirmary... Well, it was a mess. Things are finally calm again, and so I've come here to unwind. Let me tell you, I put all of my knowledge to use keeping those kids alive. Still, the truth of it is that when someone faces death for the first time...well, they figure out who they are. They learn if they can do it again. We can't lose them, Professor. Not to battle, or to cowardice. If you can keep them going, then I will too."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I will protect them."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I will try my best."}, {"speaker": "Tomas", "line": "The head of the Western Church holds the title of bishop. That's not as distinguished as an archbishop such as Lady Rhea, but it still comes with a fair amount of authority. If someone in that position plotted an assassin, I cannot help but think it must have been instigated by some outside force. There are bishops in the Eastern Church as well, but to speak frankly, they do not have much impact. They are under the influence of both the archbishop and the Leicester Alliance, so their ability to voice grievances is quite limited."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "I hear about the things you did.

Those things are even worse when threatened."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Can you see that barrier? It is surrounded by great power. You must break through to fight that thing. A strong attack or gambit might help to break through more quickly. If you can break the barrier, that power will have nowhere else to go, and that will likely cause confusions for that thing. It cannot counter while confused, which means that is the best time to attack!"}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "If you break down all of their barriers, not only will they be confused, they will not be able to move for a short while. Without the power flowing around them, they will not be able to restore their barriers.

The damaged caused at times like that is not contained to just one spot. Once they have charged some power ups, their barriers will be restored. You really must pay close attention to those things!

Does that mean you possess that power too?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Professor, you have returned. The goddess is indeed generous with her divine protection. I have already heard Gilbert's report about what happened. See to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself.

You are worthy of wielding the Sword of the Creator, so there is no need to worry."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "The church will formally return the lance to House Gautier. If you would..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "As you wish."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "You have my gratitude. I can see that I was right to trust you with this. Please report back. I will tell you of your new mission for the coming moon at that time."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I will not."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "What is the meaning of this?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Ahem, excuse me.  Lady Rhea, I am overjoyed and beyond grateful to you for recovering the Relic of my family, House Gautier. Now, may I please have that lance? I have received direct approval from my father to take possession of it."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "As the next head of House Gautier, do you swear that you will never cause such a deplorable incident to transpire?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "On my family's name...and on my brother's life, I swear it."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Very well. However, I have one condition. You must never allow another to wield this lance. Your brother clearly demonstrated what fate awaits those who break that restriction."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Yes. I...I will not soon forget."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I assume the archbishop was pleased with your performance. Did you return the Lance of Ruin?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I returned it."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": " No need to lie, Professor. I saw Sylvain earlier. It was written all over his face."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I did not return it."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": " I'm glad. Sylvain must be overjoyed as well."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": " There's no need to lie, Professor. No one could have expected you to disobey the archbishop."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I keep thinking about what Gilbert told us..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "About Miklan?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "About House Gautier?"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Yes, Miklan was discarded by his family because he was born without a Crest. Eventually he became a masterful thief and gathered enough ruffians to capture a fortress. Right or wrong, he was a gifted leader. He could have been a great asset to F\u00f3dlan. What a waste. It's true that a Crest can increase your magical abilities and allow you to wield the full might of a Hero's Relic. But one cannot measure a leader's worth based solely on whether or not they bear a Crest. There are plenty of talented people in this world without one."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I completely agree."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why is everyone obsessed with Crests?"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "People believe Crests are blessings from the goddess, that they're necessary to maintain order in F\u00f3dlan. But the people are wrong. Crests are to blame for this brutal, irrational world we live in. Their power is granted only to a select few, whom we elevate and allow to rule the world. Have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the Crests? Do that, and people will have no choice but to rise and fall by their own merits."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Lady Edelgard. I question whether you revealed too much to the professor."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Perhaps I did."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "It is true that our teacher possesses a rare talent. Even I cannot deny it. The ability to wield the Sword of the Creator is concerning..."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I've already explained this to you. My power alone is insufficient. That's why I'm borrowing power from those people. If our teacher can wield it in my stead... I believe that would be for the best."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "It's a risk. A dangerous one. You leave me no choice but to take matters into my own hands. Please excuse me."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I can't hide from the truth. I can't do all that I must on my own. If all I can rely on is my own ambition, my path won't be easy. Is it so risky...to reach out my hand? Father... I swear I will not stop until I succeed. My regret. My grief. My whole life. I've thrown it all away...into the darkness..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Is your meeting over, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You look troubled."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Are you weary?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I was just thinking about something. Professor... The possession of Relics and Crests has been highly valued in Faerghus since ancient times. It's far from uncommon for someone to lose their ability to lead their house because they don't bear a Crest. Just like Miklan. It happened to my uncle as well. The eldest child of the king, and yet he never ascended to the throne. All families whose bloodlines carry Crests of the 10 Elites are much the same. But House Gautier takes it a step further, and absolutely requires an heir who possesses a Crest."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why are they so obsessed with it?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why House Gautier in particular?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "To that house, the power of Crests is a necessity, not a luxury. House Gautier holds the most northern territory in the Kingdom, and they have fought with the people to the north for many years. The head of that house is responsible for protecting that territory from fearsome invaders, whom they keep at bay with the power of Crests and Relics. In exchange for that responsibility, they are granted special privileges within the Kingdom."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Their Crests grant them special privileges?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "In a way. That said, ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Strength is strength, with or without a Crest."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I believe the same. Ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I believe that Margrave Gautier was wrong to disinherit Miklan because he did not bear a Crest. Still, there is always a reason for why such customs stand the test of time. Imagine what this world would be like if no one placed any stock in Crests... Bloodlines that carry Crests would dwindle. The metaphorical blade used to oppose threats would eventually rest. This same argument has been made time and time again across the years. Both sides are at once right and wrong."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What do you believe, Dimitri?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I believe those with Crests and those without should acknowledge the others' strengths and learn to respect each other based on personal merits. And that doesn't apply only to Crests. The same holds true for lineage, race, faith, ideologies... If we could just accept each other and make mutual concessions, one step at a time... Perhaps... Who knows if that's even possible. Everyone has something that is unacceptable within them. I certainly do, and I'd wager you do as well. I wonder which is best, Professor... To cut away that which is unacceptable, or to find a way to accept it anyway..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Nice work, Teach. It's thanks to you that we successfully completed our mission. As for Miklan... I wonder if he really believed he could wield a Relic."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Hard to say."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I bet he just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew he couldn't use it."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I doubt it."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Agreed. He probably just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew it was futile."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Though I'm sure he wasn't counting on turning into a monster like that... I wonder if that monster represents another aspect of the Heroes' Relics. What a strange and terrifying power."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't know."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It seems so."}, {"speaker": "Tomas", "line": "Stories of misfortune have followed the Heroes' Relics since ancient times."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Tomas! You've caught me by surprise. That's not easy to do. Though I suppose I should've expected to see our librarian in his library."}, {"speaker": "Tomas", "line": "I am sorry to intrude. I simply heard you speaking of the Heroes' Relics. I can tell you more about them, if you'd like. The story goes that Nemesis was corrupted by evil because of the Sword of the Creator. Other Heroes also lost themselves by continuing to use the Relics...transforming into Black Beasts with twisted souls. There used to be a great many records regarding the dark history of the Relics."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Used to be?"}, {"speaker": "Tomas", "line": "They have been destroyed, across all of F\u00f3dlan. Stripped from their shelves, including those that resided at this very library."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "You make it sound like the church is covering up the truth. But now that you mention it, Rhea was very specific about not wanting anyone to find out what happened at Conand Tower. Hey Tomas... why are you telling us all this?"}, {"speaker": "Tomas", "line": "It seemed like you were searching for answers about the Relics. What is a librarian if not a guide in the search for knowledge. And not only have you been searching, but you have been doing so through the night. I would suggest you stop before the knights notice. And that is enough meddling for today. Please excuse me."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "So I've been found out, have I? I suppose I do spend more time at the library than most students. But I won't stop. I can't afford to."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What are you after?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Teach... You don't really expect me to tell you something so personal like that, do you? Though, I wouldn't mind sharing if you were to tell me some of your secrets in exchange..."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I can't let this exchange pass without comment... If you're sharing secrets, perhaps I can share one as well?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Are you sure you could survive that? I'd say you're the least likely to share secrets out of everyone at the academy."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Heh heh, coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment. After all, you're easily the student with the most secrets."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I'm afraid you overestimate me. My secrets don't amount to much. But back to Teach..."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Don't try to change the subject, Claude. We're talking about secrets. Yours. Who is your father? And why did you appear so suddenly, as if from nowhere? Duke Riegan's eldest son died in an accident. Having tragically lost other family members as well, he was without an heir. The Alliance would undoubtedly have been shaken if House Riegan had lost its position of leadership. But then you showed up. Why did you return to House Riegan? What brought you to the monastery?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I would like to hear this as well."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He doesn't have have to answer to you."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Alas...to be surrounded by women as lovely as flowers, only to be pricked by their thorns."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "My dream, in truth, is a selfless dream. But I require power to make it a reality. When I learned about the power of my Crest, I knew I had a chance. So I'm chasing that dream. To the bitter end, if need be. I came to this monastery because I thought I might find someone useful. Someone to help me on my path. So, what do you think? If you promise to help me achieve my dream no matter what, I'll promise to tell you anything."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": " I have my own dream to tend to. I pray that yours does not interfere with mine."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "What about you, Teach?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "If it's a noble dream..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That may be difficult."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I see. Well, now isn't the time to discuss this. You are still my Teach, after all."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Professor, you have done well to complete such a difficult task. You have shown exceptional skill in leading your students. I am forever grateful for the safe return of the Hero's Relic. Just as I expected, you have mastered the Sword of the Creator. Now then, I shall tell you about your mission for the coming month..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": " Rhe\u2013 Archbishop!"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Seteth, what troubles you?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Flayn is missing! I cannot find her anywhere!  Professor, have you seen Flayn recently?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I have not."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "I have searched everywhere! Where could she be?!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Have you looked everywhere?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "I have searched every corner I can think of! I could not find her anywhere."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "She may be in danger! Oh no... No, no! What am I to do?!"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Calm yourself, Seteth. Professor, we shall continue our discussion another time."}]}
