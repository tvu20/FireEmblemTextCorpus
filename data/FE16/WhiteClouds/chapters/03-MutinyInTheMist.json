You can count on that."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Doubtless, there are times when one must take up their blade, even if there's no chance of winning. But this... It's downright senseless.

Please be ready for anything, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "After Faerghus lost its king, there were many rebellions. It is likely Lord Lonato's provocations are related.

Are we ever gonna do anything but find and subdue people? Well, if we're just going to tie up loose ends, at least it'll be pretty safe. I don't mind stretching my legs for this one. And if Catherine's going, too, there's a good chance we'll get a look at her Relic in action."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Hey, Teach. There's some minor noble rebelling in Faerghus, right? He has no chance of winning. I wonder what he hopes to achieve... Huh? Are you going along to help?

Why would a minor lord raise an army against a foe he cannot possibly hope to defeat?"}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "My central duty as a noble is to protect the commonfolk.

At least, he never said anything to me about it."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "What's going to happen to Lonato? If he's killed, I... I don't know how I'll live with that."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Professor, have you seen Felix around?

Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I saw him at the dining hall."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Ah, right, it is meal time. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Don't you love looking after horses? I do. They repay your absolute love and trust with the same. I wish girls were so easy to deal with..."}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "I've heard whispers about Lord Lonato. They say he is a very kind and gentle lord. Why would such a kind man suddenly raise an army? Oh, Professor. You were working late last night, weren't you? You shouldn't overdo it. A ghost might rise up from the well to get you if you stay you too late! Or so I'm told."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "We're going on a mission with the knights, right? I wonder if... Oh... Sorry! It's nothing. I was just wondering if someone I've been searching for might be among them."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You're looking for a knight?"}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Yes. Well...maybe? If he's here, he's probably a knight.

I'm definitely going to find him one of these days!"}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "To be honest, I've felt a bit lost here at the monastery. At a loss for what to do. Thankfully, a sweet young girl reached out and offered help. I believe she's Seteth's little sister."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Why does His Highness take the side of the people of Duscur? I just don't understand it. Only four years ago, they murdered our king and slaughtered the soldiers and knights who were with him, all of whom were innocent. Even if he can forgive them, I can't\u2013not ever. What they've done is against all codes of honor and ethics."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "We are truly blessed with how fertile the monastery grounds are. Every day, there's something new to harvest!"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "It's a noble's duty to protect the commonfolk, not to endanger them by rallying armies in such a feckless and improper manner. Abuse of that kind is no better than slavery. A proper noble must guard the people from such a fate, wouldn't you say?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I agree."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Precisely why true nobility is well respected."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We don't know all the details yet."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "There can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation. Let us put an end to this quickly."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Hey, Professor! Do you happen to have any food on you? I'm starving! No matter how much I eat before I train, I'm always so hungry after. My muscles must be going through a growth spurt!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "This place has so many breathtaking works of art. I feel like I'm living in a museum. Each piece can teach us about styles and techniques from a thousand years ago!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Do you know a lot about art?"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art, but I won't pretend to be an expert."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Do you like art?"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Oh yes, very much. I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Ah, Professor. It would seem that a minor lord in Faerghus is raising an army\u2026 This poses a threat, obviously. But not one for the Kingdom\u2014for the church. I mean, Faerghus doesn\u2019t even have a king at present. There\u2019s something\u2026unsettling about this army. You had better ensure we\u2019re fully prepared."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "The monastery grounds are far too spread out. Feels like it takes hours to get from one area to another. And, no, that's not because I'm getting lost. I'm a fully capable, mature person! Who never gets lost."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Oh. Hello, Professor... Um. Was there something you needed?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I came to see the horses."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Oh! You like horses? I like them too. They're such kind creatures."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm just looking around."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "I see. I won't bother you, then..."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Professor, your clothes are a bit dirty. If you don't pay attention to your hygiene, the girls won't like you! I hate when my clothes get dirty. That's one of the many reasons I find it best to train as little as possible."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Professor, your clothes are a bit dirty. I'd have expected you to be more careful, seeing as how you're a professor and all. I hate when my clothes get dirty. That's one of the many reasons I find it best to train as little as possible."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I'm studying here so I can be the best there is, just like Captain Jeralt. Do you think I've got it in me to be a top tier mercenary, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That depends on how hard you work."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I'm going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here, I can tell you that."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You really want to bring the money in, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I do! Though, it's about so much more than being rich. It's about honor."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Pointing a sword at the Holy Church of Seiros is akin to pointing a sword at the goddess herself. Meting out appropriate punishments to the sinful... It is a sacred duty with which we have been entrusted. As a member of the church yourself, I hope that you will take that to heart."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "If you have a moment, I would like to have a word. It has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have been making advances towards Flayn. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Not at all."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Actually..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "If you do see anyone getting too close with Flayn, please, inform me of it at once."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "If the flowers within the greenhouse are removed, they will soon wilt and whither...

You really are as hardworking as they say."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's an overstatement. I'm just me."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Spoken like a true hard worker."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's right. I'm a force of nature."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Huh. Maybe the gossip's wrong. Hardworking people usually don't like to make a big fuss about it."}, {"speaker": "Jeritza", "line": "What?

Just to enjoy the horror of it?"}, {"speaker": "Tomas", "line": "Professor, I heard that you may battle alongside Catherine.

I hear it's nothing short of amazing."}, {"speaker": "Knight Of Seiros", "line": "Since we're heading to Castle Gaspard, that means we'll be passing through Magdred Way. The road is well known for its beautiful surroundings. Depending on the time of year, it can be incredibly foggy, though. When it's like that you can't enjoy the lovely scenery... Lucky for us, it shouldn't be too foggy while we're there. Not that we'll have time for sightseeing anyway."}, {"speaker": "Knight Of Seiros", "line": "I hear that Lord Lonato served the king of Faerghus's older brother when he was younger.

The commoners who allied themselves with Lord Lonato believed they were fighting for a just cause. It would be disrespectful to consider them simply victims when they died for what they believed in.

Even if our enemies are the gods themselves...we must never lose sight of our goal."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's taking it a bit far."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Is it?

I'm afraid this incident is far more serious than anticipated."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Why... Why did this happen? Lonato was always such a kind man...

Those weren't knights or soldiers, but fathers and sons! We...we shouldn't have killed them. We should have found another way... I...I'm sorry. It's not fair for me to blame you for the circumstance. I know that if we hadn't...done what we did, even more civilian lives would have been lost. At least, my mind understands that. But...my heart... Professor... Those in power, no matter the era, always claim they fight for a just cause. That they take life to protect it. But... Is it truly OK to take any life you please, all in service of some implacable \"just cause\"? Lord Lonato didn't take up arms out of a lust for power. He simply believed his cause to be just. Who's to say it wasn't? Maybe we didn't have to cut him down like that. Maybe we could have reached a mutual understanding...found a path of peace. I...I have to believe that. Perhaps the notion sounds laughable to you. Mere lip service to naive ideals.

I love the confidence, Teach. But you're no match for the Heroes' Relics.

Just the usual fanciful nonsense. An ancient Relic that once cut a mountain in half with a single swing. That's what they say, anyway. But as amazing as Thunderbrand is, I don't think it fits that description. Apparently, Relics can harness tremendous power for those with a compatible Crest. Though you can technically use one so long as you have any Crest at all. I dunno. Long story short, I'd like to try cutting a mountain in half someday."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Ooh! Are you talking about Relics? You'll be able to wield one soon, Claude! I just know it! After all, you've already been selected as the next head of House Riegan!"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Easy there, Hilda. I don't know how apt \"soon\" is. My grandfather is still unbearably healthy. Oh? Is this news to you, Teach? Yours truly was recently recognized as a legitimate child of House Riegan. They possess one of the Heroes' Relics too, though I've yet to see it."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Just recently?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I officially joined House Riegan only last year.

Where is she now?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I can't say. My mother's currently living in a different world than the one she grew up in and has no desire to return home."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Um, OK. You sure have a lot of secrets, don't you?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I'm just keeping a promise to my parents. Make of that whatever you will. In exchange for my so-called secrecy, I'm free to do as I please, which is why I decided to see what the other side of my family was like. That's how I found out about this strange Crest I bear..."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Professor, Claude. It sounds like the troops will be withdrawing soon. We should return as well."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "We won. We should be celebrating. Instead, we're heading back with heavy hearts..."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Whoa there! What's the matter? You look as sad as a kitten without any yarn. If we hadn't done what we did, the rebel army would have followed this road all the way to the monastery. And they would have crushed all the little villages along the way. We stopped that from happening. You should be proud."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Sorry to intrude, but this incident may be more serious than anticipated."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "I found this on Lord Lonato. It's a note that mentions a plan to assassinate Lady Rhea. We can't tell who sent it, so the source is suspect, but the content is too disturbing to ignore. We must report this to Lady Rhea right away. I hope that it's nothing..."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "I am glad to see that you have returned safely. The goddess is gracious with her divine protection. But it was not only her divine protection that shielded you, was it?

However, we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers, even if those sinners are civilians. I pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Our real concern is what Catherine reported. The secret message that was in Lord Lonato's possession. It contained a deplorable plot to target the archbishop on the day of the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth. The plan seems unrealistic at best, but a threat is a threat. We must maintain constant vigilance. To that end, I would like for you and your students to help with security on the day of the ritual."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You can count on us."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We won't let her down."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Won't that endanger the students?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best, they should be fine so long as they have you on their side."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "The Rite of Rebirth is of paramount importance. It is when the Church of Seiros and its believers unite to pray for the return of the goddess. The archbishop and I will be confined to the Goddess Tower once the ritual begins. Of course, the knights will be on high alert as well, but there aren't enough of them to keep watch on every corner of the monastery. It is far from ideal to be forced to mobilize students, but the gravity of this situation requires that we all bend to avoid breaking."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "While there is no need to fear for my safety, we cannot turn a blind eye to those who would blaspheme so heinously."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "With any luck, this will all be for naught.
