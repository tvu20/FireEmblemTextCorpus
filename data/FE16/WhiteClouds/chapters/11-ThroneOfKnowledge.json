Is it OK for you to be out on your own right now? Just\u2026please be careful not to topple over again. You scared us nearly to death. Anyway\u2026 Doesn't Rhea want something from you? Sounds important. I'm glad I'll be there to witness the ritual at the Holy Tomb. I want to see whether or not something happens with my own eyes."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I always knew there was something special about you, but you've only gotten more and more extraordinary the longer I've know you.

I have a feeling that things will only grow more dire from here on out."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "Edelgard and Hubert have been busier than usual. Constantly coming and going, in and out of Garreg Mach. Perhaps they are doing something in the Empire? As the legitimate heir of the Aegir family, I have not heard anything about it.

Did Hanneman make his, I will do no harm speech or promise this won't hurt a bit when he asked to study you? Both? I've a bit of research I'd like to perform. Nothing so crass as Hanneman's poking, prodding, and drawing of blood. No, I wish to investigate Crest power itself. Crest power must have some kind of limit, right? Lady Rhea says any limits must be the protection of the goddess, but that doesn't quite answer it for me. Hmm..."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "You're so strong now!

I still plan on beating you some day!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'll help you get there."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "You'd better not go easy on me. I need your training to be strict if I'm gonna get any better!"}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "So hungry... Oh, is that you, Professor? Sorry. I'm really not feeling well this month. Even leaving my room for dinner is just too much. It's got nothing to do with your, um...changes. So, um, don't open the door, please!"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Recently, Professor, I feel as though you've been a bit distant. It's like you're sort of floating above the clouds, separate from other people... And like you've got no interest at all in ever coming back down. How can I help?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm not being distant, so don't worry."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't know what to say to that."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Hey, don't worry. I thought maybe I'd ask and see what you'd say."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "In Brigid, we have legends. Stories containing people who have a spirit living inside of them. Those spirit people have much strength. They are maybe able to fly in the air or race across the ocean. Hair that shines and eyes that glow... They have qualities that are not unlike what you are looking like, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I can't fly."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Are you knowing that for certain? Maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Perhaps."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Do not have doubt, Professor. The powers you have are like the powers of the legends."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Hurry up and cage the wild boar. Look, he's losing his grip. Even in his swordplay, he's getting sloppy. If he keeps progressing like this, he's going to get himself killed. Kronya, Solon... They're dead, but we still have a glut of enemies. We still have to take down the Death Knight and the Flame Emperor. Our next battle is fast approaching. I'm ready for it."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I can't even imagine what it must be like inside the Holy Tomb."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't know either."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Well, it's probably a grave, that much is for sure. And it's likely underground. Beyond that, who knows?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's just a place to bury people."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I guess you're right. Holy or not, all graves are kind of the same, aren't they?"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I can't help but wonder though... Just what kind of ritual is this?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "I swear, it's like you're an entirely different person."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I haven't changed on the inside."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Heh, I guess you're right. If I look hard, I can still tell it's you."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Isn't it weird?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": " No, not at all! I'm just not used to it. It really suits you though."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": " It's not weird at all. It's... You're somehow even more beautiful than before. I'm joking! I'm joking! Don't get mad."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "You've been granted this power by the goddess herself. Truly, you must be a very special individual. Maybe Seiros transformed before receiving her revelation too!"}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "Hmm. I haven't heard anything about that before... Maybe that part never found its way into the legend?"}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "It is told that Seiros had a revelation instructing her to use her power for good, and to lead the people of F\u00f3dlan to salvation... I wonder what sort of revelation you might have, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Bah! Professor! Sorry, this will take some getting used to... Your hair and eye color are completely different! You just don't look like yourself anymore."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's only my appearance that has changed."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Of course. You're right. I'm just being silly, as usual."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe I am a different person..."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Don't scare me like that! You are still you...right? You are, right?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "To be honest, I cannot keep up with all that's been happening recently. Monica was actually Kronya. Tomas was actually Solon. Who were these people? What about you, Professor? You are a true ally, yes?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's my intention."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Not the most convincing answer you could have given. Still, I simply must take you at your word."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't know."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Pull yourself together! It is still your duty to lead us, is it not?"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "You look so...different. You're still our professor in there, right? Did anything else change besides your hair and eyes? Are your arms bigger? How do your abs look?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I've changed quite a bit."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Really?! You gotta teach me how to do that!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I haven't changed that much."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "That's disappointing. What's even the point?"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "So, this month's mission is to take part in a ritual at the Holy Tomb, where you will receive a revelation from the goddess herself. What if she really appears? What if I finally get to gaze upon her radiance? I've always imagined the goddess--how beautiful she must be!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "You're going to the ritual at the Holy Tomb, right? I hear that a revelation from the goddess is expected. What if she shows herself? I'll be so jealous!"}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Your hair! And your eyes! What happened to you?! You didn't lose something as a result of gaining those powers, did you?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Don't worry\u2014I'm fine."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I see. Well, that makes me feel better. But still, be careful."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't know yet."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Sometimes our frail bodies don\u2019t do well with excess power\u2026 So don\u2019t push yourself too hard."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Long ago, Saint Seiros was gifted with a divine revelation from the goddess, as well as incredible power. Is that what happened to you too, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "No way! The professor transformed before receiving any kind of divine revelation, right? Still, I wonder. Does the fact that you've changed really mean you've been granted some kind of power?"}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "If that's the case, then what sort of revelation can be gained from the ritual?"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "I'm guessing the revelation will just be a gentle reminder to use this new power to save the people of F\u00f3dlan. What else is there to say? You don't actually believe we're going to hear the voice of the goddess, do you?"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "When you changed, even the other professors were taken completely by surprise. There's a ritual at the Holy Tomb this month, isn't there? I wonder what will happen with that. I'm sure you'll be all right. But don't lose sight of who you really are, OK? However you may change, and whatever new power goes along with those changes--you'll still be the same person, deep down. Remember that."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "You haven't a thing to worry about. You have been gifted the power of the goddess. Furthermore, you have overcome the death of your father, Jeralt...and you have destroyed countless of our wicked foes. I am proud...so very proud of who you have become."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Once we finish the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum, all will be well."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm uneasy."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "That is understandable. Just know that your unease should disappear the moment we conclude the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Hmm... Ah. It is you. I am sorry, but I have a lot on my mind. I would prefer to be alone right now."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Professor, I am so happy. Your new hair and eye color suit you well. We make quite the pair! But...recently I sense that things are a bit strained between Lady Rhea and my brother. She wants to do something at the Holy Tomb. I do not know what, but... Hm. Whenever it has concluded, I hope they will return to their friendship, as it has always been..."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Captain... Oh, Professor! How long have you been standing there? I didn't see you. I was just sorting through Captain Jeralt's belongings. I... Haven't made much progress. I keep finding things that bring back memories. Clearing out this room of his belongings again, it's... It's not easy."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "In our battle last month, we really cut the enemy down to size. But there are other enemies we have yet to hunt down, not the least the Flame Emperor. Once we've crushed them all, we can return to our peaceful lives at the monastery. It will happen soon. I have a feeling something big is coming."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "People who live an inordinately long time, people whose hair changes color, and those odd Heroes' Relics... Is F\u00f3dlan some mystical land full of inhuman creatures?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's not like that."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "You still look human. For now, at least."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Is the world different outside F\u00f3dlan?"}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "You should see for yourself. I'd recommend exploring west of the Empire."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Sometimes, I find myself thinking I should leave Garreg Mach and return to my home... Where I should have been all along."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Where you should have been?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Ignore me. I'm sorry...it's a silly thing. An old man's ramblings, and nothing more."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I won't stop you..."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "I hear that Lady Rhea will accompany you for this month's task. She's the pillar that supports the hearts of F\u00f3dlan's people. Her safety is paramount. I hope there are no complications..."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Are you positive? Really? Your appearance is due to the influence of the Crest of Flames? Intriguing. Unfortunately, I have found no record of Nemesis's hair and eye color ever changing. However... If that transformation was brought on, in part, by the power of the Crest, that would be most... Well, I suppose interesting is too small a word. Still, it would be an absolutely exceptional discovery. To know for certain, we must investigate further. So, clothes off!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "What? A full physical is in order, yes? We need to know if this transformation affected you adversely. Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "The Holy Tomb, huh? I've worked here for years, and this is the first I've heard of it. I mean, it does make some sense. Sort of. Something about it is still weird. I understand now why they'd build the monastery in the mountainous center of F\u00f3dlan. Although... When the monastery was built, the Kingdom and the Alliance weren't even around yet. But look how cleverly it was placed right in the middle of the Empire, Kingdom, and Alliance. That's weird, right?"}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "When I first saw you, Professor, with that hair color and that eye color? I thought you looked kind of like Lady Rhea. Like maybe you could be related. I like the way it looks! I wonder if I could change my hair color too... Maybe if I tried hard enough. If I thought real hard about it, I mean."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That would be exciting, wouldn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "All I need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape, right? Just like you did."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You don't need to do that, Cyril."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "I might not need to, but I still wanna."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "Hey, Professor. You seem...different. Lots of things seem...different around here lately. I've noticed it. Have you?"}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Although I suppose...you are something to report! For a moment, I thought you were someone suspicious! Lucky for you, I am quite perceptive. It took only that single moment for me to recognize you.  The professor went out and got some new power!"}], "intro": [{"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Are you surprised, Professor?
