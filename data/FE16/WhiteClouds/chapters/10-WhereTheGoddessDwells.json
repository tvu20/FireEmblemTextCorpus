If you ask, I\u2026 No, scratch that. All of us students would gladly lend a hand. Even if it means going against Rhea's wishes. Don't forget it. Now go. Everyone's worried about you.

You're finally returning to your old self. To see the light in your eyes again is a gift. It inspires me to carry on as well.

I'll inform you immediately if I learn anything relevant."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "What happened to Jeralt... It's terrible. If there's anything I can do, simply ask.

I will kill anyone should you ask it of me."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I'm so sorry about what happened to Jeralt... No...of course my sorrow is nothing compared to yours.

I've been reading Jeralt's diary. The baby he mentions\u2026 That's you, isn't it? I can't understand about half of what's written on here\u2026 But Jeralt really cherished you. That much is clear."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I haven't lost a parent yet, so I can't even begin to understand how you must be feeling... But even while you're standing still, the world keeps on moving. I always find that oddly comforting."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "I've never been much for condolences. How about a little logic, instead? The knights have spread out around Garreg Mach in search of Jeralt's murderers. Thus, the monastery's fighting strength is, for the moment at least, depleted.

We should be prepared for further confrontation."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "I've never been much for condolences."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Professor, please lend us your ears. Ferdinand is saying impossible things."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "I do not see what is impossible about it. All I said was that if you want to go back to Brigid, you probably can.

Apologies for the misunderstanding."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "I slipped quietly into the vault and rummaged about, looking for anything we might find useful. There is a group of people who want to kill us, after all. What? This is no time for asking permission. I learned long ago that one can ask permission or forgiveness. It is rarely useful to request the former. Still, it appears that the knights have already taken everything useful. There were Crest-related objects I thought might be worth studying, so\u2013 There you go again with that stern look. Of course I'll put them back when I'm done. Assuming they bear no additional use."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "I'm not even close to being strong enough. I mean, Jeralt was so much stronger than me, but even he... That's enough. I can't dwell on the past. There's no way to know what my future holds but I do know one thing. Whatever happens, I have to make my own way in this world. I have to keep pushing so I can grow even stronger!"}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "Professor? I, um, I brought some flowers for Jeralt."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "It's the least I can do.

Leave some flowers on his grave for me."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Dark expressions don't suit you, Professor. But I'm... Well, I'm glad to see you out in the world again. It seems this month will be a quiet one around here. There aren't many knights around to liven things up."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Most of the knights are gone, seeking out the enemy."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Isn't that a bit much? I agree it's important, but is it a good idea to neglect the safety of the monastery?"}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "What do you think, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It would be a shame if we were invaded."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "I agree. We can send some knights after our enemies, but so many? It makes the church seem reckless."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You're worrying too much."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Hopefully the knights finish their business and hurry back. I wouldn't mind having a few extra lances around."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Not just Tomas, but Monica too. We can't be sure who to trust anymore, can we? Who are these people, really? What do they want?"}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "I'm so glad you're OK, Professor. I was so worried!"}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Oh, Professor! You must be starving. Mercie and I made some sweets for you. We were thinking that if you were to eat something sweet, it might help you feel better."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Thank you for the thought."}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "Baking sweets is my specialty. I'm sure they'll do the trick."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm fine."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Well, of course you are! And if you have sweets you'll be even more fine."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "I'm so sorry... I never quite know what to say at times like these... Just...don't push yourself too hard too soon. It's OK to allow yourself to be sad right now. Losing someone dear to you... Well, each loss is unique, but it's a feeling I know very well. That said... Professor, I..."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "There is no one here who has not heard tales of Jeralt's valor. We have suffered a most dear loss. I do not know what the enemy's aim was, but I do know this\u2013after what they have done, we cannot suffer them to live. If there is anything I can do to ensure that justice is brought swiftly, you need only give the word."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "You've gotta keep yourself active during tough times, Professor. Even if it seems impossible. That's how I got through when I lost my parents. If you need help with anything, just come and see me. Eating and training are my specialties."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "I'm scared. I feel that I don't understand the world. How could something like that happen to Jeralt? He was so strong."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Even though you're scared, push through."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "You're inspiring, Professor. Ill do my best."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What happens, happens."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "I suppose, but... Please, take care, Professor! We can't afford to lose you too."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I'm sure you will pull through this because you're so strong, Professor. Best to stay calm during such tumultuous and upsetting times. We don't know the nature of our enemies. If we underestimate them, anything could happen."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "But if we don't defeat them\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I agree they must be defeated, but I also feel we must approach this with prudence."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We should be careful."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Yes, I agree. I\u2026don't want to lose you too, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Professor! People are saying horrible things about Marianne. They're saying she's friends with the bad guys. If I hear someone say that, I'll\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Leave it alone, Hilda. It doesn't matter."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Just ignore it."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Of course. Thank you, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We'll defeat the bad guys.

There's not much else I can do\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Professor, it seems like you're holding up OK, but\u2026 I'm worried about Leonie. She really loved Jeralt. I hope she can bounce back\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Captain Jeralt's gone. He's gone. And we'd only just reunited... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sure this is even harder on you. But I just can't\u2013 I can't believe..."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Professor... How are you holding up? I know how heavily grief weighs upon one's heart... I lost my mother some time ago. It was... Forgive me my moment of weakness. Even all these years later, I cannot recall that time without feeling the pain as if it were brand new. Just know that I am praying for your mind and your heart to find peace."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "First Tomas, and now Monica. I do have a theory, though I admit it is nothing more than speculation. Both Tomas and Monica have each gone missing at one time or another. It was reported that when Monica returned from her disappearance, she began to act like a completely different person. As if, perhaps, the real Monica had been killed and replaced by an impostor. Thinking of it like that, it is possible that this Solon had been impersonating Tomas for some time. How they managed such a convincing change of appearance, though, I still do not understand."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "You have lost your father... Now more than ever do I understand how very lucky I am that you were able to save me. Professor, I deeply appreciate what you have done. Thank you. If there is anything at all I can do in return, please tell me, OK?"}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "You've lost someone very dear to you... I'm so... You have my sympathy.

You're a very strong person."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "I have something rather uncomfortable to discuss. It's about the weapon that killed Jeralt. Will you listen?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'll listen."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "It was a dagger, but I know enough to know it wasn't an ordinary dagger. It wasn't made of iron or steel because... Well, because whatever it was, the wound it left wasn't normal. Who could make a blade like that, do you figure?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I won't listen."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "I see... That's probably for the best."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "I wonder who they were..."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Oh Goddess, hear my prayer. Please receive this beloved person. When the cold rain washes the body, when the bird and wolf announce the dawn... Receive them into your blue blood. Receive them into a twinkling star. That's a mourning scripture from the Church of Seiros. Lady Rhea taught it to me. I pray that Jeralt is happy in the next world."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "I heard Jeralt passed away... My deepest condolences. I knew him long before I ever even met you... He was always so much fun to be around... It's such a loss..."}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Professor...

It's a riddle, so to speak. Those guys are undoubtedly planning something terrible. We need some kind of clue as to what. The attack on the Holy Mausoleum. That foul business in Remire.
