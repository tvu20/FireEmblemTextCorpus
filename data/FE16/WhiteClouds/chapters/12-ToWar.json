If that is not wicked, what is?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What is her objective?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of F\u00f3dlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know.

Of the other three, Lord Vestra was assassinated. Hubert, his son, will succeed him. Bernadetta's father, Count Varley, is under house arrest. His wife is now supporting Edelgard.

What should I be doing?"}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "I have had the arrival of a letter from Edelgard. She is asking...that I join her side. She is making the decision...no, she is deciding if Brigid is a friend or an enemy of the Empire. But my choice is not to be friends. My choice is to fight with you. Brigid is not a friend of the Empire. We will not be following again. We will be ready to fight with you instead."}, {"speaker": "Dedue", "line": "His Highness calls for the head of Edelgard.

If that is the case, then she is my enemy."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "You saw it too, didn't you? The boar's true nature. He's hidden his desire for revenge pretty well.

Well, we'll just have to try our best."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Things must be pretty crazy in Faerghus about now. My father must be beside himself. I don't get it.

Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "For the sake of her ideals?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them?

Let us proceed with caution."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "I hear the Alliance's territory will be in danger if we don't get rid of these Empire guys!

I've spent my whole life running in fear, and now...I..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We can win this together."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We can't win if you run."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "You're right. It's time to stop running.

Right, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "What is Edelgard even trying to achieve? She wants to destroy the church so badly that she'll take on anyone who doesn't fall in line? I don't get it."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Her ideals are in conflict with yours."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's a hard thing to accept."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "I just can't believe she'd start a war over it. Not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way. Could Captain Jeralt's death have also been a part of her plan? Don't you go and die on me, Professor. Captain Jeralt would never forgive you."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "How are you, Professor? Any new changes to report? With the Imperial army drawing near, it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did... Thankfully, you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side.

All we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Well, perhaps it's pointless to get upset about the past. My duty now is to prepare for battle.

We will protect Garreg Mach!"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Ugh. If I could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self! Now it turns out Edelgard is the Flame Emperor, and the new Adrestian emperor! And she's striking out against the monastery, with the full force of the Imperial army behind her. We gotta beat her at her own game! For our sake as well as Lady Rhea's..."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "We're falling behind. I don't know that we can keep up with the new emperor.

We must make careful preparations."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "There are always small power struggles, still... It has been hundreds of years since all of F\u00f3dlan was consumed by war. I didn't actually think it would come to this... I feel as though I'm not in my rightful place. I cannot protect the things I should... Professor. If I survive this war, I wish to return to my homeland... To the land of my king."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "The Holy Tomb held many Crest Stones. This is the first time I've heard of Crest Stones being hidden away in such a place... But more importantly, I'm interested to know the Empire's aim. Why would their army desire Crest Stones? There is power there, yes. And yet... I must think on this. The Crest Stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding Conand Tower and the chapel as well... And of course, the Crest Stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into Demonic Beasts... Could that possibly be their aim?! The Empire's army may well plan to use Crest Stones to create Demonic Beasts!"}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "The mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was Edelgard? Wow. Doesn't make much sense though, does it? There would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess... Eh, I'm gonna stop. I don't really have the head for this political stuff. Mostly I'm worried about my old opera company. I wonder what's happening in the capital right now. I hope they're safe..."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "It's my job to protect Lady Rhea. I've gotta do it. and I gotta do it as best I can. And if that means I gotta die for her, then I will. Ugh, how could Edelgard treat Lady Rhea like she's the bad guy? She's never been anything but nice to everybody! I just don't get it at all..."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "I can't believe the Empire raised an army... Even I couldn't have guessed it. War is profitable...but dangerous. I really don't like seeing people I care about out there mixed up in all this."}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings Professor! Something to report! Unexpected, isn't it? Apparently, this is the first time Garreg Mach has been invaded in its whole 995-year history! It's my job to protect this gate, so even if enemies come in droves, I will never let them through! I hope we both survive... Let's battle with all our might and pray we win this thing!"}], "intro": [{"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Listen up, everyone! The Imperial army is upon us.

I don't need to tell you that the situation is dire. We have some support troops from the local nobles, but the army we're facing is immense. No matter how you look at it, we're at a disadvantage. To make matters worse, the enemy is being led by Edelgard.

As for Seiros and Nemesis\u2026just how much of their mythology is true?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "It's true. But lucky for me, I refuse to die with so much still unknown.

I have my own ambitions to see to. There are things\u2026dreams\u2026that I must see come to fruition. And I've been thinking. I want you to see those dreams realized as well.

You're so much more. You're my ally and my friend. Teach\u2026 Friend\u2026 None of those words quite capture what you've come to mean to me. We may not be connected by blood, but I believe our bond goes deeper than that. Now that we know each other, our hearts are connected.

Though her own losses were great, her foes had no choice but to surrender. Archbishop Rhea commanded the Knights of Seiros, leading from the front lines against the Imperial Army. But amidst the chaos of battle, she vanished, and her whereabouts remain unknown. With this single attack, the Adrestian Empire officially launched its offensive against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. The unification of F\u00f3dlan has begun."]}
