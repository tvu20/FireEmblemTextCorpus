In that case, allow me to fill you in.

It will take place in the vast Gronder Field. That is in Empire territory to the southeast of Garreg Mach."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Whichever house defeats the most opponents wins. Of course, the professors also fight alongside their respective houses."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Well, usually. Professor Manuela is being prudent. She will not be participating this year.

I hear the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field, far away from Garreg Mach."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "The house that defeats most opponents wins.

Do you think she'll be able to join us despite her injuries?"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I'm afraid she's sitting this one out, as is Professor Hanneman.  \"As my persistent rival will not be present, it only goes to follow that I must also sit out this year's battle.

I've got a lot of questions to ask Edel here. Since I couldn't graduate last year, I really want to make sure I can do so this year. Don't worry.

Sounds fun, but not as fun as reeling in the ladies. Heh! Just kidding, of course. The most important thing right now is preparing for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.

Could it actually be Professor Jeritza?"}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Gronder Field is in the Empire, right? I wonder how we'll get there. I thought I heard that there's no path that goes straight from the monastery to the Empire... Oh! Perhaps we'll travel through Alliance territory. Yes, I see, from the east, we would go...hm, there! Ah, yes, that must be it!"}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Holding such a frivolous and downright ridiculous event so close to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion... It's absolutely absurd. Although...they did say we could eat whatever we catch. I'm a sucker for a good meal...I just couldn't resist."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "I received a rare letter from my father recently. He said that he is praying for the Golden Deer House to emerge victorious. Insistently praying. My father attended the Officers Academy, and won a glorious victory in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. I think he is quite proud of that, even to this day. I suppose that shows how great an honor it truly is."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Hey, Professor! Did you hear about the fishing tournament? You get to fish in the pond as much as you want. The more you catch, the more you get to eat!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Sometimes it's nice to dangle a fishing line and let your mind wander. I'd love to spend some time lounging around by a scenic river or lake."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Why would we go all the way to Gronder Field? It's idiocy to travel that far. It may be a tradition, but it takes forever to get there and is exhausting. So pointless. I guess there's nothing to be done about it. Even by you, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Excuse me, Professor. Um, do you think it would reflect poorly on me if I chose not to take part in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Yes, it would."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Oh, I see..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Don't you want to participate?"}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Well, I don't really want to leave the monastery..."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "I'm not very confident, but I'll try my best."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Professor, do you have a second? It's about Monica. Does she seem...off to you? She was imprisoned for a long time, but she seems to have recovered almost instantly, and she's been bizarrely cheerful."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Now that you mention it..."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "You see what I mean? I wonder if she's straining to seem happy, just to make people comfortable."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "She's moving on. Isn't that a good thing?"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "I guess you're right. It just seems fast, doesn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Hmm... And why is she so close to Edelgard anyway?"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Why are they having a fishing tournament now? Are they just giving up on the battle of the Eagle and Lion?! You're not condoning this, right? Are you?!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Yes, I'm taking part."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "What?! If you've got all this free time, shouldn't you be spending it on your students?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "No, I'm not taking part."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Good. I'm looking forward to seeing you in action. I hope Captain Jeralt will be watching."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "The situation last month was dire indeed. The students endured great hardship. I hope you are able to put all of that behind you so that you may focus on this month's assignment."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Of course."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "A most reassuring response. I trust that your class is in good hands."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It will be difficult."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "That is to be expected. I, too, cannot quite shake that feeling of unease. Even so, we must both strive to put that nasty business behind us."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "I look forward to seeing your skills on display at the Battle of the Eagle and Lion."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "I have something to ask of you."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Leave it to me."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "I have not even told you what my request is yet! Well, fine."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Flayn has been through an awful lot this past month. To make up for that, I have decided to give her whatever she wants. I asked her what she would like, and she expressed a desire for a feast of fish. Since I'm sure the students would be interested, I have decided to hold a fishing tournament here at the monastery. I have left all of the specifics to Shamir. Please, enter and put in your best effort."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "I hear that you participated in the fishing tournament. I appreciate you taking the time."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "I told my brother I had a craving for some tasty fish. I did not realize when I did that it would turn into...well, this. My apologies."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "I'm going to catch me some mighty fish, just you wait and see! Er, but they haven't been biting..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Your shouting is scaring the fish."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "What shouting? Everyone told me I was too loud, so I've been using my quiet voice."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe the fish are frightened by you."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "I didn't think of that. Ah, the truth is right in front of me...  Just kidding. As though a fish is smart enough to be afraid of me."}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "Can you believe what Seteth said? \"Catch some tasty fish for Flayn.\" I'm her bodyguard!"}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Welcome to the monastery fishing tournament. You look confused. Didn't Seteth tell you about it? Just catch whatever fish Flayn requests. Show any fish you catch to Flayn."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "The fishing tournament is over. I heard you did some fishing, and that Flayn is happy."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "Professor, has Seteth told you? We're to have a fishing tournament. Given the events of the last month, I believe this is just the sort of distraction we need, staff and student alike."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Will you take part?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "I'm afraid I am not one for festivities. I do enjoy a spot of fishing, though."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Are you good at fishing?"}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "I do enjoy the sport, yet I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at it."}, {"speaker": "Gilbert", "line": "I believe it best that I stick to quietly fishing by myself."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "The recent happenings at the monastery... There is something going on behind the scenes here. I've been commissioned to investigate as well. As I've already mentioned, this month I'm off to the Kingdom. You be on your guard, OK?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm not worried."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "Well, I hope you're right."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm more worried about you than myself."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": " Perhaps I've gotten into your head too much! I won't go dying on you. I've stayed alive this long, after all."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "How are preparations for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion going? Hm? Fishing? Taking it easy, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "I don' t know if you've heard, but Flayn is very special. Her blood carries a rare Crest... Oh, the lengths to which she could advance my research, if only I was allowed to study her! If only it weren't for Seteth's strict orders! He protects his sister with unusual zeal."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You should give up."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "I dislike it, but I agree. The time I would spend begging him and accomplishing nothing would be better spent on other research."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe you can convince him."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Have you ever tried convincing Seteth of anything? I'm not sure I could convince the man the sky is blue if he hadn't already looked up for himself."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "I always thought I was pretty good, you know? Then I go and get stabbed. Ugh... But my opponent was the Death Knight, so I figure I did pretty well to only get stabbed. I wonder if it's true that he is actually Jeritza... Whoever he is...I'm going to make him pay. It turns out that when I get stabbed, I get really mad!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He hurt you this time. Next time he may kill you."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'll help you get revenge."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "I'm not going to let him get the better of me again!"}, {"speaker": "Tomas", "line": "When you feel that first refreshing breeze upon your face, you know it is almost time for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Gronder Field is within the Empire, but the path there from the monastery necessitates passing through Alliance territory.

You will have to cross one of the largest bridges upon that river, the Great Bridge of Myrddin."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "F\u00f3dlan is big. It's not as big as Almyra is, but it's still pretty big."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Do you want to travel around F\u00f3dlan someday?"}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Travel? I don't know... Never thought about it, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Do you want to go home to Almyra?"}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Why do you think I would want to do that?"}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Young Monica disappeared last year. I thought she had simply run along home. But it turns out she was kidnapped! I can't believe it. How awful it must have been for the poor thing.

I knew your parents...once upon a time."}, {"speaker": "Monk", "line": "I've been gone from the monastery for some time now because... Well, it matters not. Might I...ask a favor?

So if we do lose, it would be on your shoulders, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "If you're not confident you can do this, just sit back and leave it to me."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": " The most you will do is make things worse. You'll just get in Lady Edelgard's way."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "Are you two about to fight? Haha! Count me in! Wait, no. I think we all need to calm down."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "We have no lack of opponents. I am ready to go hunting for our enemies!"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Hunting isn't exactly... Well, I guess they're pretty similar, actually."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "I'm just gonna hide in the fort and cheer everyone on. There, um, is a fort, right?"}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "Sure, but it's deep in enemy territory. How kind of you to offer to cut through for us."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "What?! No! That's not what I meant! Ugh, good work Bernie..."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "This will be your first battle, won't it, Flayn? You don't seem nervous at all."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Haha, I shall give it my all!"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Our battle will begin shortly. The flag of the Black Eagles will soon grace Gronder Field!"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "So, this is to be our battlefield...Gronder Field.

That's most reassuring."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm not so sure."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "We've seen your power firsthand, so we know better than anyone what you're capable of. Beyond that, we believe in you. If it's not too big a burden, I ask that you believe in us as well."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "We can win. I'm sure of it. After all, it's not as though we've spent the last half-year sitting idle. And I'm feeling stronger this moon. As though I could conquer a thousand opponents all on my own."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's reassuring."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "You can depend on me. I hope you know that."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Don't get carried away..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I'm only joking, of course... But perhaps it isn't a laughing matter. I beg your forgiveness. I must practice levity so that I can provide a more enjoyable joke when the opportunity next presents itself. After all, I hear that telling jokes is a good way to calm the nerves before heading into battle. Still...I find it quite difficult."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Well, it's about time for the battle to begin. Everyone, brace yourselves."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Hmph. All I'm worried about is finding someone worthy to cross swords with."}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "We've prepared and trained a great deal. We should be fine, right?"}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "You're always so carefree, Mercie!

Let's do our best."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "If I emerge victorious in the lauded Battle of the Eagle and Lion, the ladies are sure to take notice. I'll have to go into hiding."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Ugh, is that all you think about? Actually, as long as you try your hardest, frame it however you like."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Haha, I shall give it my all!"}, {"speaker": "Dedue", "line": "No matter the battle, I will never falter."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "We're counting on your guidance, Professor. Let's show the world what the Blue Lions are made of!"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "So this is Gronder Field... Hey, Teach. Not a bad place to wage war, is it?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "How so?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Absolutely."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "I knew you'd understand."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Plenty of places to hide, and our pick of paths to advance through. It's the perfect battlefield for our tactics. I have my eye on that low hill over there. See it? It's the ideal spot to lure our enemies to, and then surround them with fire."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's risky."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Fire is unacceptable."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Gotcha, Teach! I know, I know. We want all students to make it back to the monastery. With you in command, we can't lose. The Imperial princess and the crown prince don't stand a chance."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Professor! Claude! What are you two talking about?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "What do you expect? It's Claude.

You know me better than I know myself."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Win or lose, it's an honor just to participate in the legendary Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "We've got to win so we can show Captain Jeralt what we're made of!"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Yes! I'm ready! Let's go!"}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Haha, I shall give it my all!"}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "I'll just...stay quiet and follow along so I don't get in anyone's way."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "That will not be acceptable, Marianne. The whole point of this exercise is for each house to act as one."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Do your best! I can't wait to see how well everyone does."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "All right, sounds like Hilda will be taking control of a central hill and watching the battle from there."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "It's almost time.
