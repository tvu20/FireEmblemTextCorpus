And just like that, it came to me. How odd. That look upon your face\u2026 Did you think me a child? A mere child who forgot her own name?! Phooey! That \u201cchild\u201d just saved your life! And what does that make you?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I am no child."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Ha! Such arrogance. You look the part but are you truly an adult?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm less than a child?"}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Correct! You understand."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "You threw yourself before an axe to save just one young girl. Yet all is well, as I have stalled the flow of time for now. You would have died had I not intervened."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You stopped time?"}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Hm. I do not hear your gratitude. Perhaps I should force you to leave?  There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Though it is only momentary, time has stopped.

I must turn back the hands of time!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Keep time frozen until I'm safe."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "That is ridiculous! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'll just stay here and wait to die."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "As though I could stand idly by and watch that come to pass! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!"}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Yes... I do believe it can be done. You really are quite troublesome. I cannot wind back time too far, but all is well. You are aware of what\u2019s to come, which means you can protect yourself this time. Now, go\u2026 Yes, you who bears the flames within.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone like that."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "In any case, just put that out of your mind for now. The battlefield is no place for idle thoughts. Risking your life is part of the job for mercenaries like us. Letting your mind wander is a sure way to get yourself killed."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "OK, time to get moving. Our next job is in the Kingdom. I told you before. It\u2019s far from here, so we\u2019ll need to leave at dawn."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Oh, right..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Of course."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "Hm? Good grief. Everyone is already waiting for us outside."}, {"speaker": "Mercenary", "line": "Jeralt! Sir! Sorry to barge in, but your presence is needed."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "What's happened?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Please forgive our intrusion. We wouldn\u2019t bother you were the situation not dire."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "What do a bunch of kids like you want at this hour?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "We\u2019re being pursued by a group of bandits. I can only hope that you will be so kind as to lend your support."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "Bandits? Here?"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "It's true. They attacked us while we were at rest in our camp."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "We\u2019ve been separated from our companions and we\u2019re outnumbered. They\u2019re after our lives\u2026not to mention our gold."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "I\u2019m impressed you\u2019re staying so calm considering the situation. I\u2026 Wait. That uniform\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Mercenary", "line": "Bandits spotted just outside the village! Damn\u2026 There are a lot of them."}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "I guess they followed you all the way here. We can\u2019t abandon this village now. Come on, let\u2019s move.

Aren't you Jeralt the Blade Breaker? What's a renowned mercenary like you doing here?", "unit": "Jeralt", "boss": "Kostas"}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "I'm the one who should be complaining.

Why him?"}, {"speaker": "Event", "line": "An Unexpected Reunion"}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Captain Jeralt?! It is you! Goodness, it\u2019s been ages. Don\u2019t you recognize me? It\u2019s Alois! Your old right-hand man! Well, that\u2019s how I always thought of myself anyway. It must have been 20 years ago that you went missing without a trace. I always knew you were still alive!"}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "You haven\u2019t changed a bit, Alois. Just as loud as ever. And drop that \u201ccaptain\u201d nonsense. I\u2019m not your captain anymore. These days I\u2019m just a wandering mercenary. One who has work to do. Good-bye, old friend."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Right... Good-bye, Captain. Wait! That isn't how this ends. I insist that you return to the monastery with me!"}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "Garreg Mach Monastery... I suppose this was inevitable."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "And how about you, kid? Are you the captain's child?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He is a stranger to me."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I'm a bandit."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That is correct."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Is that so? Well, physical differences aside, your mannerisms do remind me of the captain."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "I'd love for you to see the monastery too. You will join me, won't you?"}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "What's troubling you, Captain? You aren't about to run off again, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Jeralt", "line": "Even I wouldn't dare run from the Knights of Seiros."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "The Knights of Seiros... They do seem rather skilled."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Ah. It seems your presence is required. Get going!"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I appreciate your help back there. Your skill is beyond question. You\u2019re clearly an experienced mercenary. And your father...that would be Jeralt, the Blade Breaker? Former captain of the Knights of Seiros. Oft praised as the strongest knight to ever live. Have I missed anything?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The Knights of Seiros?"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "You haven\u2019t heard of the Knights of Seiros? The most famous order of knights in all of F\u00f3dlan?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I didn't know he was a captain."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "How curious. I\u2019d wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Hey! You are coming with us to the monastery, right? Of course you are. I\u2019d love to bend your ear as we travel. Oh, I should mention that the three of us are students of the Officers Academy at Garreg Mach Monastery. We were doing some training exercises when those bandits attacked. I definitely got the worst of it."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "That would be because you ran off."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Too true! I was the first to make a strategic retreat. Everything would have worked out if these two hadn\u2019t followed me and ruined everything. Because of them, every single one of those bandits chased after us. Utterly ridiculous."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Ah, so that\u2019s what you were thinking, Claude. And here I thought you were acting as a decoy for the sake of us all."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "His intentions were as clear as day. You will prove a lacking ruler if you cannot see the truth behind a person's words."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Hm. You will prove a lacking ruler if you look for deceit behind every word and fail to trust those whom you rely on."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Oh, joy. A royal debate between Their Highnesses. I wonder how being completely predictable affects one\u2019s ability to wield power. Personally, as the embodiment of distrust, I\u2019d say your little exchange smacks of naivet\u00e9."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Me? Na\u00efve? Tell me, are you actually incapable of keeping quiet, or is your lack of self-awareness a condition of some sort?"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "In any case, forgive our digression. I must speak with you, if you can spare a moment. The way you held your ground against the bandits\u2019 leader was captivating! You never lost control of the situation. It showed me I still have much to learn."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Your skill is precisely why I must ask you to consider lending your services to the Empire. I might as well tell you now. I am no mere student. I am also the Adrestian Empire\u2019s\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Halt, Edelgard. Please allow me to finish my own proposition. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in dire need of exceptional individuals such as yourself. Please, do consider returning to the Kingdom with me."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Whoa, there! You two sure are hasty. Trying to recruit someone you just met. Tactless, really. I was personally planning to develop a deep and lasting friendship on our journey back to the monastery before begging for favors. But it seems there\u2019s no time for niceties in this world. So, capable stranger, let\u2019s get right to it. Where does your allegiance lie?"}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Hmm. It seems one's place of birth is quite significant to them. Yet they are so impressed by you, that you may take your pick. Well?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Adrestian Empire: Land of Ancient History"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "A wise choice. Though the Empire has fallen from its former glory, the other regions are merely offshoots that pale in comparison."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Holy Kingdom of Faerghus: Land of Noble Knights"}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "Understood. Faerghus is a noble and distinguished kingdom that has always valued chivalry."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Leicester Alliance: Burgeoning League of Nobles"}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Is that right? Well, that\u2019s a win for the Alliance, so I suppose I\u2019m obligated to be happy."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "All right, that's enough with the small talk. It's time to head back to the monastery."}, {"speaker": "Claude", "line": "Looks like we'll have to pick this up another time."}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "My, my. They are in such a hurry. You know... Each of the three is most unique."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Edelgard\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Dimitri\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Claude\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Sothis", "line": "Yes, I thought the same. I am so sleepy once again... I may be sleeping...but I..."}]}
