the icy winds of the oghma mountains have begun to scatter and the verdant fields once again spring to life across fódlan heralding the start of a new year as they celebrate the dawning year the people pray that they may realize their full potential just as a tiny sprout hopes to one day grow into a great tree
the continent of fódlan said to be protected by a revered goddess has existed since time immemorial three ruling powers now control the land in the south lies a region long held by a more than one thousand year old dynasty the adrestian empire beyond its borders to the frigid north is the home of the holy kingdom of faerghus ruled by the royal family and its knights to the east a league of nobles that heeds no king nor emperor rules what is called the leicester alliance once consumed by a tempest of war and turmoil fódlan and these three mighty powers now exist in relative harmony
this will be your first time at the monastery id be happy to show you around
it really is fódlan in a nutshell the good and the bad
like it or not well be there soon enough
there it is garreg mach monastery
rheas here
i wonder  did the flow of time bring you here
its been years since ive last set eyes on this place to be forced to see her now 
her
you saw her in the courtyard earlier didnt you the archbishop lady rhea
youve been here before
ive never spoken of this to you before but many years ago i was a knight here i reported to the archbishop lady rhea
the archbishop
lady rhea
as you know the majority of folks in fódlan are devout followers of the teachings of seiros the leader of that ridiculously large religious organization is the archbishop lady rhea
thank you for your patience jeralt my name is seteth i am an advisor to the archbishop
right hello
it has been a long time jeralt i wonder was it the will of the goddess that we have another chance meeting like this
forgive my silence all these years much has happened since we last spoke
so i see the miracle of fatherhood has blessed you that is your child is it not
yes born many years after i left this place i wish i could introduce you to the mother of my child but im afraid we lost her to illness
i see my condolences as for you i heard of your valiant efforts from alois what is your name
my name is 
a fine name indeed
 
you must at least show the basic courtesy of telling us your name do you not think you are being a bit rude to the archbishop
it is all right seteth my dear i am called rhea i am the archbishop of the church of seiros in truth i was only being polite i already know your name and a fine name it is
from the bottom of my heart i thank you for saving those students of the officers academy
hmph
jeralt you already know what it is i wish to say do you not
you want me to rejoin the knights of seiros dont you i wont say no but 
your apprehension stings i had expected that alois would have already asked this of you i must step away for now but i expect they will desire a word with you soon please listen carefully to what they have to say until tomorrow  farewell
i cant believe it forced back into the knights of seiros im sorry i dragged you into this looks like ill be stuck here for a while and im afraid your services are requested as well
as a mercenary
as a servant
nothing like that they want you to teach by the sound of it you heard those brats earlier talking about the officers academy right well the academy just happens to be short a professor and apparently that damned alois went and recommended you to lady rhea
so you must be the new professor my how stern and handsome you are
er no im not the one youre looking for you can handle things from here good luck  and watch out for lady rhea i dont know what shes thinking making you a professor like this she may be up to something stay on your guard
oh its you then so young 
competence and age are not necessarily correlated as you well know i am hanneman a crest scholar and professor at the officers academy i wonder if you bear a crest of your own when next you have a moment to spare i insist that you pay me a visit so we can delve into the subject further
im manuela im a professor a physician a songstress and available its nice to meet you
youre a physician
i look too pretty for that line of work do i but yes when im not teaching i can be found in the infirmary if youre ever lonely please do come and pay me a visit i would love to 
youre a songstress
of course before i came here i belonged to a renowned opera company perhaps youve heard of me the mittelfrank opera companys beautiful peerless 
spare our colleague the needless chatter manuela now then it seems youll be taking charge of one of the academys three houses i expect you havent yet been briefed on the nature of each have you
do you really not know fine ill do you a favor and explain the officers academy is comprised of three houses of students each of which is closely affiliated with its region of origin the black eagle house is for students from the adrestian empire their house leader this year is edelgard the imperial princess who is in line to be the next emperor
the blue lion house is for students from the holy kingdom of faerghus their house leader this year is prince dimitri he is to be the next king of faerghus
lastly there is the golden deer house which is for students of the leicester alliance their house leader is claude grandson to duke riegan the leader of the alliance
to think that the next emperor king and sovereign duke are all here it certainly is a promising year for the academy
ill say i just hope none of those little treasures cause any trouble
hm quite for now i suggest taking a stroll around the academy to get your bearings and when youve a moment please stop by my research laboratory
the old man has a point oh and keep in mind that ive only notified the house leaders that youre our new professor its more fun that way i suggest you try spending time with the students some odd ducks in that bunch but theyre good kids im sure lady rhea will have more information for you tomorrow but that should get you going good luck youll need it
have you no intention of changing your mind rhea appointing a stranger a child no less as a professor at our esteemed academy is 
i have made my decision seteth i know worrying comes naturally to you but there is truly no need that “stranger” is jeralts flesh and blood after all
i cant say thats all too comforting how trustworthy is this jeralt character is he not the man who went missing after the great fire 21 years ago i would remind you that flayn is now here with us as well i beg of you please consider whether this is an unnecessary risk
seteth they have my trust let that be enough for you as well more importantly i have received a report from shamir i am increasingly concerned about a matter regarding our suspicious individual we cannot ignore those who harbor ill will towards the church especially if they are frequenting garreg mach
yes that matter is of great importance as well i shall continue my investigation rhea  for now i will have faith that you are placing your trust with the utmost care i pray that nothing occurs to shake that confidence
i assume you are already aware that you will be teaching here at the officers academy correct to start please speak with the three house leaders you should also take a look around the academy and acquaint yourself with your new home that is your first task here at the monastery please let me know if you accept it once you have finished come and speak with me
you should speak with every student you can this might be your only chance to see what theyre really like before you become a professor 
 you are responsible for choosing which house to lead if there are still students you have yet to speak with try visiting each houses homeroom
ha i imagine you were a bit surprised that i recommended you as a professor here frankly we had someone else in mind for the role but they ran off during our dustup with the bandits cant entrust students to someone whos abandoned them once before huh
you saved the lives of the students you came across that at least was admirable now you should make the rounds go around the monastery and see that you greet everyone
so youve accepted a teaching position here  pity i was hoping you would lend your strength to the empire i never properly introduced myself did i my name is edelgard von hresvelg i am the princess and heir apparent to the adrestian empire i wonder if youll be tasked with leading the black eagles  i hope youve had a chance to meet everyone would you like to know more about any of the black eagles
yes
me well some think im a bit distant arrogant even but theres little to be done one day i must rise to become adrestias next emperor what else  well it seems to me that we may have similar personalities
hubert is the heir of marquis vestra he has served me since i was a child you may think his blood runs a bit cold but  heh actually thats rather accurate still if you can get past that youll see hes quite astute and reasonable
for some reason he thinks of me as a bitter rival and is always trying to challenge me its terribly irritating his house is that of duke aegir which produces adrestias prime ministers that family is perhaps too pleased with its own status
hes remarkably intelligent but he only wishes to apply himself to tasks that particularly interest him and nothing else hes also fond of well napping if he had any work ethic or sense of duty to speak of i suppose he would be destined to become an official of the empire
hes the second son of count bergliez he has no inheritance in his future which is perhaps why hes always so eager to prove himself hes overly energetic and rushes headfirst into any battle if he ends up in your care be sure to keep a close eye on him
shes count varleys only daughter i suppose you could say shes a bit eccentric but she seems like a gentle soul i believe shes shut herself away in her quarters and doesnt care to leave but dont worry ill make sure she finds her way to class
few commoners have joined the black eagle house but dorothea is an exception shes a songstress from a famous opera company in the empire im not entirely sure what brought her to the officers academy
to the west of fódlan is an archipelago called brigid petra is the granddaughter of their king brigid is a vassal state of the empire which is how she came to be enrolled here shes incredibly smart and studious
please accept my apologies for the other day you came to our aid yet i hadnt even the courtesy to properly introduce myself i am dimitri alexandre blaiddyd crown prince of the holy kingdom of faerghus of course at the academy i am simply a student and ive heard word that you are to become a professor here delightful news i still have much to learn but im confident i could benefit greatly from your guidance in any case welcome to the monastery i hear youre investigating the different houses did any of the blue lions catch your attention
yes
me oh um please forgive me  its difficult to open up on the spot dont you think im afraid my story has not been a pleasant one  i do hope that doesnt color your view of me but i understand if that cant be helped
dedue was born in duscur and has been loyally working in my service for the past four years hes rather taciturn but once you get to know him youll see hes a kind and good natured young man
felix is the heir to house fraldarius he has a bit of a sharp tongue but dont let that fool you deep down hes a good guy he gravitates towards people who are skilled perhaps you would enjoy a friendly competition with him sometime
hes the adoptive son of lord lonato of castle gaspard but i hear he was born a commoner he has an extremely earnest personality so im certain he will approach your lectures with great enthusiasm
sylvain is the heir to house gautier he is a capable person who highly values his friends that said  well hes always been a bit of a ahem skirt chaser so to speak pardon my bluntness i speak with him about it often but it doesnt seem to help
i hear she was born to imperial nobility but a twist of fate brought her to the kingdom she may seem carefree on the surface but shes actually a kind soul who pays careful attention to everyone around her
annette is baron dominics niece she is a talented student who scored extremely high marks at the royal school of sorcery shes cheerful and hardworking brilliant really though she can be a bit oblivious at times i hear she caused an explosion in the kitchen last night 
ingrid is count galateas daughter she is also a childhood friend of felix sylvain and myself she is diligent industrious and principled in truth she is more knightly than most knights you will ever meet
well well scored a teaching gig here did ya talk about a great first impression i guess that means id better introduce myself properly im claude von riegan im from the ruling house of the leicester alliance but dont worry too much about all that madness im guessing you dont know which class youll be teaching yet do you i bet youd like ours were not as difficult as the other two have you met the folks from the golden deer house yet care to know more about anyone
yes
laughs piqued your interest have i as luck would have it im pretty curious about you as well but whats life without a bit of mystery lets just spend the next year or so learning about each other little by little
hes the heir of gloucester territory if you havent already picked up on it hes a bit arrogant and fancies himself a ladys man that said deep down hes really devoted and honest  though i wouldnt mind never hearing him talk about his noble obligations ever again
he comes from a merchant family but his parents died in an accident seems like hes had a rough life despite all that hes just about the most cheerful guy youll ever meet his passions are training eating and  actually thats about it
hes the second son of a merchant family since his brother will inherit the business hes training to become a knight if you ask me doesnt seem like he truly wants to be a knight  hes probably just doing it to please his parents 
lysithea is the daughter of count ordelia and is probably the youngest student here but watch out she gets angry if you treat her like a child as for me i do it on purpose you have to make your own fun in this place you know
marianne is margrave edmunds daughter and thats pretty much all i know about her she doesnt interact much with other students so i wouldnt be surprised if a lot of folks here have never even heard her speak
hilda is the only daughter of duke goneril it seems her father and brother coddle her quite a bit if you look up lazy in the dictionary her picture wont be there because she never got around to submitting it not too unusual for a noble i guess
leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary i think she said that her father is a hunter shes pretty blunt and as stingy as they come a habitual saver too i think shes hoping to repay her village for helping to send her here
i suppose i should return to rhea 
this is the classroom of the black eagle house which is for students from the adrestian empire our house leader is princess edelgard there are many other nobles among our ranks as well
i am hubert a humble servant of lady edelgard i heard you came to the aid of her highness you have my most sincere thanks this is petra she has come all the way from brigid to study in the empire back on her archipelago she is actually a princess in fódlan terms she would be called heir to the throne
hello i am called petra i am pleased to be meeting with   no i am pleased to have met you
is it true that you saved edelgard thats incredible the names caspar by the way pleased to meet ya

 what do you want  i am jeritza i teach here weapon instruction these are the training grounds good bye
 greetings you must be the new professor what a pleasure  as for me my job is to stand here at this glorious entrance and leisurely watch over the comings and goings of everyone make folks smile you know  er and by that i mean to vigilantly guard this entrance with my very life no levity whatsoever as of now nothing to report
here i am again the office of the captain of the knights that said im merely here to assist apparently the current captain is getting on in years i hear the captain has a hard time keeping up with the responsibilities of the job  thats where i come in
this is my research laboratory ive worked hard to furnish it with the rare materials and purpose built equipment required for my work
oh professor dropping by so soon i expected wed take some time exchange a few smiles as we passed in the hall flirt a bit you know  well youre here now and i do like a man who knows what he wants lock the door huh that welcome didnt faze you at all did it whats the matter dont you like me or are you just so innocent you dont understand me
im real busy so could you please move along now thanks ok now what else did lady rhea need doing today
 welcome to the library here you may find literature from the far reaches of fódlan  i am tomas the librarian if you have need of me do not hesitate to ask i have worked here for hm i have lost track of the decades it seems
how are you enjoying your time at the academy thus far i hope you have found our halls brimming with the vitality of well intentioned souls
hm i suppose it is time for you to take charge of one of our three houses of students i must note that i am personally against entrusting someone as lacking in trackable history as yourself with such a task but it is as the archbishop desires
the black eagles the blue lions and the golden deer  all so different i hope youve made it a point to get to know each of them
since you are new here we have decided to allow you first pick manuela and i will take charge of the remaining two houses
which house will i choose 
are you having trouble deciding please open your heart to the will of the goddess and choose carefully
so you have chosen the black eagles led by edelgard correct
so you have chosen the blue lions led by dimitri correct
so you have chosen the golden deer led by claude correct
your heart has made its choice then all i ask is that you guide these open minds with virtue care and sincerity
they are all promising youths who bear the weight of fódlans future upon their shoulders i hope you appreciate what an honor it is to lead them
brother oh i am so sincerely sorry i did not mean to interrupt
i am in the middle of something flayn is it urgent
no no its nothing more importantly  who is this
this is our newest professor at the academy
oh my a new addition to the officers academy i am so very pleased to meet you professor i am seteths little sister flayn i am so happy to make your acquaintance
let us focus on the topic at hand there is something you should be aware of in a few days time there will be a mock battle between the three houses intended to gauge the current progress of the students we will be using this battle as an opportunity to ascertain your own abilities as well please do not disappoint the archbishop that is all
wait so our new professor is you i didnt see that one coming
easy caspar arent you being a bit rude
you know its a waste of time to expect politeness from him  it will be a pleasure learning from you professor now if youll excuse me im off to take a nap
ah dont look at me like that oh and please dont talk to me too much either
 im sorry for the chaos youve walked into 
i hear we are rather close in age professor i hope you do not mind if we treat you like one of us in our class we try to treat each other as equals despite any differences in age or status personally i would love to include you in that inner circle
i dont mind at all
you have a gut professor i will take great joy from your teachings
petra i believe you mean to say that our professor has guts thats a bit different from having a gut you cant go around saying someone so slim and attractive has a gut
oh please take my apologies i have not yet mastered this language
professor i want you to know that its perfectly acceptable for you to treat me as you do the others i may be the imperial princess but here at the academy im just another student that said know that i have high expectations of you and high hopes but im certain you can lead the black eagle house to greatness
sure sure now lets break the ice with a training session i want to see our new teacher in action
why will the ice be broken is this a custom i have missed in my studies
not real ice just the ice of um    well it just means lets get to know each other
i dont wanna train lets stay in the classroom and learn from a book
lets all calm down and have a nice cup of tea how about doesnt that sound lovely professor
 
i know we all agreed to treat each other as equals but there is a limit to what i can tolerate the esteemed black eagle house requires order
 looks like your first job will be to quiet down this racket i dont envy you
ugh theyre not normally this rowdy i do hope you can manage professor
wait does this mean our new professor is   no i really cant believe it but i was speaking to you so casually as though we were companions oh i am so sorry professor you just look the same age as the rest of us and   oh and im sorry i just said that too i really must watch my tongue 
i dont mind if you treat me as a friend
you say that but i just dont know about all of this
ill admit it doesnt sit well with me either after all we wish to show you due respect
sure but if the professor says it ok shouldnt that be enough that is if your highness can consent to such a thing after all were already speaking this way to our future king so we may as well relax our speech with our professor too right
well were not in the kingdom so it only goes to follow that we should all speak companionably  i concede if the professor says its fine we ought to accept that kindness gratefully
as for me im not sure i can manage
you dont have to force yourself if its too difficult youre fine with that too right professor
such benevolence is a sight to behold i dont suppose you would care to join me for tea we could discuss education and marriage
control yourself sylvain i have more important matters to discuss with our new professor
having heard of your skills im eager to meet you in battle come to the training ground later there you will show me what youre capable of
you arent wasting any time are you felix as it were count me in for any such battle
hmph
pardon me but i would also love to observe you in battle for future reference if thats ok with you
ashe i dont have you speak of merely watching you should join us as well
 if you get injured simply say the word and ill patch you up straight away
your highness do take care not to go overboard
you worry too much dedue ill be fine i promise
my companions is there not something inherently wrong with crossing blades as a way to bond with each other
huh i never thought of it that way well if thats how you feel i suppose youll just stay behind while the rest of us are at the training ground
ingrid my dearest friend you really are too hard on me
well then professor what do you think as you can see the blue lion house is a lively bunch but youll fine none who work harder im certain well cause our fair share of trouble but im very much looking forward to the year ahead
wait what are you really our new homeroom professor
is that true you arent quite what i pictured oh sorry i didnt mean that the way it sounded
i was sure youd be roped into joining the knights
dont tell me you chose this class just to get to know me better right im flattered really  whoops now that youre our professor maybe i should choose my words more carefully
i dont mind
oh well then since were pretty close in age and all i suppose formalities arent all that necessary
one must truly marvel at the exceptionality of this appointment becoming a teacher to students almost the same age as yourself how unusual ive heard you are a skilled mercenary but i cannot shake my discomfort at your new position
are you really as strong as they say lets see your biceps i bet ive packed on more muscle than you
i doubt that apparently our new professor was personally recommended by alois one of the knights
as far as skill goes i saw it with my own eyes whats more teach here is the child of the most renowned former captain of the knights of seiros
i heard theres no way a child of the captain isnt worthy its simply not possible
the captain who are you talking about
captain jeralt of course the most notable captain of the knights of seiros and a peerless mercenary
hes not that well known 
youre exaggerating a bit
hmph it doesnt matter what you think of him captain jeralt deserves nothing but respect
hm well after working as a mercenary alongside a father figure such as he i have high hopes for our professor
just because someone is special  doesnt mean their children are special too lysithea assuming that a child is going to be exceptional just because of their lineage is a bad idea  dont you agree marianne
huh oh um yes i suppose so
well we can find out for ourselves in battle i cant wait to see what tactics youve learned from the captain
a battle shouldnt we have a welcome party or something first ill get the meat
how savage i propose a nice conversation over tea instead i am more than willing to procure some high quality leaves
tea you cant get to know someone over tea if theres no meat involved its not a party
your common sensibilities are grating to my noble ears please quiet yourself
sorry for the bickering teach as you can see the golden deer is a rowdy bunch were not especially unified youll find nobles and commoners alike here   those who are dedicated to their studies alongside slackers but hey that just makes your life more exciting right i really hope youre looking forward to the year ahead as much as i am
say while youre here id like to use this device i designed to determine whether the power of a crest resides within you wont hurt a bit promise you dont know about crests well allow me to tell you everything absolutely everything about them is your calendar clear this will take a while crests are a fascinating topic but before one can dive deeply into said topic one must first understand what crests are they are power incarnate they are said to have been bestowed upon humans by the goddess countless ages ago they exist within the flesh and are passed down through bloodlines those who carry crests may excel at magic display exceptional strength or any number of boons each crest has its own power the nature of which is beyond mortal understanding for now
and you believe i have a crest
i suspect as much yes but we wont know for sure unless i look into the matter as i said crests are passed down through the blood however just because someone carries a crest does not necessarily mean their descendants will inherit it as well only a scarce few descendants of a crests bloodline end up inheriting that crests power perhaps one of your ancestors bore a crest and you just happened to inherit it that is how a crest usually presents itself after all
do what you can to find out
yes of course ill get to the bottom of it straight away
theres no need to look into it
i most strongly disagree there absolutely is a need my crest research is of critical importance to the church ill have you know since you are now a professor here i must insist that you aid in my research of course there are those who lack the foresight to aid in my endeavors such as that stubborn seteth but such individuals are the rare exception
now then please go ahead and hold out your arm over this device here
what is this a pattern ive never seen before is it possible an as yet undiscovered crest has been detected to think there are still crests out there that even i am unaware of how thrilling ahem  pardon my unrestrained jubilation i have much to consider you may leave now i have more research to do in regard to this crest yes so very much more research but for now your work here is done  hmm  what could this line here be indicating perhaps it represents a lack of symmetry  or perhaps  what in the world oh i see  it may be connected to that but to a greater degree than usual 
 
with each moon professors of the officers academy receive a schedule for the month ahead it notes the days on which events and missions will take place that month pay careful attention to your schedule so that you may thoughtfully plan what you intend to do each month and when
so this is my room  i thought i heard a girls voice but i must have been imagining things
some believe the dignity of the empire rests on the results of the mock battle thats an overstatement of course still we must do our best to prevail you should take the time to learn each students abilities perhaps some extra lessons and training sessions are in order you look as if you have no idea whats going on here i know my way around so im happy to help you find your footing
the monastery has some exceptional facilities that everyone who lives at the officers academy is welcome to make use of for example you can enjoy a meal with your students at the dining hall or take part in some one on one sparring at the training grounds i suggest visiting the various facilities whenever you have the time to spare its a great way to get to know the students faculty and various workers here
have you noticed the bulletin boards placed around the monastery those contain requests people have posted as well as helpful information from the market if you prove yourself by helping people with their requests certain facilities here will become available for your use the bulletin board is updated frequently so i suggest checking it at least once a month
you should take your time when speaking with everyone but when it comes to using the facilities  well you need to be more careful with that if you use them without planning ahead your free time will be gone before you know it
a great deal is expected from professors of the officers academy so its important to hone your skills to put it plainly youll need to keep expanding your knowledge of all disciplines not just battle
i trust youre eager to face the black eagles in battle enjoy the thrill of anticipation while it lasts soon youll wish you had chosen to lead our house instead
i hear there will be a mock battle soon we must not neglect our training i trust that you will carefully study the strengths and weaknesses of each of your students that you may provide effective guidance regardless of the results this battle will be a great learning experience even so  what is the point of competition if the aim isnt to win as this is your first time at the monastery please allow me to show you the ropes
both students and teachers of the officers academy are free to use the facilities within the monastery for example you can dine with others at the dining hall or partake in one on one combat in the training grounds i encourage you to wander around the monastery and lend an ear to the people living here
there are bulletin boards in various places around the monastery have you seen them professor there you can find requests from various sources as well as information about the market if you fulfill these requests you should eventually be able to use even more of the facilities here the bulletin board gets updated frequently you would do well to check it once a month
this probably goes without saying but no matter which facility you use it will take up a considerable amount of your time its helpful to plan out activities in advance so that you dont mistakenly squander your time here
professors at the officers academy are expected to have exceptional leadership skills students and teachers alike must devote themselves to their studies and strive to acquire great wisdom even outside their respective fields
i heard about the upcoming mock battle i want you to know professor that i do not intend to lose i hereby declare my intention to prevail at  goodness listen to me the thrill of competition has carried me away i wont speak so formally of a class assignment in the future
did you hear the news teach looks like were gonna have a good ol mock battle between the houses the golden deer house isnt exactly what youd call an elite group just yet so you may want to whip everyone into shape with some extra training after all competition is only fun if you win to that end id better prepare as well you know i was researching what its like to live here long before i even enrolled want me to fill you in teach
students and teachers of the officers academy are all free to use the facilities within the monastery that means you can chow down with students in the dining hall or get in some one on one sparring at the training grounds as you explore the monastery try visiting the various facilities and talking to the people who live here
if you havent noticed there are bulletin boards in various places around here you can check them out to see posted requests or to find more information about the market i hear that fulfilling requests can even earn you the right to use more facilities the bulletin board gets updated frequently so its probably a good idea to check it once a month
far be it from me to tell you how to use the facilities but its a good idea to be mindful of how youre using your time if you dont think about how youre spending your free time itll be over before you know it
here at the officers academy even professors are expected to study often to help maintain their strong leadership skills in other words students and teachers alike have to strive to grow in every possible field
hey teach i hear theres gonna be a mock battle between the houses im not gonna lie im a bit concerned about facing an elite mercenary like you maybe take it easy on us what do you say
dimitri and claude are the leaders of the other two houses do not underestimate them when we take the field it would be best not to engage the both of them at once
if you continue to insist on distracting me i will have no choice but to get rid of you joking of course
let me tell you the provenance of our class name the eagle that refers to the twin headed eagle on the adrestian empires coat of arms and black is the traditional color of the empires armor hence black eagles
 the great tree moon is the best time of the year for naps i could just forget all about my assignment 
thats not a good idea
now im feeling sleepy too 
yeah 
who jeritza sure seems strong i kinda thought he was gonna be the new professor assigned to our class after that teacher ran away during our outdoor training i figured jeritza was a natural replacement i was surprised when you were suddenly appointed professor instead i dont think i could hold my own against jeritza in battle i could probably take you though
not a chance
you really think so with enough training im sure ill beat you someday
probably
hah seriously you should really work on your self confidence if youre planning on becoming a professor
um i ah was just heading back to my room bye
 
i dont like to come out unless i really have to hope youre ok with that professor
hi professor howre you doing if youre not busy would you like to join me on a little trip into town if im cooped up in this dusty old monastery for too long it drives me absolutely crazy
yes its true that im the only commoner in the black eagle house i knew that before the first day of class those people are simply exhausting
professor i hope you know i am having great abilities for reading and writing with sadness i still have struggles with speaking if my ways of speak of speech are causing a burden i hope you will have forgiveness
here at the monastery i have had many great learnings from many great people i am hopeful to have learnings from you too as forever i will do my best trying
his highness has said that he trusts you and i have no cause for doubt but if you mistreat him in any way i will take action
let me know when you are hungry i will make you a quality meal as thanks for your service to his highness
im busy do you want something
i was hoping to spar with you
i cant right now but lets fight soon i look forward to beating you
nothing in particular
then get out of my way
oh did you come to look at the plants too the greenhouse here is really incredible there are so many rare flowers id never seen back home and herbs i never even knew existed
ive never had much interest in plants
thats normal they all looked the same to me before i really studied them
you seem well informed on the subject
my adoptive father is the real expert he taught me everything i know about herbs including how to tell them apart and how to make medicines
you should try looking around the greenhouse sometime if the mood strikes you maybe something will catch your eye
hey professor if youve got spare time want to join me for a trip into town we could try to pick up beautiful girls  or not im kidding dont look at me like that
well theres dorothea hilda and mercedes lady rheas quite the beauty too and i must admit ive even checked out professor manuela once or twice you know professor i think im going to like it at the officers academy there are beautiful girls as far as the eye can see 
before i came to the officers academy i attended a school of magic in the kingdom capital thats where i met annie thats what i call annette oh i guess lorenz was at the school of magic too but annie was always just so nice to me even though i was older shes my best friend in the world
hello professor uh i have a teeny tiny question for you if thats all right  you havent seen a man with hair the same color as mine a scowling face and a generally gloomy demeanour have you
looking for someone
well yes its a bit difficult to explain  please just let me know if you do see him ok
cant say that i have
i suppose it was silly to ask sorry for wasting your time
the blue lion house derived its names from the honorary title of the first king of faerghus loog the king of lions wore brilliantly blue garments his chivalric exploits are recorded in multiple legends the library holds various historical accounts regarding him and the blue lions if you find time you should read them theyre filled with insights
our house is that of the golden deer do you know the significance of that name professor golden deer are sacred creatures said to have protected leicester since time immemorial all three of the houses have a meaning behind their name you should feel free to ask around if that sort of knowledge interests you
ugh i really need to eat i cant hold out until the next meal why cant the dining hall stay open all the time i need to keep eating if i want to get stronger
have you memorized everyones names yet im ignatz in case you forgot im looking forward to learning from you
this is the golden deer house youre in charge of a different house right too bad we wont see more of each other im happy to learn from you if the opportunity comes up
hi professor have you gotten around to visiting the library yet its absolutely loaded with valuable information i only wish i wasnt burdened with the necessity of sleep so i could spend all my hours there
you like reading
in a manner yes but its more that i want to learn as much as i possibly can
you ought to get some rest
please dont treat me like a child i may be a bit younger than the others but that really shouldnt factor in
goddess i pray to thee  please protect us   
so about the mock battle thats coming up you dont mind me sitting it out do you as a fragile maiden im useless in battle ill just cheer everyone on instead
oh professor have you adjusted to life at the academy yet me im still not used to it im not one for all this studying and training
im captain jeralts first and best apprentice i can beat anyone professor even you if i have to it may have been only for a short time but i learned from the absolute best
do bear in mind that even as you are appraising your students they are appraising you as well i hope that you will do your best to form lasting bonds with your flock oh and i look forward to witnessing your prowess in the mock battle
these are the students quarters to better help you supervise them you also have a room here your room is here at the end commoner students also reside on the first floor while the second is primarily for students of noble birth as a rule we try to avoid discrimination based on social status here but the nobility can be quite insistent when it comes to matters of propriety speaking of it would be best for you to avoid improper conduct i expect you to set a good example for the students
hello there professor well i call you that but i am afraid that i am not a student here myself 
thats a shame
should the opportunity arise i would love to become a student and begin my studies in earnest
where can i visit you then
my brother would not be pleased if he heard you saying such things
the monastery is kind enough to provide a sanctuary for my brother and i hes the only family i have
captain jeralt has hardly changed since 20 years ago ive aged at least three times as much as he has why am i talking about this oh right it was because i just overheard tomas remarking on the subject the leader of a legendary group of knights returned people are bound to be talking about the ol captain
i care nothing of friendship if you have no business here leave
the church has changed a lot since my time seteth hanneman manuela jeritza and many of the knights  none of them were around 20 years ago have you met leonie yet apparently it was my influence that inspired her to leave her village sorry to burden you but could you watch over her for me shes the only apprentice ive ever had
apparently there is to be a mock battle between the houses interesting but i hope you understand that i have far more important things on my mind my research is proceeding slower than i would like your crest is something of a challenge frustrating yet also quite intriguing i was wondering if i might get a sample of your flesh a couple square inches would do no perhaps some blood a couple of drops on the device are all i need
its some kind of experimental apparatus 
i might as well assist by providing a blood sample 
oh thank you professor those few drops of blood are invaluable to my research oh so much more to learn
i had better keep my distance
a mock battle this early wow professor theyre not giving you any time to settle in are they dont you worry though should you get injured i will care for you all through your recuperation i will see to you oh so very very personally
professor i hear you are lacking in knowledge of the church of seiros the library contains countless documents about the teaching and history of the church i encourage you to make good use of them
im a little busy
oh sorry
if youre looking for the greenhouse its right there see it looks like a greenhouse thats it
cant we talk just a little
i really cant right now i got a lot of things to do work and stuff like that why dont you look at the flowers in the greenhouse instead theyre pretty
greetings professor nothing to report by the by have you ever regretted a decision and wished you could go back and undo it its too bad theres no lesson for how to turn back the ol clock huh but i suppose a bad decision isnt worth all that fuss anyhow
im not too keen on the professor of my class i really hoped to focus more on strategy hmm maybe i should talk to my professor about transferring to a different class
there are two types of crests major crests manifest their power most effectively while minor crests are slightly weaker it is said that the closer a persons blood relation is to various saints and heroes the higher their chance of bearing a major crest of course there are also examples of major crests manifesting in children whose parents bear no crest whatsoever the exact nature of how and why crests are inherited is still a mystery
i hear a member of house hresvelg the ruling family of the empire has entered the officers academy for the first time in ages it is said that the adrestian empires very founding was aided by none other than saint seiros that is why the crest of seiros is on the imperial flag in recent years a rift has developed between the empire and the church  let us hope that this will be a good opportunity for both parties to reforge their close relationship of years past
as part of our commitment to the goddess the knights undertake various missions across all of fódlan assisting with the education of young nobles is also a part of our sacred duty
the imperial princess the crown prince and the heir to the alliances leading house  this is one exceptional year thats for sure if youre a teacher here youd better watch your step if anything were to happen to those kids  well suffice to say that it could harm the reputation of the church of seiros which weve spent almost a millennium establishing
tomas has served as the monasterys librarian for decades actually he was away from garreg mach for a spell but he returned to his post last year there is no one as familiar with the monastery archives as he is
its finally time for the mock battle this is my chance to measure your worth as an instructor do you think you can rise to the challenge
leave it to me
so confident this will be interesting
im concerned 
that doesnt inspire much confidence does it
each of us has undergone strict training were prepared for anything that comes our way that means theres no need to hold back show us what youre capable of
hey there did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting oh no worries well just join in now
simply tell me your weaknesses and youre welcome to stay but is there enough time to cover them all
ah so you cant win unless you know my weakness poor princess you really should believe in yourself more
i spare no effort when pursuing victory as a master of schemes i should think you would understand
schemes me i have no idea what youre talking about i plan to fight fair and square as ever
hearing the words fair and square from claude can only be a bad omen
your highnesses havent known me for very long but you already have me figured out dont you
no need to poke fun i will fight with honor that said i will fight to win
yes and the same is true of us right professor
dont go too hard on us
no use trying to hide how you really feel teach i can see it in your eyes you dont intend to lose
i dont intend to lose
if that is how you feel then i will not hold back
aw how precious looks like you and the students have become fast friends
while i am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students im afraid its about time for the faculty strategy meeting
ah how time flies in that case ill see you later
edelgard professor be careful out there
ah its finally time for the mock battle im eager to put my skills to use and you professor
im looking forward to it
excellent i have high expectations for your command that said ive no doubt it will take everything weve got to pull a victory
i hope we can win
i wouldnt worry too much about it if you command use as you did back in the village i have no doubt well be fine
our opponents are mighty that much is certain but im positive we can win
hey there did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting oh no worries well just join in now
nice try claude but i do not intent to let slip our strategies especially when we are up against such strong opponents as you two
well now kind words from his kingliness if thats the case wed better come up with some clever schemes so as not to disappoint right princess
right no matter the tactics you devise we will destroy you the best you can hope for is to learn a thing or two
haha theres nothing wrong with a friendly rivalry but lets not get carried away a rash attitude could be your undoing after all
hmm  perhaps your time would be better spent preparing instead of worrying about the competitions mindset
hey now if you two are getting this fired up before the battle even starts itll make it that much easier for my class to sweep up a win so please carry on
a good point claude i apologize that wasnt my intention at any rate lets vow to make this a productive battle shall we
dont go too hard on us
no use trying to hide how you really feel teach i can see it in your eyes you dont intend to lose
i dont intend to lose
oh in that case i wont hold back
aw how precious looks like you and the students have become fast friends
while i am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students im afraid its about time for the faculty strategy meeting
ah how time flies in that case ill see you later
i look forward to assessing your abilities i hope you dont disappoint
time for a mock battle eh hmm how should we go about this  well youll be our commander that much is for sure just dont screw it up and everythingll be great got it teach
im not concerned
leave it to me
right ill do whatever i can to help too i mean im kind of obligated to for example if i add a little something to their food to upset their stomachs 
dont even think about it
yeah yeah wink wink i read you you cant officially condone that sort of thing right but say hypothetically speaking students from the other houses started racing to the infirmary  as far as anyone knows it could just be a harmless little stomach bug making the rounds
well well what a fascinating conversation you two are having may we join
claude i cant believe you would stoop to such crooked schemes to gain the advantage have you no honor
if that was really my scheme i wouldnt be talking about it out in the open im afraid youll have to wait until our battle to see whats really in store
its irrelevant anyhow whatever you have planned wont save you from a crushing defeat
she has a point still im rather eager to see what sort of scheme that mind of yours conjures up
you heard em teach we cant let these fine folks down
it will be a fair fight
heh of course a fair fight as all fights are good one teach play innocent now so they wont see it coming
if they insist
are you serious teach well if a crooked scheme is really what youre after ive got more than a few of those up my sleeve
aw how precious looks like you and the students have become fast friends
while i am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students im afraid its about time for the faculty strategy meeting
im sorry professors its about time i returned to my training anyhow claude edelgard until we meet again on the battlefield farewell
i look forward to assessing your abilities i hope you dont disappoint
formerly a promising young mercenary you are now the newest professor at the prestigious officers academy students and faculty alike look on with curiosity as you engage in a mock battle between the schools three houses
the mock battle is finally here will you lead us to victory
im sure you already understand but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner incidentally ill be overseeing this mock battle so listen well if you want to win
none of your shallow tactics are required claude ignatz and i will dismantle the opposition
me but im not ready
are you making light of our new professor if you drop your guard youre going to get hurt 
ashe can you move to the front lines i want to lure the enemy this way
got it your highness leave it to me
once youve finished preparing make your move dedue mercedes keep our enemy occupied until then
im on it
oh my well try our best
well done teach i may have to take this seriously after all
lets use the forest to set up an ambush im counting on your support everyone
if theyre waiting in the forest wed do well to take a detour
welp were surrounded all we can do is fight back with all our might
are you really gonna fight two houses at once heh an impressive display of confidence
this is a good opportunity for us lets forge ahead
beautiful work professor but the true challenge starts now
youre a tough opponent but i refuse to yield do not fool yourself into believing i will hold back
dimitri  its time we can finally settle the question of whos stronger
very well i accept your challenge with you as my opponent i wont hold anything back
i would expect no less
coming up with brilliant schemes i can handle no problem but im not much for fighting go easy on me
 
you know that was a joke right jeez not so much as a smile 
look at that a real life princess ill have to be careful not to scar that little face of yours
careful claude ill win no matter what but youre only making things harder for yourself
losing hasnt even crossed your mind has it ooh thisll be a bit of a shock then
to shock was your intention to begin with was it not
ive lost oh unthinkable
ive lost the new professor is quite a commander
ouch was that really necessary
argh i hate losing i guess ill just have to settle for cheering the others on
i must have let my guard down i guess thats a loss for the golden deer house
well done i nearly wound up a patient in my own infirmary
ah so strong have to do better next time 
ngh apologies your highness i can go no further
oh no  this is as far as i can go 
my training was insufficient  i am so sorry everyone the rest is up to you
i suppose that does it for the blue lion house 
my goodness the leadership of someone with actual battle experience is  well i was as good as useless
i am the son of house aegir how did i fail i must need to train harder 
hmm the new professors rather strong suppose ill have to call it a day
my my  the new professor seems very capable
forced to retreat  well things will only get tougher from here on out
to think that the black eagles could lose so readily 
all right thats that the winner of this mock battle is  the black eagle house
even though it was just a mock battle we defeated both houses masterfully take pride in this victory everyone
this victory is the result of everyones hard work thank you my friends you did well
it is about time for the battle to begin our victory depends on your leadership do not let us down
none of your shallow tactics are required claude ignatz and i will dismantle the opposition
me but im not ready
are you making light of our new professor if you drop your guard youre going to get hurt 
dorothea will you head towards the front lines i wish to draw the enemy towards us
you got it edie leave it to me
ferdinand hubert if the enemy comes stop them
leave it to us although i could do this on my own
heh clearly not or her highness would not ask me to watch your back
well done teach i may have to take this seriously after all
lets use the forest to set up an ambush im counting on your support everyone
if theyre waiting in the forest wed do well to take a detour
welp were surrounded all we can do is fight back with all our might
are you really gonna fight two houses at once heh an impressive display of confidence
victory is in sight black eagles do not let up
flawless tactics professor our only choice in this situation is a head on attack
psst your princliness youve got a thing for edelgard right come on fess up youll feel better
claude please this is no time for idle banter your defenses are wide open
that didnt get to him huh what a shame ill find a better way to ruffle him up next time
there can be no victory unless i defeat you so be it
so this is the stage for the mock battle  the commands all yours teach
i will fight on the front lines i can stop the enemys advance with grace
do you have lady edelgards permission to  hmph i suppose ive no choice but to provide cover
thank you hubert we are off to a terrible start
ashe can you move to the front lines i want to lure the enemy this way
got it your highness leave it to me
once youve finished preparing make your move dedue mercedes keep our enemy occupied until then
im on it
oh my well try our best
hm you are performing as expected professor we will have to face you with our full might
we will use the forest to ambush our enemy everyone i am counting on your support
if theyre waiting in the forest wed do well to take a detour
it seems were surrounded  at a time like this our only option is to cut a path through
are you planning on fighting two houses at once i will admit that is favorable for us
this is a good opportunity for us lets forge ahead
beautiful work professor but the true challenge starts now
great work everyone even if its just a mock battle the taste of victory is sugary sweet
excellent work today professor though our victory should come as no surprise
it was a close call
was it im not sure i agree with that
it was easy
yes it was further proof that youre well qualified to guide the black eagles
that was impressing professor i mean impressive we gained a victory because of your great leadership
we certainly did we all tried our best of course but we couldnt have won without you
i was curious what it would look like if you did not hold back and you did not disappoint
hmph i daresay we owe our victory to lady edelgard
how so for that battle she was only a soldier following our professors command sure she was an incredibly powerful soldier 
dont worry about it too much linhardt all that matters is that we won
im all done with being on the battlefield ok id rather stay back than pursue victory out there
you are all as ridiculous as always we only managed to win because we worked together
was it something i said is it so odd me talking about togetherness if so that perception must change in fact im canceling the festivities so we can discuss this topic further im kidding of course come on everyone weve earned this celebration
professor ive been looking for you
i was hoping we could all share a meal together it could serve as both a victory celebration and a post battle analysis what do you think
a victory celebration
of course after all we fought hard out there such exertion is bound to make anyone hungry for respite dont you agree
im invited
of course why wouldnt you be
come now professor we cant very well celebrate without the key to our victory present
hes right he really is we were only able to win because we had your help professor
yes compared with that boar who knows nothing save frontal attacks your tactics were nearly decent
felix you really ought to stop picking fights with his highness
dont worry ingrid i encourage all to speak freely and i must agree that the professors tactics were truly extraordinary i have much to learn
oh sure but today was exhausting im so hungry i can barely stand 
to be honest so am i lets head to the dining hall together
 
professor im sorry to intrude but you dont look too happy for someone who just won
youre mistaken
you say that but your eyes tell a different story
is that so 
hm well i understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes im sorry for prying
i know we only just met so this may be difficult for you but  id love nothing more than to share our happiness with you joy can be so fleeting after all were all in this together so i hope you will consent im sure the rest of the class feels the very same well come along professor lets enjoy the fruits of our labor
great work teach that was a brilliant win
im glad we won
ive been anticipating that magic moment when your tactics and my schemes entwined and you did not disappoint that composed expression you always sport like a permanent mask is a perfect complement to my ruthless scheme thats a joke of course mostly
everyone did well
huh playing ignorant as to the quality of you command and deflecting the praise to your students you really are a model professor teach
to be honest i had a bunch of other schemes planned as well just in case the situation called for it but i didnt have to resort to any of them i suppose our opponents lucked out
well met professor the breadth of your skill was on full display today i must admit that your tactics were masterful i shudder to think what may have transpired had it been claude leading us into battle
i noticed that too we just did what you told us and we won i love it
as expected from a child of the former captain of the knights thank you for today professor i have much to consider
i never doubted that our professor would be amazing it was way too obvious dont you agree marianne
huh me oh um yes of course well done professor
captain jeralt taught his child well it would have been more of a surprise had our professor proved lacking
dont you think its a bit hard to give jeralt all of the credit leonie in any case its clear that we only won because of our new mentors guidance
a mercenarys wisdom and techniques are forged in battle those are the sorts of things you can only learn through experience right teach but more importantly its time to celebration our victory teach here has yet to try my well renowned home cooking
i really do hope youll join us after all i swiped some finely aged cheese from the dining hall for just this occasion
your work with the students was remarkable i can see jeralt trained you well i do hope you were able to use the occasion to bond with the students
i did
i am so happy to hear it nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still
not really
oh well you have only just met them so i suppose that should come as no surprise
of course the mock battle was mere practice the real fight is the battle of the eagle and lion which will take place during the wyvern moon you are expected to properly train your students so as not to humiliate the academy during the long held tradition that is the coming battle
as for today i have called you here to tell you of your mission for the month ahead your class is to dispose of some bandits causing trouble nearby
my mission
bandits
those affiliated with garreg mach monastery have a moral obligation to help those in need regardless of social standing students are no exception each month before the newly birthed moon departs each house of students must complete their assigned mission you shall work to complete the task at hand alongside your students and report back to the archbishop before the deadline understood i will soon provide you with the necessary details for your first mission if i told you now i expect you would only forget and i despise repeating myself
i can sense something special within your heart  i have high hopes for you
bandits they say 

do you recall when we first met you shall not fall so shamelessly again correct
 
have you no words for me do not tell me that you are shocked to hear from me you ought to know that i am always with you now to hear my voice should not come as a shock
right
i dont understand
whatever shall i do with you i am alive within the confines of your heart i am unknown to all but you but through your eyes and ears i see and hear just listen to your heart as you are doing now and we may speak like this that is all that i know
 
what is this nonsense all i was told was to kill as many noble pipsqueaks as possible no one said anything about the knights of damned seiros being on our trail
you have proven yourself worthless distracted by something so trivial i had hoped you would achieve your goal despite the setback but now a child of the knights former captain is in play how interesting
hey this isnt what i agreed to
hiring a mercenary as a professor what was that woman thinking
are you listening to me how do we finish this
you die
wh  what
underestimating the knights was an amateur mistake one you will pay for the road to eternal torment awaits you all now i must locate your replacements 
wait get back here damn you
/***EOF***/
though most stars will still glimmer in the crisp winter air the blue sea star has gone back into hiding legend states that the goddess prays for peace from her home in the heavens in the town of garreg mach the anniversary of the monasterys completion nears and the peoples prayers intensify ahead of the millennium festival still five years hence
we are planning a grand ball for this month i am sure the students will be most pleased
yes certainly however we must not devote all of our time to frivolity we have a new mission for you we have found evidence of someone sneaking into an unused chapel
a chapel
it is a building that was once a temporary sanctuary at a time when the monastery was under renovation
was something stolen
no there is nothing of value in that building we do not yet know what the intruders objectives are
this month your class is tasked with guarding the chapel and investigating these intruders with the recent state of affairs surrounding the holy church we cannot afford to overlook any abnormality no matter how seemingly trivial
i am ordering a seasoned knight to assist you to ensure the safety of the students in times like these i am afraid we must always expect the worst
thats reassuring
which knight
reporting for duty lady rhea
i thought you two could use the time to bond and to speak of important matters 
appreciate the thought
bear in mind that jeralt has a separate mission of his own he will join you once he has finished it
its true ill be away from the monastery for a while but when i return  ill come and watch you work ill be looking forward to it
tomas  no solon was it not and the flame emperor  it is most clear that something has transpired and it relates to you somehow or is the fault my own and youre just caught inside the wave  sothis the goddess of this world  i bear her name  hmm  how confusing i feel as though my head has turned to mush
everyones in such a festive mood i feel a bit out of my element here i cant help but worry something might happen while were all distracted  after all our enemies are always plotting still this air of levity is much more agreeable than the grim atmosphere of late
it seems the dastards who set remire village aflame have yet to be apprehended monsters trampling mercilessly over innocent lives they deserve a gruesome end 
someone entered the old chapel  i think the townsfolk used it for feasts and such in the past with that whole tomas business you cant blame the church for being on edge
another month full of chaos ive barely had time to catch my breath what is the objective of tomas and his ilk and what makes flayn so special does that not bother you
ah the ball it reminds me of my first such event back in the imperial capital it was held by my father the prime minister i really showed off my dancing skills everyone was quite impressed with me
you know professor i used to think i would be comfortable with all manner of experiments so long as they provided usable results but when i heard of solons work well i realized id not consider the moral and philosophical limits of what all manner of experiments might mean urk  sorry im not great with blood even when im just thinking about it i feel a bit ill now
i cant believe this  im so angry right now first its the death knight and now tomas and neither of them are in custody i cant stand the thought of such evil lurking in the world we have to do something about this i have to do something about this
the ball a grim reminder of my sad reality the other nobles will be fine im sure theyve all been to events like this before but me im a noble and ive never even been close to one of these things
i wonder if remire village will ever be the same again how do you recover from such a terrible event so many dead so much destroyed  i cant see how the whole village doesnt just end up abandoned
our class was also sent to help put the village in order but then 
dancing of fódlan is not the same as dancing of brigid the reason is maybe that the music has many differences in brigid dancing is different for each person our dancing has vigor and ferocity there is no speech of technique for our dancing
even though there is to be a ball we still have a mission it would be nice if this month passed by in peace
argh  too much merriment the librarian betrayed us the death knight is back is this the time to be throwing a ball
last month was  well you know even better than i do i hope this one will be more cheerful this ball though  i dont know its all new to me
great work in remire village professor who would have ever guessed it was tomas ah but no now isnt the time to get lost in gloomy thoughts
oh now where did that ingrid run off to the ball is soon and she hadnt even put on any makeup i was trying to help her out
so tomas the librarian was a bad guy but he always seemed so nice cmon self youre better than this you promised youd be on top of things this month
mercedes locked me in her room for hours earlier  she was slathering pounds of makeup onto my face saying something or other about the ball it really wore me out 
ah the long awaited ball finally an opportunity to showcase my exquisite skills on the dance floor these skills were ingrained in me when i was a boy my hands and feet move on pure instinct
the ball is coming up soon i am so excited i cant wait to fill up on food while everyones dancing i even heard therell be some prime cuts of meat
some scary things have been happening lately i hope that this month of all months is peaceful the ball is coming up and everything  although im not much of a dancer actually
its true that tomas was employed here under the recommendation of house ordelia but thats all i know of the topic id never even seen him prior to enrolling here even when he was supposedly in ordelia territory i never once saw him there im still feeling bothered by all of this but theres not much else i can say about it right now
a ball um i dont think ill partake
its almost time for the ball oooh my am i excited this being a school we dont have many chances to get dressy
im glad the remire village situation got sorted out but its not over yet is it and i cant believe old tomas turned out to be an enemy who can you trust anymore
before the ball it is customary that we host a competition of dance known as the white heron cup the students are quite fond of this tradition each house must select representatives to compete their dance shall be judged by its beauty grace and technique the student who is deemed the winner will be given the opportunity to train as a dancer should they so please it is a very precious thing the gift of dance i hope that you and your students will choose to participate
i have been told that your house won the white heron cup this can only be a result of the students talent and effort not to mention your steadfast instruction
it would appear your house was defeated in the white heron cup with the white heron cup concluded all that is left is to wait for the ball i hope you will find it enjoyable
it has come to my attention that you did not participate in the white heron cup were none of your students skilled in dance with the white heron cup concluded all that is left is to wait for the ball i hope you will find it enjoyable
i have looked into tomas but i just cannot make sense of this at all from his behavior up until now i never would have suspected that a man like him could turn on us i have also discovered that his appearance has changed  it is almost as if he is not even human what in the world is going on
hello professor the ball will soon be upon us ah i can feel my heart fluttering already i  i have never danced in front of people before not even once in all my life i am very much looking forward to it
ah the ball  it reminds me of how i met my wife i was at a villages harvest festival there was a full moon bathing everything in its cool glow she appeared out of nowhere dancing gracefully in the moonlight a lovely fairy
that story sounds fake
hah the full moon was an embellishment i admit but you can forgive a man for waxing poetic cant you anyway 
thats a wonderful story
we soon fell in love and tied the knot now we have a daughter whos as bright and beautiful as a sunny morning so whenever i see people dancing i think of my wife and my heart does a little waltz
the area with the old chapel was supposed to be off limits it was at risk of collapse so they didnt even post guards its not too strange does that surprise you eh garreg mach has lots of places that are blocked off for one reason or another thats true of the underground holy mausoleum as well as the northern woods people call it the sealed forest but as far as i can tell its nothing special just a forest
whats this about the ball knights dont participate its an event for students but it does pique the interest of some knights in particular
alois cant dance but i hear he likes to watch he volunteered to judge the white heron cup not that i care
it cannot be true that our siblings in arms could turn against us however i will continue investigating members of the church to think even someone as senior as tomas would fall under suspicion  i know not how far to take my search
even the knights 
unlike the monks the knights of seiros are lady rheas direct subordinates some are in quite unique circumstances but i cannot think any of them would betray us
even the students 
yes a great many strange and terrible things have come to pass this year  i must not dismiss the possibility that someone among the students is behind it all
garreg mach monastery is said to have been completed during the ethereal moon why 995 years ago as a matter of fact thats rather a long time ago dont you think every year a ball is held to celebrate the founding and every one hundred years a very special celebration takes place its a grand festival involving all of garreg mach it is thrilling to read of past festivals and im rather excited to experience one for myself once in a lifetime eh the next one in five years will make a millennium should be quite an event do you imagine youll still be here teaching then
great just great its that time when all the students get all lovey dovey youre new but you know about the ball yeah i cant bear it young love is wasted on the young they cant appreciate it to its fullest ugh i wish i could fall in love too 
oh speaking of the ball professor have you selected your representative for the dance contest yet if you dont the contest will go on without your house and that would be embarrassing
nah tomas wouldnt betray the church i dont believe it i wont believe it theres some people in the church who hate people like me who are from almyra but tomas was always real kind but if he really was lady rheas enemy  well id defend her against anybody no matter how kind theyd been in the past
hey professor hows it going making lots of coin id love to catch up but im super busy right now working for money you understand
greetings professor nothing to report ah other than the legend of the goddess tower of course have you heard the students talking about it on the last night of the ethereal moon on the same night as the ball  if a man and a woman go to the goddess tower and make a wish its sure to come true i have a wish but i cant find anybody to make it with me 
is there someone i feel that way about
the white heron cup is a competition of skill and grace in dance please encourage your house to participate that said if you are serious about winning be sure to choose your representative carefully
by the way have you chosen our houses representative for the white heron cup if nobody else comes to mind im willing to take up the challenge professor
understood just leave this to me and victory is assured
i see  if you believe theres someone more qualified i certainly wont object
on a lighter note ive heard youve yet to choose a class representative for the white heron cup its not something im interested in but if no one else wants to do it then i will shoulder the burden
how very whimsical of you i suppose ill have to do what i can
wise better to choose someone with more charm
do you see what i am trying to say here do not make me beg you  please choose me as our representative for the white heron cup
wonderful you will have a chance to see the legendary footwork of house aegir
hmph if you really think someone is better suited for it i will not argue
let us change the subject and settle my stomach i assume youve heard about the dance competition have you chosen a representative yet or  oh my you havent have you have you come to tell me im to be it
i see  i can dance in theory but i dare say in practice things may go very differently
i think thats wise i simply cant really be bothe   what i mean to say is i lack the confidence
ugh sorry about that professor im just so frustrated right now i need something to take my mind off things that reminds me if youre looking for a volunteer id be happy to represent our class in the white heron cup im an excellent dancer
great we both know im our classs best chance at winning this thing
you really think you can find a better dancer than me
what is a white heron cup anyway wh what a dance competition thats terrifying w we need a representative for our class please anyone but bernie
youre just trying to humiliate me arent you
oh what a relief thank you so much professor
im sorry professor im talking about such grim and terrible things when we could be talking about the white heron cup its a big dance contest between the classes and i simply adore dancing im quite good at it since i was a diva in an opera company you know
i think my heart just skipped a beat you want me to represent the class im not sure when i last experienced such flattery professor
what why not me oh whatever so long as you remember to chose someone hm
are you choosing me to represent at the white heron cup or are you not
i will display all that i have learned i will grab the victory
i have understanding you believe that i cannot grab the victory i am guessing
i  im sorry please ignore my troubled ramblings was something the matter something to do with the white heron cup professor i beg of you please do not chose me as our house representative i am utterly serious
what curse you professor i will of course accept but know that you have damned us all
oh thank the goddess please be sure to select someone with the confidence to win for us
incidentally i have heard there will be a dance competition prior to the ball have you chosen a representative yet
i will take part if you insist
someone must want to participate you would do well to find that person
ah whatever you look like youre about to say something are you considering me as our representative for the white heron cup heh
i was joking you really couldnt find anyone else
i see thats a relief
but speaking of the ball isnt there something happening just before it the white heron something it sounds like every class needs a representative have you picked ours yet
are you sure you want m me to do this i guess ill just have to do the best i can then
you should pick one of the nobles they all have experience with this sort of thing
the ball is almost here and the white heron cup dance contest so professor who will be representing our class
me uh sure why not ill get out there show off my moves and drive the ladies wild
i get it no worries really id rather see a beautiful person dancing instead of some goof like me
while were on the subject of the ball whats this i hear about a dance competition physical activity isnt my forte but dancing can be fun if theres no one else youd rather select im happy to represent our class
thanks for having faith in me professor ill try my best to win
are you sure please let me know if you change your mind
after all we have the ball to look forward to and the white heron cup before that oh speaking of have you chosen our house representative yet if not id like to volunteer
really thats fantastic ill try as hard as anyones ever tried you can count on it
aw thats too bad but if you reconsider you know where to find me
speaking of i heard that theres going to be a dance competition have you sorted out who will represent our class professor its not me is it please dont say its me 
oh dear  well ill see what i can do then on my honor
thank goodness i dont know the first thing about dancing
considering this recent rash of strange incidents i wonder if having a ball is really the best idea  and then theres the white heron cup sheesh what poor sap are you enlisting to represent our house teach
claude me dont be unreasonable teach ugh  i mean if i have to make a miracle happen i guess ill figure it out 
oh but first the white heron cup who will appear onstage i wonder youre choosing a representative for the dance contest isnt that right choose me im a pro
great now that im in the spotlight ill do anything to win
aww i was really getting excited for it let me know if you change your mind huh
from what i hear the white heron cup will be held just prior to the ball say no more professor i would consider it an honor to represent our class
you will not regret this choice
by all means take your time and think it over but i do assure you there is no candidate better suited to the task than yours truly
apparently theres supposed to be a dance contest too i think its called the white heron cup whos gonna represent our class i can do it if you havent picked someone else
you made the right choice professor everyones gonna think my moves are hilarious
aww really i may not look it but im actually a pretty good dancer
watching other people dance can be fun though ive heard people talking about the white heron cup do you know who will be representing us
me what no please you cant
i think a noble would make for a better choice bound to know their way around a ballroom
right  its the dance this month isnt it i cant see how anyone would be much in the mood for dancing considering  although i suppose the white heron cup does sound pretty fun
uh you want me to be our representative ive certainly got a few moves 
it would probably be more logical to ask someone who likes dancing in the first place so i certainly understand
theres a dance contest as well i see ill cheer for our class of course so um  who will represent our house in the contest
i see well  um im sorry what did you say
im sure whoever represents our class will do a fine job much better than i could do
the ball doesnt matter i dont dance i might show up for the food though not that its got anything to do with me but have you picked someone to represent us for the white heron cup yet
what youre asking a peasant to dance youve got some pretty weird ideas
well someones bound to want to do it im sure weve got a few people with the talent to win too
have you heard yet about the white heron cup if you have yet to choose a representative do you mind terribly if i volunteer
ah thank you professor i am overcome with joy just you wait until my feet touch the ballroom floor
understood ah well either way i am still so excited about the ball
well i suppose we should practice then shall we
how was that i believe ive improved my technique
huh  well lets practice whenever you can spare the time agreed
to think id be rehearsing my dance moves of all things give me some advice professor
a little less grotesque now maybe
all right but if we want to avoid a tragic accident during the contest i will need more practice
professor uh  do you know how to dance i could really use some guidance
you really can do everything i am envious of you if you will pardon my frankness
fair enough you do not think i need guidance you are probably right
professor are you here to practice with me for the dance contest
i dont enjoy a bit of this you know entirely too much standing up and moving around for my taste but if im going to do it i may as well be in it to win
i see  well thats just fine by me theres a book on fishing that id like to finish
hey professor did you want to practice dancing with me
what did you think pretty perfect right
youre probably right i dont need any more practice im a natural
professor will you give me some dancing lessons
was that okay a little reassuring at least maybe
is this your idea of an education clip my wings and toss me off a cliff
hey professor youre here to help me practice for the dance contest
how was that was my dancing everything you hoped for and more i certainly enjoyed it we simply must do it again soon
well i am terribly talented agreed still i think ill practice on my own if youre too busy
i have much to be learned we will now practice the dancing ok
i have much more knowledge of fódlan lance how is my dancing professor
that is not fortunate i will have patience
i am in the thick of battle so battle i must will you help me prepare professor
how was that i perhaps did not offend as much as usual but i do not like our chances
i suppose i must practice diligently while i can on my own away from prying eyes
will you teach me to dance
was that satisfactory
that makes things difficult
here help me practice my dancing you forced me into this so youre going to help me
how did i get roped into this
hmph you irresponsible fiend
ive been practicing as best as i can professor but do you think you could give me a little help
was that all right im completely self taught so i really have no idea
you really want to leave this all up to me
oh professor im glad youre here i need help figuring out this whole dancing thing mind helping me
one and two and three and four  got it im pretty good at this
aw dont be like that professor you chose me  you should help me win
oh professor do you mind watching my dance routine i would appreciate your honest opinion
how was that i hope its good enough to win 
im so sorry i didnt realize you were busy i didnt mean to distract you
professor would you watch me dance really quick ive been practicing a ton
mwahaha well what do you think id say im pretty great wouldnt you
oh do you have really important professor things to do well let me know when you have the time
professor i admit  i have two left feet when it comes to dancing do you have time to give me any pointers
how did i do was i awkward i felt awkward
perhaps some other time then since you chose me ill need your guidance in all this
teach this is all your doing step up and take responsibility youve got to help me practice my dance moves
my legs arent as unwieldy as before i think  if i keep this up i might do not terribly
youre too busy too busy to take responsibility for your actions wow well youd better make time for me before its too late
hey professor care to join me for dance practice
phew i dont think we can possibly lose just you wait and see
what youve got something better to do than watch me practice
rehearsals will not be necessary but if you insist i can give you a small taste of what is to come
well professor are those not the most exquisitely refined moved you have ever witnessed
i assure you dancing is fully ingrained in my being any further practice would be redundant
hey professor you want to teach me some winning dance moves
that looked pretty good right i think i can win this thing
if you think my moves are good enough then i dont need dance lessons
professor can you watch me practice
is this how you do it im feeling a little unsteady 
professor dont abandon me in my time of need whyd you pick me in the first place
professor can you supervise my dance rehearsal if im going to do this i want to win it
well how was i i figure if i dance with passion and fervor ill appear even more mature
youve chosen me but you wont even bother to help me prepare thats rather rude professor
did you need something professor i suppose i should p practice right
no no thats no good i cant seem to get a feel for it 
oh very well
professor come join me for dance practice
im going to have to do this in front of a crowd i can feel myself going pale already
hey youre the one who put me up to this the least you can do is give me a hand
yes do you need me for anything professor i would be happy for some dancing guidance should you have any
thank you so much i am eager to improve my dancing
i see perhaps soon
ladies and gentlemen my sincerest apologies for the wait thank you for gathering here on the eve of the highly anticipated ball to bear witness to  the academy wide dance competition welcome to the white heron cup
the competition will be judged by me your humble servant alois rangeld and also  the acclaimed former songstress of the mittelfrank opera company manuela casagranda
yes yes thank you oh and it should go without saying but i swear to show no bias to my own house got it good
last but not least the glamorous assassin who does all of her dancing in the dead of night shamir nevrand
hmph
the three of us swear on our honor to judge the following proceedings with utmost impartiality and fairness and with that will the representatives of each house please make their way to the stage
contestants are you ready to dance and is the band prepared to play very well  begin
time thats all folks splendid all three of you were fantastic now lets hear what the judges have to say 
oh my lets see i suppose i have no choice but to vote for 
oh my lets see i suppose i have no choice but to vote for 
great feedback both of you well then lets see  factoring my own humble opinion  yes we have a winner and i will announce who it is right now without any delay the winner of this years white heron cup is 
well a victory is a victory
i am not sure the judges are in their right minds 
haha as expected of someone as accomplished as myself
oh well just so long as nothing else is expected from me
i won i won how did i win
bernie are you sure heh heh 
i wonder if i can use this to bolster my singing career 
everywhere dancing is dancing this is the proof
i won there must be some mistake 
is this a joke
nonsense
are you sure this is ok
heh heh heh i knew i had it in me
oh really how lovely
i did it go me
oh um sorry i really didnt see this coming
ah what a burden to be great at everything
perfect wheres the prize there is a prize right
haha as expected
me uh really
cant say i had much confidence going in but this is great
yes it was the logical choice my dancing was superior
oh dear  this is a bit embarrassing
i can dance huh
have i prevailed oh most glorious my practice was not in vain
the ball is tomorrow i have no worthwhile memories of such events yet im still looking forward to this one
as am i in the sense that i look forward to destroying all of the unworthy suitors who will inevitably swarm lady edelgard
i will admit edelgard is adorable however when it comes to elegance on the dance floor i am superior
youre not a bad dancer ferdie but you do have some moves that are hard to watch
you honor me with your kind words i understand that i am sometimes too dazzling to behold directly
im envious of your positive attitude i also know how to dance in theory maybe i should participate as well
not me you wouldnt catch me dancing at a ball any sooner than youd catch a fish swimming through the sky
 you do tend to flop around like a fish on the land after all
wh why would you say that now i feel like a fish on a skillet 
on a skillet  hahaha ahem never mind
speaking of the ball do we get to pick who we dance with i wonder who i should ask 
a bold subject change should lady edelgard wish it i would be honored to 
i will fight with all that i have in me
fighting no thats not really the point 
i will not be as a fish upon the flame
 um  ok 
i have a proposition lets all agree to meet back at the monastery exactly five years from today
like a class reunion thats a great idea
five years from today will be the millennium festival for garreg mach monastery ive heard the magnitude of the festivities will exceed all prior years
ooh how exciting sounds like a great excuse to come visit our dear professor
you will be seeing how much growing i have done you will be pleased professor this idea is good
who knows where each of us will be in five years time or who we will become still i have faith that all of us will gather and celebrate our reunion
thats assuming the professor is still here in five years and not enjoying a cozy early retirement
even if thats the case you will come wont you whether or not youre still teaching here 
of course
i will try
dont forget my teacher even if the millennium festival should be canceled i promise to return here 
this is the only ball of the year and i see why everyone is absurdly excited 
your highness you sound so detached we are all encouraged to enjoy the ball tomorrow
right you are what a burden 
huh i never thought wed see eye to eye but i agree id rather be swinging my blade than wasting my time with some girl at a ball
felix your highness you must be joking right this is our chance to dance with all of the ladies of the academy to our hearts content you wish to throw away the best day of the whole year for sword practice insanity i tell you
im pretty excited about the ball myself its not like we get to do things like this very often
too true ashe in fact im gonna do you a favor and give you a crash course in chatting up girls by tomorrow youll be an expert
actually id much prefer if someone could just teach us how to dance 
dont worry about the dancing part i can teach you that easy
its time for the ball that warrants at least a tiny bit of makeup dont you think ingrid just a smidge
i hmm maybe ill think about it
its settled tomorrow morning well meet up in ingrids room ooh i cant wait
hahaha you know  theres no telling where life will take us after we leave here if only we could find a way to come together again just like this 
a fine notion your highness perhaps five years from now
five years from now ah thats when garreg mach monastery will be holding the millennium festival
by then well be addressing your highness as your majesty instead
thats right i suppose we all know its coming but by then youll be far removed from us
come now you know me better than that my title may change but i wont and it wont just be me you know five years from now youll all have your own stuffy positions to contend with but as i understand it the festivities at the millennium festival will be of a scale far beyond anything weve yet seen  in other words the perfect excuse for us all to return here
ooh a reunion that sounds fun i wouldnt miss it for the world
id love for you to be there as well professor after all youre the heart of the blue lion house
ill be there
ill try
good then its settled of course if something happens and im not able to attend im leaving all of the logistics of organizing this reunion to you professor
you have to attend
its true im sure being a king will keep you busy but its a bit early to be backing out of your own plans dont you think
yes  i suppose youre right im sorry you have my word i will return as well count on it
the time has come for the annual ball but first an eve of merriment ok ill admit it the officers academy isnt as uptight as i thought
ooh i adore such things dancing is the only thing im really good at anyway
theres a feast tomorrow isnt there isnt there ah i cant want a moment longer
dancing singing  im not good at either of those things
so dancing is fun oh and remember you cant dance with the same partner multiple times its tradition that means you have to dance with all of the gentlemen in all of the houses swapping dance partners as you please 
how scandalous i for one plan to simply behold the pure essence of dance
ill um  watch from a distance
you cant just watch marianne if a boy asks you to dance you simply must accept its only polite
you can ask anyone to dance gah whatever should i do
hahaha lucky you ignatz tomorrow if only for a day you may live out your dearest dreams of an exalted existence as for me i am surely to be overwhelmed with the propositions of desperate ladies i will doubtless have little time for partners of my own choosing
which one of you is dreaming now lorenz
everyone listen up to no ones surprise i have a brilliant idea teach youll want in on this too
whats your idea
this may sound impetuous perhaps irresponsible almost certainly impossible but were gonna do it anyway in exactly five years time lets promise to meet again right here at the monastery
a reunion theres usually food at reunions count me in claude
five years from now  will be the monasterys millennium festival celebrating 1000 years since the founding of garreg mach
i hear the millennium festival will be the largest celebration in the monasterys history
oh i get it itll be easier for us to all get back here with the millennium festival as an excuse
how true as the new leader of the alliance i will certainly have the occasion to attend and pay my respects to lady rhea
that almost certainly will not transpire
and you teach i guess its hard to imagine that youll still be teaching here five years from now  but im sure no matter where you end up youll come running at the chance to see your adorable little golden deer again right
i dont know
who knew teach had a heart of ice too bad i can see from a mile away that youre joking how you really feel is written all over your face
probably so
ahem  that was your cue to promise everyone youll return go on set a good example teach if you promise everyone else will too
hahaha im already excited after five years well all be whoever were going to become
please professor invite captain jeralt too i want to show him how well his apprentice turns out
its settled then what do you say claude is it official
the promise is sealed that means were all obligated to keep it five years from today all of us will meet again at the monastery dont forget it teach you and i will meet here again 
running away i understand you hardly had the time to breathe in there it must be hard to be the favorite teacher at the ball poor poor professor
i am not everyones favorite 
was that a joke i find it hard to tell with you just think of all the students begging you to dance
it is difficult
so you do think youre the favorite i might have known
but where is there to run this place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance
ah  i see the goddess tower waits for you 
ah here you are are you waiting for someone
im not waiting for anyone
good i would not wish to interrupt anything
i was waiting for you
 for me well you should have summoned me earlier regardless here i am
has something happened
no nothing in particular in fact thats why i came here this place the goddess tower  it was special to my parents my father attended the officers academy himself a few years after graduating he was crowned emperor one day during a visit to the monastery he snuck into the goddess tower on a nostalgic whim and there she was my mother she had just enrolled in the academy that very year they were instantly drawn to each other love at first sight you could say it was the first time either had truly been in love  or so the story goes
their first love
yes of course as emperor my father had already married for political reasons as the empire demands many heirs he also had numerous other lovers in the end my mother settled for becoming one of his many consorts but i choose to believe there was genuine love between them heh i suppose its a silly story to cling to
its a lovely story
isnt it its a shame that the lovely stories ended after i was born for as long as i can remember my mother had already been exiled from the capital its strange something about you makes me reveal all of the things i so carefully keep concealed
who was your first true love
hmmm for some reason i feel compelled to tell you all of these things i have kept hidden i cant say the name but it was a noble who i met in the kingdom a lifetime ago
anyway  what about you its your turn to reveal some long held secret you can share a story about your past or perhaps tell me about your first love
i have no such stories
youre telling the truth i can tell hm  i wasnt even able to make you blush
please dont ask that of me
you realize that just makes me more curious than ever
sorry 
heh  no im the one who should apologize it wasnt my intention to pry im just intrigued by you and your mysterious past you have supposedly always been a mercenary but i believe there is more to your story than that  lets leave it there for today and return to the ball there must be plenty of students hoping to talk with you and to dance with you i would not wish to prevent you from mingling i cannot keep you all to myself after all
here for a tryst professor i wont interfere i shall take my leave at once farewell
just a moment
yes what is it i assume you are waiting on someone
what do you mean a tryst
you have arranged to meet someone here at the goddess tower have you not
no not at all
i see apologies for the misunderstanding then i take it you are unfamiliar with the rumors about this place
what rumors
there is an old legend that says promises made between lovers here are sure to be fulfilled if you believe in that sort of thing i would have expected you to be familiar with the story already considering how popular you are i was certain that someone had asked you here
i am not that popular
on the contrary i suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try
that is not the case
no need to sound so dejected i suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try
but thanks to their cowardice i am gifted with this opportunity to speak with you its clear you have never felt at ease around me as a result of how little trust there is between us i should get back to the ball regardless i imagine there would be quite a scene if you turned out to be lying
you dont believe me
trust is not in my nature good night
hello professor i just needed a quick break from the festivities fancy running into you here
you followed me didnt you
i beg your pardon absolutely not it is simply a coincidence the heir to the great house of aegir chasing after a woman in the dead of night the very thought of it
what a nice coincidence
yes a coincidence 
anyway seeing you here i cannot help but recall the legend of the goddess tower it is said that when a man and a woman meet here by chance on the night of the ball their paths become one the goddess blesses them and ensures a harmonious union
i heard it differently
oh you heard the legend too how was it different that the goddess is sure to grant any promises made here ah perhaps that is how it goes come to think of it
are you sure thats the legend
indeed that is how it goes or at least that is the version i heard
how long have we known each other now about nine months by my count the passage of time is swift indeed listen i need to tell you something after i graduate i must pass stern judgement on my father his greed got the better of him he has strayed far from the righteous path as the next duke aegir i will succeed him as prime minister and it will fall to me to hold him accountable only then can i justly guide the empires subjects and work to create a better world that is my dream my will and my future i pray that i will have the courage to fulfill my solemn duty and that i will have your support
of course im with you
im always happy to listen
thank you knowing that you are on my side i feel unstoppable well shall we head back plenty of people must be wonder where you went specifically the legions of men who would like to dance with you to be honest i count myself among them
professor youre late
what do you mean
to tell the truth it was an act of sheer hope that i might find you here
we didnt have plans to meet
true but a young man can hope to accidentally bump into someone
oh sorry
my apologies professor it was a bit of a joke ive been waiting here because i thought you might come by
im glad to find i was right i hoped to find you so i might ask  well i would very much like to research your crest
not right now
does that mean you might be interested eventually lets decide the place and time right now then what is that not acceptable
why would i let you do that
because it would be terribly interesting
anyway  have you heard the legend of this place professor its a sentimental one to be sure the story goes that if two people share a vow at the goddess tower theyll be bound together forever hm or was it that theyll be cursed forever one or the other for certain all the same i think its a rather lovely legend
it doesnt sound that lovely to me
tell me more
well i suppose it does depend on your enjoyment of potentially mistranslated myths professor be warned this may seem forward of me  however lets vow that one day i will be allowed to research your crest as much as i please
i think not
excuse me
ive overstepped my bounds again havent i its just that today is such a special day and well i suppose i got caught up in all the excitement how about this instead lets agree to meet here again one day just the two of us
if the opportunity arises
such an opportunity wont just arise we have to make it happen for ourselves i look forward to that day
i agree
i look forward to that day i really do 
hey professor i was looking all over for you what are you doing up here i think this place is supposed to be off limits 
i didnt know
well thats the official rule i dont think anyone follows it though
if its only supposed to be 
heh good point no one follows that rule anyway and i heard no one from the monastery really cares
where did you hear that
huh i cant remember her name it was just some girl who started talking to me last night she was trying to get me to leave the ball tonight and go to the goddess tower with her she wouldnt say what she wanted to do here though said it was a secret or something i told her id be too busy dancing and stuffing my face with food so she left dont know why but she didnt seem too happy about it i guess i was curious though so i came to check it out thats when i saw you walking this way so i followed you in
thats just awful
isnt it she wouldnt explain herself and she got angry
i was referring to you
i cant help but feel sympathetic
i appreciate that but im not really looking for sympathy i just wish she wouldve explained herself before getting all angry
my sympathy was not for you
huh why well its all over now cant change whats in the past
i like your positive attitude
thanks i had a feeling youd get it
maybe you should worry about the past a little
ugh really i just dont like to dwell  but if you say so i could keep it in mind
anyway im going to head back to the ball you coming doesnt look like theres anything too exciting going on here
lets head back
maybe coming to the tower wasnt a total waste of time i got to talk to you at least right
im going to stay
all right dont stay too long though you might catch cold
welp im starting to get hungry again time to fill up on some more food
 ah wh whats that ghost is it a ghost dont eat me
calm down its ok
itll eat the skin right off my bones and no one will ever  huh oh its you professor what a relief
its just your professor
i knew it i said bernie this place is haunted youll just get eaten by the ghost of some dusty old professor or  oh oh its you
you can relax now
right im better now thanks but try not to scare me like that again please  with the ball happening tonight i was sure there wouldnt be anyone here and from far off you look  well you kinda have a spooky silhouette i guess you havent heard the legend
legend
oh so if a couple swears a vow on the night of the ball the goddess grants their wish thats amazing is it true i guess thats the sort of thing you miss when you spend all your time avoiding people but wouldnt it be nice to spend some time alone with a nice guy in this lonely tower cut off from all the rest of the world anyway  oh professor since youre here and all could i ask you for a favor as you probably know by now its my lifelong dream to live in solitude forever  so could you help me to swear that vow
nice try
saw right through me huh
i cant promise that
guess youre right it probably wouldnt work out so well for me would it
ah well no use complaining actually im happy i got to see you here tonight even if it was just by coincidence would you mind staying a little longer its nice and quiet and the skys really pretty i quite like the atmosphere on a night like this being out in the open doesnt seem so bad 
ah professor you showed up
why are you here
um im the one who called you here remember
why do you look so happy
well because youre here of course
you came here because you read the letter i sent you right
not that i recall 
what letter
are you saying this is a coincidence how disappointing to think you didnt come here specifically to see me still if were meeting by complete chance  that has a certain appeal too its as if destiny brought us together and tonight is the night of the ball  lucky me
what are you plotting
plotting thats a bit rude dont you think
i thought you werent comfortable around me 
oh thats just when youre looking through me in front of others when its just us i kind of like it
originally i wanted to see what youd do when you read my letter i just wanted to see if youd come here like i asked i had a feeling that you would though i suppose you didnt even read the letter to begin with  i should just be thankful i wasnt left here waiting all alone forever do you know its been almost nine whole moons since you arrived at garreg mach you must have found a special someone by now havent you professor
i have
ooh who could it be youve made me so curious oh dont worry im not going to pry if you dont want to share your private life is private after all
i have not
uh huh right i bet youre just hiding it theres someone youre sweet on  dont you worry i wont pry if you dont want to share these things are private after all
is that what you wanted to talk about
are you changing the subject dont do that ohh i bet that means you do have someone dont you dont you worry i wont pry if you dont want to share these things are private after all
well i oughta get going  i wouldnt want to be in the way if your special someone shows up either way i do hope youll share a dance with me later
professor what is bringing you here is the ball not enjoyable
i had to escape
escape i thought the ball was for dancing not fighting  oh escape meaning to leave i have understanding
i wanted to see you
but you are seeing me every day why would you be wanting to see me now maybe you and i share a reason for being here 
im lost
lost but this monastery is where our home is  i am not understanding
i have been hearing about a legend about the goddess tower people have a belief that the goddess watches this place on this night if you share a promise the goddess will make that promise become true that makes men and women who are close come to this place on this night i am wanting to see that and so i came to observe with secrecy but no one is here i have much disappointment
i wanted to see that too
someone might arrive still we could go find a hiding spot for both of us we may have to be squished with each other but i will not be worried if you are not
you shouldnt spy on people
yes that has truth i will be thinking about that from now on
oh i have a realization if someone sees us here with each other they will think that we are with each other that is not accepting acceptable for people to misunderstand
that could be a problem
we should be returning to the ball separately
i wouldnt mind
is that ok professor i think we are agreeing on that maybe we should be returning to the ball  with each other
its quiet here isnt it professor that reminds me do you know the legend associated with the goddess tower
ive heard it
is that right you dont strike me as the sort to enjoy stories like that
im not concerned with such things
just as expected
they say that wishes made in this tower will come true i wonder who came up with such a silly notion
you dont believe it
legends are legends nothing more i doubt there are many who really believe that wishes can be granted the goddess just watches over us from above  that is all no matter how hard someone begs to be saved she would never so much as offer her hand and even if she did we lack the means to reach out and grasp it thats how i feel about her in any case  i suppose theres no harm in passing the time with silly legends what do you say professor care to make a wish we are here on the night of the ball why dont you try wishing for something
after you
i cant think of anything so go ahead
a wish of my own  i suppose my wish is for a world in which no one would ever be unjustly taken from us or something along those lines
thats a great wish
ill wish for the same
thank you professor although at a time like this  perhaps it would make more sense for me to wish that well be together forever what do you think
 
  haha well now professor you must admit ive improved in the art of joke telling
thats cruel
it didnt sound like a joke
im sorry  i guess that was rather thoughtless of me   honestly  i do regret saying such a thing please think nothing of it ive blurted out irresponsible things like that to my classmates promises that well see each other again and the like i have no business making such promises for the future there are certain things that i must accomplish even if it means risking my life i may not even have a future to promise to someone
 
we should head back soon its rude of me to keep you all to myself shall we professor
what are you doing here
i could ask you the same
i needed some quiet
i felt similarly
though i elected to attend this ball i did not know what to do with myself once there i do not wish to be a nuisance to his highness or to my classmates thus i have sought solitude i noticed a number of people looking for you however should you not return to the festivities
id like to stay here a bit longer
not just yet
as you wish
 
 
the stars seem brighter here somehow i have heard the goddess of fódlan grants a special blessing at this tower the blessing ensures that any oath sworn between man and woman here shall be fulfilled that is what i have heard we had similar legends in duscur some elements of human culture are universal i suppose is there an oath you would like to swear
not that i can think of
i understand
i swear to work toward peace for fódlan
i am not sure that a full and lasting peace is possible
but while i have this opportunity permit me to swear an oath to you i swear that we will look upon these same stars again when his highness has led us to a more tranquil age
that is a worthy oath
i look forward to it
good there is a chill in the air is there not i am accustomed to cold weather but you should go back indoors
lets go back together
if you wish i suppose the damage to your reputation for being seen with me has already been done
will you share a dance with me
i do not know how to dance if you wish to teach me then i will endeavor to learn
let us return if the cold is too much i will lend you my coat
oh look who it is
what are you doing here
i just wanted some quiet its so loud i needed a little respite
are you waiting for someone
no i just wanted a bit of quiet
besides what are you doing here
i thought i might find you here
huh you must be joking
im here for the same reason as you
ah well i guess it figures
hm have you heard the legend of the goddess tower that if you make a pledge it will be fulfilled childish i know but if it were true  lets make a pledge to the goddess i pledge that someday i will surpass you ill surpass your technique your skill with the sword and your cunning as a warrior then i will make you taste defeat
that seems extreme
thats your pledge to the goddess
what a disappointment if youre looking for a passionate affair youve got the wrong man go find someone else ive spent my life avoiding love and romance theyre distractions blades blood and battle thats what im made of and nothing else if someone saw us however this may look like an amorous meeting youll have to settle for being mistaken as my lover
thats mean
what nonsense
its time i went back to training ill always be more comfortable holding a sword than a womans hand try not to catch a cold up here id hate for such a good sparring partner to be out of commission good bye
professor did you come up here for a rest too
thats right
i guess we think along the same lines i was feeling kind of worn out
actually i was looking for you
for me oh im so sorry to put you out of your way i was just kind of worn out from all of the excitement i am enjoying the ball but its a bit much you know
everyone else seems used to this kind of thing but ive never been to anything like it before my friends did teach me a bit about proper manners and how to dance but i still feel out of place stepping on girls feet messing up the pretty floral decorations  haha ive been a bit of a disaster sometimes i wonder if its even right for someone like me to be in a place like this
i feel that way sometimes too
really you do thats kind of reassuring
you have every right to be here
youre right of course im a student at the officers academy just like everyone else lonato was kind enough to send me here i need to live up to his expectations
by the way have you heard the stories about the goddess tower they say that if a man and a woman make a wish together here the goddess will make it come true
what would you wish for
oh never mind me id like to know what youd wish for
lets make a wish together then
my thoughts exactly do you have anything in particular youd like to wish for
my wish is 
your wish is
for your wish to come true ashe
what my wish w well um let me think
i cant think of anything
well if you cant come up with anything maybe i should think of a wish instead
all right ive got it i wish for my brother and sister back home to be able to live out their lives in peace
thats just like you
thats a lovely wish
this kind of thing is pretty embarrassing huh maybe i should be heading back ill never get better at fancy social events like this if i keep running away from them right i guess i should ask another girl to dance oh but id better make sure i go over the steps again first
you could dance with me
really youd do that wow thatd be great just promise not to laugh if i mess it up ok come on lets head back
evening professor lovely night isnt it just look at those stars  i heard you were headed over to the goddess tower and i got curious about who you might be meeting but here you are all by yourself this isnt a lovers tryst at all heh heh 
tryst
oh yeah the goddess tower is where lovers meet didnt anybody tell you they say that if you exchange vows here they always come true its a sacred place for lovers
why are you here alone
where is your lover
well the person im interested in is already here youre here alone im here alone i was thinking maybe 
wait me
well of course were the only two people here arent we i keep thinking about it and it just makes sense my crest and yours 
thats too much too soon
marry you i cant even trust you
heh ok true true you know ive never regretted any of my past behavior until you turned me down just now i cant be who ive been my whole life i gotta get it together and become a man you can trust i know that sounds like another one of my games but its true ill prove it to you anyway im going to head back to the ball since were both here would you accompany me
ill go back with you
well then my lady i do hope youll give me the honor of a dance it will be good practice for our first dance at our wedding reception heh heh im kidding
im going to stay here for awhile
its chilly out tonight so take care not to catch cold and if you do get cold you know where to find me sorry old habits die hard i guess  ok well im headed inside
anyway  lets get going before you change your mind
why professor i was wondering where you ran off to i searched the entire floor but couldnt find you anywhere tired are we i can tell by that look on your face it must be exhausting being so popular huh
im exhausted 
i can imagine shall we take a break here then say professor have you heard the legend of the goddess tower they say that if two people exchange a vow here the goddess herself will fulfill it
ive never heard that before
well that simply wont do youll fall behind if you cant keep up with your students
i think i recall such a story
ah so even you have heard that one the stories must travel far
many young couples come here in private all thanks to that legend they make promises to stay together forever things like that i actually saw a man invite a lady to join him at the tower while on my way here its rather romantic dont you think
i think so
indeed
i disagree
really youre a strange one professor
though just because two people share a promise that doesnt guarantee theyll be together forever youve noticed many nobles at the academy right they very rarely have the freedom to choose their own partners yet still they wish to stay together maybe thats why they pray to the goddess are you waiting on anyone professor
no theres no one
what a relief i was afraid that i was keeping you
i was waiting for you
oh my even though we didnt make plans to meet youre a charmer arent you
ah i almost forgot why i came looking for you i was wondering if youd like to dance with me its just so loud in the reception hall though i think id rather stay here with you  if thats all right with you professor thank you i appreciate it
professor im happy to see you here everybodys been asking about you youre really popular with the students
i had to escape
im worn out
oh really huh uh actually ive been trying to find you too but if youre not interested in dancing thats ok we are supposed to be at a ball thought  if youre not going to dance tonight when and where will you get another chance
here
now
wait really there isnt any music  but this is too special to pass up maybe i could sing a little something i may not look like it but im a practiced singer though people do tend to think my lyrics are a little odd ♪ fry the food it tastes so good  it fills up our hungry tummies  ♪
now im hungry
what an interesting song
its about this yummy stew one of the monks taught me to make a while back oh i know ill make it for you it really is just about the tastiest thing in the world um  if im bothering you please tell me now and ill leave you alone
 
say professor  did you know that if you make a wish here at the goddess tower it will for sure come true thats why people usually meet up with someone they like here for a rendezvous and they make a wish that theyll stay together forever so  uh i thought you might be waiting for a girl here and that im messing it up
ive never heard about that tradition
nothing of the sort
hehe thats just what id expect you to say but since were already here lets go ahead and made a wish together
what kind of wish
sure
ive already decided what it will be dearest goddess  i wish for the professor and i to always be the best of friends hows that sound can we wish for that
id be happy to
really that makes me so happy
its a little embarrassing 
oh no actually when i said it aloud i could tell it was an embarrassing wish  oops
well id better be going now and you should think about returning to the ball too but make sure you save me a dance
whew i cant manage one more bite so full  so full
oh professor what do you think youre doing here i came here to stuff my fa i mean to have some me time
i sort of followed you 
you mean you saw that just now all the food everything ugh so embarrassing  maybe theres a nearby rock i can crawl under
no reason really
oh so were just running into one another by chance then phew if you had followed me here id be a little bothered and probably embarrassed
were you waiting for someone
who me no no of course not i was just about to walk off all that food i just ate really i came here to have some privacy but youre here now so i suppose that makes it a bit less private
are you worried people may get the wrong idea
i suppose theres that possibility now that you mention it
just the two of us 
uh well yes i suppose its just us here 
does that concern you too professor im happy to return to the reception hall
its not terribly concerning really
of course nothing to see here im happy to keep walking off this food in that case ah the stars certainly are beautiful tonight hm its peaceful looking up at them together dont you think maybe we can do it again sometime
id love to come along
if we return from here together i worry that people would start unsavory rumors about us i dont concern myself with gossip but id hate for it to mar your reputation in any way are you certain fair enough lets head back then
oh hey teach what brings you to the goddess tower you know what never mind the answer is as clear as day you couldnt bear the ball anymore and simply had to escape
i wouldnt say that 
i just needed a break
theres nothing wrong with admitting youre not comfortable in a noisy crowd really i get it im the same way
i dont believe it
ha see right through me do you but i really do mean it parties arent for me music and fun are all well and good but those dances the nobles do are something else i was never really taught to do that sort of thing my upbringing was lacking in certain ways
even though youre from a noble family
even though youre heir to the alliance
even so i may have secured a fancy new title but who i am on the inside  well status alone cant change that thats a bit of an aside though say teach  have you heard the legends about this tower they say if a man and a woman pray for the same thing here on this night the goddess will grant their wish without fail
why tonight
who knows maybe it has something to do with celebrating the anniversary of the monasterys completion maybe the goddess comes down from above on this night and this night alone to celebrate with us even goddesses like to party right the truth is that its just a legend the students here like to tell its not based on any real facts but i suppose it would be a waste to pass up a chance of having our wish granted what do you say teach care to try
what would we pray for
hm  lets see  how about we pray for our ambitions to come true you dont exactly seem like the selfish type but even you must have an ambition or two
i do
i do not
more of a hope 
thats what i thought its the same for everyone
even if youre not aware of it im sure theres something your heart of hearts wishes for
thats what i thought its the same for everyone
no one is ever completely satisfied everyone has something they long for otherwise whats the point of it all of course same goes for me without even realizing it i found myself holding tight to some pretty big ambitions if you would  i would love for you to share in those ambitions with me teach
but all that aside lets get started lets pray to the goddess before she tuckers out for the evening ok  here goes oh divine goddess hear our prayers we beseech you and your radiance please grant us that which we seek
huh i think that should do it the goddessll make our dreams come true now yeah
i wonder
at any rate weve done all we can whether we actually believe our dreams will come true or not is up to us
i suppose we should head back soon im sure everyone is looking for you just promise to spare a dance for me ok teach i swear so long as its not one of those goofy noble dances i am a treasure on the dance floor
ah there you are professor i didnt see you at the ball i was wondering where youd slipped off to everyone is waiting for you shouldnt you be heading back
momentarily
no id like to stay here
well theres no need to hurry the ball will continue a while longer was the noise becoming too much it must be difficult if you are unaccustomed to high society i say that but im actually the same after a while of excitement i yearn for peace and quiet
did someone turn you down
professor rude just what do you think of me there are definitely students in there making the most of things flirting as if their very lives depended on it but for a catch such as myself every day is an opportunity theres no need to appear desperate still its unexpected that the two of us would be here together isnt it
why is that
do you not know the legend of this place the goddess is said to grant a special kind of blessing unique to the day of this ball it is said that on this day she will honor any vow sworn between man and woman here at this tower its a famous legend amongst the students which may be why i expected to find more of them here
so you came here to spy on people
of course not i would never stoop to such despicable behavior honestly i forgot all about the legend until now im not interested in that sort of foolishness though i suppose it couldnt hurt to test it even if it is only a legend what do you say professor shall we swear some sort of vow together something that will benefit the both of us what dream should we promise to make a reality
peace for all
happiness for the two of us
thats very fitting i will remember that we made this vow here today well i should head back lest by my absence the festivities lose their luster
 omm  mmm  mmm  huh whos there
p professor is the ball over already what uh  what are you doing here
just taking a break
ah a break sure sure thats uh  thats what im doing too
i heard a strange noise
strange noise no need to worry ill uh  ill look into it for you
huh i suddenly have the energy to dance maybe ill head back to the ball
what were you eating
ah you noticed it was just some meat it was a much nicer cut than im used to we all got one helping but some people didnt want theirs can you believe it i hate to see good food go to waste im sorry professor
you should be
you need to follow the rules
youre right i know  oh by the way i heard something on my way here i heard that if two people make a wish together in this tower on this night the goddess will grant it
two people
i dont know the specifics just that you cant do it alone there has to be two of you since were both here now lets make a wish together what should we wish for more delicious cuts of meat
no then how about bigger muscles
what else is there to wish for hm me becoming a proper knight but thats just for me not you 
we can wish for that
we can professor thats so generous of you
now that we wished for it im sure ill become a proper knight
lets wish for peace in fódlan
peace in fódlan thats a good wish too
i really hope our wish comes true
 
gah is that you goddess professor ah im sorry i thought you were the goddess
thats ridiculous
youre right youre right imagine if she just appeared out of nowhere do you know of that old legend professor
old legend
yes its said that if a man and a woman make a vow tonight at the goddess tower  she will appear before them and bless them ensuring that vows fulfillment
ridiculous
i know but can you imagine if she just appeared out of nowhere still  maybe even if we cant see her we can sense her presence i envision the goddess as the most beautiful creature in the world  more beautiful than any landscape any artwork utterly beyond compare thats what i think anyway or perhaps what i hope since i first heard that legend ive wanted to try it and perhaps meet the goddess
but if the legends true 
yes i know what youre getting at she would never appear before a single person frankly i didnt know any girls well enough to invite them here so i was hoping a couple would come along and i could sneak a peek  wait that came out wrong i take that back i have absolutely no intention of peeking
shall we make a vow
what you and me i suppose we do fit the criteria but are you certain you would want to do that
in that case lets try it what should our vow be please pick whatever sounds best to you
peace for fódlan
of course might be a little ambitious but lets give it a try
happiness for all
of course might be a little ambitious but lets give it a try
may you live your life honestly
oh oh i see yes thats a wonderful vow
now let us pray
 
did you feel that i think the goddess is near
still ridiculous
youre right of course
professor
yes
i saw you wandering off to this tower i thought you might be lost or something so i followed you inside
actually im a ghost
dont toy with me like that professor i know its you i figured you might be lost or something so i followed you inside
everyone seems to be looking for you youre surprisingly popular
that surprises you does it
i do find it surprising yes particularly your popularity with the ladies
naturally
despite your confidence im still surprised by your popularity with the ladies
it isnt like youre very sociable after all not to be rude mind you
how do you fare in such matters
er i wouldnt know to be honest i have no interest in such things the academy is for honing ones skills not for frivolous romances despite what the other students may think i overheard them gossiping about a place where a man and a woman can make a vow and it is certain it will come to pass seems to be some folktale they enjoy i wonder where this place is 
the goddess tower
oh of course i recall now its  wait thats  thats here isnt it uh just to be clear this is pure coincidence i didnt follow you for for that but we are here alone so people may wonder what our aim is lets get out of here before someone sees us and gets the wrong idea
theres no need for panic
are you saying you dont mind if someone sees us and thinks  oh i suppose you believe theres no danger of that since its just me youre treating me like a child arent you well i dont mind either then obviously theres nothing going on here if youre going stick to around until we collect dust then so will i
 
actually im gonna go now dont you stay too long either youll catch your death of cold out here
please be patient ill be done with my prayer in a moment  dear goddess i beg thee  oh professor
is someone else here
no  im the only one here umm  well more accurately im the only human present my bird friend is here as well
youre talking to a bird
no well its more like the bird is doing me a favor they say if a man and a woman pray here on this night their wish will come true at least thats how the legend goes
and the bird
its a pigeon a male pigeon at least i think so i thought he might count as a man
 
 
well id better be leaving it seems my pigeon friend got impatient and flew away
im sorry 
no its fine the goddess probably wouldnt accept a male pigeon anyway
ill take his place
oh um are you saying youll pray with me professor
 
thank you if you have a wish for the future lets pray for it ok
what is your wish
who me oh nothing in particular lets pray for your wish there must be something you want well
peace in fódlan
very well let us pray
only to see you smile
hey no need to tease me 
professor i must be going now but im glad i ran into you
professor youre not waiting for anyone right thought so i bet youve never heard the legend about this tower then
i havent 
what legend
something special happens here during the ethereal moon on the night of the ball first an unmarried boy and girl need to meet at the goddess tower and make a vow then the goddess will grant them divine protection and ensure that their vow comes true or so they say its a well known story among the students a couple guys invited me up here but 
you turned them down
yes i did
they stood you up
no how rude i turned them down
if i accepted their invitations then our vow would come true its just a legend sure but i prefer to be cautious about such things one of the guys was pretty handsome and he came from a good family  but that doesnt really tell you what a persons like on the inside i want a life partner whos good hearted and good looking anyway i went for a walk and happened upon you and i thought  the professors perfect why dont i just make a vow with him hah im just kidding professor to be honest i wanted to spy on you see if you had someone else up here although if you did want to make a vow with me i wouldnt object need some time to consider
yes lets revisit this tomorrow morning
hang on it wont mean anything tomorrow oh i get it everyones looking for you down there girls included you dont want to keep them waiting youre pretty smooth you know that well im off then ill see you at the ball ah  did the goddess hear that conversation
hey professor you all alone here i mean youre not waiting for anyone or anything are you
actually im meeting the archbishop
liar i saw lady rhea just moments ago she was in the reception hall
manuela should be here any moment
yeah right i just passed her flirting with some guy on my way up
anyway i saw you heading to the tower so i thought id drop by i figured you might be lonely
you figured that did you
hey dont make it weird by the way  have you heard the legend about this place they say if a guy and a girl make a promise here together the goddess will make sure its kept
ive heard
its a pretty well known legend
i had not heard that
really its a pretty well known legend
thing is the way the story goes it doesnt work all the time it has to be the night of the ball tonight so since its just you and me here what do you say we give it a go i mean i dont know if the goddess will really take the time for a pair like us but its worth a try
what are you suggesting
well you know lets make some kind of promise weve got the chance itd be a shame to waste it i mean not something romantic or anything thatd be weird we could promise ill become a top tier mercenary though i guess thats more of a wish  lets see  ok ive got it i solemnly swear to meet you once more on this very ground as a mercenary beyond compare oh but that was all about me no fair you probably have something you want to promise too
no i think that covers it
hah you really do take after captain jeralt always putting others first all right then goddess you heard the promise its a done deal say professor why did you come out here anyway
i just wanted some time alone
ah well it is pretty crowded down there i guess i shouldnt have interrupted ill leave you to it but dont stay out here too long all right youll catch a cold
professor is that you over there it seems both of us were curious about this place
what are you talking about
oh perhaps i was mistaken i figured you had come to this tower after having heard the legend
what legend
youve not heard of it then i suppose i only recently learned of it myself from a friend legend tells that on the night of a ball when a man and woman pledge vows at this very tower  the goddess will bestow her blessing ensuring those vows come to pass of course such things do not really come to pass but there are many who place stock in this legend i wondered what sort of vows youths tend to pledge  so here i am hoping to gain deeper understanding only to bump into you are you meeting someone here perchance
no im not
thats unfortunate i wonder if anyone else will be coming  professor if the legend were true what type of vow might you pledge
its hard to say 
no ideas perhaps your imagination is lacking due to the lack of a partner what say you to being my partner how about sharing a vow with me ill give you until the count of three to come up with something heartfelt and honorable one two three go ahead
may we always be together
may we both find joy
oh you made my heart flutter i see this is the type of vow one would make to another youve taught me well as a professor should im most certainly wiser and more mature than i was even just moments ago oh dear what if the goddess really did hear your vow although i suppose i would not mind if that turned out to be the case i bid you good evening
running away i understand you hardly had the time to breathe in there it must be hard to be the favourite teacher at the ball poor poor professor
i am not everyones favorite 
was that a joke i find it hard to tell with you just think of all the students begging you to dance
it is difficult
so you do think youre the favorite i might have known
professor what are you doing here
arent you going to dance with edelgard
no i should think not
arent you going to dance with claude
haha good one professor i could see saving a dance for edelgard but claude is another story in any case i have no intention of dancing with anyone
as a child edelgard taught me how to dance it was a bit awkward honestly
edelgard
as a child
ive told you before were siblings by marriage havent i her birth mother was my stepmother although i didnt know that at the time my stepmother treated me with such kindness just as though i were her own flesh and blood and yet she never so much as hinted that she had her own child edelgard we were born and raised in different territories without ever knowing the other even existed yet against all odds for just over a year we became childhood friends
friends
not siblings
indeed unaware of each others stations or backgrounds we met and became incredibly close this was when she and lord arundel were living in the kingdom
why were they in the kingdom
they were in exile  this was a time of great turmoil within the empire i ran into her when visiting lord arundels residence with my father she seemed quite bored with everything at first i found her to be difficult and stubborn but that facade quickly fell away revealing her true self beneath  thats around the time when she taught me how to dance her instruction was  oh lets call it strict to put it nicely
wrong foot dimitri youre supposed to lead with your right
el the suns going down i really oughta be heading home 
that one year before she had to return to the empire was so much fun the time of my life in many ways
its kind of pathetic to think about it all these years later but can you guess what i gave her as a parting gift
flowers
a book
no that makes too much sense actually i gave her a dagger you should have seen the look on her face
a dagger
huh good guess professor but i swear it came from the heart
in faerghus weve long considered blades as tools of destiny as a way to cut a path to a better future she was being dragged all over unable to live the life she wanted i thought the dagger could help her cut out a path to the future she dreamed of however that was many years ago im sure shes forgotten all about the boy i was back then
im afraid its far too late for that things are different now shes different im different  anyway  im feeling a bit out of place here festivities like this dont suit me
professor  will you join me for a bit you must be getting a bit tired of the ball by now
but where is there to run this place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance
it seems that everyone is having a delightful time will you not dance some more
im tired
id rather not
how dull of you had i a body of my own  oh i would sing and dance until i fell upon the ground but you  hmph do as you will
ah youre not the only one who feels that way look over there
 
hmph im bored beyond compare will you not follow her
why would i
i have no reason to
oh come on hurry up i know that you are curious to see what she is up to  i hear someone singing from other there

that song  i feel i have heard it in the past  actually  it is not that i have heard it i  did i once sing that song to someone no theres more i wrote this song  oh but how could that be so if that were true then how could she be singing it unless  no no i am suddenly so exhausted  as are you no doubt quickly then to bed with you
captain captain where are you hey professor have you seen your old man
too bad i guess it will have to be you then 
im back sorry for the delay my last mission took longer than expected
captain thank goodness youre here there are reports of demonic beasts near the chapel
nonsense i havent heard anything about the monasterys walls being breached
thats why im heading there now to see whats really going on youll join as well wont you
of course were both sworn to protect this place
where did they come from
demonic beasts
its odd just before they appeared someone saw a number of students heading toward the chapel they were apparently acting strange as though they werent in their right minds shortly after demonic beasts started to appear one after the other
are the students safe
were the students killed
hm  the students  theres no way those demonic beasts got in from the outside  but none of that matters right now we need to act go summon your students
damn it  i wanted to talk to you about something important but theres no time theres never any damn time but this is much more urgent so it can hold for now ill meet you there
things take a turn for the worse as you and jeralt investigate an abandoned chapel in garreg mach
there really are demonic beasts here  theyre emerging from the chapel ill head that way the rest of you protect the students who werent able to get away
help me these beasts  theyre 
argh somebody help me
that beast  theres a stone or something on its forehead 
 
do you really think you can keep going dont push yourself too hard thinking about what happened in remire village its clear youve gotten the hang of being a leader maybe you should have taken command of me too
 
the demonic beasts were actually students how can this be 
thank you but my friends who couldnt get away  are they ok
i was so scared  ill find a way to repay you i promise
sorry that was a close one 
phew  you saved me thank you
there isnt a trace of evidence to be found in the chapel this must have been something to do with remire perhaps 
wait
huh another student
run along now
thanks for all your help sir
youre just a pathetic old man how dare you get in the way of my brilliant plan you dog
run along now
thanks for all your help sir
huh what are you doing here
you must survive merely because there is a role that i require you to fulfill
sorry it looks like im going to have to leave you now
to think that the first time i saw you cry your tears would be for me its sad and yet im happy for it thank you kid
so this is where your father lived  hm are you still crying if turning back the hands of time was not enough to save his life you must accept what came to pass was fate
it wasnt fate
control yourself though jeralts death was at the hands of wicked ones a fate is still a fate
our enemies will pay
agreed we cannot let the wicked ones run free
oh your father said to look for something here he must be referring to whatever is behind that bookcase there 
your fathers diary  huh his handwriting is prettier than his face would suggest well well these entries here are from before your birth he seems to have been writing this for quite some time hm ah  read that part there horsebow moon year 1159 
day 20 of the horsebow moon all is cloudy i cant believe shes dead lady rhea said she died during childbirth but is that the truth and still the child she traded her life for doesnt make a sound didnt even cry at birth
well now that baby must be you that means  hm someone is approaching us
there you are lady rhea is looking for you professor and after your audience why dont you join me at the dining hall you havent eaten since since it happened have you
 
forgive me  i suppose its too soon to try and coax you back into the normal swing of things as for what happened to jeralt  im so sorry im sorry i couldnt do anything to stop it stay here until youve found some peace ill cover for you with lady rhea and everyone else
thank you
well be waiting for you whenever youre ready to return to us
if only
no need to put on a brave face no one would blame you for taking time for yourself
i dont believe its a sign of strength to just keep going forward no matter what taking the time to grieve for those weve lost theres strength in that too thats what i think anyway that said  its also important to remember that no matter how sad you are eventually your tears will dry up thats when you have to figure out what it is youre living for then you can cling to that with all your might and start moving forward again
what im living for
four years ago in duscur i experienced the same pain youre feeling now my father was the strongest man i knew someone i loved and admired deeply that day he was killed before my eyes his head severed clean off my stepmother the kindest person i had ever known left me behind and disappeared into the infernal flames
everyone who i considered precious my family and my closest friends i couldnt save any of them not a single one now the burden of the work they left behind falls on me i must ensure they have no regrets thats my duty as the sole survivor of the tragedy its a heavy burden but accepting it gave me the strength to pick myself up off the ground and start moving again start living again
jeralt is gone  so what will you do now professor what must you do look deep in your heart and im certain youll find the answer there indelible and inescapable
ive probably bothered you enough for today but i have just one more thought to leave you with even now seteth is gathering the knights to begin a full scale search for the enemy it may not be right away but before long they will find their trail
no matter what happens or what anyone may say know that i plan to stand by you professor through anything until the bitter end
well did you search deep within yourself as he suggested and did you find yourself some answers this book is filled with secrets yet unknown we must return another time to read the rest oh but i have at least figured one thing out i know now why our fates are intertwined 
ah  here you are to think that captain  that jeralt would meet his end like that i hope you know that you were the most important thing in the world to him
i was
what do you want
he wasnt the most emotional guy im sure expressing his affection wouldnt have come naturally to him after whats happened its up to me now i alois swear to protect you in the captains stead  sorry this isnt the time for my blathering lady rhea is looking for you i came to tell you that ill take my leave now
this book is filled with secrets yet unknown we must return another time to read the rest oh but i have at least figured one thing out i know now why our fates are intertwined 
professor i have been waiting for you i am filled with grief at the loss of our most celebrated knight jeralt was an ally of many years and also a dear friend
many years
when did you meet
it was a long while back at the time jeralt was a soldier of the kingdom he was injured in battle and i saved him just as he was about to perish that was our first meeting after that he became a knight of seiros he gave his all to the service of the church
why did he leave the knights
but it had been so long since you last saw him 
he fell in love with one of the nuns here at garreg mach their love produced a child whom she died giving birth to it was her decision she weighed her own life against that of her childs and in the end implored me to save the child your father never truly accepted that decision he took the child took you and disappeared without warning
who was my mother
did i inherit my crest from my mother
your mother she was my 
sorry for the interruption lady rhea theres something you must hear immediately a report from the knights patrolling the area 
very well professor you are dismissed for the day please rest and focus only on mending your heart understood
/***EOF***/
huh
lady seiros
tell me nemesis do you recall the red canyon
youll die for that die die you took everything  that i loved
hes gone now mother 
oh my what could have brought you here
i wonder how you got in here  it is most rude to interrupt a moment of repose very rude indeed now come to me i wish to have a look at you
hmm  i have not seen the likes of you before who are you anyway
im a ghost
do not deceive you would do well to keep your wit in line
im a demon
do not deceive you would do well to keep your wit in line
im a mortal
i see then you must have a name of sorts go on
huh i shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names you must possess a day of birth as well beneath which moon and on what day were you born to this world
well wonders never cease it seems we share our day of birth how strange hmm it all feels so familiar i think it may be time for yet another nap  it is almost time to begin 
hey time to wake up
were you having that dream again
i was dreaming about a war 
massive armies clashing on a vast field right there hasnt been a battle like that in over three centuries 
i was dreaming about a young girl 
youve described her to me before i dont think ive ever met anyone like that
in any case just put that out of your mind for now the battlefield is no place for idle thoughts risking your life is part of the job for mercenaries like us letting your mind wander is a sure way to get yourself killed
ok time to get moving our next job is in the kingdom i told you before its far from here so well need to leave at dawn
oh right 
of course
hm good grief everyone is already waiting for us outside
jeralt sir sorry to barge in but your presence is needed
whats happened
please forgive our intrusion we wouldnt bother you were the situation not dire
what do a bunch of kids like you want at this hour
were being pursued by a group of bandits i can only hope that you will be so kind as to lend your support
bandits here
its true they attacked us while we were at rest in our camp
weve been separated from our companions and were outnumbered theyre after our lives not to mention our gold
im impressed youre staying so calm considering the situation i  wait that uniform 
bandits spotted just outside the village damn  there are a lot of them
i guess they followed you all the way here we cant abandon this village now come on lets move hope youre ready
lets take care of those thieves before they overrun the village take down the enemies in front first that should take the wind out of their sails
you have a strange aura about you  you say youre a mercenary so show me what you can do
thank you we are in your debt it wouldnt do for us to fall in a place like this please lend us your strength lets work together to drive out these thieves
its because of you guys that im not dead right now thanks for that i didnt expect to run into mercenaries like you in some remote village the gods of fortune must be smiling on me
well advance while protecting ourselves from the enemy take up position inside the forest
yes good if were in the forest we can sustain their attacks without losing the advantage
this is a fine opportunity use the combat arts i taught you
attack when an ally is nearby and the enemy will be intimidated making them easier to hit
damn why are there mercenaries in the village guess well have to deal with them too
im gonna kill you where you stand 
what the arent you jeralt the blade breaker whats a renowned mercenary like you doing here
im the one who should be complaining im caught up in the mess you started
hey you with the blank stare outta my way
youll die
honestly what are you accomplishing with that little stunt its like youre trying to get me killed you fool
well its fine after all if you dont know the value of your own life youre not going to protect it very well are you course not  well then i guess its up to me to guide you from now on right you can call me sothis but im also known as “the beginning”
hmm  sothis  yes that is it my name is sothis and i am also called the beginning but who once called me that
what are you talking about
sothis
i was not able to recall my name until just now and just like that it came to me how odd that look upon your face  did you think me a child a mere child who forgot her own name phooey that “child” just saved your life and what does that make you
i am no child
ha such arrogance you look the part but are you truly an adult
im less than a child
correct you understand
you threw yourself before an axe to save just one young girl yet all is well as i have stalled the flow of time for now you would have died had i not intervened
thank you
there now is gratitude so much to ask i did deem you worth saving after all
you stopped time
hm i do not hear your gratitude perhaps i should force you to leave  there now is gratitude so much to ask i did deem you worth saving after all
though it is only momentary time has stopped however did i manage that 
what will happen when time resumes
what now
when time begins again the axe will tear into your flesh and you will surely meet your end how rude of you to drag me into this now what to do 
turn back the hands of time
of course i must turn back the hands of time
keep time frozen until im safe
that is ridiculous oh but perhaps  of course i must turn back the hands of time
ill just stay here and wait to die
as though i could stand idly by and watch that come to pass oh but perhaps  of course i must turn back the hands of time
yes  i do believe it can be done you really are quite troublesome i cannot wind back time too far but all is well you are aware of whats to come which means you can protect yourself this time now go  yes you who bears the flames within drift through the flow of time to find the answers that you seek 
huh
youll die
hey over here
hey  did you just 
the knights of seiros are here well cut you down for terrorizing our students hey the thieves are running away go after them the students seem to be unharmed and whos this
ugh  why him
an unexpected reunion
captain jeralt it is you goodness its been ages dont you recognize me its alois your old right hand man well thats how i always thought of myself anyway it must have been 20 years ago that you went missing without a trace i always knew you were still alive
you havent changed a bit alois just as loud as ever and drop that “captain” nonsense im not your captain anymore these days im just a wandering mercenary one who has work to do good bye old friend
right  good bye captain wait that isnt how this ends i insist that you return to the monastery with me
garreg mach monastery  i suppose this was inevitable
and how about you kid are you the captains child
he is a stranger to me
great sense of humor this one clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain
im a bandit
great sense of humor this one clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain
that is correct
is that so well physical differences aside your mannerisms do remind me of the captain
id love for you to see the monastery too you will join me wont you
whats troubling you captain you arent about to run off again are you
even i wouldnt dare run from the knights of seiros
the knights of seiros  they do seem rather skilled
ah it seems your presence is required get going
i appreciate your help back there your skill is beyond question youre clearly an experienced mercenary and your father that would be jeralt the blade breaker former captain of the knights of seiros oft praised as the strongest knight to ever live have i missed anything
the knights of seiros
you havent heard of the knights of seiros the most famous order of knights in all of fódlan
i didnt know he was a captain
how curious id wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed
hey you are coming with us to the monastery right of course you are id love to bend your ear as we travel oh i should mention that the three of us are students of the officers academy at garreg mach monastery we were doing some training exercises when those bandits attacked i definitely got the worst of it
that would be because you ran off
too true i was the first to make a strategic retreat everything would have worked out if these two hadnt followed me and ruined everything because of them every single one of those bandits chased after us utterly ridiculous
ah so thats what you were thinking claude and here i thought you were acting as a decoy for the sake of us all
his intentions were as clear as day you will prove a lacking ruler if you cannot see the truth behind a persons words
hm you will prove a lacking ruler if you look for deceit behind every word and fail to trust those whom you rely on
oh joy a royal debate between their highnesses i wonder how being completely predictable affects ones ability to wield power personally as the embodiment of distrust id say your little exchange smacks of naiveté
me naïve tell me are you actually incapable of keeping quiet or is your lack of self awareness a condition of some sort
in any case forgive our digression i must speak with you if you can spare a moment the way you held your ground against the bandits leader was captivating you never lost control of the situation it showed me i still have much to learn
your skill is precisely why i must ask you to consider lending your services to the empire i might as well tell you now i am no mere student i am also the adrestian empires 
halt edelgard please allow me to finish my own proposition the holy kingdom of faerghus is in dire need of exceptional individuals such as yourself please do consider returning to the kingdom with me
whoa there you two sure are hasty trying to recruit someone you just met tactless really i was personally planning to develop a deep and lasting friendship on our journey back to the monastery before begging for favors but it seems theres no time for niceties in this world so capable stranger lets get right to it where does your allegiance lie
hmm it seems ones place of birth is quite significant to them yet they are so impressed by you that you may take your pick well
adrestian empire land of ancient history
a wise choice though the empire has fallen from its former glory the other regions are merely offshoots that pale in comparison
holy kingdom of faerghus land of noble knights
understood faerghus is a noble and distinguished kingdom that has always valued chivalry
leicester alliance burgeoning league of nobles
is that right well thats a win for the alliance so i suppose im obligated to be happy
all right thats enough with the small talk its time to head back to the monastery
looks like well have to pick this up another time
my my they are in such a hurry you know  each of the three is most unique
edelgard 
dimitri 
claude 
yes i thought the same i am so sleepy once again  i may be sleeping but i

as cold air begins to creep in from the north of faerghus fódlan welcomes the riches of fall the women spend their days reaping the golden fields gratefully embracing the bounty the goddess has once again provided the men venture into the wild with horsebows and empty sacks ready to be filled with game
as i believe you are already aware seteths younger sister flayn has gone missing at present all we know for certain is that she has not left garreg mach
flayn is not the type of person to just wander off on her own without telling me where she is going we have searched the monastery thoroughly but have found nothing i am now mobilizing the knights to begin searching the town troubling rumors have been running rampant lately i do not wish to consider the worst but 
troubling rumors
what is it youre afraid of
there are rumors of someone prowling the streets and attacking innocents night after night the knights have investigated the matter they have not discovered any remains nor have they found any concrete evidence
the people are panicked they all insist someone called the death knight is coming to claim their souls with his blade there is no way she could have escaped unscathed if she were captured by such a fiend where is she
seteth recall that impatience begets error please do your best to calm yourself i think of your sister as family as well you know that you have my support we will devote ourselves fully mind body and soul to recovering her  professor your mission for this month is to help find flayn the knights have the town covered so i ask that you focus your efforts on searching the monastery again we do not have time to waste you have your orders
flayn has gone missing most unsettling
it doesnt seem likely that shes simply gotten lost ill help in any way that i can
so our mission this month is to find her well then let us hurry and locate her before anyone else
i hope flayn is ok what would happen if  just what would we do if 
you cant think like that bern seteth would have a heart attack if he heard you
ive heard that she has a crest but i suppose for this moment that is irrelevant
well start by gathering information someone must have seen flayn recently
right if we work together im certain well find her
flayn has disappeared seteth must be beside himself
so finding little flayn is our mission for this moon leave it to me professor chasing after girls is my specialty
sylvain  even you must agree that now isnt the time for jokes
i hope flayn is ok ive heard rumors about some death knight running around town 
sounds intriguing i had been hoping to cross blades with him
felix please consider how seteth must be feeling right now
in any case we must start our search at once every moment matters on your order professor lets try to collect as much information as we can
what flayn is missing
so finding flayn is our mission for the month i take it
wait whos flayn
seteths little sister surely youve seen her flitting about the monastery
she is the girl who looks about the same age as me but seems well beyond her years
seteth is much older than flayn hes always looking out for her he must be worried sick if i were to go missing i cant imagine what that would do to my brother
when searching for someone its best to start by gathering information hopefully someone has seen flayn
im on the lookout for suspicious individuals the only place ive yet to check is the library
well go together
as you wish
get some rest
as you wish after i check the library
candlelight  and who is that
is it flayn
is it the death knight
no it isnt impossible 
professor dedue what are you up to at this hour
your highness my apologies
oh none necessary im sorry for startling you i was just doing some research but im just about finished i didnt realize how late it had gotten wed better head back to our quarters dedue until tomorrow professor
a most unusual man whatever could he have been looking for so late at night hm that book is quite askew  he must have rushed to put it back upon the shelf
 
it seems to be a record of donations from nobility arundel  thats not a name i know but look at that this arundel gave quite a sum each year  that is until the year 1174 he must have died or fallen to financial woe hmm  i cant imagine what this has to do with flayn
oh my  just one small girl whos gone astray has caused all this we cannot let this stand you must do all you can to find out wheres shes gone now ask around to see what information you can find come now no time to waste
we must begin our search for flayn professor if she ran off on her own free will thats her business but that may not be the case for her sake i suggest we assume that she was abducted and begin an investigation who benefits from kidnapping her lets gather all the information we can on anyone whos been acting strangely
manuela ran off with jeritzas mask hmm  well have to speak with both of them but where could manuela be jertiza is likely at the training grounds or in his quarters on the eastern side of the knights hall
flayn is missing  we should split up and search for her there isnt a moment to waste we must find her before its too late
when i consider how seteth must be feeling my heart breaks we must find flayn as soon as possible there are no signs of her having left the monastery but we cannot safely rule out any possibility just yet im wasting precious time standing about trying to think of a solution ill survey the monastery and see what information i can gather there must be someone who has a clue as to flayns whereabouts
what professor manuela ran off with professor jeritzas mask i have a bad feeling about this  we must find them both at once professor jeritza will be at the training grounds or his quarters i believe the latter can be found on the eastern side of the knights hall
i have thoroughly surveyed the entire monastery and yet i have not found a single trace of evidence that suggests flayn was abducted perhaps we must seek out personal recounts rather than physical evidence  in any case we must hurry before something terrible happens
no sign of her leaving the monastery eh that is assuming we can actually trust that information 
oh but im sure this space has no shortage of secret passages and hiding spots
true for now theres not much we can do aside from making a thorough search of the monastery
lets ask around and see what we turn up you never know who might have seen something
professor manuela ran off with professor jeritzas mask what could that possibly mean
well thats suspicious sounds like we should try talking to them
professor jeritza is almost certainly in the training grounds or his quarters where was that again oh over on the eastern side of the knights hall
flayns gone missing where could she be if it were an ordinary kidnapping youd think thered be a demand for ransom or something by now i dont like the sound of this 
if flayn has been taken hostage then we know she is alive at least for now there would be no point to abducting her if simple murder was the objective thats only logical professor
a beautiful delicate maiden vanishing into thin air  it is like something out of a book if it were a book we would have no need to worry she would be rescued presently by a dashing nobleman do you have any idea as to where she might be where she might have wandered off to
perhaps she went looking for treats
that is what i thought why i am here in fact but she is nowhere to be seen
to the greenhouse for some flowers
hmm the greenhouse i did not think of that i will take a look around there later
flayn no i havent seen her shes been abducted oh youre looking for her sorry my mind was somewhere else i just recently learned she has a crest did you know that professor if it was a particularly rare crest i could imagine professor hanneman would have quite an intense interest in her oh no im not accusing professor hanneman of abducting flayn
i dont know if she ran off or got kidnapped or what i just know that flayns in trouble thats it i cant keep sitting around i gotta go find her now where do i start
uh flayns not in here ugh i guess i have to let you in to prove it dont i
there see no ones in bernies room but bernie maybe flayn just wanted to be alone for a while have you considered that come to think of it where is her room anyway
hey professor have you seen manuela i saw her running off somewhere in a terrible hurry i wonder if it has anything to do with flayns disappearance do you know professor
youre on first name terms with professor manuela
oh yes didnt you know she was the senior diva in our opera company
flayn was childnapped that is what you are thinking and the villain is inside our monastery hmm i must have admittance one person has been catching my eye shamir is a knight not like other knights her movements are being reminders of no they remind me of warriors of brigid before she was here what was she getting up to 
ive heard the monastery is full of secret passages if there is no sign of flayns departure its possible that she used one of those whatever has happened i hope she is all right
ah youre looking for flayns kidnapper i cant say anything for sure but i do have suspicions about jeritza theres something about how hes handling his blade lately it seems more impulsive than usual it couldnt hurt to try speaking with him at least at this hour i think youll find him sparring with catherine at the training grounds
i heard something like this happened last year too neither the culprit nor the missing student were ever found last time some people say it was the work of evil spirits
maybe it was
d dont say things like that professor im sure the culprit is you know corporeal well catch whoever it is
then it could be the same culprit
i thought the same could there be a connection
ow ingrid just about slapped the teeth out of my head all i did was suggest that flayn had eloped 
quite an insensitive joke
insensitive i was just exploring possibilities
is that a possibility
i dont know i was just suggesting things then suddenly i was seeing stars and ingrid was yelling at me
do you really think flayn was kidnapped
she must have been
i have a feeling youre right we really need to find her and quickly
there must be another explanation
do you think she ran off on her own that doesnt put me any more at ease
there have been a lot of rumors swirling around lately about a death knight who kidnaps people from the nearby town  you dont think flayn was you know do you
we cant rule it out
i dont believe so
whether the rumors are true or not i just hope our flayn is safe 
to think that flayn would disappear like this  seteth must be worried sick i havent got much to go off of and perhaps its out of line for me to feel so uncomfortable  but something has been bothering me for a while about gilbert i feel as though ive met him somewhere before  i also noticed him staring intently at annette once hmm 
if flayn were taken hostage i expect we would have received demands from the culprit by now perhaps this is not a kidnapping at all do you suppose she could have simply run away
thats possible
if that is the case it is unlikely that we will find her anywhere in the monastery
i dont think so
what could it be then what possible motive could there be to abduct her
i hope flayn isnt going hungry if someone really kidnapped her ill never forgive them now that i think about it i saw alois hanging out by the pond not too long ago he was always getting into trouble for trying to talk to flayn you know its probably a crazy thought but im starting to worry
ive only ever spoken to flayn a handful of times she always seemed so naive about the ways of the world im worried about her
you think shed be easily deceived
yes im afraid so i just hope she comes home safe
do you have feelings for flayn
wh what makes you say that this is hardly the time for teasing you know
reflecting on it now flayn has always seemed a rather odd person she appears young yet theres something about her that seems much older than her years suggest and shes quite wise but also surprisingly naive 
maybe shes lived a very sheltered life
hmm you might be right whatever the case seteth seems to care for her more than anything
maybe shes actually a ghost
a ghost dont be absurd
dear goddess hear my prayer  please watch over flayn  please protect her 
i bet flayn ran away she couldnt stand being held back by seteth any longer i can emphasize i know what its like to have an overbearing big brother
where could flayn have gone do you think shes really been kidnapped i hear tomas has been going around asking about her  but hes probably just worried like the rest of us though it wasnt just flayn he was asking about you and captain jeralt too
professor have you still not found any leads regarding flayns whereabouts i have looked everywhere not even the knights on guard have seen anything of note
youre searching too
i too care for flayn she is like family to me
we will find her together
yes let us work together it reassures me to have you by my side
may the goddess protect dear flayn until she returns to us 
 
i will find her i swear it
that is all i ask please lend me your aid
try not to worry
you ask the impossible oh flayn 
she would have never left the monastery of her own volition why is there not a trace of her to be found
hey there professor did you want to talk  what me abduct flayn you cant really believe i did that
did you find anything in the pond
well this may sound silly but  i was too scared to even look i couldnt bear the thought of finding her in its depths
i hear she was always yelling at you 
oh thats just because of my dumb jokes she says that theyre not very good but if i went around kidnapping everyone who said that the whole monastery would be empty
did you hear about flayn its just one thing after another this year i swear some of the lower ranked knights are searching for her in the town if they find anything ill know  what jeritza hm come to think of it i havent seen him today what would make you suspect him
that mask he wears is suspicious
i heard that he goes out every night
i see well ill let the knights know
what brings you here im taking a break  is this about flayn you find me suspicious hah
youre not from fódlan
true your point being
what did you do before coming to the monastery
i was somewhere else fighting is that a problem
i understand that i dont fit in among the knights of seiros  but that hardly links me to flayns disappearance
working hard arent you ill admit im impressed i can assist with any tasks or help with your students
on it im available anytime im not on a mission with the knights
miss flayns whereabouts are unknown i pray she is safe  we do not seem to have any leads at present  i am one of the suspects am i well hopefully i can lay your suspicions to rest do you know of my lets call it unique situation
your true identity
do you mean annette
i was once a knight in service to the faerghus royal family if ingrid believes she saw me before it was likely in fhirdiad the kingdom capital annette is  she is my  but no i would appreciate it professor if you would ask no more
because of flayns disappearance all of the knights are searching nonstop but we havent found a single lead seteths face is getting paler by the minute its hard to watch  whats that youre looking for manuela well i did pass by her earlier she was carrying something a mask of some sort 
jeritzas mask
im not close to the guy so i cant say for sure but come to think of it you could be right
flayns mask
are you feeling all right when have you ever seen flayn wearing a mask
young flayns disappearance is most troubling  what who would suspect me you know what ill tell you who a fool thats who
is her crest rare enough to justify kidnapping her
flayns crest the major crest of cethleann is rare but there are others who possess it
you have already investigated her thoroughly
alas seteth would never allow that however while flayns major crest of cethleann is rare there are other who possess it
is something the matter i see so flayn has gone missing i will do what i can to support the search  hm it seems that you are a bit suspicious of me might i ask your reasons
why were you asking about flayn
i was away from the monastery for a few years but do not forget  i have spent more than four decades in total working here at garreg mach monastery yet it was not until recently that i learned that seteth has a sister
why were you asking about my father
it has been two decades since i last knew jeralt yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him
it is only natural to be curious dont you think i assure you there is nothing more to it than that
i cant believe flayn just disappeared i dont like it one little bit oh are you here to see someone alois and shamir and all the knights are gonna head into town soon
greetings professor today there is quite a bit to report there is a masked individual who has been going into town every evening and not returning until the following morning you see nothing gets past this guard i doubt it has anything to do with flayns disappearance but  well better safe than sorry i always say
professor i saw him a knight wielding a gigantic scythe he was just like the rumors say all covered in jet black armor it was the death knight i just know it you dont think he has something to do with flayns disappearance do you
i can only imagine how worried seteth must be but isnt mobilizing the entire order of knights a bit excessive i was originally assigned to investigate those reports of the death knight in the town near garreg mach when i think how many more victims that dastard might claim while were all busy searching for flayn  im sorry  that was insensitive were all under a lot of stress right now its important that we find her quickly
ive served here at garreg mach in some capacity or another for several decades now but after all that time even i cant claim to know everything about the layout searching the entire interior of the monastery is a more difficult task than you may think it makes you wonder who designed such a titanic compound there are fragments of records remaining from its original construction but none of them name an actual architect 
this might be the first time ive ever seen seteth look so worn down if poor flayn was lured away by anyone  i personally think the clear suspect is that miscreant from duscur those people are deceptive by nature 
the whole monastery has been turned upside down i wonder if were still going to have the battle of the eagle and lion next month its a yearly tradition but with things the way they are right now its hard to imagine at any rate i hope they find flayn soon
it seems flayn is still missing what could have happened to her
everyone hurry i heard a scream from professor jeritzas room
jeritza  ah the combat professor with the mask he has always been rather suspicious we must hurry
professor jeritza are you there
he does not seem to be here  hm on the ground professor manuela
is she injured
is she dead
no shes unconscious someone clearly attacked her
look at her hand it looks as though she is pointing at something  there
theres an opening behind that shelf perhaps a secret passageway 
what is the meaning of  wait is that manuela what happened here
we know as much as you do she needs to be taken to the infirmary
yes of course and quickly give me a hand child
understood ill support her head professor ill be back shortly please be careful
does this mean professor jeritza did it could he also have kidnapped flayn
we should start by investigating this passageway do you agree professor
lets investigate
agreed the culprit could be hiding inside
we should call for the knights
we dont have time for that it would be on us if the culprit escaped
that settles it well take the offensive here we come you monsters
shall we professor
we still dont know where flayn is  but we cant give up not until shes found
professor your highness i just heard a scream in professor jeritzas quarters
jeritza  ah the combat professor with the mask he has always been rather suspicious we must hurry
isnt that  professor manuela
professor manuela please wake up professor manuela
is she injured
shes still breathing but she needs medical attention immediately
is she dead
no i believe shes just unconscious but this wound requires immediate attention
look do you see professor manuelas hand its like shes pointing at something 
i see it behind that shelf could it be a secret passage
what is the meaning of  wait is that manuela what happened here we must take her to the infirmary immediately you dont just stand there help me carry her
of course ill return shortly professor
do you think this is related to flayns disappearance
what should we do professor
lets investigate
it looks dark uh dark in there
aw youve always been scared of dark places havent you annie but dont worry the professor and i will protect you
we should call for the knights
youre right we should call for help
but the culprit could flee while we wait sh shouldnt we take a look
there are sounds coming from within if were going to investigate now is the time
well be ok im sure of it are you ready professor
theres still no sign of flayn  what should we do teach ill admit im out of schemes here
professor claude somethings very wrong please hurry to professor jeritzas room
knock knock is anybody whoa professor manuela
i heard a scream coming from here just moments ago it must have been professor manuela
is she injured
shes unconscious she was clearly attacked by someone
is she dead
no i believe shes just unconscious it looks like she was attacked by someone
hey it kind of looks like professor manuela is pointing at something
so we follow where shes pointing and  oh what do we have here theres a rather suspicious hole behind that shelf
what is the meaning of  wait is that manuela what happened here we must take her to the infirmary immediately you dont just stand there help me carry her
right right hold down the fort for me teach ill be back once we get professor manuela taken care of
what could have happened here and where is professor jeritza
this must be related to that girls disappearance what if shes being held captive down there no no thats crazy  right
lets investigate
right  its scary but  ok
dont be a coward ignatz well be fine as long as we stick close to the professor
we should call for the knights
but what if something bad happens while were searching for the knights
you mean like a captured girl being strangled or something
ah youre right what should we do
weve got to investigate lead the way professor
the culprit may be hiding inside so lets be extra cautious
i never would have imagined  hm i see someone theyre unconscious
is it flayn
yes and there is someone else too it appears to be another student
is it jeritza
no professor its two young girls
someones coming i recognize that scythe and mask  its that jerk we fought at the holy mausoleum
what is this place its so bah i see someone i think theyre unconscious
is it flayn
yes i see flayn but who is this other person
is it jeritza
are you blind theyre obviously female and there are two of them
professor someones coming from farther in that scythe  is that the knight who attacked the holy mausoleum
its way too creepy down here and it smells funny and bah a person theyre unconscious
is it flayn
yes its flayn oh but theres someone else too 
is it jeritza
look closer professor there are two girls
someone is coming that scythe  could it be the knight we fought at the holy mausoleum
that sword you must be  one of us will die the other will live i will enjoy this dance of damnation
the monastery is shocked to learn that seteths younger sister flayn has gone missing after an exhaustive search for clues you finally come upon a lead 
our objective is to recover flayn let us hope we are not too late
hmm something odd about the floor over there what will happen if we step on it
contraptions in the floor stay alert
interesting apparatus i wonder if we can operate it
so you have come ill make sure you never leave
that knight looks like death itself we must rescue flayn immediately
theres something strange about the flooring at the end of the corridor something might happen if you step there
some kind of contraption has been activated
what is this device it appears operational
professor we need to defeat the death knight and then rescue flayn
hm look at that strange tile over there i bet something will happen if you step on it
whoa look at those weird contraptions on the floor
i wonder what that is looks like you can use it but who knows whatll happen
i have no need of you 
now you will die together  how joyous 
you should withdraw from here
i dont take orders from you 
kill them
halt youre having a bit too much fun
you are getting in the way of my game
hmph youll have more opportunities to play soon your work here is done
understood i will go 
we will cross paths again i am the flame emperor  it is i who will reforge the world
flame emperor rather worrisome that he sounds intent on showing up again
are they both ok we should get them out of here
the enemys withdrawn lets carry them up
flame emperor and the death knight i have to say they both looked very dangerous
where did they go it doesnt matter we need to get these two out of here
bring them up
flame emperor eh seemed quite frightened of us if you ask me haha
hes gone we should get these two out of here
lets get out of this horrible place cmon we can carry them up
theyre pale and their pulse are slow  still i dont believe their lives are in danger
you found flayn where
you missed the most important part of the mission we found her within that secret passage the culprits were the death knight and what was his name ah the flame emperor sadly they got away
all that matters is flayns safety right professor
right
i wanted to catch them
it is unfortunate if only you could have waited for me to return 
we will take these two to the infirmary professor please inform seteth
whatever the circumstance im glad flayn is safe though im curious to find out who that other girl is  huh professor is that a smile
heh you look happy i dont think ive ever seen you like this before anyhow we should hurry to seteth he must be beside himself by now
thank goodness those girls are pale as ghosts but at least theyre alive but that death knight person feels so familiar
you found flayn thank goodness
she was unconscious at the end of that secret passage we found the culprit too but he got away
no use dwelling on it
we almost had him
im just grateful that everyone is safe thats what matters most id like to hear what transpired but first we need to get these ladies to the infirmary
 understood well go at once
 im im sorry professor im so relieved i suddenly felt weak i couldnt be happier with how things turned out and i imagine no one will be more overjoyed than seteth hm hey professor can you make that expression one more time
like this
i dont think ive ever seen your face like that
no
i dont think i can 
heh i apologize ive forgotten myself and come dangerously close to teasing you its just ive never seen you look so happy before its downright mesmerizing ah but this isnt the time for idle chitchat we must hurry and share the good news with seteth
theyre both alive  thank goodness
you actually found flayn nice work
it is a shame you could not be there claude i would have liked for you to witness our mortal struggle against the death knight
he got away
we could not defeat him
hey at least we managed to rescue flayn and complete our mission thats what counts right right excellent work everyone now then lets get these limp ladies to the infirmary shall we
no problem i can carry them both at once
be gentle with them raphael let us carry each one individually and slowly
you know teach seeing you smile sure makes me feel better you look happy for a change hm do you really not know well truth is ive never seen you smile before now at times it made me wonder whether you were even human but i suppose that was just my imagination running wild anyhow weve probably kept seteth waiting about as long as he can stand lets hurry up and tell him the great news
professor  please allow me to express my eternal gratitude once more flayn is safe and sound and i have you to thank for that mere words could never express how thankful i am i i am indebted to you
i couldnt have done it without the students
yes of course i shall express my gratitude to the students as well
im just happy shes safe
yes indeed i i too am overjoyed
but why was flayn taken to begin with
her kidnapper was the masked knight who vanished during the rite of rebirth the one known as the death knight considering the circumstances it seems plausible to assume that his true identity is jeritza and we cannot forget about the mysterious flame emperor  his true motives are yet unclear however i have an idea i believe the enemy may have been after flayns blood the blood that flows through her veins is special it is extremely rare and extremely dangerous if enemies who know the secret of flayns blood have appeared our only option is to leave the monastery and go into hiding
brother wait
flayn what are you doing here you should be resting
i do not like the path of your thoughts i do not wish to live in some lonely remote location where i never get to see anyone not ever again
if we stay here you may be targeted again wouldnt it be better for the two of us to live in peace
even if we ran off to some new secret location there is no guarantee that they would not find us that is why i believe it would be safest to stay in the monastery where we are surrounded by capable knights and professors
i see your point i do however 
you know it is the only reasonable option what if i were to join the professors class
that is a great idea
you think so too i am so very pleased to hear that with a professor like you nearby i shall be safe no matter what foe should appear
why would you do that
because with a professor like you nearby i shall be safe no matter what foe should appear
i see i am afraid you have a good point professor  due to my position i have closely scrutinized everything about you after all that has happened i must admit that you are indeed a trusted ally so what say you can i entrust you with flayns safety
it would be my pleasure
i suppose i have no choice
i am so glad that flayn is safe yet i cant help but wonder what the story is about the other girl she wore the uniform of the academy but who is she
well done professor i see that i was right to ask your class for assistance i have been told that manuela and flayn are recovering nicely as is monica
is monica a student here
who is monica
monica the girl you rescued along with flayn is also a student at the officers academy however 
she is a student from last years class she went missing just before she would have graduated it never occurred to us that something might have happened to her at the monastery we assumed she had run away i never dreamed that we would find her not like this
monica has asked to rejoin the black eagle house once she has fully recovered our enemies are still out there so we must remain cautious and continue our investigation however we must also help the students to move on from this incident
after all the battle of the eagle and lion will be held in gronder field next month
yes the students will remember it for the rest of their lives please guide them so they may show us their best at the coming battle
so youll be going to gronder field next month youve never been there before have you there is unease in the western side of the empire but everything east of the capital enbarr is stable well there was a noble rebellion a short while ago but it didnt amount to much
what will you do next month
i have my own mission the church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them
will you come to the battle of the eagle and lion
sorry but ive got my own mission and its far from gronder field the church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them
what im more concerned about is finding out who among us is pulling the strings ever since the rite of rebirth strange groups have been seen around garreg mach and elsewhere too there was also an incident where some knights investigating these suspicious strangers turned up dead not that its likely but if something like that ever happens to me  search this room every corner behind every shelf im going to leave something for you
dont say things like that
dont get me wrong i have no intention of dying i know it would be too much to ask you to cheer up but can you at least drop the serious   well ill be was that a smile just now
i promise
dont just nod solemnly theres nothing to worry about im just being cautious then again i guess youre always solemn
/***EOF***/
together the people of fódlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends they recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike but each person must still walk their chosen path alone with each day the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky a silent reminder perhaps of some inescapable truth 
unforgivable i cannot believe that the adrestian empire would embark on such a violent course of action
the fault is my own i failed to see the wickedness within edelgards heart
is she wicked
she plotted with ill meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the holy tomb if that is not wicked what is
what is her objective
there is no question on that front she clearly wishes to conquer all of fódlan and in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions she plotted with ill meaning strangers and defiled the holy tomb
or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know perhaps she is planning to make herself a false deity by demonizing the church of seiros 
adrestia received its very name through a divine oracle to injure the goddess is a sin most foul that shall not be forgiven nor forgotten we must stop the empire and quickly
i have returned rhea
welcome back shamir were you able to discern the empires movements
their main troops are marching towards garreg mach it is said that they will join forces with edelgards army and arrive within two weeks
two weeks that is not enough time it will require all of our efforts just to prepare our defenses before then we must send notice to all surrounding villages at once we must order the residents of garreg mach to flee for their lives
it will be done
 professor listen closely if our enemy invades the monastery i will have no choice but to stand upon the battlefield if something happens to me i am entrusting my sacred duties to you
why me
sacred duties
you must have guessed it by now the truth of who you are or perhaps i should say your lost memories are surely beginning to return i have acted all these long years as a mere proxy for you but the duty is yours and yours alone only you can lead the people of fódlan
 rhea please you must tell me all that you know i beg of you
 
that one is the progenitor god am i correct
in a sense our dear professor is a vessel one who carries the power of the progenitor god within in time the vessel will become one with the power contained within and the progenitor god shall return to this world
i see i trust that you are aware of the questionable nature of this experiment but i suppose there is no turning back 
i ask that you help our friend and in doing so help her i am waiting and hoping for the moment when our creator rules this wayward land once more
i am sorry but i cannot do this i am not certain it is just 
i see that is a shame
i understand as ever i will take you at your word
lady rhea brother i will do my part as well
flayn were you eavesdropping regardless i am glad to hear it you owe your life to the professor after all and in the end they may prove to be our brethren
you have my gratitude seteth and you as well flayn as followers of the progenitor god it is up to us to see our mission through
  ill have that girls head just you wait 
the empire is moving quickly edelgard must have been preparing for this for a while now if you really think about it she must have been planning for this even before you got the sword of the creator  of course she was always a step ahead of us we were blinded by the ball and the battle of the eagle and lion and everything else 
half of the empires six great noble families have declared their support for edelgard of the other three lord vestra was assassinated hubert his son will succeed him bernadettas father count varley is under house arrest his wife is now supporting edelgard and my father he was stripped of his role as prime minister as as result house aegir has lost all of its power all of its land we have lost everything i i  what do i do
the most important nobles in the empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor my father included i didnt think it possible that the imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily however it seems that both my father and caspars are supporting edelgard  having both the minister of domestic affairs and minister of military affairs on your side gives you total control over the empires military and finances they must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing 
i dont normally have a problem jumping into a fight but it feels strange going up against my father we arent especially close but hes not an opponent id want to face id almost rather fight a monster i hope hes not part of the group coming to attack garreg mach 
what does war with edelgard mean for us professor and why does she even want that
i dont know
yeah i guess wed have to ask her
she seems to think force is the only way
i wonder why shed think that 
thats how it always goes i guess you never realize something cant be undone until youve done it
edelgard became emperor and raised an army huh who knew the kid had it in her i mean yeah of course i knew shed be emperor eventually but  the more i think about it the more surprised i am i wonder whos going to win 
us or her you mean
but would it really be ok for edelgard to win
we will not lose
thinking about it makes me scared were up against the entire imperial army still i know someone as smart as you will figure something out 
i am owing big debts to duke gerth of the empire he is the minister of affairs that are foreign he is a friend of edelgard he is to her side what should i be doing
i have had the arrival of a letter from edelgard she is asking that i join her side she is making the decision no she is deciding if brigid is a friend or an enemy of the empire but my choice is not to be friends my choice is to fight with you brigid is not a friend of the empire we will not be following again we will be ready to fight with you instead
his highness calls for the head of edelgard for me that is cause enough to fight
that is against the teachings of the goddess
perhaps but it is too late to stop him now
youre truly all right with that
the hatred of his highness is also my hatred any other feelings i may have are irrelevant
and if edelgard was responsible in any way for the tragedy of duscur that is something i cannot ignore if that is the case then she is my enemy
you saw it too didnt you the boars true nature hes hidden his desire for revenge pretty well but now its stirred up well regardless that girls starting an all out war isnt she but an enemy is an enemy no matter who they are dont let compassion for her get in your way
once the imperial army reaches the monastery well have no choice but to fight 
whats going to happen to us
everything will be all right
i believe you with the knights on our side and especially with you professor i know we can do this
i cant say for sure
oh well well just have to try our best
things must be pretty crazy in faerghus about now my father must be beside himself i dont get it why did edelgard make enemies with the nobles
i have no idea
me either  of course even if we did get it what do we do about it
for the sake of her ideals
ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them those must be some lofty ideals to say the least
i hope this all gets sorted out quickly and safely im worried about my father
i guess we have no choice but to fight have we oh but why would edelgard do something like this im sure well be all right though professor the goddess will keep us safe
ive known his highness since i was a child but ive never seen that side of him before he seemed like a completely different person than the one i know 
the empires aggression cannot stand but if we are going to attack them now we must be honest with ourselves about our chances of success it goes without saying that i will fight the imperial army with everything i have for as long as i am able but house gloucesters territory is adjacent to imperial lands let us proceed with caution
i hear the alliances territory will be in danger if we dont get rid of these empire guys if the alliance is in danger that means my sisters in danger too theres no way im gonna allow that it doesnt matter how many guys they throw at us ill beat em all these muscles arent just for show but first i gotta get some food
you know professor im glad that i came to the officers academy i feel accepted here ive learned so much honestly im surprised at how much ive grown so i will not let the academy be destroyed its important to me and i will protect it
i feel the same
i feel braver just hearing you say that professor
dont do anything rash
ill try to keep a clear head but there wont be any turning back for me i dont want to have regrets
were gonna win this professor
so edelgard the one who calls herself the flame emperor was connected to those strange beings the imperial army might be using even more terrifying methods than we know you had better be cautious professor any amount of carelessness might prove to be our undoing
can we really defeat someone who is willing to turn their back on the world just to uphold their own beliefs ive spent my whole life running in fear and now i 
we can win this together
surely we can win if we rely on each other right professor
we cant win if you run
youre right its time to stop running ill fight with everything ive got
youll battle edelgard right good luck me oh im going to run away i have zero interest in dying here thank you very much
at times like this i just feel so anxious you know but youll watch out for me there right professor
what is edelgard even trying to achieve she wants to destroy the church so badly that shell take on anyone who doesnt fall in line i dont get it
her ideals are in conflict with yours
its a hard thing to accept
i just cant believe shed start a war over it not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way could captain jeralts death have also been a part of her plan dont you go and die on me professor captain jeralt would never forgive you
how are you professor any new changes to report with the imperial army drawing near it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did  thankfully you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side please try to listen carefully for her voice 
i will try
i cant hear a thing
please do not say such sad things i am certain you will hear her in time
may the goddesss voice reach you 
we must protect garreg mach defiling the holy tomb was a sacrilege i will not allow such a thing to happen again the archbishop has already given you a new responsibility i want you to rise to that honor
professor  war is breaking out again is it not
again
there was a truly terrible war once upon a time
i want to stop it if i can
an honorable notion do you think there is something to be done whatever shall we do
i never wanted another war  all we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead
well perhaps its pointless to get upset about the past my duty now is to prepare for battle were depending on your strength professor crush our enemies
ill try
im depending on you
captain i hope youre watching we will protect garreg mach
ugh if i could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self now it turns out edelgard is the flame emperor and the new adrestian emperor and shes striking out against the monastery with the full force of the imperial army behind her we gotta beat her at her own game for our sake as well as lady rheas 
were falling behind i dont know that we can keep up with the new emperor to think that she was able to raise an army of that size right under our noses  however hard we fight i give us a 50 percent chance of winning the enemy has too many advantages we must make careful preparations
there are always small power struggles still  it has been hundreds of years since all of fódlan was consumed by war i didnt actually think it would come to this  i feel as though im not in my rightful place i cannot protect the things i should  professor if i survive this war i wish to return to my homeland  to the land of my king
the holy tomb held many crest stones this is the first time ive heard of crest stones being hidden away in such a place  but more importantly im interested to know the empires aim why would their army desire crest stones there is power there yes and yet  i must think on this the crest stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding conand tower and the chapel as well  and of course the crest stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into demonic beasts  could that possibly be their aim the empires army may well plan to use crest stones to create demonic beasts
the mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was edelgard wow doesnt make much sense though does it there would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess  eh im gonna stop i dont really have the head for this political stuff mostly im worried about my old opera company i wonder whats happening in the capital right now i hope theyre safe 
its my job to protect lady rhea ive gotta do it and i gotta do it as best i can and if that means i gotta die for her then i will ugh how could edelgard treat lady rhea like shes the bad guy shes never been anything but nice to everybody i just dont get it at all 
i cant believe the empire raised an army  even i couldnt have guessed it war is profitable but dangerous i really dont like seeing people i care about out there mixed up in all this
greetings professor something to report unexpected isnt it apparently this is the first time garreg mach has been invaded in its whole 995 year history its my job to protect this gate so even if enemies come in droves i will never let them through i hope we both survive  lets battle with all our might and pray we win this thing
listen up everyone the imperial army is upon us if you can fight pick up a weapon everyone else hurry up and evacuate we have the goddesss protection on our side we have nothing to fear victory will be ours
professor are you ready
almost
well hurry up i dont need to tell you that the situation is dire we have some support troops from the local nobles but the army were facing is immense no matter how you look at it were at a disadvantage to make matters worse the enemy is being led by edelgard do not underestimate how extraordinary her abilities are
of course we know but we cant let her get away also please cease your unwarranted glaring we dont deserve your judgement
my father was removed from his role as prime minister and is still under house arrest in the imperial capital as his successor it is my duty to stop her
the way shes going about all of this is wrong its up to us to help her realize that
i wont be following her but l wont run away either
edies going to come at us with all shes got and thats a lot that means we need to fight her with all of our might too
she is one who has strength that has certainty but we have strength also we will not be losing
i shall fight with all that i have it is an honor to fight alongside each of you
you students really have guts dont you though i suppose i cant call you students anymore youre now part of our order you have our support and our gratitude professor im counting on you go ahead and take the lead
leave it to me
ill protect the students
these kids they look up to you i guess that goes without saying just look in their eyes and you can see it if we all make it through this lets meet again good luck out there
theyre here at long last
it seems this will be a battle to remember about time
ill never give up no matter how outnumbered we are ill fight to the very end
hm i should have made a move on the imperial princess before things got this far it could have changed everything
we have the goddesss divine protection on our side all thats left to do is to try our best
all we can do is fight as best as we can though if im being honest im really scared right now 
we cant just hand over the kingdom and the monastery well stop her no matter what it takes
your highness you do not seem well
  unwell you say whats gotten into you nothing could be further from the truth im so happy i can hardly contain myself my father my stepmother my dear friends they want her head they want her life theyve whispered as much to me and the chance to answer their pleas has arrived at long last
dont lose control out there
  im always in control professor and ill stay in control until i have the pleasure of killing that woman
dont act rashly were all in this together
  of course of course but dont mistake my intentions edelgard will die by my hand and mine alone
lets move professor even if it costs me my life i wont rest until ive crushed her skull in my bare hands
shes back already talk about impatient
if we dont stop them the academy will be destroyed prepare for battle everyone
we will stop edelgards rampage
our opponent is formidable but if we work together we will not fail
enough talking lets go
dear goddess  please protect us all 
i shall fight with all that i have it is an honor to fight alongside each of you
professor claude  youll lead the way wont you you wont let any of us fall right
i wanted to talk to rhea first but as expected that wont be possible what did she hope to accomplish at the holy tomb what happened to you as a baby there are still so many things i need to know the same goes for the real origin of the crest stones and the heroes relics as for seiros and nemesis just how much of their mythology is true
its true but lucky for me i refuse to die with so much still unknown hey teach  all joking aside can we possibly survive this battle
well find a way
thats all we can do right if we gave up the god of fate wouldnt be happy
i dont know
hey now i wasnt really looking for an honest answer honesty is bad for morale teach youd better cut that out
im a lot of things but im not the kind of man to just roll over and die in a place like this i have my own ambitions to see to there are things dreams that i must see come to fruition and ive been thinking i want you to see those dreams realized as well on top of all that there are still so many secrets out there just waiting to be uncovered we cant let that stand can we
so teach  no scratch that youre so much more youre my ally and my friend teach  friend  none of those words quite capture what youve come to mean to me we may not be connected by blood but i believe our bond goes deeper than that now that we know each other our hearts are connected even if our paths diverge and were forced to say good bye  i know that well meet again
and so for lack of a better word i gratefully call you my friend and i hold fast to the belief that this isnt it for us no matter who or what you really are ill always be on your side you cant count on much in this world but you can count on that
the imperial army led by edelgard advances on garreg mach as everyone struggles to process this turn of events the grim reality of war fast approaches
i have a report the enemy is within the walls theyre about to break the defensive line
the archbishop and the defensive line both require our assistance we must protect them until reinforcements get here
report the enemy has taken the entrances there the reinforcements were heading
we must retake the strongholds to the east and west so our reinforcements can get through
one stronghold secured
both strongholds secured with time to spare
alright thats one stronghold recaptured now the other
thats both strongholds it appears we were right on time
no the monestary has fallen weve been defeated 
im here and ive brought reinforcements dont worry  well protect the monastery
i brought reinforcements ill send them to the front line
they have taken the monastery we have lost 
we took back one of the strongholds on to the next 
all right we took back both of the strongholds lets keep up the momentum
damn it  the monastery has fallen into the hands of our enemy we failed
the goddess protects us  what is there to fear rebel swords  this is blasphemy against the goddess stop this now
n no  i cannot fall here 
a wonderful chance to earn some recognition ill be the one to take down the monastery
i have no choice but to distinguish myself in this fight
argh im finished im loathe to say it but i must retreat 
such a shame there are people in the empire you truly care about too arent there i wonder what will become of them
what you fail to appreciate is that we have at our backs a force you cannot hope to defeat
i can afford to fall back we still have the advantage
this fight is but a sideshow  to the ravaging of the sacred place that is garreg mach 
the time is not right  i will wait for the next opportunity 
i will not allow you to get any closer to her majesty
my life was changed forever by her majesty  now i lay it on the line for the empire
lady edelgard im so sorry i cant keep going i must retreat
think very carefully about whether you wish to raise your sword against the empire  or if you will offer it to us in fealty and after youve thought it through if you still wish to fight i wont stop you i will simply use the full extent of my power  and crush you
you will come to regret raising your blade against the emperor of the adrestian empire
huh this guy seems real familiar 
y you dastard arent you  no 
eh that doesnt matter right now lets go
lady edelgard held you in such high esteem in the end however it seems like you are nothing more than a slave to your goddess
this battlefield is too chaotic  for us to kill each other upon 
i wish you were someone whose heart could be swayed by my words and deeds if it were so i would have done anything to make you my ally 
youre late i  we are all tired of waiting now lets separate that sick head from your neck shall we
heh you never were one for patience
you fought well but now your fight is over send in our reserve troops and give my uncle the signal
what  is this
everyone here young and old is in your hands
no i will not allow another red canyon tragedy to happen here
what is going on
what now
why did you come
in imperial year 1181 the new adrestian emperor edelgard von hresvelg led a strategic assault against the monastery at garreg mach though her own losses were great her foes had no choice but to surrender archbishop rhea commanded the knights of seiros leading from the front lines against the imperial army but amidst the chaos of battle she vanished and her whereabouts remain unknown with this single attack the adrestian empire officially launched its offensive against the holy kingdom of faerghus and the leicester alliance the unification of fódlan has begun
/***EOF***/
the northern lands are enveloped in a bitter cold and frigid winds are carried across the sea to the south of adrestia when feather white snow falls on fódlans locket the fort looks as delicate as a pearl however beneath that snowy blanket her throat is more treacherous than ever
rhea please talk to me what are you hiding what is the meaning of how that one looks it is almost as though 
as i said there is nothing of which to speak for now at the end of this month 
i read jeralts diary i happened upon it in his room
what
in it he stated the reason for his departure the baby thought to have died in the fire has returned to us jeralt realized that you had done something to the child and decided to flee what did you do to that baby rhea nothing questionable i should hope
seteth enough they will be here shortly no more i beg of you i will take our dear professor to the holy tomb there i should be able to see our dearest wishes to fruition when i was young i heard her voice there  im sure of it
you may enter
i have been awaiting your arrival professor now that you have received sacred power from the goddess there is somewhere you must pay a visit to at once you must go to the holy tomb so that you may receive a divine revelation from the goddess
the holy tomb
a revelation
the holy tomb is where the goddess sleeps this monastery was originally built for the purpose of protecting that hallowed temple
only a select few know of it but there is a legend about seiros and the holy tomb saint seiros the first soul to be gifted power from the goddess received her revelation there she was told it was her sacred duty to save the people of fódlan and that she must use her power wisely in order to lead them the words that were handed down to seiros from the goddess will likely fall upon your ears as well
prepare yourself to go at once there may you find out why you were blessed with such power
there will be a ceremony at the holy tomb it is then that you will receive the goddesss revelation you may share this mission with your students
do you think it wise to bring them into this
a mission now
it is said that when seiros received the revelation she had holy warriors by her side protecting her your students who have followed you and fought alongside you through the darkest of times are well suited to stand by you for the ceremony of course as the leader of the church of seiros i will be by your side as well
strange 
the occasion is too significant to be missed
isnt that too dangerous
the holy tomb is a sacred temple that is sealed off from the rest of the world there is nothing to fear
even if something were to happen i am more than capable of protecting myself
much has changed but your duty has not wavered steel your mind for the ceremony and prepare your students well
rhea and seteth were not their usual selves what happened to teach thats questionable and what really awaits at the holy tomb the way they were acting i dont think they have any plans of sharing that information
i cant hear sothiss voice anymore 
professor you should know that ill be away from the monastery for a few days
where are you going
its meant to be a secret but im going to enbarr the imperial capital dont worry ill be back in time for the ceremony at the holy tomb
professor please if he hears it from you that he needs to rest perhaps his highness will listen
hes exaggerating he thinks my color is off and that rest will cure all i have a headache but thats just from lack of sleep its not going to stop me from completing this months mission
you should rest
the professor agrees please rest at least until the task is at hand
i wont even if i tried its not like i would get any decent sleep it would only be a waste of time
dont overexert yourself
i must insist 
who do you think you are i can take care of myself dedue
in any case we wont let you down this month professor you can rely on us
hey teach is it ok for you to be out on your own right now just please be careful not to topple over again you scared us nearly to death anyway  doesnt rhea want something from you sounds important im glad ill be there to witness the ritual at the holy tomb i want to see whether or not something happens with my own eyes
i always knew there was something special about you but youve only gotten more and more extraordinary the longer ive know you that transformation was just the beginning wasnt it i have a feeling that things will only grow more dire from here on out
edelgard and hubert have been busier than usual constantly coming and going in and out of garreg mach perhaps they are doing something in the empire as the legitimate heir of the aegir family i have not heard anything about it but if it were significant i am sure my father would have told me
how are you professor did hanneman make his i will do no harm speech or promise this wont hurt a bit when he asked to study you both ive a bit of research id like to perform nothing so crass as hannemans poking prodding and drawing of blood no i wish to investigate crest power itself crest power must have some kind of limit right lady rhea says any limits must be the protection of the goddess but that doesnt quite answer it for me hmm 
youre so strong now im starting to understand why you were appointed professor
i thought i was stronger but i still have such a long way to go
try to catch up to me
oh i will i still plan on beating you some day
ill help you get there
youd better not go easy on me i need your training to be strict if im gonna get any better
so hungry  oh is that you professor sorry im really not feeling well this month even leaving my room for dinner is just too much its got nothing to do with your um changes so um dont open the door please
recently professor i feel as though youve been a bit distant its like youre sort of floating above the clouds separate from other people  and like youve got no interest at all in ever coming back down how can i help
im not being distant so dont worry
i dont know what to say to that
hey dont worry i thought maybe id ask and see what youd say
in brigid we have legends stories containing people who have a spirit living inside of them those spirit people have much strength they are maybe able to fly in the air or race across the ocean hair that shines and eyes that glow  they have qualities that are not unlike what you are looking like professor
i cant fly
are you knowing that for certain maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky 
perhaps
do not have doubt professor the powers you have are like the powers of the legends
hurry up and cage the wild boar look hes losing his grip even in his swordplay hes getting sloppy if he keeps progressing like this hes going to get himself killed kronya solon  theyre dead but we still have a glut of enemies we still have to take down the death knight and the flame emperor our next battle is fast approaching im ready for it
i cant even imagine what it must be like inside the holy tomb
i dont know either
well its probably a grave that much is for sure and its likely underground beyond that who knows
its just a place to bury people
i guess youre right holy or not all graves are kind of the same arent they
i cant help but wonder though  just what kind of ritual is this
i swear its like youre an entirely different person
i havent changed on the inside
heh i guess youre right if i look hard i can still tell its you
isnt it weird
 no not at all im just not used to it it really suits you though
 its not weird at all its  youre somehow even more beautiful than before im joking im joking dont get mad
youve been granted this power by the goddess herself truly you must be a very special individual maybe seiros transformed before receiving her revelation too
hmm i havent heard anything about that before  maybe that part never found its way into the legend
it is told that seiros had a revelation instructing her to use her power for good and to lead the people of fódlan to salvation  i wonder what sort of revelation you might have professor
bah professor sorry this will take some getting used to  your hair and eye color are completely different you just dont look like yourself anymore
its only my appearance that has changed
of course youre right im just being silly as usual
maybe i am a different person 
dont scare me like that you are still you right you are right
to be honest i cannot keep up with all thats been happening recently monica was actually kronya tomas was actually solon who were these people what about you professor you are a true ally yes
thats my intention
not the most convincing answer you could have given still i simply must take you at your word
i dont know
pull yourself together it is still your duty to lead us is it not
you look so different youre still our professor in there right did anything else change besides your hair and eyes are your arms bigger how do your abs look
ive changed quite a bit
really you gotta teach me how to do that
i havent changed that much
thats disappointing whats even the point
so this months mission is to take part in a ritual at the holy tomb where you will receive a revelation from the goddess herself what if she really appears what if i finally get to gaze upon her radiance ive always imagined the goddess  how beautiful she must be
youre going to the ritual at the holy tomb right i hear that a revelation from the goddess is expected what if she shows herself ill be so jealous
your hair and your eyes what happened to you you didnt lose something as a result of gaining those powers did you
dont worry im fine
i see well that makes me feel better but still be careful
i dont know yet
sometimes our frail bodies dont do well with excess power  so dont push yourself too hard
long ago saint seiros was gifted with a divine revelation from the goddess as well as incredible power is that what happened to you too professor
no way the professor transformed before receiving any kind of divine revelation right still i wonder does the fact that youve changed really mean youve been granted some kind of power
if thats the case then what sort of revelation can be gained from the ritual
im guessing the revelation will just be a gentle reminder to use this new power to save the people of fódlan what else is there to say you dont actually believe were going to hear the voice of the goddess do you
when you changed even the other professors were taken completely by surprise theres a ritual at the holy tomb this month isnt there i wonder what will happen with that im sure youll be all right but dont lose sight of who you really are ok however you may change and whatever new power goes along with those changes  youll still be the same person deep down remember that
you havent a thing to worry about you have been gifted the power of the goddess furthermore you have overcome the death of your father jeralt and you have destroyed countless of our wicked foes i am proud so very proud of who you have become
thank you
once we finish the ritual at the holy mausoleum all will be well
im uneasy
that is understandable just know that your unease should disappear the moment we conclude the ritual at the holy mausoleum
hmm  ah it is you i am sorry but i have a lot on my mind i would prefer to be alone right now
professor i am so happy your new hair and eye color suit you well we make quite the pair but recently i sense that things are a bit strained between lady rhea and my brother she wants to do something at the holy tomb i do not know what but  hm whenever it has concluded i hope they will return to their friendship as it has always been 
captain  oh professor how long have you been standing there i didnt see you i was just sorting through captain jeralts belongings i  havent made much progress i keep finding things that bring back memories clearing out this room of his belongings again its  its not easy
in our battle last month we really cut the enemy down to size but there are other enemies we have yet to hunt down not the least the flame emperor once weve crushed them all we can return to our peaceful lives at the monastery it will happen soon i have a feeling something big is coming
people who live an inordinately long time people whose hair changes color and those odd heroes relics  is fódlan some mystical land full of inhuman creatures
its not like that
you still look human for now at least
is the world different outside fódlan
you should see for yourself id recommend exploring west of the empire
sometimes i find myself thinking i should leave garreg mach and return to my home  where i should have been all along
where you should have been
ignore me im sorry its a silly thing an old mans ramblings and nothing more
i wont stop you 
i hear that lady rhea will accompany you for this months task shes the pillar that supports the hearts of fódlans people her safety is paramount i hope there are no complications 
are you positive really your appearance is due to the influence of the crest of flames intriguing unfortunately i have found no record of nemesiss hair and eye color ever changing however  if that transformation was brought on in part by the power of the crest that would be most  well i suppose interesting is too small a word still it would be an absolutely exceptional discovery to know for certain we must investigate further so clothes off
 
what a full physical is in order yes we need to know if this transformation affected you adversely dont worry it wont hurt a bit
the holy tomb huh ive worked here for years and this is the first ive heard of it i mean it does make some sense sort of something about it is still weird i understand now why theyd build the monastery in the mountainous center of fódlan although  when the monastery was built the kingdom and the alliance werent even around yet but look how cleverly it was placed right in the middle of the empire kingdom and alliance thats weird right
when i first saw you professor with that hair color and that eye color i thought you looked kind of like lady rhea like maybe you could be related i like the way it looks i wonder if i could change my hair color too  maybe if i tried hard enough if i thought real hard about it i mean
that would be exciting wouldnt it
all i need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape right just like you did
you dont need to do that cyril
i might not need to but i still wanna
hey professor you seem different lots of things seem different around here lately ive noticed it have you
greetings professor nothing to report although i suppose you are something to report for a moment i thought you were someone suspicious lucky for you i am quite perceptive it took only that single moment for me to recognize you  the professor went out and got some new power
professor will you join me theres something i must do it will take a few days but i promise well be back in time for the ceremony at the holy tomb
where are we going
its meant to be a secret but im going to enbarr the imperial capital there is something i must do there
ill go with you
thank you my teacher
father forgive me for asking this of you i know how much pain youre in  how the burden of the throne weighs heavily on you  and so  
there is no need to apologize edelgard you must know   that i do not have much time left in this world the time has come
thank you father now to complete the imperial succession you must relinquish your crown here in the throne room the archbishop of the church of seiros would normally act as witness but my professor will fill that role instead
edelgard 
from this day forward the weight of the empires future shall rest upon my shoulders all that i do will be for the benefit of the people of fódlan
edelgard von hresvelg the crown is yours by the covenant between the red blood and the white sword and by the double headed eagle upon your head i hereby pronounce you the new emperor are you prepared to take those responsibilities as your own
in accordance with the ancient covenant and in keeping with the hresvelg legacy  i swear that upon this throne i shall use my reign to lead fódlan to a new dawn and achieve peace for all
the imperial succession is complete  my daughter i regret that i could not do more for you when you were stolen away to the kingdom when the prime minister did those horrible things i could only watch in horror
i   i understand father in those dark times your eyes and your fists were my salvation within your eyes i saw true care and upon your fists clenched tight with indignity i saw the blood that dripped and fell even as i bled i felt that you too must also be bleeding
your majesty you must not leave your sleeping chambers in your condition  ah edelgard i did not expect to find your highness here
prime minister you have misspoken i am no longer your highness but rather your majesty
i impossible
it is true edelgard is the new emperor of the adrestian empire we will summon the officials  and prepare an ordinance at once and you prime minister  
  are dismissed it will be some time before you are allowed to make contact with the outside world again
no how can this be i  understood your majesty
edelgard  my dear el i leave the fate of fódlan   in your capable hands
father 
thank you for staying by my side professor now that im the emperor its time to grasp my destiny after the ceremony at the holy tomb i must return to enbarr this may be the last we see of each other we are out of time my teacher everyone is waiting for us we must go
a revelation from the goddess  to think well have the honor of attending such a historical event
i hear the archbishop will accompany us to the holy tomb
if something happens to her all of fódlan will suffer we must protect her at all costs
this may sound mad but perhaps we dont have to worry so much about that lady rhea has said before that she is capable of protecting herself i have a felling that is true i thought it was a strange thing for her to say and beyond that her movements bring to mind a great warrior with an extensive military background
who is rhea really
if so we have nothing to fear
i wonder mind its also possible that im way off track regardless perhaps we should brace ourselves for anything
i never imagined attending a ceremony for real revelation
i wonder what the ceremony will be like im so nervous im not ready for this
theres no chance for battle unless something goes terribly wrong right how boring
if you keep saying things like that something bad is bound to happen
 whats wrong flayn you look like you have something on your mind
who me no it is nothing may we all see this through to the end
 your highness i will protect you no matter what  your highness
 
lost in thought
you havent seemed like yourself lately 
hm ah i suppose you could say that nothing to worry about its about time for lady rhea to arrive lets all steel ourselves for whatever may occur at this ceremony
youre going to receive the goddesss revelation at the holy tomb thats news to me i did not see that coming
lady rheas going too right i hear it will be well guarded but it is that really okay
if solons allies are still around its certainly true that we dont know when or where they may appear
i dont know what type of place this holy tomb is but we should be cautious
if something happens well have to take matters into our own hands
what do you think professor is it really okay for lady rhea to attend
im worried
it seems to be tightly sealed ill give you that we should be fine as long as nothing goes terribly wrong yep  just as long as nothing goes wrong
its encouraging
leave it to our fearless leader to shrewdly factor in rheas fighting ability youre bold teach i love it
well the truth is we wont know whats going on until it happens all we can do is stay on our guard and play it by ear
thats quite enough babbling claude there is nobody more unfit for a holy ceremony than you
um divine punishment wont strike us for setting foot in the holy tomb right
good grief why are you always so negative
hm flayn is something on your mind
who me no it is nothing may we all see this through to the end
it still doesnt make sense to me a goddess was living inside teach right but now theres a ceremony to receive a revelation or whatever how could that be necessary anymore there must be another objective  its pointless to speculate about it now well know the answer soon enough there isnt any danger for us students but  be careful teach
are you surprised professor this is the holy tomb
to think there was such a vast space beneath the monastery all this time its hard imagine that any of these enormous contraptions are of this world
this is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest along with her children
it is said that our creator the goddess sothis sat upon this very throne professor do you recognize this throne
i do
so long  i have waited so very long for this day sit upon the throne i have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess
i do not
there is no need to hide anything from me you have seen it havent you in a dream 
well  it was supposed to be but a step away what could possibly be missing
 stop right there
 dont move any of you if you move your lives will be forfeit thank you ever so much for guiding us this far the imperial army will now take possession of everything in the holy tomb
whats the imperial army doing here
wait does he work for the flame emperor
so the flame emperors connected to the empire i never thought that possible
edelgard did you know about this
yes in fact i gave the order i am the flame emperor
i guess thats the end of play at school lady edelgard i mean your majesty
get to work everyone the crest stones belong to us now and take those filthy bones too
insolence you will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place  professor destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator
wait whats the meaning of this edelgard
 you  made use of us why
im sorry my teacher i cut this path and now i must follow it my friends i ask that all of you stay back it is not my intention to fight you  by order of the adrestian emperor edelgard von hresvelg i command you to collect the crest stones if anyone attempts to stop us kill them
are you surprised professor this is the holy tomb
incredible to think such a vast space has been hiding beneath the monastery all this time i wonder what powers that giant mechanism that descends beneath the ground
this is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest along with her children
it is said that our creator the goddess sothis sat upon this very throne professor do you recognize this throne
i do
so long  i have waited so very long for this day sit upon the throne i have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess
i do not
there is no need to hide anything from me you have seen it havent you in a dream 
well  it was supposed to be but a step away what could possibly be missing
halt reveal yourself
 dont move any of you if you move your lives will be forfeit thank you ever so much for guiding us this far the imperial army will now take possession of everything in the holy tomb
why is the imperial army here
this cant be how did they get into garreg mach
even the flame emperor is here that can only mean  
the flame emperor is connected to the empire what do you know
i never imagined youd have the nerve to return here what are you after flame emperor
is it not obvious the holy tomb contains great power the power to rule all of fódlan
and to attain that power youll trample anything that stands in your way just like you did in duscur
i had nothing to do with that  quickly retrieve the crest stones kill for them if you must
insolence you will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place  professor destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator
are you surprised professor this is the holy tomb
that mechanism for descending underground back there  what powers it when i tried to come by myself it wouldnt even budge
this is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest along with her children
it is said that our creator the goddess sothis sat upon this very throne professor do you recognize this throne
i do
so long  i have waited so very long for this day sit upon the throne i have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess
i do not
there is no need to hide anything from me you have seen it havent you in a dream 
well  it was supposed to be but a step away what could possibly be missing
sorry to disturb you when youre distressed archbishop but it seems some uninvited guests have arrived
 dont move any of you if you move your lives will be forfeit thank you ever so much for guiding us this far the imperial army will now take possession of everything in the holy tomb
the imperial army what are they doing here
so they knew we were heading to the holy tomb and followed us here
hey who is that standing next to the angry guy could that be  
the flame emperor i see so youve been allied with the empire from the beginning
what are they doing here what do they hope to gain
theres only one goal for grave robbers like these right flame emperor youre here to steal the treasure that rests within the holy tomb
for a fool you catch on quickly those crest stones will be ours that infernal power which is masquerading as a medicine but is truly a poison will plague this world no longer
insolence you will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place  professor destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator
your house ventures into the holy tomb to receive a revelation from the goddess in that hidden place deep beneath garreg mach a shocking truth is revealed
i will not allow such violence from the empire strike down the rebels and protect the holy tomb
the crest stones are in the caskets open every last one of them
the holy tomb must not be desecrated protect as many of the crest stones as you can
heretics what could be gained from desecrating these tombs and disgracing the dead
i guess were fighting over who gets those crest stones  what in the world do they intend to use them for anyway
take away every last one of those crest stones
that is enough do you even know what those stones are
take away the crest stones all of them
that is enough do you even know what those stones are
im told its fine to kill those who resist now then how shall i cook you
wait  no i was just following orders i just  graaargh
despite what i said i have no intention of killing you so why not stand down and get out of my way
so the end has come 
professor i will make no excuses thank you for all that you did for me in truth   no lets leave it at that
you could have had a peaceful life  why did you have to come to garreg mach
you wish to interfere then your life is forfeit
you are the one person i did not wish to make an enemy of 
do not try to say you have forgotten  do you know just how many people died in duscur
why bother with this stay silent and fight
so you want to turn your eyes away from the lives you have trampled dastard you are a monster the lowliest beast i have ever known
so youre the fabled flame emperor go ahead and enlighten me what are you planning to do with the crest stones what did you use flayns blood for whos kronya whos solon
silence there is no need for you to know
is it that mask thats to blame for your curtness if so maybe i should rip it off and ask again
ugh 
 
so the end has come 
is this some sick joke the flame emperor is actually edelgard
is this some kind of twisted joke
ive been looking for you  i will take that head from your shoulders and hang it from the gates of enbarr
stop right there
 
before i break your neck there is one thing i must ask you
stay out of my way
i dont recall giving you permission to speak answer my question that is all you have left to do flame emperor no edelgard tell me now why did you cause such a tragedy
 
you killed your own mother and yet you havent even had the decency to stop and consider the reasons behind your actions have you
i already told you i had nothing to do with that
ha it was foolish to think i could reason with a lowly beast
your majesty now
you are a monster 
come hubert
to flee is futile wicked girl the church of seiros will raise its entire army against you until you have been captured and punished you have defiled the holy tomb dishonored the goddess and humiliated your brethren that crime will never be erased even if you burn in the eternal flames and spill all of your blood into the goddesss soil
come professor let us return and decide upon our next course of action
ngah 
are you ok
i cant believe it edelgard 
we werent able to defeat her
your highness 
i will kill edelgard with my own hands i swear it  lets return to the monastery professor it is clear what must be done
you have disappointed me edelgard to think that a descendant of house hresvelg would dare betray the holy church   professor kill edelgard at once she is a danger to all of fódlan such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating
i have achieved my objective i will retreat farewell professor if we meet again it will be on the battlefield
come hubert
to flee is futile wicked girl the church of seiros will raise its entire army against you until you have been captured and punished you have defiled the holy tomb dishonored the goddess and humiliated your brethren that crime will never be erased even if you burn in the eternal flames and spill all of your blood into the goddesss soil
come professor let us return and decide upon our next course of action
im not exactly on friendly terms with the princess but i do have a few questions for her edelgard said that the crest stones represent power that means she knows how to use them she almost certainly knows other secrets of fódlan as well  once things calm down a bit theres a lot more that rhea needs to tell us
i just hope theres still time i have this strange feeling  that history is being written that an age of anarchy is upon us lets hope im mistaken
you have disappointed me edelgard to think that a descendant of house hresvelg would dare betray the holy church 
so it is my teacher who stands in my way i always knew it would come to this 
professor kill edelgard at once she is a danger to all of fódlan such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating
i will withdraw  for now
come hubert
to flee is futile wicked girl the church of seiros will raise its entire army against you until you have been captured and punished you have defiled the holy tomb dishonored the goddess and humiliated your brethren that crime will never be erased even if you burn in the eternal flames and spill all of your blood into the goddesss soil
come professor let us return and decide upon our next course of action
you  how dare you
 my teacher i   thank you but are you certain that   no now isnt the time for discussion
words cannot properly express my gratitude professor
so this is the choice you have made you are just another failure your presence soils this holy tomb and disgraces my brethren i will not allow one who would lend our enemies strength  to wield the power of the goddess sothis i have passed judgement and now i shall rip your chest open  and take back your heart myself
 that must be the immaculate one 
yes the monsters that have controlled fódlan in secret for far too long rhea is their leader
there is no time to waste your majesty professor we must escape while we can
edelgard and hubert have disappeared they will surely return to the empire the knights have been dispatched to search and investigate if there is any movement we will know we cannot ignore the possibility that there will soon be open hostilities between us and the imperial army when that happens are you prepared to fight your own if you wish to return to the empire i will not stop you that is your choice to make
if edelgard is acting afoul then we have no choice but to strike her down
its up to us to stop them we have a war on our hands
i have no interest in fighting not even for her and yet  
how are we supposed to decide just like that
edie hubie im sorry about this but  im siding with the professor
her doings are wrong it is our duty to make everything right
i am sure you all have much on your mind i encourage you to confer with your professor and make a decision you have until the fighting commences  professor i am depending on your strength for the safety of fódlan
the leaders of the church have misused its creed to fulfill their true desire   to rule the world they have fooled the people of fódlan long ago they divided the empire to create a kingdom and then divided that kingdom to create an alliance they did all of this to make the masses bicker amongst themselves they caused instability in order to reinforce their own authority they gathered gold and lived in extravagance how by preying on the devotion of those who wished for the goddesss salvation those corrupt hypocrites cannot lead fódlan to true peace their foul belief system must be torn asunder so that true wisdom may finally prevail and so i have decided   by order of the adrestian emperor edelgard von hresvelg   the empire hereby declares war on the church of seiros
i cannot believe it  let us recount the situation as it stands professor after you returned from the holy tomb  the adrestian empire declared war upon the church of seiros as well as our allies
declared war
edelgard demanded her own father relinquish the throne and then assumed the position of emperor she has deemed the church of seiros to be an evil of this world and is calling upon the people of fódlan to help her tear it down i must discuss our response to this declaration with the archbishop after the knights return from their investigation until then watch over the students see that they remain calm
so  hes finally shown his true face the same dimitri ive seen once before a beast who loves spilling blood
youre wrong im sure of it there has to be an explanation 
i knew hed been carrying the burden of that tragedy i understand his thirst for revenge his family and closest friends all massacred right in front of him but it still doesnt add up there must be more that we dont know
thats true dimitri didnt come unhinged until after the flame emperor was unmasked 
you dont think theres some connection between those two do you
professor the empire has declared war on the church of seiros
we knew this day would come sooner or later
whats going to happen
dont worry
we need more information
we cant afford to be optimistic its entirely possible the kingdom will be invaded
settle yourself ingrid we need to carefully consider our options
we cant just act rashly that will only make things worse
one weve ascertained the situation we must return to fhirdiad  your highness 
 
i heard what happened teach the princess   well the emperor now   she really did it didnt she the lords and dukes of both the kingdom and the alliance have been called out and now have to choose between the church and the empire the seed of conflict was always there and now we find ourselves in the middle of a war that will tear fódlan in two
the empire is rash but i never thought it would come to this
how could something like this happen i hope everyone back home is safe
im sure its mass confusion at home right now my brother must be worried sick about me
only time will tell
lets calm down
youre absolutely right teach im sure a lot of us are worried about our homes but  all we can do now is prepare for battle  and tread carefully
/***EOF***/
hoarfroast now graces treetops and open fields alike and an icy chill blown in from the north of faerghus blankets the land all of fódlans creatures begin to settle in for a long winter the setting sun bathes the full winter coat of every wolf in a foreboding scarlet glow hunters can now spread the word that the red wolves are back on the prowl
thats what were dealing with is there no chance its an infectious disease
there are no absolutes in medicine but the chances are extremely slim restless movements fits of violence becoming bedridden or even impossible to wake  with symptoms that varied there are only a few possibilities its either a mixture of poisons or magic and dark magic at that
youre talking about remire village arent you manuela
oh my if it isnt jeralt tell me what was the first thing you heard
everything after you mentioned that its not likely its an infectious disease my child and i owe the people of remire village if somethings happening there we must help them
we scouted the area ourselves speak with the knights hear what they have to say i must go thank you for your help manuela
you know im more than willing to go with you to remire village  after all i owe you my life if youd like i bet we could even manage the mission all by ourselves just the two of us 
thats nice of you
professor a bit of a tease are we a girl could get used to this side of you
im afraid not
youre saying no well arent you just a great big bore
nice try but ill be going to the village as well enough nonsense its time to move out
as you like good bye jeralt good bye professor
ill be in my office making preparations what about you if you have the time it would be helpful if you could go ahead and talk to the knights
 
hey whats wrong
im ok
i just got a little dizzy
if anything feels off return to the infirmary no need to just grin and bear it got it
ugh  what could have caused such dizziness i felt it too actually  ive felt that way before 
you look unwell its because of what happened isnt it
dont speak of it aloud
you cant change the past for now all we can do is use it to our advantage
i know that i also know that i must steel myself to ascend the imperial throne
those preparations are going well we  someone is coming
professor i heard about our mission for this month something terrible is happening in remire village thats where you were when fate sent you our way this feels preordained
are the knights making progress with their investigation
i dont know
they are
if what is happening there is by design there must be someone pulling the strings there is the death knight of course and the mysterious mages who were implicated with the western church they showed up when flayn was kidnapped as well and now there is another strange occurrence near the monastery  it seems an unknown organization hopes to make the monastery its stage for something
do you believe that all of these incidents are connected professor
i do
that is the logical conclusion but im not so sure
i do not
oh im surprised to hear you say that but actually i agree
it certainly appears that all of the events surrounding the monastery are connected by a single thread however  i think its possible that it may just be a result of different motives overlapping remember professor  if you think of people as simply enemies or allies it may be impossible to grasp the truth
i see so youll be staying here for some time then honestly im surprised ive heard its been a few years since you last donated to the church
that was merely because of the financial situation of my territory i assure you it has nothing to do with my dedication to the church by the way dimitri  isnt edelgard currently enrolled at the officers academy as well
yes shes in the black eagle house i dont believe she has any plans to leave anytime soon why not pay her a visit
i may do just that its nice to stay in touch with my dear niece every now and then of course im also delighted that i was able to speak with my nephew as well whether through marriage or otherwise family is family after all
of course the feeling is mutual
professor  if you were watching you should have made your presence known
who was that
that was lord arundel the regent for the empire he is also edelgards uncle
an acquaintance of yours
he called you his nephew 
my stepmother was his younger sister we are not related by blood but he is technically my uncle
in other words 
so you and edelgard 
yes my stepmother was edelgards birth mother edelgard and i are siblings by marriage we can delve into that topic another time for now lets make preparations to investigate whats happening in that village
oh dear the princess of the empire and the kingdoms prince are kin how very odd
so thats why he was worried about her 
all beings are attached somehow to those who are their family yes even i i must have had a family too  i wish i could remember them my family  i wonder who and where they are and what theyre doing now
i find it odd as well 
they likely harbor knowledge they do not wish to share oh yes im sure of it but i suppose we must wait until the time of truth arrives 
in any case  about this arundel youve heard that name before correct
in the library
quite true we came across that name within the library right where the prince had been
in the office
your memory is worse than mine the library we came across that name within the library right where the prince had been dont you recall
i thought that arundel had died  and yet not so he seems alive and well i wonder what the prince had hoped to learn from reading of his uncles charity  so many things the prince has yet to tell  how bothersome 
tomas doesnt seem to be here  oh well thats fine ive been researching the heroes relics a lot since we last spoke to him i found out something interesting
why have you been researching them
why do you have to ask trust me what really matters is what i found out
something interesting
its about the connection between crests and the heroes relics the crest stone of each relic is carved with a specific crest the one that has the ability to wield it properly the crests are the keys you need the right one to safely use a heros relic the only thing i cant figure out is why doesnt the sword of the creator have a crest stone bearing a crest
its by the whim of the goddess
hey now no need to write off my findings by saying its a mere whim of the goddess
it had one in the past
precisely at least thats my current guess
theres more i believe the crest stones might be the source of the relics inhuman power when miklan transformed into a black beast he was taken over by something that originated from the crest stone and the crest stone was on his body it all seems to add up now look at this picture i found in the library
that creature is called the immaculate one who was supposedly sent by the goddess to save the followers of seiros see the pattern on its brow and the faint circular boundary isnt it possible thats a crest stone if all this is true then crest stones are what power the ability to assume massive forms like that of the immaculate one and maybe the heroes relics can harness that transformative power 
oh it is you have you seen tomas recently
no such luck i was hoping to speak with him myself but he seems to be out on the town
i see well  hm where did you find that picture
it was in the library why do you ask is it something my youthful eyes shouldnt be seeing
no of course not however that is not part of this librarys collection it must belong to tomas it would be problematic if it got mixed in with the other books i will take possession of it for now
 take it away where no one can see it you mean 
what was that
thats what tomas said he said records that the monastery doesnt approve of tend to disappear
tomas said that preposterous i have far too much to accomplish to waste time with this foolishness
he was certainly in a hurry i wonder if hes off to confront tomas well he took the picture so i guess thats that for now ill see you later teach
so the church is hiding something after all some massive secret about relics and crests a secret that must have something to do with the professors true identity 
i do not know why it is so but being here makes me feel quite unwell i am so sleepy and a bit  it is a struggle merely to stay conscious  are you feeling the same
i am
and yet it feels familiar  as though pulled from a corner of my memory from a time long ago  i simply cannot fathom it
i am not
why must you be so difficult i know the entire contents of your heart and soul so you should know there is no fooling me
they say that things rarely if ever go according to plan still plan we must after all if we dont effectively force things to go our way nothing will be achieved how about you professor are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself
i am
your character must be stronger than most
i am not
thats surprising  but i suppose its possible youre telling the truth
they say that things rarely if ever go according to plan still plan we must after all if we dont effectively force things to go our way nothing will be achieved how about you professor are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself
im sorry to ask this of you but i would deeply appreciate it if you would promise to keep my association with edelgard to yourself it is a complicated history what she and i share
professor you seem unwell how are you faring if youre not feeling well id strongly recommend some rest
even if i spend all my time rummaging through this library theres a limit to the knowledge that can be gained apparently it only contains books whose contents have been deemed appropriate by the church if only tomas were around i bet he has some interesting stories he could regale us with 
what in the world is happening in remire village i hear even the knights have been dispatched i hope its nothing too serious  after all thats where we first met i have valued memories of that place
need something professor i was just asking monica here to be less demanding of lady edelgards time
hey its not like im bothering her sorry for the ruckus professor please dont worry about it too much nooothing to worry about here
ugh i wish you would worry about it a little more
remire village  is that not where you met edelgard if you had not been there something terrible could have happened did one of the house leaders know that mercenaries were staying in remire village i wonder  it will remain a mystery for now all we can do at this point is speculate
i fear i may become a social recluse soon  my life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall although i guess a real recluse wouldnt leave their room eh that would be me if you werent my teacher locked away in my room reading napping never to be seen you know i never see bernadetta outside of class i wonder what it is that she does in her room all day
i fear i may become a social recluse soon  my life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall although i guess a real recluse wouldnt leave their room eh
hey professor did you see that my father came by during the battle of the eagle and lion he left soon after but i saw him talking to edelgard first i wonder what they could have to talk about
your father
yeah hes pretty important in the empire i thought i mentioned it to you before hes the minister of military affairs
empire business perhaps
i guess that would make sense he is the minister of military affairs after all
still though  i couldve sworn those two didnt get along
what is it sorry ive um  ive got a cold
get well soon
um thanks
no you dont
how did you know my act was perfect alas tis no mere illness of the body but a malign affliction of mine soul so um back to bed
 
congratulations on winning the battle of the eagle and lion did you get a special reward i certainly feel like i earned a special reward dont you professor
no winning is its own reward
i was afraid you might say that i do wish youd dote on me just a bit more 
aww  disappointing
this is a place of mysteriousness i have awareness of how much difference every part of the world is in a place alike to this place you can imagine the goddess of fódlan truly existing at times i miss those places in brigid at times  i am missing those places so painfully
all this month his highness has been going out late into the night he will not speak of it to me professor do you happen to know anything
as i recall 
lord arundel is here that may well explain it
i dont know
i see i am sorry to trouble you with questions
his highnesss headaches have been growing steadily worse i would prefer that he retire to bed early
investigating remire village be on your guard
you know professor the tournament fish and the meal we indulged in after the battle of the eagle and lion  why all of the food ive eaten in this monastery has been absolutely delectable every last bite of it
food really is the only thing you think about huh
hardly i think about all sorts of things
oh like tomorrows menu for instance
im worried about remire that affliction is a little too mysterious for my liking im pretty sure its not normal
ive heard its not an ordinary disease
then what could it be
ive heard its the work of a cursed specter
wh what ah come on dont tease me but what if it really was something like that how could we hope to stop it
i wonder how remire village is faring hopefully were not dealing with some new epidemic it wouldnt be unheard of almost 20 years ago a terrible plague blazed through faerghus it even hit the capital city taking the queen consorts life or so i heard the whole kingdom was in an uproar over that loss the person who saved the kingdom wasnt a doctor but a holy woman the fair lady cornelia after that she was awarded the honor of being a mage in the service of the royal family she sounds like an amazing woman but  she must be pretty old by now but hey maybe shes aged like a fine wine
oh goodness is something the matter professor you look a little pale  please be careful its so easy to catch a cold this time of year
hmm  the librarian is always out and about these days and just when i had some questions about a book id borrowed  ugh now im so curious about where hes gone off to hed better come back soon 
how are you feeling professor you look rather ill if you dont mind my saying so are you sick if so i would urge you not to push yourself too hard take some rest
nothing gets by you
just my natural talent nothing out of the ordinary enough wit now you should lie down
what an unexpected kindness
what is that supposed to mean never mind if youre not feeling well you should stop trying to walk it off and simply lie down
hey professor can i get your advice on something i just dont know what to do anymore i used to think they were the best but now i cant even stand looking at them
its ok to be worried
but worrying about it wont solve my problems what if i can never eat fish again
time heals all wounds
good point professor i think i need to see other meats right now then i can come back to fish when im good and ready
ah professor the battle of the eagle and lion was such good fun dont you think
ignatz how long are you going to keep harping on about the battle of the eagle and lion
aw come on let me gush did you see how the house leaders came together after the battle what an incredible thing to witness harmony even after something so hard fought
true if they can keep playing nice perhaps there will be peace in fódlan after all
i heard about remire village from some of the knights its certainly troubling if its a contagion we at garreg mach should be on the lookout as well
i dont believe it is
oh well thats better but i wonder what the real cause could be  your words are oddly persuasive professor even if theyre not exactly based on anything
ill handle it
your words are oddly persuasive professor even if theyre not exactly based on anything
good day professor well then i should go
professor captain jeralt just told me remire village is in a bad way right
the situation there is worrying yes  but tell me how is your vertigo
im all right now
were you not feeling ok you seem fine to me
i hope youre not just saying that we cant have you putting on a brave face only to fall in battle
still a little unsteady
are you not feeling ok you should get some rest
hm if you must go to the village make sure youre in good health before we depart
professor  do you ever wish you could return to your life as a mercenary
i do
i thought you might traveling the world just you and jeralt  how lovely it must have been
i do not
is that so i suppose you have become accustomed to your new line of work this months assignment will again take you outside of garreg mach to remire village
it was in remire that you first met alois and the rest of his order was it not half a year has come and gone since then how quickly time passes 
what is it i am in the middle of my daily duties i assume you know by now that the four saints are all important figures in the teachings of seiros  still i have a particular fondness for saint cethleann
i am so happy to be part of your class professor i honestly cannot recall the last time i interacted with others on a daily basis like this  it reminds me of when i was a child ha that was so very long ago now 
how long ago
oh i mean very very very very long ago
youre still a child
despite how young i may appear to you im quite mature you may be surprised you know
im going to catch me some mighty fish just you wait and see i didnt catch a single fish last month but this month this month
time to give up
thats exactly what captain jeralt said
maybe youre doing something wrong
im casting my line just as the captain taught me all those years ago 
youre going with the captain to investigate remire village arent you it feels like so long ago that you two came here 
of the four or five years since i started here this is certainly the busiest
it was four ive been here five
oh whats a year here or there don t be petty now shamir
you count your enemies the same way
if i take care of them quickly what does it matter how many there are oh sorry we didnt mean to ignore you professor
as you were saying its been a busy year there never seem to be enough hands for the work
that reminds me do you have that thing if you do we want it
want no we need it give it to me not her
hey now im the one who brought it up we may be friends but thats just rude
professor tell me is this about remire there are more villagers acting strangely today than yesterday knights have been dispatched yet  the underlying cause is as yet unclear and the most anyone can do is stand back and watch it is most distressing professor what do you think about all this
some kind of illness
if it were indeed a disease why would it only affect the villagers and not infect the knights stationed there
some kind of conspiracy
in that case we should strengthen the guards if you visit the village professor please take care
punishment from the goddess
the goddess you have spoken near blasphemy and i would suggest a hasty apology
i thought we might make it through last month in peace but no another incident just had to arise didnt it if only this debacle had to do with crests why id have gone and dealt with it in an instant
i know you figure medicine and magical healing are two ways to do the same thing but its way deeper than that medicine is all about preventing infection and suppressing symptoms with well medicine  thats probably obvious but magical healing is focused on closing up wounds faster raising a bodys vital energy stuff like that
the knights go out from garreg mach to take on all kinds of other duties id sure like a job like that one day then again i dont know  serving lady rhea here is pretty good
greetings professor nothing to report oh except that tomas departed the monastery and is yet to return consider that reported hes been gone for periods of time before and has always returned so im not too worried still  i wonder what in the world hes doing out there
weve got to go now
whats going on
ok
the situation in remire village has changed drastically we dont know much more than that were hearing reports that the villagers are killing each other some say houses are burning regardless we need to move
kill kill ahhhh
haha  hahaha  hrngyarhh
help somebody please help
whats going on here 
this is horrific its even more revolting more terrible than i expected
im revolted too
it really is horrifying
true but if we are not careful how we proceed we will only increase the death toll
the villagers are all attacking each other lets knock them all out one by one
 always so reckless you do know that if we mess up we will either kill or be killed right
still we cannot just stand here twiddling our thumbs and doing nothing
id r really like to go home now but theres no time for thoughts like that
we have to help them
i am waiting for your orders with full readiness
wait those people over there  they seem to be observing the chaos they must be behind this eliminate them and rescue all of the unafflicted villagers
 ungh 
whats wrong with you
are you ok
i  dont worry about me im fine
dont waste your time on me saving the village is far more important we havent a moment to lose
what can we do amidst such confusion
well have to take up arms against the villagers who are rampaging if we strike carefully it should be possible to spare their lives
oh dear  isnt there a more peaceful way to deal with this
no matter how long it takes well need to check and rescue them all one at a time
those who have gone made may be victims themselves is it possible to save them
well saving the poor people who arent crazy is definitely our top priority lets get on with it
slow down annette it wont do anyone any good if we panic and get injured ourselves
isnt that  your highness suspicious figures spotted in the village they seem to be watching the chaos
are they the ones responsible for this madness if so its clear what must be done kill them all dont let a single one of them escape sever their limbs and crush their wicked skulls
this is unbelievable  theres no way to tell whos lost their mind from whos mad with fear 
if we dont act quickly things are just going to keep getting worse
its horrifying
i really dont want to get involved here but we cant leave these people on their own right
what can we do
how about we hit them hard enough to knock them out but not hard enough to kill them
thats too reckless but  ill admit i cant think of a better option
if some must die just know it was by the will of the goddess 
stop that marianne we have to save all of them theres no way this madness is by the will of the goddess
nobles are responsible for the safety of commoners by the honor of house gloucester i swear that i will save them all
claude there are some strange looking people here
so you noticed too look theres a suspicious group hiding amongst the villagers could they be the culprits if so 
they will not be forgiven
i wont let them escape
there you have it our objective is clear take down that suspicious group and rescue the villagers
a pattern of strange occurrences in remire village has suddenly erupted into something far more serious
there are some suspicious looking ruffians out there but our top priority is to rescue the villagers got it ill rein in the villagers whove turned violent you focus on rescuing the others
the one giving commands in the back  im certain thats tomas the librarian
the one giving orders to the others isnt that tomas the librarian
it cant be  the one giving orders to the weird ruffians  isnt that tomas
tomas what are you doing here dare i even ask
tomas what are you doing here
tomas what in the world are you doing here
im not tomas my name is solon the savior of all
whats the matter so shocked you cant even speak you were so easily fooled by my disguise  i was hiding away in garreg mach to get the blood of that little girl called flayn with her blood well be one step closer to realizing our goal
ill have a bit of fun here too 
thats the death knight he must be an ally of tomas or solon or whoever he is
they charge in without any plan whatsoever beasts all of them  the experiment is over kill them
solon what have you done you will not escape punishment
  i will cut you to shreds
you monster we could have saved them
kill kill
th thank you
weve rescued as many as we can now its time to capture solon
ah the cursed fell star  this will be a fine opportunity to measure your power
you are but a savage insignificant beast  yet you think you can kill me
tomas no  solon i will stop you
what if you insist on turning your blade against me then expect no mercy
my pleasure  do your best to kill me with that blade 
you are not the one i crave 
my blade craves their flesh  the weak will eventually die 
what are you trying to do here
youre the one who should be answering that question stay out of my way
the death knight was just a distraction lets concentrate on killing solon
we let him get away  that doesnt matter now our top priority is to kill solon
what does he want anyway in any case we need to take care of solon
why have you gone after this village what are you planning
heh i could have conducted this experiment on any test subjects now that i have what i came for i must bid you farewell
wait damn it hes gone 
we let him get away  ill survey the village there may still be enemies in hiding
i will survey the village there may still be some survivors
its over  all we can do now is focus on our next move ill have a look around the village there may still be people who need our help
it looks like we somehow managed to sort things out and casualties were kept to a minimum they said they werent picky about who they used as their test subjects because of them the people of remire village 
there you are
that armor so youre the flame emperor
yes i believe you have met my subordinate the death knight
oh weve met him all right but back to you youre the one responsible for the destruction of this village
do not get the wrong idea
what in blazes does that mean
it is true that i am working with solon but that does not mean our objectives are the same had i known they planned to do this i would have stopped it you have my word
your words are meaningless now ill have to insist you accompany us back to the monastery
i cannot abide that however if you wish to join forces i will hear your plea
what
if left to their own devices they will commit countless more violent acts like this one do you not wish to prevent that with the sword of the creator on our side solon would not be a threat 
i will join your cause
you are lying i can see that you cannot contain your fury toward me pity
i must refuse
pity though not unexpected
pray that you do not live to regret your choice
jeralt professor have you seen lady edelgard
jeralt professor have you seen his highness
jeralt professor have you seen claude
whats wrong kid huh damn it hes gone 
hey ive been meaning to talk to you since coming to the monastery youve changed
changed
how so
youve been angry since we first arrived in remire village and you look so happy when youre instructing the brats before the monastery id never seen you bear your emotions like that not once
you might be right
its thanks to the students
then perhaps its a good thing we came to the monastery if only so i could see your face lit up like that or maybe there was never any reason for us to leave the monastery in the first place 
a reason to leave
wasnt i born after you left the monastery
ah  ive put my foot in my mouth havent i though i suppose it may be nearly that time  come to my office when you next have a moment to spare theres something i need to tell you
just what was that about i cant recall a time of old when you were at the monastery  i wonder what is hiding in the mist that is your past 
professor i dont know if this is appropriate to say but admirable work out there i really believe we did all that we could
i wish that were true
jeralt said the same thing we must try to stay positive even through the horror
i wasnt strong enough
no mortal is all powerful we must try to stay positive even through the horror
i hear the so called flame emperor appeared in remire village as well hubert told me that you spoke with him
he said he wasnt involved in this incident
and do you believe him professor
i believe him
oh but how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are
i dont believe him
that makes sense its hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how theyre connected to all this
even if his words are true his objectives are still unclear but if the flame emperor should someday reveal his true intentions  maybe then he will appear before you without his mask and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe
he asked me to join forces with him
really is that what you want professor
i do
oh but how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are
i do not
that makes sense its hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how theyre connected to all this
even if he wants you as an ally his objectives are still unclear if the flame emperor truly wishes to make use of your power  perhaps someday he will appear before you without his mask and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe
edel i need to ask you something oh im so sorry did i interrupt
no not at all if youll excuse me professor
professor  i im sorry you saw that side of me in the village it must have been quite a shock to you and the others im mortified by my behavior when i saw the chaos and violence there my mind just went completely dark
i felt the same
i see  so that happens to you as well then
you werent yourself
i see why you would say that i always strive to keep my emotions at bay but  sometimes the darkness takes hold and its impossible to suppress it just shows you how lacking i am  i have much to learn
ive told you before that some day we may find ourselves facing something we simply cannot accept thats what the chaos in remire village was to me solon and the flame emperor are both beasts who must be eliminated demons who kill the innocent they arent even human at this point
the flame emperor said he wasnt involved
and you believed him he doesnt deserve our forgiveness he became an accomplice when he refused to turn himself in and return with us to the monastery
where is this anger coming from
it must be hard to fathom its true that i dont have any strong connection to those villagers and yet 
you see professor  i saw the same flames of torment just four years ago in duscur
please have mercy
gah the pain make the burning stop help me  somebody 
avenge us those who killed us  tear them apart destroy them all
ugh  gah  my father my stepmother  four years ago they lost their lives to those flames ill never forget  i still remember their faces their screams the tortured last moments of every person who died that day  but right now all that matters is that we do whatever we can to help the surviving villagers get back to their normal lives
thank you for everything  theres a reason that i came to the officers academy just one reason i came here for revenge and one day i will have it
hey teach that assignment wasnt my favorite ive got to admit i suppose pretending to be unaffected doesnt do anyone any good that was terrible to behold its always hard to see innocents die
it is
i wasnt strong enough
hey all you can do is keep smiling keep marching thats part of a leaders job you cant give in to despair not just for me or for you but for all of us in the golden deer house we have to keep smiling so the others can move forward too as long as we dont show that were disheartened theyll know they can make it too thats what matters
sorry for getting ahead of myself teach thats how i feel but how you handle it is really up to you by the way  i hear that guy who calls himself the flame emperor showed up in remire village i couldnt believe it when hilda told me the news what could he be after
the heroes relics
maybe after all he was after the sword of the creator in the holy mausoleum  but then they kidnapped flayn and used her blood for their recent attack based on that we should probably assume that their true objective is something other than the relics dont you think
you have a point
what do they want with flayns blood
they called this incident an experiment and they said they got what they came for that means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time sadly thats all we can assume there are far too many things we still dont know
world domination
ha i know i just laughed but that really isnt funny teach world domination  hm ok actually  i wonder they called this incident an experiment and they said they got what they came for that means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time i hate to even consider it but if they can replicate the incident at remire village on an even larger scale  if were not careful well have a full scale war on our hands then world domination wouldnt be a joke anymore
i dont know
i was afraid youd say that frankly theres way too much that we still dont know they called this incident an experiment and they said they got what they came for that means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time sadly thats all we can assume
flayn your timing is impeccable would you care to join us for a while fair lady
wha   why oh my
damn she gave us the slip in any case i doubt she knows the full story it seems more like she has something on her mind that she cant divulge
youre pushing too hard
we cant go easy on her
whoa there settle yourself teach
seems like it would be better to push seteth for an explanation or best of all to go above his head and ask rhea  now that we know tomas was an enemy we cant be sure that exposing the churchs secrets would be to our benefit where are the answers i seek where are they 
you did well handling that awful business in remire village i am certain the goddess shares in our grief at the senselessness of that calamity more importantly i was shocked to hear that our own tomas was actually a dark mage i must reflect on our blindness
you surely must you failed to notice that a rat was hiding in your home pathetic who are these wicked foes how did tomas escape your gaze
who are these villains
why did tomas come to the monastery
tomas came to the monastery 40 years ago by recommendation of house ordelia of the alliance around eight years ago he went back to house ordelia before returning to the monastery once again just last year after having worked at garreg mach for decades why would he betray us now just what did he hope to accomplish jeritza became a professor at the officers academy because of a recommendation from the imperial nobility supposing that he is the death knight that means that our enemy is an organization that has taken root in at least two territories
in the long history of the church of seiros  no long before even that  there have been an endless number of threats to the peace of fódlan yet those who oppose us still operate in the shadows their identities a mystery i believe that solon and the death knight are merely one part of a much larger whole
a threat to fódlans peace that means we have no choice we have to stop them all
what now
without knowing what their objective is we cannot afford to act recklessly the knights will investigate for now you and your class should focus on your training
they must be stopped
i have truly come to rely on you i believe that the monastery will remain safe so long as we have you we do not yet know the enemys objective or whereabouts for now please devote yourself to preparing for whatever comes next
that is all for today
professor please wait i know there is much that you still do not understand however one thing is clear you possess great power i believe that you are destined to be a source of great hope for all in any case i expect great things from you walk this world proudly dear professor may the goddess sothis protect you
the goddess sothis is that what she just said
is something the matter
its nothing
i see in that case farewell
i had never heard the name of the goddess
i see sothis is the goddesss true name please do not use it carelessly farewell
do not say something that we may regret she  i  what exactly am i for now lets leave this place please  go
/***EOF***/
from on high flocks of wyverns roar in chorus and soar the pristine skies heading south for the winter fódlans children lend their hands to winter preparations by gathering firewood and catching fish from the rivers cool waters yet all the while their gazes are turned skyward drawn to the magnificent sight above
professor you already know about the battle of the eagle and lion correct
only the name
i cant recall
i see in that case allow me to fill you in its a large scale mock battle between the rival houses that takes place every year
its scale is incomparable to the mock battle we fought during the great tree moon it will take place in the vast gronder field that is in empire territory to the southeast of garreg mach
whichever house defeats the most opponents wins of course the professors also fight alongside their respective houses
well usually professor manuela is being prudent she will not be participating this year since his long time rival will be absent professor hanneman has also declined
in that case i must sit out too
what should i do
oh dont worry about us you know you wanna see the kids in action
are you feeling any better professor manuela
thanks to all of you but id only be a burden out there my students dont need to see me collapsed well not on the battlefield anyway
correct we will not be participating regardless do not expect victory to come easily or at all
well put weve spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits you can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you
if im the only professor present 
this doesnt seem fair 
oh my look at you if youre as confident as all that my students will walk all over you
we have taught our students well there is no need to hold back challenge them with everything you have
the battle of the eagle and lion is finally upon us this is our chance to show off the results of your expert training professor
battle of the eagle and lion
have lady rhea and seteth really not filled you in well if thats the case im happy to explain
it slipped my mind
haha i highly doubt that if you dont mind id be happy to explain
the battle of the eagle and lion takes place every year during the wyvern moon it can best be described as a mock battle between the three houses
much like the one we had during the great tree moon do you remember professor
yes i remember
i remember our celebration most of all
it was certainly an unforgettable time ive never seen anyone put away as much victory food as you did that night professor
this battle will take place in empire territory at gronder field in other words far removed from the monastery its a mock battle between the three houses the house that defeats the most opponents wins
your highness if the rumors are true i believe professor manuela and professor hanneman will not be joining us
ah yes right you are given recent events professor manuela has opted to sit this one out since she wont be present professor hanneman has decided to skip this year as well
in that case i must sit out too
what should i do
oh dont worry about us you know you wanna see the kids in action
professor manuela are you feeling better already
thanks to all of you but id only be a burden out there my students dont need to see me collapsed well not on the battlefield anyway
in that case perhaps it is best that you sit this one out
correct we will not be participating regardless do not expect victory to come easily or at all
well put weve spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits you can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you
if im the only professor present 
this doesnt seem fair 
oh my look at you if youre as confident as all that my students will walk all over you
we have taught our students well there is no need to hold back challenge them with everything you have
its finally time the battle of the eagle and lion at gronder field is this month dont tell me you forgot teach
it slipped my mind
youre kidding come on teach i need you to keep it together for me dont lose focus when it counts
i know little about it
youre kidding didnt rhea or seteth fill you in guess i have to do everything myself around here
the battle of the eagle and lion is one of the academys annual traditions its a huge mock battle between the three rival houses
but you know all about rivalry battles professor there was one right after you got here remember i hear the battle of the eagle and lion will be held in gronder field far away from garreg mach
the house that defeats most opponents wins its a three way battle that relies heavily on strategy sounds exciting doesnt it
hey claude what about professor manuela do you think shell be able to join us despite her injuries
im afraid shes sitting this one out as is professor hanneman  as my persistent rival will not be present it only goes to follow that i must also sit out this years battle now leave me be claude
in that case i must sit out too
what should i do
oh dont worry about us you know you wanna see the kids in action
if it isnt our own professor manuela all things considered youre looking well
thanks to all of you but id only be a burden out there my students dont need to see me collapsed well not on the battlefield anyway
does that mean you really wont be joining us for the battle
correct we will not be participating regardless do not expect victory to come easily or at all
well put weve spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits you can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you
if im the only professor present 
this doesnt seem fair 
oh my look at you if youre as confident as all that my students will walk all over you
we have taught our students well there is no need to hold back challenge them with everything you have
hmph this monastery is more dangerous than i expected its likely that our foes have infiltrated the ranks of the teachers  and there may be others of questionable character about as well if you ask me there is something amiss about that old man tomas
what do you say edel shall we meet up in the library later to  oh hello professor
do you need something im a little busy at the moment
sorry professor ive got a lot of questions to ask edel here since i couldnt graduate last year i really want to make sure i can do so this year dont worry i wont participate in any assignments so as not to take any attention away from the younger students i look forward to learning from you professor
what do you say edel shall we meet up in the library later to  oh hello professor
do you need something im a little busy at the moment
sorry professor ive got a lot of questions to ask edel here since i couldnt graduate last year i really want to make sure i can do so this year
the battle of the eagle and lion  its name comes from the war in which the kingdom won its independence from the empire its imperative that we fight our best we must live up to the legacy of the king of lions
to hold a fishing tournament at a time like this  participate if you must but i urge you not to lose sight of our goal as for me i wont be joining in im so focused on the battle ahead i fear i would snap my poor rod right in half
flayn and monica was it im glad they were returned safe and sound
going all the way to the empire for a mock battle this is serious business and theres a reward to be had as well id really like to win this thing everyone else seems to be raring to go too were all looking to you to guide us teach
going all the way to the empire for a mock battle this is serious business and theres a reward to be had as well id really like to win this thing
seteth that stubborn goat holding a fishing tournament now just last month he looked like death warmed over
the battle of the eagle and lion is a free for all contest among the three classes if you are victorious the archbishop will no doubt present you with a reward
consider me motivated
im not interest in rewards
just what i thought youd say
you know the empire used to control all of fódlan but after the civil war the northern region split off and became the kingdom later the eastern part of the kingdom seceded to become the alliance there are three powers today but a thousand years ago we were all united as one even now among the nobles of the empire there are some who dream of reunifying fódlan 
im just absolutely exhausted i swear to you professor every month were worked harder than the month before i had imagined the academy as a chance to possibly relax before our lives began in earnest
you came to the academy to relax
after graduating well enter into noble society which mean contending with all the intrigues and dramas that entails i want to just postpone life for a bit fish  nap under a tree  skip out on lectures and  well not on your lectures of course professor
it is what it is
agreed thats the church of seiros for you what is it they say those with power are obliged to use it
are you gonna participate in the fishing tournament professor
hi professor want to know something gronder is in the territory of house bergliez in the empire thats right next to my home the region of house varley oh oh no what if  what if my parents come to watch aaah
calm down
im calm of course im calm why wouldnt i be calm ugggh
i dont think nobles are allowed to watch
really are you sure you wouldnt say that if you werent completely sure right
fishing no thanks i tried it once and ugh gross i dont even really like to eat fish let alone catch and gut them besides who can think about fishing right now the battle of the eagle and lion is coming up soon feeling confident
very
thats the spirit
not really
oh have a little faith in yourself professor youll do fine im sure of it
i fished with frequency back in brigid i will not have losing will you be trying to fish too
the battle of the eagle and lion draws near his highness insists upon training well into the night he has said it is nothing to worry about but how could i not be concerned
did you want something
ever since the tournament the kitchen is completely overtaken with fish the cooks cannot keep up
im not interested in glory or prizes all i want is a formidable enemy to sink my teeth into as far as i can see there are only a couple of opponents worth my time
since we were little ingrids always gotten this odd look in her eye when someone brings up food
you know im pretty good at fishing my older brother used to take me out why dont you give it a try too they say we can eat whatever we catch
a fishing tournament huh sounds fun but not as fun as reeling in the ladies heh just kidding of course the most important thing right now is preparing for the battle of the eagle and lion after all the ladies love nothing more than a winner and around here theres no bigger game
thats the wrong reason to compete
everyone has their own reasons to fight at least im honest about mine
im sure they do
i knew youd understand professor
hmm  ah im so sorry i was lost in thought
you seem a bit down
its very kind of you to be concerned but i promise that im fine i was just thinking  the death knights true identity could it actually be professor jeritza
what were you thinking about
the death knights true identity could it actually be professor jeritza
gronder field is in the empire right i wonder how well get there i thought i heard that theres no path that goes straight from the monastery to the empire  oh perhaps well travel through alliance territory yes i see from the east we would go hm there ah yes that must be it
holding such a frivolous and downright ridiculous event so close to the battle of the eagle and lion  its absolutely absurd although they did say we could eat whatever we catch im a sucker for a good meal i just couldnt resist
i received a rare letter from my father recently he said that he is praying for the golden deer house to emerge victorious insistently praying my father attended the officers academy and won a glorious victory in the battle of the eagle and lion i think he is quite proud of that even to this day i suppose that shows how great an honor it truly is
hey professor did you hear about the fishing tournament you get to fish in the pond as much as you want the more you catch the more you get to eat
sometimes its nice to dangle a fishing line and let your mind wander id love to spend some time lounging around by a scenic river or lake
why would we go all the way to gronder field its idiocy to travel that far it may be a tradition but it takes forever to get there and is exhausting so pointless i guess theres nothing to be done about it even by you professor
excuse me professor um do you think it would reflect poorly on me if i chose not to take part in the battle of the eagle and lion
yes it would
oh i see 
dont you want to participate
well i dont really want to leave the monastery 
im not very confident but ill try my best
professor do you have a second its about monica does she seem off to you she was imprisoned for a long time but she seems to have recovered almost instantly and shes been bizarrely cheerful
now that you mention it 
you see what i mean i wonder if shes straining to seem happy just to make people comfortable
shes moving on isnt that a good thing
i guess youre right it just seems fast doesnt it
hmm  and why is she so close to edelgard anyway
why are they having a fishing tournament now are they just giving up on the battle of the eagle and lion youre not condoning this right are you
yes im taking part
what if youve got all this free time shouldnt you be spending it on your students
no im not taking part
good im looking forward to seeing you in action i hope captain jeralt will be watching
the situation last month was dire indeed the students endured great hardship i hope you are able to put all of that behind you so that you may focus on this months assignment
of course
a most reassuring response i trust that your class is in good hands
it will be difficult
that is to be expected i too cannot quite shake that feeling of unease even so we must both strive to put that nasty business behind us
i look forward to seeing your skills on display at the battle of the eagle and lion
i have something to ask of you
what is it
leave it to me
i have not even told you what my request is yet well fine
flayn has been through an awful lot this past month to make up for that i have decided to give her whatever she wants i asked her what she would like and she expressed a desire for a feast of fish since im sure the students would be interested i have decided to hold a fishing tournament here at the monastery i have left all of the specifics to shamir please enter and put in your best effort
i hear that you participated in the fishing tournament i appreciate you taking the time
i told my brother i had a craving for some tasty fish i did not realize when i did that it would turn into well this my apologies
im going to catch me some mighty fish just you wait and see er but they havent been biting 
your shouting is scaring the fish
what shouting everyone told me i was too loud so ive been using my quiet voice
maybe the fish are frightened by you
i didnt think of that ah the truth is right in front of me   just kidding as though a fish is smart enough to be afraid of me
can you believe what seteth said catch some tasty fish for flayn im her bodyguard
welcome to the monastery fishing tournament you look confused didnt seteth tell you about it just catch whatever fish flayn requests show any fish you catch to flayn
the fishing tournament is over i heard you did some fishing and that flayn is happy
professor has seteth told you were to have a fishing tournament given the events of the last month i believe this is just the sort of distraction we need staff and student alike
will you take part
im afraid i am not one for festivities i do enjoy a spot of fishing though
are you good at fishing
i do enjoy the sport yet i wouldnt say im particularly good at it
i believe it best that i stick to quietly fishing by myself
the recent happenings at the monastery  there is something going on behind the scenes here ive been commissioned to investigate as well as ive already mentioned this month im off to the kingdom you be on your guard ok
im not worried
well i hope youre right
im more worried about you than myself
 perhaps ive gotten into your head too much i wont go dying on you ive stayed alive this long after all
how are preparations for the battle of the eagle and lion going hm fishing taking it easy are you
i don t know if youve heard but flayn is very special her blood carries a rare crest  oh the lengths to which she could advance my research if only i was allowed to study her if only it werent for seteths strict orders he protects his sister with unusual zeal
you should give up
i dislike it but i agree the time i would spend begging him and accomplishing nothing would be better spent on other research
maybe you can convince him
have you ever tried convincing seteth of anything im not sure i could convince the man the sky is blue if he hadnt already looked up for himself
i always thought i was pretty good you know then i go and get stabbed ugh  but my opponent was the death knight so i figure i did pretty well to only get stabbed i wonder if its true that he is actually jeritza  whoever he is im going to make him pay it turns out that when i get stabbed i get really mad
he hurt you this time next time he may kill you
ill help you get revenge
im not going to let him get the better of me again
when you feel that first refreshing breeze upon your face you know it is almost time for the battle of the eagle and lion gronder field is within the empire but the path there from the monastery necessitates passing through alliance territory fódlans biggest river the airmid river flows along the border between the empire and the alliance you will have to cross one of the largest bridges upon that river the great bridge of myrddin
fódlan is big its not as big as almyra is but its still pretty big
do you want to travel around fódlan someday
travel i dont know  never thought about it i guess
do you want to go home to almyra
why do you think i would want to do that
greetings professor nothing to report young monica disappeared last year i thought she had simply run along home but it turns out she was kidnapped i cant believe it how awful it must have been for the poor thing they say her personality is completely changed but at least she seems more cheerful than before grateful to be alive perhaps
ah i see so you are jeralts child you so resemble your mother
did you know my mother
i did indeed i was acquainted with your parents ive been wanting to speak with you for a while now
who might you be
i am nothing more than a common monk i knew your parents once upon a time
ive been gone from the monastery for some time now because  well it matters not might i ask a favor do you mind terribly picking up some fresh flowers to place upon your mothers grave i am certain shed be deeply moved to receive a gift from you
gronder field is in the empire its actually part of my familys territory   house bergliez it is the largest field in all of fódlan the grain it produces sustains the whole empire wait  i sure hope we dont destroy all that grain
it is considered the most suitable place for a large scale battle
professor if it were up to you how would you approach this battle
i would fight them head on
i would surprise them with clever schemes
that sounds like a certain someone we both know but as you wish well use whatever strategy you think is best if the black eagle house bands together we wont lose
our strength is superior so if we do lose it would be on your shoulders professor
if youre not confident you can do this just sit back and leave it to me
 the most you will do is make things worse youll just get in lady edelgards way
are you two about to fight haha count me in wait no i think we all need to calm down
we have no lack of opponents i am ready to go hunting for our enemies
hunting isnt exactly  well i guess theyre pretty similar actually
im just gonna hide in the fort and cheer everyone on there um is a fort right
sure but its deep in enemy territory how kind of you to offer to cut through for us
what no thats not what i meant ugh good work bernie 
this will be your first battle wont it flayn you dont seem nervous at all
haha i shall give it my all
our battle will begin shortly the flag of the black eagles will soon grace gronder field
so this is to be our battlefield gronder field are you feeling confident professor
very
excellent thats most reassuring
im not so sure
weve seen your power firsthand so we know better than anyone what youre capable of beyond that we believe in you if its not too big a burden i ask that you believe in us as well
we can win im sure of it after all its not as though weve spent the last half year sitting idle and im feeling stronger this moon as though i could conquer a thousand opponents all on my own
thats reassuring
you can depend on me i hope you know that
dont get carried away 
im only joking of course  but perhaps it isnt a laughing matter i beg your forgiveness i must practice levity so that i can provide a more enjoyable joke when the opportunity next presents itself after all i hear that telling jokes is a good way to calm the nerves before heading into battle still i find it quite difficult
well its about time for the battle to begin everyone brace yourselves
hmph all im worried about is finding someone worthy to cross swords with
weve prepared and trained a great deal we should be fine right
youre always so carefree mercie dont forget we need to try our hardest out there so we can win
this is our chance to show how hard weve been working lets do our best
if i emerge victorious in the lauded battle of the eagle and lion the ladies are sure to take notice ill have to go into hiding
ugh is that all you think about actually as long as you try your hardest frame it however you like
haha i shall give it my all
no matter the battle i will never falter
were counting on your guidance professor lets show the world what the blue lions are made of
so this is gronder field  hey teach not a bad place to wage war is it
how so
absolutely
i knew youd understand
plenty of places to hide and our pick of paths to advance through its the perfect battlefield for our tactics i have my eye on that low hill over there see it its the ideal spot to lure our enemies to and then surround them with fire
its risky
fire is unacceptable
gotcha teach i know i know we want all students to make it back to the monastery with you in command we cant lose the imperial princess and the crown prince dont stand a chance
professor claude what are you two talking about
what do you expect its claude i expect he was foisting more of his ill advised schemes on our poor professor
oh you have me all figured out lorenz you know me better than i know myself
win or lose its an honor just to participate in the legendary battle of the eagle and lion
weve got to win so we can show captain jeralt what were made of
yes im ready lets go
haha i shall give it my all
ill just stay quiet and follow along so i dont get in anyones way
that will not be acceptable marianne the whole point of this exercise is for each house to act as one
do your best i cant wait to see how well everyone does
all right sounds like hilda will be taking control of a central hill and watching the battle from there
its almost time come on teach the battle starts now
you all should know  i am not about to go easy on you today
as long as we can pull off the win it doesnt matter how
our victory must be absolute no matter what it may take
it is time
forward now
for honor
the battle of the eagle and lion a traditional contest of strength between the three houses has arrived it will take place at gronder field which lies in imperial territory
the battle of the eagle and lion is set to begin at long last everyone show off the results of your dedicated training
remember were not just fighting for honor theres a prize at stake
its almost time to begin steel yourselves everyone
the black eagles and blue lions are fighting  maybe we can sneak right past them
a stronghold for me to seize splendid
there goes lorenz acting on his own  guess weve got no choice but to capture the central hill and cover him
this could be our chance dedue cut through the golden deer
ingrid make use of your mobility circle back behind the black eagles
mobile force you move up as well circle around to the rear of the black eagles
if you intend to act do it now hubert head toward the golden deer
ferdinand circle around to the back of the blue lions
mobile force you move up as well circle around behind the blue lions
the black eagles and the golden deer are already in battle we should take this chance to break through the black eagles flank
i will draw the black eagles out your highness
yes and while you are doing so we will take control of the central hill
if you stand in my way i will cut you down until you have no blood left to bleed
 
what i was just trying to rally your spirits now to victory
hey princess heads up theres a rat right by your imperial feet 
bah i huh how dare you make a fool of me you will not rile me with such childish tactics
ah so the sheer terror in your eyes was  something else entirely my mistake anyway it was only a joke
you really hope to unsettle me with childish jokes it wont work you must stand and fight
so it is time to cross blades  i never imagined such a day would come to pass
if the empire and the kingdom go to war well be able to fight as much as we please
i am sorry but that is not something to joke about the thought of fighting you is troubling at best
in that case i wonder when youll be able to stomach facing me in battle  do you need a few moments
this is a great chance for me to find out if the sword of the creator really is all its cracked up to be on that note youd better not surrender too quickly
hey your royalness if you promise to let me have the prize ill let you take the honor of victory do we have a deal
enough of your foolishness i  wait a moment you are trying to anger me is that it
saw right through me did you well if theres no deal ill just have to win this thing fair and square
i will happily face you here and now do not hold back claude
how far can i push myself with you as my foe  this will be a great chance to test our mettle do not underestimate me professor or you will fail
im sorry but i must retreat  you should have no trouble winning dont give up
i hate to admit it but it seems this is as far as the black eagle house goes
sorry but its about time i make my exit  the rest of you please finish the job
i hate to say it but it seems were at a stalemate looks like the golden deer wont be winning this round 
i fear i cannot fight any longer im sorry everyone  please continue onward to victory
i suppose my training wasnt enough  the blue lions have no choice but to retreat
that is the end of this years battle of the eagle and lion and the winners are  the black eagles
thank you for your hard work everyone i daresay that prize is as good as ours
that is the end of this years battle of the eagle and lion and the winners are  the golden deer
a victory worthy of a feast we did so well theres no way we didnt secure that prize
that is the end of this years battle of the eagle and lion and the winners are  the blue lions
we won and judging by our performance im certain we have earned the prize as well
edelgard professor that was a spectacular battle you both fought exceptionally well
complete and utter defeat  i would hate to make an enemy of you two
no need to get carried away with praise i know you both feel we won by a paper thin margin and i wont deny it if we were to fight again theres no telling who would prevail what do you think professor
the blue lion house was very strong
i am honored to hear you say that still i must continue to train rigorously
the golden deer house was very strong
im honored and ill level with you   i think that margin is at least as wide as two sheets of paper i mean that
they were nothing
professor well i suppose its ok to let victory go to your head just this once
in any case i hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use
agreed i would hate to know a future in which im forced to cross swords with you
true although the battle of the eagle and lion was originally named after a war between the empire and the kingdom but thats all in the past im sure even the name will one day fade from the pages of history
i hope so
lets do our best to get along
how admirable teach on that note i have a proposition when we get back to garreg mach lets have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses and by a grand feast i mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall
it would be a fine opportunity to know each other better count me in
so be it lets plan to meet up on the night we return is that ok with you professor
im looking forward to it
well celebrate our victory
whats gotten into you today im not used to seeing you this excited
 seeing such a big smile on your face is a rare gift  it makes me feel like i can maybe relax a little too
well done your princeliness im certainly not in any hurry to get on your bad side
i assumed you would attack us head on i clearly need to rethink my opinion of you well done dimitri
you both deserve equal praise for a battle well fought all three houses did extremely well dont you agree professor
the black eagle house was very strong
not strong enough clearly if theres ever a next time know that i plan to wipe that smile from your face
the golden deer house was very strong
its an honor to hear that from a fighter such as yourself but theres no getting around it the blue lions were better prepared
they were nothing
it only seemed that way because of the caliber of your command even now we must not allow ourselves to become complacent
in any case i hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use
i wouldnt mind ill accept a challenge from either of you at any time heh im kidding of course
that is nothing to joke about the true battle of the eagle and lion is best left in the past in fact i wouldnt be surprised if they eventually change the name of this mock battle
i hope so
lets do our best to get along
how admirable teach on that note i have a proposition when we get back to garreg mach lets have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses and by a grand feast i mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall
you really value that kind of thing dont you well i suppose no harm can come from it count me in
i have no objections either and you professor
im looking forward to it
well celebrate our victory
oh well im not sure thats the point  uh professor was that a joke
you look so happy i love seeing you like this i suppose that look on your face is just another boon from this glorious day perhaps the best one of all
well done claude i see your schemes are not to be underestimated
yes i must wholeheartedly agree as ever i have proven to be no match for you
it is the utmost honor to receive praise from your royal   im kidding of course really though i was lucky to have teach on my side in all honesty you two made me work for it if i had to face you again theres no telling which way it would go what do you think teach how did the other houses fare
the blue lion house was very strong
i appreciate that still it is clear that i must continue to be rigorous in my training
the black eagle house was very strong
not strong enough clearly if theres ever a next time know that i plan to wipe that smile from your face
they were nothing
too true teach that just about sums it up oh im sorry thats probably too hard for the losers to hear isnt it
in any case i hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use
agreed i would hate to know a future in which im forced to cross swords with you
i wouldnt mind ill accept a challenge from either of you at any time heh im kidding of course
well now that the three way battle has ended in an alliance victory i daresay its time for some post battle reconciliation the victor has but one request hear me out  when we get back to garreg mach lets have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses and by a grand feast i mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall
hmph i accept your proposition please notify me once your preparations are complete
it seems i have no choice but to drown my sorrow at losing in overindulgence ill help you with the preparations
its not a feast if you dont eat too much leave it to the imperial princess to say such wonderful things
thats not exactly what i said but  ugh forget it laugh all you want
oh if you insist hahahaha hey teach looks like youre having a good time too seeing you smile like that means weve got no choice but to have a great time tonight lets get going
its finally over  there were way too many strangers at that feast
put your chin high bernie it was a chance for you to have growth
but  but everyone was acting so friendly it was overwhelming 
linhardt i wasnt done talking to you if those alliance guys came at it from here and those kingdom guys came from there 
i know i know wed have been able to take them all out at once i heard you im going to bed now
did anyone get the feeling that there were already couples forming thats not really fair is it i wanted to sneak off with someone too 
i was hoping for some tea after our meal anyway would you care to join me
i suppose i can settle for you just this once ferdie
until today i thought it would fall to me to command and guide our ranks all by myself but with you leading us ive gotten to experience what its like to fight alongside everyone  and ive realized  how happy it makes me fighting under your command the emperor doesnt take orders from anyone its their duty to stand alone and lead the entire empire but maybe its better to have someone to rely on  so that you can support and guide each other through the darkness
am i that someone
i am unfit to guide an emperor
i may be heir to the imperial throne but first and foremost im your grateful student that will never change even when i fulfill my destiny and become the emperor i told you long ago that i wished to enlist you in the service of the empire well i take it back now i wish only for your continued guidance during my eventual reign
dont just hide away in the corner professor youre the reason were celebrating
its because of you that ive had the courage to leave my room for a bit each day  im im so grateful professor
we were all just discussing how well you led us remarkable
 your guidance is without parallel professor  i have had practicing of that phrase
your trainings been top notch really
whatever would we do without you
i have had the opportunity to experience much please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more professor
i feel the same  you are something special my teacher
i had a wonderful time today professor as usual i was astonished by how much you ate in the name of celebration really though i must thank you again our victory in the battle of the eagle and lion was thanks in no small part to you
we all did our part
yes that is true but it was your instruction that allowed us to reach our full potential
i agree
thats the spirit theres nothing wrong with acknowledging your own strengths every now and then
i feel silly admitting this now but when you first came to lead our class you unnerved me you never smiled and you never showed anger either and yet you didnt appear to be suppressing your emotions they just werent there at first i thought perhaps you just didnt care for us but i soon concluded that wasnt the case at all for the longest time i just couldnt tell what you were thinking it was as though you had no humanity whatsoever 
that stings
and now
youre different now in the half year weve spent together ive seen the glow of humanity in your eyes and in your actions countless times i am truly grateful to have had the chance to spend this time with you professor
what are you two talking about how dare you get chummy without us
getting cozy are we mind if i cut in
thats enough sylvain
oh please i would love to join you as well i have so many things i wish to talk to you about professor
oh me too i have so much to tell you and i want to thank you too
honestly professor i was only able to achieve so much because you were with us
ashe is right youre irreplaceable to us professor
yes that without you the blue lions  well we wouldnt even be the blue lions at all except for the blue part because wed be sad
i suppose there are worse things than fighting at your side
i have had the opportunity to experience much please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more professor
haha as you can see you have our trust as well as our admiration i look forward to spending the rest of the year with you
as do i
good then lets give it our all this year anyhow  its getting late we had better return to our quarters and get some rest
ugh i cant believe our house leader ate so much he passed out i guess he should just sleep it off oh professor great work today
as long as we have you and claude the golden deer house is unstoppable
i am sure we did not require claude for our victory but it certainly would not have been possible without our professor
haha im so please to be in your class professor you truly bring out the best in us
lets keep fighting and winning
i knew the tactics you learned from the captain would be something else i better work harder to catch up
i have had the opportunity to experience much please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more professor
because of you i managed to get through the fight without feeling like a burden thank you professor
i hear lady rhea and seteth are singing your praises too
you all worked hard
youre always so modest
our opponents were strong too
well i certainly cant deny that
just wait until you see my true power
oh wow i dont doubt it
you really showed them teach i would really hate to be on your bad side
oh look claude has been revived
your tactics were ingenious and youve somehow mastered the power of the king of liberations relic you really are incredible though you can be a bit absentminded at times your mind is like a giant bowl with a tiny crack in it 
claude saying that only makes your own mind bowl seem tiny
how dare you my bowl is much bigger than teachs unfortunately it doesnt just have a crack the whole bottom of my bowl is missing
in other words you are the absentminded one not our professor
thats true he just admitted it
hehe
its unusual to hear you laughing marianne your smile is really cute
i agree you really dont know how beauti   eh  never mind
it feels so great to laugh and joke around like this doesnt it  hm well look at that someones having a secret rendezvous in the courtyard 
all joking aside im having trouble sizing you up teach the honest truth is that id hate to have you as an enemy if possible i wish for you to fight by my side if i could use the sword of the creator we wouldnt even be having this conversation i bet if i could use it you would trust me to  right that selflessness may be what i like best about you
you fought bravely during the battle of the eagle and lion
comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the great tree moon the students have grown significantly i suppose i should praise your efforts
i can only call your deeds during the battle of the eagle and lion quite versatile
comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the great tree moon the students have grown significantly it is clear that this is a result of your guidance
in appreciation of your efforts and to show our high hopes for the future of your students i award you with this
please continue to instruct your students as a model teacher
so youve made good use of all my power after all i would have been upset if you had failed at such an easy task
it pains me to assign such a disturbing mission to you during such a blessed moment in time  however next month your assignment will be to journey to remire village to investigate an abnormal occurrence there
remire village  if i recall youve been there with your father many times
an abnormal occurrence
i have yet to ascertain the details but it would seem the villages have been acting strangely i have already dispatched the knights to verify the authenticity of this information they should be back shortly i suggest you begin by finding out what they have discovered
i pray this is not a bad omen  may the goddess protect you all

when the warm winds blow from the sea to the south of adrestia residents of fódlan know that the rainy season is upon them before the heavy rains take their toll young women hurry to pick the last of the white roses the ivory buds are woven into garlands and given as gifts to close friends or potential lovers
professor i have a new mission for your students
we have received reports that lord lonato has rallied troops against the holy church of seiros
who is lord lonato
why would he do that
lord lonato is a minor lord of the kingdom he has been showing hostility towards the church for some time now
a vanguard unit from the knights of seiros is already on its way to his stronghold castle gaspard lord lonatos army is nothing compared to the knights its quite possible the rebellion has already been suppressed
even so i would like for your class to travel with the knights rear guard to deal with the aftermath
war zones are unpredictable we do not expect you will have cause to battle but be prepared for the worst
excuse me you sent for me lady rhea
this is catherine she will be leading the knights whom you will be accompanying
nice to meet you weve heard a lot about you if you need anything just ask
she is one of our bravest knights and that is no small feat only an exceptional few have what it takes to join the knights of seiros this mission should prove useful in demonstrating to the students how foolish it would be to ever turn their blades on the church 
you have spent quite some time in here engaging in such idle chatter do you not know that we do not have a moment left to waste
i had forgotten
forgotten i dont believe that is the truth no it is more likely you were dreaming the whole day away you must try harder from now on
i should have listened more intently
you must try harder from now on
even within the knights of seiros catherine is the strongest by a large margin from what ive gathered why not seek her out as a sparring partner professor
lord lonato must know that his efforts are futile yet he cant help but fight if i were in that situation i would do whatever it took to ensure victory you can count on that
doubtless there are times when one must take up their blade even if theres no chance of winning but this  its downright senseless lord lonato knows better if he had enough allies to back his rebellion it would be a different matter 
allies
how so
ah my apologies i was just thinking aloud this whole situation is a bit too strange for my liking even with the necessary preparations in place there is always a chance that something unexpected will occur please be ready for anything professor
after faerghus lost its king there were many rebellions it is likely lord lonatos provocations are related how frustrating that i am too young to take the throne rendered powerless by age  if the throne is vacant much longer the kingdom will fall to ruin
first that bandit business and now a noble rebellion are we ever gonna do anything but find and subdue people well if were just going to tie up loose ends at least itll be pretty safe i dont mind stretching my legs for this one and if catherines going too theres a good chance well get a look at her relic in action
hey teach theres some minor noble rebelling in faerghus right he has no chance of winning i wonder what he hopes to achieve  huh are you going along to help sounds like an easy victory but good luck out there
something about this situation doesnt feel right why would a minor lord raise an army against a foe he cannot possibly hope to defeat
my central duty as a noble is to protect the commonfolk i abhor those like lord lonato who deliberately shatter the peace utterly disgraceful
he must have his reasons
i hope no one is hurt
you have a kind soul professor now i feel a little sheepish for showing anger and not empathy i apologize for my impetuousness
i heard about your classs assignment by the way good luck subduing those treasonous nobles
professor i feel i must speak to you about caspars eating habits ive never seen the likes of it he inhales entire plates of food in mere seconds
sounds unhealthy
hence my mentioning it to you good luck with him
he must have a healthy appetite
if that is a polite way of calling him a goat im inclined to agree
todays meal was delicious linhardt keeps bothering me about eating too fast says im gonna choke or something
its not safe to each so quickly
youre really gonna agree with that guy why is no one here on my side
when youre busy theres no alternative
absolutely i knew youd see things my way
♪hm hm hm hm hm  ♪ h huh um is someone there what do you want
professor about this months assignment  raising an army against the church really though it looks like we wont be fighting its still quite unsettling my understanding is that it will all be subdued rather quickly
are you going to fight alongside the knights of seiros hmm  let me know if you meet anyone i might be interested in ok
the plants of fódlan are different ones than in brigid and people here are unknowing of the spirits who watch over the earth and bless it only the goddess is known is that factual
this flower is one that is eating insects is that factual too i am wondering who watches over the plants in fódlan 
his highness is strong but on the front lines anything can happen losing him would be devastating for faerghus i hope the church understands that
best be on your guard
catherine hm her skill is impressive ill admit so is her sword but i think shes hiding something nobody knows anything about her past you should spar with her shes strong stronger than you are id bet
ngh  please professor there must be some mistake lonato would never raise arms against the church at least he never said anything to me about it
whats going to happen to lonato if hes killed i  i dont know how ill live with that
professor have you seen felix around i swear as soon as you take your eyes off him poof hes gone
i saw him at the training ground
ah of course hes there sorry for bothering you professor thanks
i saw him at the dining hall
ah right it is meal time sorry for bothering you professor thanks
dont you love looking after horses i do they repay your absolute love and trust with the same i wish girls were so easy to deal with 
ive heard whispers about lord lonato they say he is a very kind and gentle lord why would such a kind man suddenly raise an army oh professor you were working late last night werent you you shouldnt overdo it a ghost might rise up from the well to get you if you stay you too late or so im told
were going on a mission with the knights right i wonder if  oh  sorry its nothing i was just wondering if someone ive been searching for might be among them
youre looking for a knight
yes well maybe if hes here hes probably a knight though its also possible he became a monk 
i hope you find whomever youre looking for
thank you im definitely going to find him one of these days
to be honest ive felt a bit lost here at the monastery at a loss for what to do thankfully a sweet young girl reached out and offered help i believe shes seteths little sister
why does his highness take the side of the people of duscur i just dont understand it only four years ago they murdered our king and slaughtered the soldiers and knights who were with him all of whom were innocent even if he can forgive them i cant not ever what theyve done is against all codes of honor and ethics
we are truly blessed with how fertile the monastery grounds are every day theres something new to harvest
its a nobles duty to protect the commonfolk not to endanger them by rallying armies in such a feckless and improper manner abuse of that kind is no better than slavery a proper noble must guard the people from such a fate wouldnt you say
i agree
precisely why true nobility is well respected
we dont know all the details yet
there can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation let us put an end to this quickly
hey professor do you happen to have any food on you im starving no matter how much i eat before i train im always so hungry after my muscles must be going through a growth spurt
this place has so many breathtaking works of art i feel like im living in a museum each piece can teach us about styles and techniques from a thousand years ago
do you know a lot about art
im from a family of merchants so ive been able to see a lot of art but i wont pretend to be an expert
do you like art
oh yes very much im from a family of merchants so ive been able to see a lot of art
ah professor it would seem that a minor lord in faerghus is raising an army  this poses a threat obviously but not one for the kingdom for the church i mean faerghus doesnt even have a king at present theres something unsettling about this army you had better ensure were fully prepared
the monastery grounds are far too spread out feels like it takes hours to get from one area to another and no thats not because im getting lost im a fully capable mature person who never gets lost
oh hello professor  um was there something you needed
i came to see the horses
oh you like horses i like them too theyre such kind creatures
im just looking around
i see i wont bother you then 
professor your clothes are a bit dirty if you dont pay attention to your hygiene the girls wont like you i hate when my clothes get dirty thats one of the many reasons i find it best to train as little as possible
professor your clothes are a bit dirty id have expected you to be more careful seeing as how youre a professor and all i hate when my clothes get dirty thats one of the many reasons i find it best to train as little as possible
im studying here so i can be the best there is just like captain jeralt do you think ive got it in me to be a top tier mercenary professor
that depends on how hard you work
im going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here i can tell you that
you really want to bring the money in huh
i do though its about so much more than being rich its about honor
pointing a sword at the holy church of seiros is akin to pointing a sword at the goddess herself meting out appropriate punishments to the sinful  it is a sacred duty with which we have been entrusted as a member of the church yourself i hope that you will take that to heart
if you have a moment i would like to have a word it has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have been making advances towards flayn you wouldnt happen to know anything about that would you
not at all
actually 
if you do see anyone getting too close with flayn please inform me of it at once
if the flowers within the greenhouse are removed they will soon wilt and whither  is that not so professor i feel i can empathize with them  the flowers flowers that thrive despite their environment are truly inspiring are they not
past here is the holy mausoleum where the saints of the church of seiros slumber sorry but only a select few members of the church are allowed entry its open to the public on only one day of the year for the goddesss rite of rebirth
here to train you really are as hardworking as they say
thats an overstatement im just me
spoken like a true hard worker
thats right im a force of nature
huh maybe the gossips wrong hardworking people usually dont like to make a big fuss about it
what i desired fresh air
thats not like you
true 
the wind feels nice
hmph
castle gaspard eh ive been there once before many years ago  it was by request of the son of that family  christophe i think it was
im sorry but i must vent to someone professor youre familiar with manuelas slovenly behavior yes that woman she borrowed a book last week and returned it with stains of unknown origin on the cover and several pages either folded or torn just now she dropped a sandwich on the floor picked it up and kept eating when she saw my shock she said simply three second rule ugh
did you hear theres news of someone in the kingdom raising an army the kingdom the empire the alliance  they do love a good war dont they spilling the blood of young men and women and for what just to enjoy the horror of it
professor i heard that you may battle alongside catherine even among the knights she is something special⁠ a holy knight who is able to wield a heros relic still she can be a mite difficult
hey professor hows it going making lots of coin id love to catch up but im super busy right now working for money you understand
greetings professor nothing to report have you talked with catherine yet if the knights are the cream of the crop shes the cream of the cream oh and that relic of hers i hear its nothing short of amazing
since were heading to castle gaspard that means well be passing through magdred way the road is well known for its beautiful surroundings depending on the time of year it can be incredibly foggy though when its like that you cant enjoy the lovely scenery  lucky for us it shouldnt be too foggy while were there not that well have time for sightseeing anyway
i hear that lord lonato served the king of faerghuss older brother when he was younger or something like that he already had status and prestige so why raise a rebellion eh i guess its none of my business
catherine has invited me to train with her how much do you think i should train before im ready to train with someone that strong
lord lonato  he used to stay at the monastery rather frequently he was such as pious man a true believer  such a terrible shame i wonder what changed him 
next month is when a very important ceremony will be taking place at the monastery pilgrims from all corners of fódlan have already started to gather in anticipation i pray that you are able to nip this trouble in the bud as soon as possible
things we cant obtain here are likely obtainable by way of the underground are you unfamiliar with garreg machs underground the place is an absolute paradise for those who cant stay above ground
those abyssian idiots all they ever do is cause trouble wed best purge the entire underbelly of garreg mach
no matter how powerful our enemies may be there is no need to worry so long as were with catherine the mighty wielder of thunderbrand
thunderbrand
what are you talking about
you mean you dont know my weapon is called thunderbrand its one of the heros relics a long long time ago the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes which were passed down to their descendants its an honor to wield but im afraid there wont be any chance for that today our mission is to help clean up the aftermath not to fight
one must wonder why lord lonato would incite such a reckless rebellion
it all goes back to the tragedy of duscur 
ive heard of it
i remember that day well no one saw it coming
i dont know much about it
roughly four years ago the king of faerghus was murdered by the people of duscur i believe that about sums it up correct
to put it simply yes but theres more to that story they had accomplices within the kingdom as well lord lonatos son christophe was one of them and so he was handed over to the church for execution
the church executes criminals
speaking from the churchs perspective we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the kingdom which was in complete chaos
why was the king targeted
king lambert was attempting a major political reform needless to say he had many enemies
i have to say  its a real honor to accompany such a brave and distinguished knight none other than catherine wielder of thunderbrand
thunderbrand
you mean you dont know my weapon is called thunderbrand its one of the heros relics a long long time ago the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes which were passed down to their descendants its an honor to wield but im afraid there wont be any chance for that today our mission is to help clean up the aftermath not to fight
why would lonato incite such a reckless rebellion
you should know more about that than any of us ashe
well i dont lonato never mentioned anything of the like to me
he probably didnt want you getting caught up in his own personal vendetta
is ashe related to lord lonato
im lonatos adopted son he raised me as though i were his own blood he was always so kind i dont understand  i guess it has to do with christophe
what vendetta
how much do you know about the tragedy of duscur professor
ive heard of it
i dont know much about it
its when the king of the holy kingdom of faerghus was was murdered by the people of duscur it happened about four years ago 
its ok catherine please go on
right well lord lonatos son christophe was accused of being involved in that whole awful affair he was executed by the church
the church executes prisoners
speaking from the churchs perspective we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the kingdom which was in complete chaos
why was the king targeted
 
king lambert was attempting a major political reform needless to say he had many enemies
it really is an honor to accompany catherine wielder of thunderbrand i hear youre intimidating enough to silence the howling winds
thunderbrand
you mean you dont know my weapon is called thunderbrand its one of the heros relics a long long time ago the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes which were passed down to their descendants its an honor to wield but im afraid there wont be any chance for that today our mission is to help clean up the aftermath not to fight
why would lonato incite such a reckless rebellion he had to have known he had no chance of winning
it all goes back to the tragedy of duscur 
ive heard of it
i dont know much about it
you must be joking where have you been traveling that news of it didnt reach you
it happened about four years ago the king of the holy kingdom of faerghus was murdered by the people of duscur that about covers it right
to put it simply yes but theres more to that story they had accomplices within the kingdom as well lord lonatos son christophe was one of them and so he was handed over to the church for execution
the church executes criminals
speaking from the churchs perspective we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the kingdom which was in complete chaos
why was the king targeted
king lambert was attempting a major political reform needless to say he had many enemies
whatever the truth behind that incident may be lord lonato has harbored resentment to the church ever since well  to be more specific his grudge isnt only against the church its also against the one who turned christophe over to them 
report the enemy is approaching they cant be avoided their numbers are far greatly than we predicted they used the fog to slip past the knights perimeter
it looks like our mission just changed professor everyone prepare for battle
your house must help the knights of seiros suppress lord lonatos rebellion at castle gaspard though you are told not to expect combat the deep fog at magdred way sets you ill at ease 
with this fog its impossible to tell where the enemy might be or how many of them there are the enemy could be trying to surround us but they shouldnt have enough soldiers to form a tight circle take down anyone who breaks through the fog and lets push through
that smell  its fresh blood it seems the battle has already started within the fog
shouting from within the fog  it seems the knights are already battling
the conditions are the same for both sides  but were at a disadvantage for not knowing the terrain
proceed with caution wait for them to enter your field of view
you can earn a reward if your allies do not suffer heavy losses be careful not to let your allies flee
 lord lonato doesnt deserve such sadness and anger  now its your turn to suffer
  why lonato why did you drag so many others into this
you would think were just gonna do nothing while you try to kill our lord
the fog is lifting as a result of the dark mage being defeated it seems the fog was being caused by magic
i wont let you anywhere near lord lonato
 its you thunderstrike cassandra it was your wretched zealotry that killed my son
 the only name i answer to is catherine prepare to taste the blade of one who serves the goddess now you face a knight of seiros
 the fog has cleared theres nothing left to hide you or the filthy central church from the judgement of the goddess
lord lonato  please dont die 
im sorry but i dont believe lord lonato has the strength to carry on
i am sorry  but did you really think you would get away with this
 the nobles start the war but its the commoners who spill their blood first 
 you have been deceived by that witch  i will show you the truth
 you i will be the one to kill you no other
 you have lost all sense of justice  you want to fight me so be it ill send you to meet your goddess
 stand down ashe i must destroy these evil doers by any means necessary
 please surrender lonato whatever your reason for doing this we can still talk it out
 rhea is an infidel who has deceived the people and desecrated the goddess we have virtue and the goddess herself on our side
 even if all thats true dragging the townsfolk into it like this isnt right
 enough if that is how you feel prepare yourself im putting an end to this
i apologize your highness it is regrettable that we should cross swords like this
lonato i sympathize with your position i really do i have no wish to kill you but i am afraid you have left me no choice please forgive me
your highness  i cannot stop here for my child and for the people of fódlan if you will not stand aside then i have no choice but to cut you down
  that vile woman  christophe  forgive me 
  lonato i 
 i never thought id see lonato meet this fate  well done everyone lets gather our troops and go
damn it it was all so pointless ive never seen so many people utterly heartbroken 
forcing innocent citizens to risk their lives  that man was not a noble but a monster
what could have pushed lord lonato to this point
everyone was a bit shaken by the militia fighting alongside our enemies
no use dwelling on it
that is the reality of battle
if only everyone could face reality so unflinchingly the commoners who allied themselves with lord lonato believed they were fighting for a just cause it would be disrespectful to consider them simply victims when they died for what they believed in still we have no choice but to eliminate those who cling to unreasonable ideas of justice even if our enemies are the gods themselves we must never lose sight of our goal
thats taking it a bit far
is it such a day may come whether you expect it or not you should be ready
agreed
im surprised to hear you say that
really im just like lonato i too will be the sort of ruler whos willing to risk the lives of my citizens in service of a higher cause its not possible to change the world without sacrifice dying for the greater good is not a death in vain
professor  im afraid this incident is far more serious than anticipated
why  why did this happen lonato was always such a kind man  everyone in the village was was so nice to me and i i killed them i killed them all i had to i know i had to  i know that but still  what does that make me
please dont beat yourself up ashe we did what had to be done
im im sorry i shouldnt be bothering you im im going to check on the town i hope my brother and sister are ok
that that was my first time killing civilians too  those who im sworn to protect
it was a necessary sacrifice
that is the reality of war
are you insane those werent knights or soldiers but fathers and sons we we shouldnt have killed them we should have found another way  i im sorry its not fair for me to blame you for the circumstance i know that if we hadnt done what we did even more civilian lives would have been lost at least my mind understands that but my heart  professor  those in power no matter the era always claim they fight for a just cause that they take life to protect it but  is it truly ok to take any life you please all in service of some implacable just cause lord lonato didnt take up arms out of a lust for power he simply believed his cause to be just whos to say it wasnt maybe we didnt have to cut him down like that maybe we could have reached a mutual understanding found a path of peace i i have to believe that perhaps the notion sounds laughable to you mere lip service to naive ideals but i cant believe otherwise
sorry to intrude but this incident may be more serious than anticipated
nice work teach still that fight left a foul taste in my mouth that aside did you see how catherine fought
shes incredible
agreed i thought the power of the heroes relics must be exaggerated but i was clearly wrong
im stronger
ha i love the confidence teach but youre no match for the heroes relics theyre on a whole different level
makes you wonder about that legend 
what legend
oh its nothing just the usual fanciful nonsense an ancient relic that once cut a mountain in half with a single swing thats what they say anyway but as amazing as thunderbrand is i dont think it fits that description apparently relics can harness tremendous power for those with a compatible crest though you can technically use one so long as you have any crest at all i dunno long story short id like to try cutting a mountain in half someday
ooh are you talking about relics youll be able to wield one soon claude i just know it after all youve already been selected as the next head of house riegan
easy there hilda i dont know how apt soon is my grandfather is still unbearably healthy oh is this news to you teach yours truly was recently recognized as a legitimate child of house riegan they possess one of the heroes relics too though ive yet to see it
just recently
i officially joined house riegan only last year before then i lived with my father
you havent seen it
i was raised by my father house riegan is on my mothers side of the family
when i learned that my mother was the daughter of an alliance noble i was so surprised i thought the whole world was pulling a fast one on me for a week
so that means your mother is duke riegans daughter right where is she now
i cant say my mothers currently living in a different world than the one she grew up in and has no desire to return home
um ok you sure have a lot of secrets dont you
im just keeping a promise to my parents make of that whatever you will in exchange for my so called secrecy im free to do as i please which is why i decided to see what the other side of my family was like thats how i found out about this strange crest i bear 
professor claude it sounds like the troops will be withdrawing soon we should return as well
we won we should be celebrating instead were heading back with heavy hearts 
whoa there whats the matter you look as sad as a kitten without any yarn if we hadnt done what we did the rebel army would have followed this road all the way to the monastery and they would have crushed all the little villages along the way we stopped that from happening you should be proud
sorry to intrude but this incident may be more serious than anticipated
i found this on lord lonato its a note that mentions a plan to assassinate lady rhea we cant tell who sent it so the source is suspect but the content is too disturbing to ignore we must report this to lady rhea right away i hope that its nothing 
i am glad to see that you have returned safely the goddess is gracious with her divine protection but it was not only her divine protection that shielded you was it you are just as skilled as i had hoped
my students deserve the praise
i am not so sure
i still have much to learn
there is no need for modesty
i heard some of the students were hesitant about fighting militia however we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers even if those sinners are civilians i pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens
our real concern is what catherine reported the secret message that was in lord lonatos possession it contained a deplorable plot to target the archbishop on the day of the goddesss rite of rebirth the plan seems unrealistic at best but a threat is a threat we must maintain constant vigilance to that end i would like for you and your students to help with security on the day of the ritual
you can count on us
that is most reassuring you have my gratitude
we wont let her down
that is most reassuring you have my gratitude
wont that endanger the students
even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best they should be fine so long as they have you on their side
the rite of rebirth is of paramount importance it is when the church of seiros and its believers unite to pray for the return of the goddess the archbishop and i will be confined to the goddess tower once the ritual begins of course the knights will be on high alert as well but there arent enough of them to keep watch on every corner of the monastery it is far from ideal to be forced to mobilize students but the gravity of this situation requires that we all bend to avoid breaking
while there is no need to fear for my safety we cannot turn a blind eye to those who would blaspheme so heinously
with any luck this will all be for naught still be on your guard

long ago the guardian seiros made an appearance during this moon she had been summoned by the goddess whose soul was suffering as the flames of war raged across fódlan some believe that high in the sky above seiros the immaculate ones mighty wings are what powered the strong winds carrying the guardian and her forces into battle
youre here again  professor  youve been crying so even you cry sometimes oh  i suppose that was thoughtless of me to say
yes it was
long ago someone said the same to me
its fine
my teacher youre so blinded by grief that you cant see whats going on right in front of you
are you waiting for time to heal your wounds or have you curled up in a corner and lost the will to carry on
does it matter
it does youve lost yourself
how could you ask me something like that
its not like you to speak to me like that you know id never ask you a question without purpose
only you can truly understand your own sadness others can sympathize or even empathize but all anyone else can offer are the tears of an outsider looking in so i have no intention of crying for you or of standing still with you all i can do is promise to reach out my hand when the time comes for me to move forward
what do you mean
the mysterious organization that was carrying out experiments in remire village and the chapel  theyre up to something near garreg mach the archbishop has sent the knights to undertake a large scale investigation no information has surfaced yet but our enemies will soon be discovered when they are will you lead us into battle or will you just sit here with no thought for the future that is fast approaching my teacher  there is a choice to be made i hope you make the right one
my my she really is quite arrogant she spoke her mind without an ounce of reservation but she is right the time has come to stand again you already know what your answer is
oh thank you you saved me
if you were to die then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed preventing that was my only aim im afraid you must remain kronya there is something i need you to do
oh of course i am always happy to cooperate with solon leave it to me
how annoying
flame emperor  is she offending you unfortunately we cannot take our eyes off her so there is nothing to be done you are our greatest creation we used the defiled beasts blood as the fuel to your flame that you may burn even the gods now is the time to cleanse fódlan of that power and bring forth our salvation
there will be no salvation for you and your kind those responsible for such gruesome deeds in duscur and enbarr
all so that you may acquire the strength you need all for a purpose 
what are you going at this hour ooh i know  you are eavesdropping i must admit that i approve
professor we must remain quiet 
i see  the flame emperor and monica and the mage who rescued monica
its time for revenge
not yet professor
what is that guys name
i dont know but if we keep listening we might be able to find out
an unexpected change to hear their plans patience patience
oh thank you you saved me
if you were to die then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed preventing that was my only aim im afraid you must remain kronya there is something i need you to do
oh of course i am always happy to cooperate with solon leave it to me
how annoying
flame emperor  is she offending you unfortunately we cannot take our eyes off her so there is nothing to be done you are our greatest creation we used the defiled beasts blood as the fuel to your flame that you may burn even the gods now is the time to cleanse fódlan of that power and bring forth our salvation
there will be no salvation for you and your kind those responsible for such gruesome deeds in duscur and enbarr
all so that you may acquire the strength you need all for a purpose 
ive got you  finally 
wait
dont go out there
lets keep listening
if we dont act now well miss our chance
 hmm 
hmph even if someone has overhead us there is nothing they can do there have always been rats in the walls and there always will be
 
no  the dagger 
whats wrong
what about the dagger
it no never mind it couldnt possibly be so professor those are the ones we must destroy theyre the bastards who killed my family and jeralt for now lets return to the monastery and regroup as for the flame emperors dagger ill hold on to it for the time being
day 5 of the garland moon i picked some flowers for her and returned home the look of joy on her face at the sight of these flowers will be even more beautiful than the flowers themselves  yeesh that is enough his entries from before your birth are full of such romantic blatherings as that oh  it must be deeply moving you to hear such things but now is not the time for whimsy someone is here you do not wish for them to see you in this state so pull yourself together
i thought i might find you here teach not the type to wallow in solitude eh thats a relief let me tell you so  what were you reading is that jeralts 
diary
so it is
love letter
the contents are certainly bittersweet  but i think its jeralts diary
hey maybe this has some entries from when jeralt left the monastery
is that so  he was the captain of the knights but something made him leave the monastery in a hurry if it has something to do with your birth knowing what happened may get us closer to knowing what secrets the church is hiding  teach  would you mind letting me read that diary i know how important it is to you but im not asking lightly please allow me to borrow it
you may borrow it
im forever in your debt teach if youd refused i wouldve had to sneak in here in the dead of night i wasnt looking forward to that prospect anyway let me fill you in on whats been going on lately and not just as thanks for pointing me to that diary
i cant allow it
wait are you really saying im going to have to sneak in here in the dead of night to read it i know how important it is to you but im not asking lightly please allow me to borrow it
rhea dispatched the knights to various locations in a frantic search for the enemy theres a rumor that shes already secured some information something big is gonna happen soon that has me wondering  if you find out where the enemy is what will you do about it if you ask i  no scratch that all of us students would gladly lend a hand even if it means going against rheas wishes dont forget it now go everyones worried about you youd better show them youre in good spirits
if you must weep then weep i shall be here for you
thank you
well it would be ridiculous not to feel anything after something like that go on and let it out i am here
that wont be necessary
are you already past it you are unflappable i will give you that much in that case i will remain silently supportive you are right that we must keep moving ever onward
professor im so happy to see you youre finally returning to your old self to see the light in your eyes again is a gift it inspires me to carry on as well as you know the knights are searching furiously for any trace of the enemies who escaped ill inform you immediately if i learn anything relevant
what happened to jeralt  its terrible if theres anything i can do simply ask even if what you desire is revenge ill gladly lend you my power we cant let them get away with this
professor welcome back  i was  we all were   youve been on our minds know that your enemies are my enemies i will do all i can to help you find justice there is no one else i can  my strength is yours alone i will fight as you command  i will kill anyone should you ask it of me
im so sorry about what happened to jeralt  no of course my sorrow is nothing compared to yours the knights are even now searching for our enemies whereabouts they are to report back the moment they find something if you desire revenge professor you can count me in
hi teach i see the storm in your eyes has passed  youre looking much better ive been reading jeralts diary the baby he mentions  thats you isnt it i cant understand about half of whats written on here  but jeralt really cherished you that much is clear
i havent lost a parent yet so i cant even begin to understand how you must be feeling  but even while youre standing still the world keeps on moving i always find that oddly comforting
ive never been much for condolences how about a little logic instead the knights have spread out around garreg mach in search of jeralts murderers thus the monasterys fighting strength is for the moment at least depleted perhaps that was the enemys real objective we should be prepared for further confrontation
ive never been much for condolences
professor please lend us your ears ferdinand is saying impossible things
i do not see what is impossible about it all i said was that if you want to go back to brigid you probably can you are the empires guest so to speak they cannot afford for something bad to happen to you there would be a diplomatic incident someone close to us has turned up dead so one could argue that youre not safe here anymore
you were already told i am learning here from the academy what are you thinking professor
you do not have to leave if you do not wish it
you may return home if you please
i am not returning to home until i have grabbed my goal i will not be listening to the words of ferdinand
no look i did not mean to pressure you apologies for the misunderstanding
i slipped quietly into the vault and rummaged about looking for anything we might find useful there is a group of people who want to kill us after all what this is no time for asking permission i learned long ago that one can ask permission or forgiveness it is rarely useful to request the former still it appears that the knights have already taken everything useful there were crest related objects i thought might be worth studying so  there you go again with that stern look of course ill put them back when im done assuming they bear no additional use
im not even close to being strong enough i mean jeralt was so much stronger than me but even he  thats enough i cant dwell on the past theres no way to know what my future holds but i do know one thing whatever happens i have to make my own way in this world i have to keep pushing so i can grow even stronger
professor i um i brought some flowers for jeralt
thank you
its the least i can do sometimes i feel like all i do is run away 
youre out of your room 
hey sometimes i go out for uh walks 
anyway ill go lay them out
ive sung lyrics lamenting death many times on stage  but when something like this happens in real life  im lost i dont know what to say but i do know this much  sir jeralt must have been very proud to have you as his child
it is a shame what happened to jeralt i am sorry there are no words leave some flowers on his grave for me
dark expressions dont suit you professor but im  well im glad to see you out in the world again it seems this month will be a quiet one around here there arent many knights around to liven things up
most of the knights are gone seeking out the enemy
isnt that a bit much i agree its important but is it a good idea to neglect the safety of the monastery
what do you think professor
it would be a shame if we were invaded
i agree we can send some knights after our enemies but so many it makes the church seem reckless
youre worrying too much
hopefully the knights finish their business and hurry back i wouldnt mind having a few extra lances around
not just tomas but monica too we cant be sure who to trust anymore can we who are these people really what do they want
im so glad youre ok professor i was so worried
oh professor you must be starving mercie and i made some sweets for you we were thinking that if you were to eat something sweet it might help you feel better
thank you for the thought
baking sweets is my specialty im sure theyll do the trick
im fine
well of course you are and if you have sweets youll be even more fine
im so sorry  i never quite know what to say at times like these  just dont push yourself too hard too soon its ok to allow yourself to be sad right now losing someone dear to you  well each loss is unique but its a feeling i know very well that said  professor i 
there is no one here who has not heard tales of jeralts valor we have suffered a most dear loss i do not know what the enemys aim was but i do know this after what they have done we cannot suffer them to live if there is anything i can do to ensure that justice is brought swiftly you need only give the word
youve gotta keep yourself active during tough times professor even if it seems impossible thats how i got through when i lost my parents if you need help with anything just come and see me eating and training are my specialties
im scared i feel that i dont understand the world how could something like that happen to jeralt he was so strong
even though youre scared push through
youre inspiring professor ill do my best
what happens happens
i suppose but  please take care professor we cant afford to lose you too
im sure you will pull through this because youre so strong professor best to stay calm during such tumultuous and upsetting times we dont know the nature of our enemies if we underestimate them anything could happen
but if we dont defeat them 
i agree they must be defeated but i also feel we must approach this with prudence
we should be careful
yes i agree i dont want to lose you too professor
professor people are saying horrible things about marianne theyre saying shes friends with the bad guys if i hear someone say that ill 
leave it alone hilda it doesnt matter
just ignore it
of course thank you professor
well defeat the bad guys well show them
that would be the quickest way to resolve this come on marianne lets give it our all
ill say a prayer for jeralts soul theres not much else i can do 
professor it seems like youre holding up ok but  im worried about leonie she really loved jeralt i hope she can bounce back 
captain jeralts gone hes gone and wed only just reunited  im sorry im sorry im sure this is even harder on you but i just cant  i cant believe 
professor  how are you holding up i know how heavily grief weighs upon ones heart  i lost my mother some time ago it was  forgive me my moment of weakness even all these years later i cannot recall that time without feeling the pain as if it were brand new just know that i am praying for your mind and your heart to find peace
first tomas and now monica i do have a theory though i admit it is nothing more than speculation both tomas and monica have each gone missing at one time or another it was reported that when monica returned from her disappearance she began to act like a completely different person as if perhaps the real monica had been killed and replaced by an impostor thinking of it like that it is possible that this solon had been impersonating tomas for some time how they managed such a convincing change of appearance though i still do not understand
you have lost your father  now more than ever do i understand how very lucky i am that you were able to save me professor i deeply appreciate what you have done thank you if there is anything at all i can do in return please tell me ok
youve lost someone very dear to you  im so  you have my sympathy manuela and i can take on some of your workload this month we cant do all the teaching but at least we can lighten the load for you ive always seen strength in your eyes i know youll recover youre a very strong person
i have something rather uncomfortable to discuss its about the weapon that killed jeralt will you listen
ill listen
it was a dagger but i know enough to know it wasnt an ordinary dagger it wasnt made of iron or steel because  well because whatever it was the wound it left wasnt normal who could make a blade like that do you figure
i wont listen
i see  thats probably for the best
i wonder who they were 
oh goddess hear my prayer please receive this beloved person when the cold rain washes the body when the bird and wolf announce the dawn  receive them into your blue blood receive them into a twinkling star thats a mourning scripture from the church of seiros lady rhea taught it to me i pray that jeralt is happy in the next world
i heard jeralt passed away  my deepest condolences i knew him long before i ever even met you  he was always so much fun to be around  its such a loss 
professor  thank you for all you have done for us nothing to report today sobs
professor i know where the enemy is  where solon is theyre in a place called the sealed forest close to the monastery the archbishop is gathering the knights to begin a search shes doing so in secret behind our backs
why in secret
she must be afraid that a thirst for revenge will compel you to seek them out now that you know will you give us the order
no i will not allow it
this discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest it is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there they are the ones who took jeralt from you  i know how you must despise them but i must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now
you cant stop me
please professor do not act carelessly i ask that you leave this to us losing you so soon after losing jeralt would be unbearable
lady rhea our professor is not acting out of revenge sending us out there is the most strategic move we can make you cant deny it most of the knights are still far away not only does our professor wield a heros relic but there is no one here who is more powerful seteth and the few remaining knights cant leave the monastery unattended we have fought under our teachers command countless times we are the most effective army here and we are already prepared for battle we have no idea what the enemy is plotting we must act now
professor  do you agree with this strategy
understood i will give you the order destroy the enemy that is hiding in the sealed forest  you have the protection of the goddess on your side whatever happens you shall overcome
lets go my teacher whatever happens do not lose your conviction out there
professor have you heard they say weve finally located the enemy it seems theyre hiding in the sealed forest right near the monastery lady rhea has summoned all of the knights to return and take them down and all of this is being done in secret why to keep us no to keep you in the dark
why the secrecy
lady rhea likely assumed you wouldnt be able to stop yourself from confronting the enemy if you knew their location but that is not how this story ends is it professor  were at the ready order us to depart and well fight at your side
no i will not allow it
this discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest it is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there they are the ones who took jeralt from you  i know how you must despise them but i must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now
you cant stop me
please professor do not act carelessly i ask that you leave this to us losing you so soon after losing jeralt would be unbearable
lady rhea seteth please try to understand our reasoning before you refuse with most of the knights still far away we cannot afford for you two to leave the monastery undefended the enemys strength is yet unknown the only warriors who likely stand a chance are those who wield relics with all that in mind its obvious who should be dispatched is it not if the professor leaves we will go as well weve already made preparations and are ready to depart at a moments notice surely you must see that we cannot wait any longer for the knights to gather please  do what must be done and give us the order
professor  do you agree with this strategy
understood i will give you the order destroy the enemy that is hiding in the sealed forest  you have the protection of the goddess on your side whatever happens you shall overcome
no matter what enemy we face we will not fail i promise you that
teach tomas  i mean solon and his lackeys their whereabouts have been discovered apparently theyre lurking in the sealed forest not too far from the monastery rhea has called back all of the knights who were out searching to round them up seems like it could take some time for them to make it back here but she didnt ask for our help
why keep it a secret
perhaps to prevent you from running headfirst toward revenge its only natural that you would leap at the chance for it anyone would
no i will not allow it
this discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest it is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there they are the ones who took jeralt from you  i know how you must despise them but i must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now
you cant stop me
please professor do not act carelessly i ask that you leave this to us losing you so soon after losing jeralt would be unbearable
listen rhea erm lady rhea this move is the most strategic the military strategy im devising will soon echo across fódlans history im sure of it just think about it most of the knights are still far away and we cant afford to have seteth and friends abandon the monastery so the only person who can take action now also happens to be our best commander its teach and wherever teach leads well follow and since youve taught us that this sort of thing is always a possibility were already prepared for battle we can buy the knights more time not for revenge but for a defensive attack on behalf of the monastery
professor  do you agree with this strategy
understood i will give you the order destroy the enemy that is hiding in the sealed forest  you have the protection of the goddess on your side whatever happens you shall overcome
we have our orders teach now all thats left is to pull out a miracle
we are now within the sealed forest we must not let our guard down
professor  well avenge jeralt for you no matter what
remember  it is a bad idea to get distracted by revenge
i have readiness our enemies will be taking we will take our enemies down
well its not like we have any other missions this month i suppose this is as good a way as any to spend our energy
linhardt spending energy we had better finish this fast before the pigs start flying everywhere
lower your voice the enemy could be close
it is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life
professor i know im the one who insisted we come here but dont doubt for a moment that the enemy is waiting for you
lady edelgard what are you saying
what other objective could they possibly have we have no clue what kind of trap is waiting for us please be careful my teacher we cant afford to lose you 
the enemy is strong but you will prevail you must
the sealed forest is up ahead stay alert
this is for captain jeralt i will not falter
it is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life
leave it to us professor ill give it my all
fighting tomas  it will be difficult thats for certain
i dont really love the idea of fighting people i know 
we dont have a choice even if its difficult an enemy is an enemy weve just got to get it over with
just kill them from behind as long as you dont see their faces you wont know if you know them
we wont know unless we see their face  yes i suppose that is true professor  i hope you know i meant what i told you before your enemy is my enemy and i will follow you until the end whatever that end may be
thats reassuring
lets do our best
yes right well fulfill our duty together weve come this far we cant stop now i hope you know that you can rely on us no matter who the enemy is we are prepared to cut them down
yes  no matter who they may be 
the sealed forest is up ahead visibility is awful there so everyone needs to be extra cautious
you seem to know a lot about it it is just a forest isnt it
have you been there too oh  never mind listen just like i told the archbishop this is not a war of vengeance its a riddle so to speak those guys are undoubtedly planning something terrible we need some kind of clue as to what the attack on the holy mausoleum that foul business in remire the demonic beasts at the chapel  it cant go on we need to figure out their objective and stop them from achieving it thats our mission
so we have our mission now we had better not fail
it is a difficult task but we will succeed
it is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life
an enemy whose objective you dont understand is a frightening prospect
were gonna destroy em its our mission
i will have my revenge whatever it takes on that i will never budge
leonie  you will have what you seek
ill admit vengeance sounds pretty nice but dont forget that were here for information luckily we can easily find what were looking for while getting revenge for jeralt right teach
in the pursuit of justice for jeralt you and your students find yourselves deep in the sealed forest
look there demonic beasts i suppose they arent holding back
demonic beasts the enemy was always intending to lure us here 
how kind of them to welcome us with demonic beasts theyre not playing around
hello youre here welcome to the forest of death my name is kronya this weakling girl was just a borrowed look for me
this is what i really look like now you vermin  ill take down every last one of you
if this takes too long i might be forced to escape oh or do you simply intend to let me go how accommodating of you as for me i intend to kill you all
how cute youre trying so hard but now its time to die
youre a fool to be so brazen youll never avenge your father at this rate ill have to kill you too with my own hands
huh what are you   are you here to kill me
i am prepare yourself for death while you still can
monica youll pay for what youve done
i told you i am not monica i am kronya do not call me by that fake name
i dont care what youre called i dont care if it takes my last breath ill kill you
please my powers are beyond your comprehension youre just a filthy worm
but how how could i really lose to a lowly creature like you
well
solon dont just stand there and stare i need your help
yes you most certainly do
huh
have no fear kronya your sacrifice will help to rid of this world of the filthy vermin that have long infested it
solon  stop this
the time has finally come to unleash the forbidden spell of zahras upon our enemies
please help me 
begone with you fell star
that could only have been magic what happened to our professor
they were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell an eternity wandering in a void of darkness never to return to this world  to think we almost had the sword of the creator 
youre lying our professor is alive i know it
thats right our professor is no ordinary human
it is hard to fathom that our professor would die in a place like this
it is possible that death has yet to find your friend but there are worse things than death drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape  overwhelmed with hopelessness  it must be torturous
youre already boasting a victory but know this  if you did use such devious tricks to stop our professor  i swear that you will regret it
i cannot help but agree with her this once even if our professor is trapped in darkness that is not the end of their story
i will not forgive such arrogance if you prefer it so you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead
what was that sorcery what happened to our professor
they were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell an eternity wandering in a void of darkness never to return to this world  to think we almost had the sword of the creator 
thats a lie theres no way the professor is really dead
thats right our professor is no ordinary human
i do not believe our professor has fallen
it is possible that death has yet to find your friend but there are worse things than death drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape overwhelmed with hopelessness  it must be torturous
we cannot abandon hope your highness our professor lives i know it
youre right we will save the professor but first lets destroy this fiend ill slice you into a thousand pieces as we watch with horror  you will know true pain before i finally allow you to die
how trite but if you wish for pain i shall oblige if you prefer it so you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead
wh what was that where did you go professor
they were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell an eternity wandering in a void of darkness never to return to this world  to think we almost had the sword of the creator 
i dont believe anything you say our professor is still alive
thats right our professor is no ordinary human
i refuse to believe that teach would die in a place like this
it is possible that death has yet to find your friend but there are worse things than death drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape overwhelmed with hopelessness  it must be torturous
hey all i hear is good news teach is still alive and if thats true then theres only one thing to do defeat you while we wait for teachs triumphant return
prepare yourself we will avenge our leader here and now
how trite but if you wish for pain i shall oblige if you prefer it so you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead
 
you fool
what were you thinking charging right into an enemys trap are you just a boulder that rolls down whatever hill its on no even a boulder has more sense
im sorry
apologizing wont make things right this darkness is terrifying
i can explain 
excuses wont help us this darkness is terrifying
as you and i are one  i too am trapped within this void but please consider this  this realm of darkness we are in is seperate from the world from which you came i mean that it would take a god to leave this place in time our hearts and minds will cease to be are you prepared to die
i am
how very brave of you to joke at times like these 
i am not
i thought as much i also do not wish to die and yet 
there is no other choice 
what choice
do you recall your fathers diary he said you were a child who never cried nor laughed i think i am the one to blame i must have been asleep but even then i feel i was a part of you i do not know how rhea managed it but she allowed me to exist inside of you the truth is i have always been with you it is within you that i found my power yet again the power of a goddess the power of the progenitor god
 
my name is sothis by now you must be well aware of what that means i am the one who watches over fódlan and the creatures dwelling there i am sothis she who died then returned
i cant believe it
somehow i know it to be true
there is only one thing left to do to save us from this darkness of eternity i must now use the power of a god however i lack a body of my own and so i must relinquish all the power that i have to you the time has come for you and i to join as one and when that comes to pass then i shall disappear
disappear
i wont allow it
when i say disappear i do not mean that all i am will be no more my soul will join with yours and you and i will never be apart but i will no longer have a chance to speak with you i shall miss it so long have i been on this path with you through you i got to see and hear this world i even got to chastise you from time to time i may not have acted like a goddess but it was certainly fun for all that you have done  thank you im glad that it was you to whom my fate was bound
thank you for everything
now  we must pray for if we share this wish our spirits two will join as one  your wish is to return to the forest stop the enemy and rescue the little ones no need for words i know your heart as though it were my own 
your will and mine are now as one both sides of time are revealed to you and you alone
you know i am the beginning what shall you do
so the fell star consumes even the darkness itself 
professor  it is you right i knew that you would always come back to us id like to ask about your appearance but for now lets dispose of our enemies
what did you see in the darkness of zahras this should be impossible the only being that can withstand that darkness is  unless i dispose of you myself i may never have the chance to send you back there
but this is not the end  thales will carry out our mission somehow 
its over now professor about your appearance 
professor  that is you isnt it i am glad you are safe i was sure that you would return please tell me all that happened to you later for now its imperative that we kill the demon
what did you see in the darkness of zahras this should be impossible the only being that can withstand that darkness is  unless i dispose of you myself i may never have the chance to send you back there
but this is not the end  thales will carry out our mission somehow 
thales  does he also serve the flame emperor it cant be 
teach  you are teach right i always believed in you  i knew you could cut your way out of anything
what did you see in the darkness of zahras this should be impossible the only being that can withstand that darkness is  unless i dispose of you myself i may never have the chance to send you back there
but this is not the end  thales will carry out our mission somehow 
i guess this is still far from over 
i have no time to waste on the likes of you 
to think that i would lose to mere beasts
i am terrified by you  even though an emotion like fear has no place inside me that means you must be eliminated
so this is how it is  i cannot let you live
you stole the words from my mouth you lost the moment you failed to kill the professor
that hair and those eyes  you remind me of someone what happened to you
the goddess gifted me her power
the goddess i see  well im happy for you your weapon is called the sword of the creator after all its no wonder she looks favorably upon you just as it was with saint seiros no doubt  and just how will you use this new power professor
for the people of the world
heh that is so like you to say that
for my students
for us i see 
for myself
that is no answer you must use your power for something greater than yourself
tell me  if the world and your students included were to divide and go to war with each other what would you do in that scenario each side would represent both the world and your students who would you  
professor have you fallen asleep this must be a side effect of your recent changes i cant just leave you here 
i shouldnt ask hubert to carry you so i suppose it falls to me 
professor  im glad youre ok and you seem relatively unscathed im im so relieved whats more jeralts foe is dead though we took little satisfaction from it professor  i must ask what happened after we were separated you look different
the goddess gifted me her power
the goddess appeared and gave you her power its as though the legend of old has been made flesh its hard to grasp in all honestly but having seen you pierce the sky with my own eyes i find myself unable to doubt it
a legend of old
yes the legend of saint seiros it is said that she received a divine revelation from the goddess and was gifted with her power long ago the goddess dispatched seiros to defeat an evil king who went mad with power perhaps the goddess saw the goodness of seiros within you too and wished to help you in your quest to defeat evil hm if youre seiros granted power by the goddess then i suppose that makes me  ah never mind im getting carried away
professor whats wrong are you uh  are you asleep what is happening these days well it matters not we must get you help and fast
sorry professor but i have no choice but to carry you back
teach we won ill be honest when i lost sight of you i broke into a cold sweat but jeralts killer is dead alls well that ends well
thats true
true 
youre kidding right i understood putting it off while we were in battle but now that its over just go ahead and spit it out that hair those eyes that unfathomable power what happened out there
i will tell you 
you mean to tell me that an entity who claims to be the goddess was living inside your mind and its been that way since you were a baby and this goddess entrusted all of her goddess like power to you and then vanished 
its a difficult story to swallow teach but the way you look now  i guess ive got no choice but to believe it how could something like that happen there must be a clue in jeralts diary if you believe the diary theres a high possibility that rhea did something to you when you were born thats likely when all this began what in the world happened to you as a baby and what was rhea after
teach whats the matter did you trip or  wait are you sleeping this must be an effect of the goddesss power i wonder if teachs body can handle the strain 
think claude what now should i carry him on my back easier said than done 
 in times flow see the glow of flames ever burning bright  on the swift rivers drift broken memories alight 
professor you must remain still
where am i
what happened
everything is all right there is no need to worry those who are trying to harm you are far away
  how lovely it would be for this moment to last forever  i wish i could hold on to this time we have stolen  that you and i could create a world without end  i have heard whispers of what happened to you your appearance  you have received power from the goddess from the moment you took hold of the sword of the creator  i prayed that one day the radiant power of sothis which bathes fódlan in its celestial light might reside within you but you are so much more than the light you are my  close your eyes dear one sleep just a while longer
i will be watching over you always always and forever

as you have already been notified your mission is to subdue some bandits our students have been learning about combat through study but this is a precious opportunity to provide them with practical experience the knights will support your mission and are prepared to offer their assistance if necessary in short this is no mock battle you must be prepared for anything you will receive a message from the knights when it is time to depart until then use your time wisely
the last time we fought bandits you saved me maybe i can return the favor this time
lets do our best
dont get careless
the knights are well aware of our enemys strength we can count of them to keep the battlefield under control for us it seems unlikely that we would lose still lets do all we can to prepare
this will be our first true battle im looking forward to fighting alongside you professor
as am i
im a bit concerned
during the mock battle your commands were thoughtful and thorough as was your strategy with you on our side im confident we will prevail it seems we have some time to spare before our departure lets use this opportunity to prepare as best we can
more bandits not very original teach
not interested
you need to focus
well as long as youre with us at least things wont be boring in fact  it may take a turn for the interesting and with that i take my leave to make my final preparations
you seem well are you adjusting to life at the monastery
i think so
oh i didnt expect that answer when we were mercenaries i handled everything outside of battle you didnt have much contact with people did you i thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you but i guess i was wrong to worry
not quite
well i didnt expect it would be easy on you when we were mercenaries i handled everything outside of battle you didnt have much contact with people did you i thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you it seems i was right to worry
by the way i heard about those bandits your first assignment is to take them out right thats fairly routine for you by now but dont forget its the first real taste of battle for those brats itll be tougher to sleep at night if you let one of your little pupils die so stay vigilant and lead them well i wish i could offer you my support but lady rhea wont allow it for now ill try to figure out what she wants from you i dont mind you settling into your life here but dont let your guard down ever
  a girls voice  what could it mean
for some students this will be their first time stepping onto a real battlefield its important that theyre mentally prepared as for me ha do i look green to you is there anything you wish to ask me about regarding spending your time at the monastery or battles
just as students have much to learn from other students professors can also share their knowledge with each other you should consider seeking instruction from professor hanneman or professor manuela i think youll find their insight quite interesting
which house a student is assigned to depends on where theyre from that said each professor has their own area of expertise so if a student is adamant about it it is possible to switch someone from one house to another pending your approval of course if you become closer with the students by partaking in the various activities around the monastery youll be able to talk to them about such things
youre quite powerful to have beaten us in the mock battle such a shame you arent leading our class 
we have only just arrived at the academy and were already being sent out to take care of bandits it is a noble mission but one that will likely require battle in practice there is little difference between a battle and a war even with the support of the knights of seiros we must still brace ourselves for the challenge do you have any other questions about life at the monastery or about battle
just as students receive guidance from professors professors may also guide each other if youre interested you should seek out professor hanneman or professor manuela
a students house is determined by their place of origin but naturally each individual has their own aptitudes and interests that said if a student so desires and their current professor consents they may transfer from one house to another if you get to know the students better through the activities at the monastery they may approach you about this
your performance in the mock battle was exceptional professor you have inspired me to follow your example and study even more diligently perhaps we could train together sometime i would love to test myself against your sword skills again
those bandits really didnt think things through did they they had to have known the knights would be after them the moment they entered the monasterys turf fine by me though im raring for some real combat experience any chance to grow is a good thing is there anything else you want to ask me teach about living at the monastery or combat anything like that
students arent the only ones who have something to learn from their professors professors can also learn from each other if you want to you should try trading knowledge with professor hanneman or professor manuela
the house a student belongs to is determined by where theyre from but it is possible for someone to switch to a different one of course thats only if the student very strongly wants to make the change and their professor is on board with it if you do a lot of different activities around the monastery youll get closer to students and they may ask you about it
i hear youve been tasked with hunting down bandits right meanwhile my class is stuck with a downright peaceful mission sounds like youll be fighting alongside the knights too dont let the monastery down teach
i fully accept the necessity of real battle from time to time but it is still a surprise to be tasked with punishing bandits without warning it is a rather different sort of mission it makes me wonder what the archbishop is planning 
ive heard your class is hunting thieves that mission is very different from the one we were given
do you know of the aegir family we have long held the position of prime minister in the empire the empires power lies with six noble families my family foremost among them the full explanation may be time consuming i can give you a moment to get ready if you would like to take notes
im not taking notes
im ready
all right i will list the six great noble families theres caspars father count bergliez the minister of military affairs then theres linhardts father count hevring the minister of domestic affairs beradettas father count varley is the minister of religious affairs huberts father marquis vestra is the minister of the imperial household finally we have duke gerth the minister of foreign affairs and my own father duke aegir the prime minister one day i will take his place as the prime minister of the empire i am more talented than anyone in my class   even edelgard i will lead the empire to a bright enlightened future
i look forward to that
that sounds like wishful thinking
there is nothing i cannot achieve
swimming through a sea of countless books tracking down that single sought after volume  its absolute bliss how do the poor fools who spend their days sharpening swords and polishing armor find any joy in life
hey there professor you here to check in on my training oh that reminds me i found this small cloth its kinda weird not really sure what it is but it works great for wiping up sweat
 
wh what is it im not doing anything
its not good to just do nothing
im not bothering anybody am i
hey whats this cake doing out here
cake oh come on  thats just cruel
oh professor  hello i was just looking for my  well its its like a pale blue cloth have you seen it
lets search for it
eh um  ok 
ill tell manuela
thank you so much
brigid has much more warmth than fódlan even spring here has coolness and you professor which do you find is worst too hot or too cold weather
the cold
i have agreeance in brigid i am able to be wearing much lighter clothes
the heat
but you are wearing many things professor if you are not liking the heat you should be wearing lighter clothes
it is better if you do not approach me if you spend too much time around a man of duscur there will be rumors
for years the boar prince and i were inseparable i know him better than almost anyone else so let me give you some advice beneath all that princely polish hes an animal nothing more hes strong and skilled sure but dont place your trust in him as a human being take care he doesnt chew you up and spit you out
its thanks to my adoptive father lonato that a commoner like me is here at the academy he is the very model of chivalry someday im going to be just like him
professor youre the one taking out the bandits heh thats one way to start your career at the academy i didnt realize theyd order us to risk our lives here seems a bit extreme doesnt it
our first assignment is to take out some bandits did anyone tell lady rhea that peoples lives are at stake i lost my own brother to bandits   is something someone has said at some point im sure ok not my finest attempt at humor
the cathedral is nice and quiet its so relaxing  oh professor did you come to pray to the goddess
thats right
me too shall we pray together
i did not
no but shall we pray together while youre here
ive got to find out everyones likes and dislikes so i know what to cook who knows when it will be my turn at kitchen duty how about you professor do you like sweet or spicy food
sweet
ooh same ill definitely remember that
spicy
spicy ooh your tastes are so mature ill definitely remember that
felix sylvain and i have known each other since we were children his highness as well though i should warn you that both felix and sylvain are a bit challenging at times the moment i take my eyes off them theyre off causing all kinds of trouble its always been that way
now that youre all the way over here professor care to join me in some training after training i love tending to the horses or burying myself in a good pile of books ahh theres truly nothing better
it is the duty of every fódlan noble to demonstrate piety toward seiros have you also come to offer your prayers to the goddess professor
sure
you dont sound terribly sure perhaps you are not of noble birth after all devotion is not as essential for a commoner
not exactly
i see the truth is i am not a particularly devoted believer either but it would be unbecoming for a noble like me to neglect his prayers wouldnt it
the next assignment is to track down bandits sounds like some training is in order tell me something professor when it comes to a one on one battle which is better strength or skill
strength
i knew it when its all said and done muscle always comes out on top
skill
you might be right but when its all said and done i still think muscle comes out on top
im so glad to be a student here if only because i get to use this library reading books from all the regions of fódlan  i feel almost like im visiting those places myself
you should visit them in person
id like to i dont have many chances to travel 
you can learn so much from books
i agree theyre brimming with the knowledge and experience of our ancestors
there were way too many vegetables in todays meal the ratio of vegetables to sweets was completely skewed  oh hi professor were you just eavesdropping on me well everyone knows a plateful of sweets is far preferred to a plateful of vegetables regardless of age
um professor our next mission is to go after a group of bandits im not very confident im afraid ill just hold everyone else back i should probably stay behind for this one or help plan the attack instead
uh hello um if youll excuse me 
im bored maybe i should go into town  but that would be such a hassle oh hi professor im rather busy right now so do make it quick
you dont look busy to me
ah you can tell i suppose being a professor has taught you how to ferret out time wasters
if youre busy never mind
are you sure i thought youd found me out for a moment there 
professor hey do you know how old captain jeralt is
thats enough leonie if i dont know how could my child know
its not normal to forget your own age you know its kind of worrisome actually
by the time youre forgetting your own age youre past the point of caring
i guess if you put it that way youve got a point 
thank you for paying me a visit is there anything troubling you or is there perhaps something i can help you with
i wonder if the students are taking to me 
you seem to be getting along well with the students i would advise you to be confident in your abilities the rest will fall into place in time
about the teachings of seiros 
believers live their lives by her sacred wisdom please use the librarys vast resources to learn more
i can often be found here so if there is ever anything you need please do not hesitate to pay me a visit
inside the cathedral there is a chapel dedicated to the four saints do you know of them saint indech saint macuil saint cichol and 
saint cethleann who is your favorite professor
now that you are a member of the church be sure to familiarize yourself with our teachings and traditions
oh professor how are you today im just heading out for a mission ill be seeing you
good luck
i dont need luck this will be a piece of cake ill be back before you know it
be careful
what make you say that do you know something i dont are there supernatural elements at play ghosts ah oh forget it ill be going now
have we met
no sorry must be my imagination
you look bored care to duel
a duel
to the death
what i just wanted to spar 
excellent work guiding the students in the mock battle taking command like that simply splendid and bearing the unknown crests power yes im talking about you your talents are incredible and lady rheas insight as to your potential is doubly so
you know professor there are some things ill just never understand like the other night i went on a date with a dashing handsome strong young knight oh im a bit weak just remembering him anyway  do you know what that no good jerk said when we got back to my room he said what a mess im afraid to go in there can you believe it you know who cares about keeping everything neat and tidy not me thats who afraid to go in there some knight he is
do you know about the cardinals they are the ones who run the church their identities are a closely guarded secret 
that person sure does remind me of somebody but i cant figure out who oh do ya need me for something sorry but im really busy right now
hello there are you that new professor everyones talking about names anna im a merchant who slings wares all around fódlan  and beyond i come in here all the time so im sure our paths will cross more hopefully much more
greetings professor nothing to report are you settled in here at the monastery yet make sure to have a good look around theres much to see like fish you do know about the pond behind the dining hall right you can fish there give it a try
we will accompany you on your assignment we dont want anything to happen to our precious students if any of you run into trouble well step in and help out
the knights of seiros are also known as the shining knights we are the sword and shield of the divine seiros there are many orders of knights in the world but we are the only one that has the honor of bearing the name seiros as a member of the church you should probably study up on the history of seiros and the knights
i hear the officers academy of the monastery was founded about two centuries ago the eastern region of fódlan was being invaded by almyra and so the archbishop of the time took measures to prevent the border from being taken in order to ensure fódlan would be safe from potential threats she deemed it necessary to raise a generation of excellence that is how the establishment was founded though its purpose has changed over the years
zanado the red canyon is a place of great significance to the church of seiros even members of the church are forbidden from entering without permission to go trampling around in there causing trouble  those bandits truly are morally reprehensible
brigid almyra duscur  even people from far off lands gather here at the academy word of advice professor there are those who dont think kindly of such people
perfect timing professor i just received word from the knights theyve located the bandits
it seems they have them cornered they are in zanado the red canyon
i cant wait to get started ill strike down those heinous thieves before they know what hit them
charge ahead if you must caspar just do not put the rest of us in danger
im going back i wont be of any help anyway and i dont want to get hurt
dont worry bern its just some bandits well have no trouble at all
eh dont get ahead of yourselves unfounded optimism isnt a great strategy lets just get this over with
there is nothing to get over we will work with each other to achieve our mission
you seem excited to get out there
im not sure about this 
its time professor give us our orders and lets move out
professor i just got word from the knights that the last of the thieves have been cornered
just as planned theyre in zanado the red canyon
we certainly cant allow those underhanded thieves to get away lets work together and do our best to take them down
it matters not who were up against they will not harm his highness
hmph were just fighting common thieves right i dont expect much of a challenge
arent you a spoilsport im actually quite excited myself who knows  there may even be some cute lady thieves
hmm well at any rate a real battle is a great opportunity for us to see how far weve come
true the mock battle was a success well be fine so long as we stay the course
so much excitement 
i hope everything turns out all right
perhaps we are a bit overly excited but remember that we have the knights on our side all should be well ah and speaking of the knights i heard that jeralt is once again one of the knights of seiros perhaps well have the good fortune of seeing you two fight side by side
this isnt a game
weve fought together many times
oh of course i apologize for letting my childish whims get the better of me in all honesty im a bit jealous my parents are no longer around
what do you mean
no longer around
they they died both of them im all that remains of them now  anyhow im sorry to bore you with such things id say its nearly time for us to depart eh professor
hey teach glad you could make it weve been waiting on you
it seems the knights have our foes cornered they are in zanado the red canyon
its bandit time that sounds like real knight work lets get to it
im itching to put my skills to the test as well we have to win so captain jeralt can see how much ive learned
i thought jeralt wasnt coming with us either way ill give it everything ive got
um  even if i go its not like id be of any use 
thats enough of that if we dont work together and give it our all we are doomed to fail
you can be pretty intense sometimes lysithea but i agree lets do our best
everyone is so eager
i wonder how we will do 
if we fight half as well as we chatter well be fine cmon teach lead the way
so we are taking children into battle are we i am not certain i will be able to sleep soundly after beholding something like that  i shall allow you to turn back the hands of time but know this power is not infinite
so this is the red canyon  a ruin of sorts by the look of it lets end this quickly the thieves must have been driven back be careful or the cornered mice might bite us
the red canyon  this is the first time i have ever been here its like walking through a ruin lets get this battle out of the way professor the thieves must have already been driven back
so this is the red canyon doesnt look red to me  anyway lets get things started teach looks like the thieves have been driven back thats what we last heard so no surprise there
the knights chased us all the way here
chief lets get out of here theres no way we can win against them
shut your dumb mouth where would we go at this point you cant be a thief if you fear death
professor i hear theres a back road to the west why dont we split up and attack from both the west and the front if we advance tactfully we can attack our enemy from both sides i leave the rest to you regardless we must cross the bridge first
regrettable but there was no other way
allow me to clean this up for you lady edelgard
these ruffians are no match for a noble like me
i i killed them what have i done the blood 
are all real battles this exciting come on lets get on to the next one
i dont care if theyre stealing can i go home
so is making us experience a real battle part of the churchs teachings
people and beasts are as one calm your heart and do not be worried about this killing
thank you for leading us professor though i suppose there was no way we could lose to a familiar foe in any case something about this canyon feels inexplicably strange
according to our information there is a back road to the west lets split up and approach from the west and the front if we advance cleverly we attack from both sides and gain the advantage ill leave the rest to you professor but before all else well need to cross the bridge
i know they are just thieves but this never gets easier for me 
finished already i was hoping for more of a challenge
if id hesitated  that wouldve been me
i had to do it dont hate me please
i cant relax here we need to prepare for our next battle
i did it see im a great fighter
i hope the goddess blesses them to rest in peace 
still whole and sound i hope 
we have defeated the thieves well follow the knights instructions for what to do next you led us well professor
i hear theres a back road to the west how about we split up and attack from there and from the front we may be able to corner the enemy by approaching from both sides in any case we need to cross the bridge first ill leave the details to you teach
we were taken by surprise last time but  i guess this is what we can expect when battling thieves
it is a nobles duty to guard the welfare of the people nothing personal
i was planning to just sit back and watch but hey i got one
im sorry  i didnt have a choice
this is my first real fight i guess im pretty strong
a precious opportunity to test my own strength i wont make waste of your deaths
please forgive me goddess and save their souls 
this is what ive trained for
those thieves ran out of luck when they entered this canyon they never had a chance your leadership was amazing teach lets leave the rest of the work to the knights
we stole this treasure its all ours theres not way were gonna give it up to some knights
damn theyre coming from the west too i cant stand these brats
sending these brats instead of the knights means theyve underestimated me big mistake
i should have never listened to that idiot  what a mistake 
y youre  it cant be the mercenary from before so what now youre pals with the knights ill kill you and your pesky brats
spoiled little noble just die like a good little rich kid
do you really think being born a commoner gives you the right to kill despicable
spoiled little noble just die like a good little rich kid
unfortunately for you i will not oblige you will regret all that you have done
spoiled little noble just die like a good little rich kid
being noble has nothing to do with who you are as a person or how hard your life is your logic is illogical
 
i remember this being a peaceful place 
since when has it been called the red canyon 
  
hmm  i wonder why it is that you recall this place  you must be weak of heart each time i speak it scares you so
im sorry
although the battle is at an end do not feel too at ease
you surprised me
although the battles at an end do not feel too at ease
im not scared
do you think you can lie to me it saddens me to know you wish to hide such things from me
well anyhow  i am quite fascinated by this place as far as i can tell this is your first time here 
still it feels familiar
how very odd i wonder if somehow my memories have  hmm
have you been here before sothis
here i daresay it would be impossible to have forgotten such as place as this
i must admit i am unsure beyond the name and this strange feeling of familiarity i cant seem to remember anything about this place and yet a great depth of emotion is tied to that sense of familiarity like joy and sorrow pain and love and all things in between  if i was somehow here before i wonder what took place 
professor i was wondering where you were  its about time we headed back to the monastery
professor we should return to the monastery soon were all ready for the journey
teach what are you doing here we should get back to the academy
it is time to depart but know that time reveals all things one day i will remember that which i have lost  oh by the way it seems youve earned my gratitude the thieves who came here are no more
why are you grateful
why are you 
i am not sure myself yet i am grateful all the same in any case  you must become accustomed to my voice if you fall down with shock each time i speak that just wont do
oh  you think youre standing strong of course you are it was a jest
on our way out i had the chance to observe the red canyon  did you notice anything professor
what are you talking about
oh i suppose it was only me then
i did
of course i expected as much
the area was covered in ruins each more curious than the last they did not match the architectural style of any era or culture within the empire or across all of fódlan for that matter that can only mean one thing  the valleys civilization must have flourished and fallen in the distant past long before the empire was established who do you think lived there
our ancestors
a culture long since perished
subterranean beings
 heh its possible they werent even human
hmm perhaps their remnants still influence this world 
were finally back ill leave the report to lady rhea in your hands professor
huh  edelgard
does the black eagle house have a mission to see to remember on a real battlefield one can never tell whats to come you can never dismiss the possibility of a worst case scenario take care edelgard
theres no need to state the obvious dimitri but tell me  why the concern perhaps you doubt my abilities if so your lack of insight is disappointing
thats not what i meant if ive offended you i hope youll accept my apology
dont worry about it professor we must hurry everyones waiting on you
i suppose i should be off too try not to let her get to you dimitri i promise you theres no need for concern
hmm 
why are you so worried
ill tell you all about it some other time
puppy love
hahaha now thats a lark i had no idea you had a sense of humor professor ill tell you all about it some other time
hey teach on the way back you seemed transfixed by the canyon did something happen there
its nothing
nice try but you cant get anything past me you saw something or felt something im sure of it but hey if you dont want to share thats fine by me everyone has their secrets
actually 
it seemed familiar to you huh cant say the same maybe its a memory from when you were a child or from a past life anyway if you cant remember i guess there isnt really much more to be said
although ill admit there is something about that canyon that has me captivated as well how did zanado come to be called the red canyon nothing there was actually red 
so you have safely disposed of those bandits i pray that their souls find salvation but why did they target the students to begin with we must further investigate the true cause of all that took place until we know more i ask that you support the students and relieve them of any unnecessary worry
of course
i will do all that i can
good i have high expectations for you by the way how was your time in zanado legend has it in ancient times a goddess alighted upon this world in that very canyon for a goddess from heavens zanado could only have been a temporary haven
a goddess
a temporary haven
long ago the divine seiros received a revelation from the goddess a gift to help the lost the goddess is always watching over fódlan from her kingdom above however in ancient times the goddess graced this world with her presence and offered salvation to the people here she is the mother of all life the arbiter of every soul
i didnt know
my father never told me
i see during your time here i pray that you come to devote yourself to the teachings of seiros
uh lady rhea i am sorry to interrupt there is something i must ask about in regard to those bandits 
as you wish we shall continue our discussion when next we meet
a goddess  i have no memory of her but then  i have no memory at all oh how bothersome it is as though i know and yet i dont perhaps zanado was my home back when the goddess walked the land if so  what does that make me now a ghost
that must be it
are you simple thats impossible i am most certainly alive
i dont know
hmm  no that cannot be i am most certainly alive
of course we also have the mystery of why im here with you is it somehow connected perhaps some past regret is stopping me from moving on and now im forced to stay with you instead  no thats not it i cant believe in such a meaningless existence i  i 
/***EOF***/
the ceaseless rains that satiate the verdant landscape of fódlan are accompanied the fierce winds and mighty roars of thunder this abundance of rain sparkling as it falls against beams of emerging sunlight is a constant reminder to the people of fódlan that nature is ever wild and unpredictable for when the rain finally does pause the clouds part to give way to a glorious rainbow
i have a new mission for you professor i would like for you to take your students into kingdom territory to eliminate some thieves
they stole a heros relic from house gautier of the holy kingdom of faerghus the lance of ruin their leaders name is miklan he is apparently a disowned son of house gautier
why was he disowned
i believe it had something to do with his lack of a crest such happenings are fairly common within the kingdom
the crestless cannot harness the goddesss power even if they possess a relic nonetheless they are still capable of simply wielding those weapons
why must the church eliminate him
this skirmish involves a holy relic and is therefore more than a single noble is capable of resolving
the heroes relics are immensely powerful weapons we must meet this threat with adequate force unfortunately most of the knights of seiros are away from the monastery purging the apostates of the western church so we are entrusting you with this mission after all you wield the sword of the creator which is more than capable of opposing any relic
the sword of the creator is a powerful weapon well beyond the other relics you have nothing to fear however to ensure that no harm comes to the students we will also send the monasterys most skilled individuals to aid you
i must remind you that you are expected to conduct yourself in a manner befitting the wielder of that holy sword also you should know that professor hanneman has been looking for you that is all
professor i heard about our mission for this month a thief with a heros relic is worrisome but with you at our side im certain we can handle him after all you have the sword of the creator it was allegedly wielded by nemesis the king of liberation if the legends are true you hold the power to stand against entire armies a band of thieves should be nothing even the most elite imperial forces or the knights of seiros could not hope to defeat you
why does it matter
im just marveling at the potential besides your power does not lie solely in the sword of the creator
it would never come to that
is that so even if those forces were to hurt someone precious to you can you say with full confidence that you would not turn your sword on them if that were to happen you know your power does not lie solely in the sword of the creator
you are stronger and more terrifying than you realize professor  when we leave the monastery will you still think of yourself as my teacher
what do you mean
if we left the monastery
never mind im being thoughtless with my words for now lets just focus on the problem at hand
i heard about our mission for this month so  we are to eradicate thieves in kingdom territory im sorry for dragging into the kingdoms petty squabbles this should not be your burden to bear but my own 
im happy to help
its just a job
thank you professor hearing you say that puts my mind at ease
hm
your highness ah its been ages
its been a long time two years if im not mistaken
indeed your highness youve grown so much in those years i hardly recognize you
whos this
a friend of yours
this is rodrigue an old friend of my fathers i believe ive mentioned him if you recall when my father died four years ago he looked after me as though i were his own son
 you flatter me your highness it was my honor to care for such a fine young man its nice to finally meet you professor my son felix has mentioned you on occasion
what brings you to the monastery rodrigue is it the thieves plaguing the kingdom
im afraid so this is not merely a problem for house gautier but for everyone the thieves have set up their headquarters in fraldarius territory and are mercilessly pillaging the villages of that area you have our full support in stopping those dastards i thank you for your help both of you
hey teach i gotta say i never wouldve guessed you were a descendant of the king of liberation you didnt forget did you that story i told you about a relic that could cut a mountain in half that relic was the sword of the creator the very same used by nemesis the king of liberation
what are you talking about
im not his descendant
dont be coy teach the sword of the creator could only be wielded by nemesis if you can use it too that can only mean you have that bloodlines crest
i dont understand
fine keep your secrets but just so you know i dont understand isnt gonna cut it here at the monastery speaking of professor hanneman has been looking for you he probably wants to examine your crest with those crazy instruments of his actually sounds amusing maybe ill tag along
if it isnt my little claude what has you so worked up
judith what are you doing here
thats lady judith to you boy i told you until youre in charge i expect you to address me with all due respect anyway im here to retrieve you duke riegans condition has taken a turn for the worse
are you saying the old mans on his death bed
no its not that bad but in the state hes in he wont be able to participate in the next roundtable conference he wants you to go in his stead i volunteered to play the messenger
well thanks for that oh and teach this is judith also known as the hero of house daphnel
so youre little claudes teacher are you how much trouble has he been giving you
plenty
not too much
if her nickname didnt give it away you should know that judith er lady judith is the leader of the famous house daphnel of the leicester alliance she used to be a big deal at the roundtable conferences but it seems of late shes been reduced to a mere 
you had better shut that mouth before i put my boot in it you tactless nuisance now come on lets get going sorry professor but i need to borrow the boy for a bit
i suppose well have to finish our chat later sorry teach but dont you worry ill be back in time for our next mission all right judith lets get going
its lady  ah i suppose you are the active leader for the time being fair enough boy fair enough
good of you to come professor ive heard much about you lately specifically that you were able to awaken the sword of the creators power thusly it seems the true nature of your crest has been uncovered i had of course seen your crest before however at first i failed to recognize its true nature eventually it dawned on me that what is visible is perhaps merely a small part of a greater whole in other words your crest is too significant to be detected when using normal instruments after this discovery i began researching crests that might fit that description which allowed for a temporary hypothesis however i could not be certain the crest my conclusions led me to was far too unusual a crest thought to have disappeared in this world in the millennium since the fall of nemesis the king of liberation the crest of flames that is what you possess
the crest of flames 
your ability to wield the sword of the creator has unequivocally proven my hypothesis a legendary power dormant since time immemorial and now resurrected  there can be no doubt that this ancient power resides within you
a stone a stone  i do not understand yet as i think of it the pounding in my chest grows faster still but is that me or is it you hmm 
for a heros relic to be stolen  its unheard of
and just last month the sword of the creator was almost stolen too
also quite unheard of what imprudence
for house gautier to invite us on to their land they must be desperate but at least well have the stalwart knights ready to stand around and watch us do all the work
say i hear that a knight of seiros named gilbert will be joining us for our mission this moon he is skilled which is surely a boon for us still  that was not very thoughtful of lady rhea
do you know him
ahh well  no i do not not really all i will say is that we have trained together a few times in the past
do you have history with him
no  its nothing in any case you should at least introduce yourself to him before we depart
house gautier is sylvains home it would be nice if you could check on him as well
i am sorry that the kingdoms unrest did not stop with lord lonato  professor  the heroes relics are incredibly powerful please be on your guard
oof this wasnt the first time ive taken part in an alliance roundtable conference but it was still exhausting theres not enough cooperation in that group especially from lorenzs father but at least my grandfather was surprisingly alert judging by that id say hes got at least five more years in him
hey teach i hear you were able to use the sword of the creator that means  what does that mean could it mean that youre a descendant of nemesis the king of liberation
the coffin of seiros in the holy mausoleum should have held her remains instead they say it held the sword of the creator what could it mean
swinging a sword about in the holy mausoleum the potential for damage is too great to imagine i sincerely hope the saints coffins were not damaged
they didnt
one mightve been scratched
were you using magic ive heard you werent but  ugh its torture not being able to go inside the holy mausoleum for an entire year
you and your class were at that fight in the holy mausoleum right i sincerely hope the holy artifacts are unscathed i admit i wish i couldve been there to see it all even if it does make me queasy but i was there too early id gone first thing in the morning at noon one of the monks chased me out saying id been there too long who were they to decide when ive been somewhere too long
i heard a relic was stolen if this had something to do with a family conflict i dont think i could choose a side
even if theres a clear guilty party
i think id be a pretty good judge of that
we cant allow a heros relic to be stolen
what if its some kind of powerful weapon i want one too
i know relics arent easy to come by but id still like to get my hands on one 
im gonna keep training until i can beat you
 im not secretly eating cake
i can sense it
hmm  ok whats bernie doing right now oh fine you got me but keep it a secret all right
ill take your word for it
youre getting pretty good at talking through the door professor
so you have a crest too eh professor does that mean youre descended from nobility youve certainly got the look for it  i sure do wish there were more nobles like you professor a teacher a mercenary and so very mysterious  how could a girl ever get enough
i have never had goings to the kingdoms north i hear the people of north are cold and have much loneliness professor i hear you have had work have worked as a mercenary in the kingdom did you find joy in this you cannot remember is that having possibility i have amazement 
i know lord rodrigue he paid repeated visits to his highness after the previous king was killed
the western church the central church they believe in the same goddess but oppose one another fódlan is a complicated place
have you seen a man who looks like me hes middle aged and relatively tall
i have
i have not
if you get the chance tell him ive gone out ok
think of it the sword of the creator belonging to the ancient king nemesis you have to master it as soon as you can i cant wait to face off against such a legendary weapon
so the whole plan to attack the monastery was some plot devised by the western church that means they used lonato what right do they have to drag a good man like that into their schemes
theres going to be a big investigation into the western church soon i wish i could be a part of it i want to hear for myself why lonato had to die
im so sorry my older brother is causing you all this hassle professor dont misunderstand i always thought he was a piece of garbage but i never thought hed steal the relic i cant wait to see his face when he realizes im in the group that was sent to take him down
i cant believe my own brother is the leader of the bandits house gautier is my true home and his please professor he really is one of the worst people ive ever known but we still  we share the same blood were still family
isnt it strange saint seiross body was missing from her coffin but they found a sword in its place  do you think she moved from her coffin and left the sword behind
professor you looked like a natural wielding the sword of the creator its strange though isnt it the last owner of the sword was nemesis but i thought he didnt have any descendants 
hey professor did you happen to see that man i was looking for earlier i just spotted him by the dining hall but then he ran away
who is he to you
he  to be honest hes my father hes using a different name now but theres no mistaking it its him i know it is
i might have seen him
oh you saw him by the entrance to the monastery thank you professor
father  ive found you at last
professor if youre heading to the kingdom i would recommend taking a coat its chilly even at this time of year it also rains a fair bit dont get caught out there without protection or youre sure to catch a cold
wow lord rodrigue in the flesh  what is felix doing this is such a rare opportunity for him to see his family 
professor please leave sylvain alone for the time being the thing is the bandits leader who stole the relic is sylvains disinherited older brother
i have heard that someone from house gautier one of the kingdom of faerghuss noble families is causing some sort of commotion what a complete disgrace to the nobility
hey professor dont you think everyones making too big a fuss over these crests or heroes relics or whatever theyre called how important can that stuff really be
its very important
im not sure
personally i dont even care that i dont have a crest ill take muscles over crests any day heck ill take muscles over a hot meal actually 
dont you think professor hannemans been acting a bit strange maybe hes made some kind of big discovery
is it true that lady rhea entrusted the sword of the creator to you i can hardly even fathom you being capable of wielding something of such power just who are you anyway
aristocrats are fools  allowing their lives to be dictated by their crests though i suppose i am much the same in that regard 
some people are unhappy because they dont have the crest they want  and some are unhappy because they have a crest they never asked for
i thought school life would be peaceful and quiet with a sprinkle of drama to keep things interesting but since you arrived its been one thing after another is that just a coincidence i wonder
i believe so
oh i was just kidding anyway as i said before i do like having a little drama in my life
maybe maybe not
what do you mean i dont like the way you said that stop trying to spook me
captain jeralt was all furrowed brow earlier do you know whats got him so concerned if theres a problem i want to help any way i can
i dont know
ok i doubt theres anything i can do for him but i figured id ask anyway
why dont you ask him yourself
i did but he just dodged the question still its worrying to see him like that
you must be rather bewildered by the power that was hidden within however know that i believe in you i have no doubt that you will use that power justly you will most certainly fulfill the grand destiny that the goddess has seen fit to grant you
ah professor jeralt was looking for you
where is he
it seems he has gone off somewhere if he is not in his room then surely someone has seen him ask around
how are you managing the sword of the creator no problems i hope you have not left it lying somewhere unattended or anything foolish like that
no problems
im not quite used to it yet
you will need the swords power on your next mission i trust you will handle it without much issue
why is that fish so still wait  is it swimming sideways perhaps  perhaps it is resigned to its woeful fate of being plucked from the water and eaten  ah professor you are so outgoing with all of the students i would like to have more opportunities to connect with you though i am certain my brother would disapprove
you acquitted yourself honorably last month to think theyd go into the holy mausoleum and assault the goddess tower  i cannot imagine the western church is acting on its own someone must have been helping them as for the masked knight who escaped his days are numbered i hope we find him soon so i can kill him myself
hail professor if i may introduce myself i am gilbert my life has been spent as a dedicated knight i am to accompany you on your assignment i may have slowed a step in recent years but i pledge to you the full extent of my abilities
arent you too formal
i beg your pardon but such is my nature
its a pleasure to meet you
no professor the pleasure is all mine i assure you
mercedes  her face looks familiar 
oh my the crest of flames could it really  yes the actual crest of flames no that is quite enough i should compose myself i must remain objective in my research objective professional
excitement is understandable
i respect your self control
the scandal with the western church troubles me we cannot afford to let ourselves be swept along and yet 
its awful just awful what happened with the rite of rebirth the infirmary  well it was a mess things are finally calm again and so ive come here to unwind let me tell you i put all of my knowledge to use keeping those kids alive still the truth of it is that when someone faces death for the first time well they figure out who they are they learn if they can do it again we cant lose them professor not to battle or to cowardice if you can keep them going then i will too
i will protect them
i will try my best
the head of the western church holds the title of bishop thats not as distinguished as an archbishop such as lady rhea but it still comes with a fair amount of authority if someone in that position plotted an assassin i cannot help but think it must have been instigated by some outside force there are bishops in the eastern church as well but to speak frankly they do not have much impact they are under the influence of both the archbishop and the leicester alliance so their ability to voice grievances is quite limited
i hear about the things you did im so glad lady rheas safe i figure youre a great person after all professor
ive been hearing a lot about you lately word on the street is you wield some amazing sword if you ever want to sell it to me id pay top g just kidding sorta its uh not for sale is it
professor have you seen my son perchance i have need of him
he went out
is that so that is too bad
i believe hes in his quarters
is that so thank you professor
i must ask him not to distract you professor nor his highness from the matter at hand
i am rodrigue achille fraldarius i bear the great honor of serving as a lord in the kingdom of faerghus i have come in margrave gautiers stead to retrieve their stolen relic however  as i hear it a group of students is to attend to this matter i sincerely hope no harm comes to any of them
greetings professor nothing to report oh come to think of it last month there was something to report wasnt there thanks to you i hear that everything was resolved i never realized that bandits had entered  im not a great guard after all am i i hope you will forgive me one day
this weather is unfortunate those villagers were right when they said a storm was brewing but they were more afraid of an attack than they were of the storm lets end this quickly
the thieves have taken conand tower as their base  there it is in the distance
miklan must be more skilled than your average thief to have overtaken a place like that
this area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago thats when invasions from the north were at their peak back then this tower was built for both surveillance and defense it will be difficult to seize it
you know your history gilbert if i recall correctly youre from the kingdom arent you
i left my home long ago if you have any questions about the mission id be happy to answer them
what do you know about house gautier
what do you know about the leader of the thieves
house gautier has always placed great importance on whether or not someone bears a crest margrave gautier has two sons a crest never manifested for his eldest its not hard to imagine why he left and wound up in this sort of life
theres no reason that crests should have the power to dictate someones destiny dont you agree gilbert he was just another victim of cruel fate forsaken by the goddess who now demands his execution
it should be in our sights soon professor the abandoned tower those thieves are using as a base  conand tower
this area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago thats when invasions from the north were at their peak back then this tower was built for both surveillance and defense it will be difficult to seize it
youre very well informed gilbert please tell us more
well i  ah youre joking
professor did you see the local villages they were in rough shape no doubt because of the thief attacks theyre not going to make it through the winter in that condition if the thieves had taken up pillaging in order to survive that would be deplorable but understandable but this  this is something else entirely it looks as though they destroyed those villages purely for pleasure no matter what their reasons may be that sort of behavior cannot be allowed ever
dont bother losing your head over those lowlifes your highness its wasted effort
sylvain  the thieves leader the one who stole the relic word has it hes your older brother i know hes been disowned but 
he is no longer a member of house gautier or my brother hes nothing more than a common thief
are you sure about that it would be understandable to find this situation well regrettable to say the least
regrets heh you must be joking you know were far past the point of regret and it always falls on the younger brother to clean up the mistakes of their elders doesnt it
this rain threatens a coming storm we must hurry and begin our war council before the heavens let loose
say teach this must be the tower dont you think even for a tower its pretty er towering
its more like a fortress
it would prove difficult to attack
its a remnant of ancient wars  these thieves certainly found themselves a great place to nest i hear their leader miklan is a former noble it makes sense he would already know about this place
several hundred years ago this was an important stronghold for diffusing invasions from the north back then this tower was built for both surveillance and defense it will be difficult to seize it
gilbert isnt it you hail from the kingdom right no wonder youre so knowledgeable while were chatting so amicably  do you mind if i ask some questions
i dont mind if i can answer them i will
have you ever seen the lance of ruin
i have a long time ago it was an impressive if not eerily ominous weapon to behold according to margrave gautier miklan has used the lance to turn the tables on his pursuers
is that right then those without a crest can use it as well  interesting as far as i knew that wasnt possible and then we have the mythical sword of the creator which cant be used by anyone except teach crest or no crest maybe youre just that special teach or maybe theres something youre not telling us either way i expect big things from you in this battle
leave it to me
ha i love a good show of confidence ill do my best too you can count on it
im relying on you claude
are you now then why dont you hand over the sword of the creator for a bit then again it would just be a heavy blade in my hands theres no justice in this world teach
ugh the rain is really coming down now lets finish this quickly
a group of thieves led by a disowned son of house gautier has stolen a heros relic and begun to run amok seeking to neutralize this threat the church is sending your house there to settle the matter
the enemy is close by were almost to the top floor
they have nowhere left to flee so the situation is in our favor all we have to do is chase then down
they are merely thieves but they have a heros relic do not drop your guard
phew why did we have to climb so high before a battle at least its better than fighting in heavy rain
dont hold back for my sake my brother is going to pay for everything hes done
the captains in trouble hurry up you fools
enemies approach from the lower floor watch the rear flank
here we go attack them from both sides
its an ambush
so you think you can take the lance from me huh ill kill you  ill kill every last one of you
why have you come you crest bearing fool
im here for the lance of ruin miklan hand it over i dont want to humiliate you but i will
hmph hurry up and die already if not for you  if it hadnt been for you 
shut up im so tired of hearing that youve always blamed me for something that isnt my fault
not bad for your kind  a bunch of spoiled rotten children
what the hell
damn look at that  im outta here
hold on
no
graaaargh
what the miklan is that you
that form  oh my is this your first time fighting such a thing then listen well to what i say
such is the fate of one whose life is corrupted by a crest stone  how pitiable the least we can do is put an end to his suffering
so this is the power of a heros relic to create such a sinister beast  it has gone too far i fear all we can do now is put an end to it
how awful so the heroes relics are hiding such a terrible power within i cant even tell friend from foe anymore i feel for him but the best we can do now is finish this quickly
an evil power has caused them to grow quite large their life force is beyond a mortal like yourself you cannot win unless you fell them twice or even thrice
even if youve cornered one you cannot let your guard down those things are even worse when threatened
can you see that barrier it is surrounded by great power you must break through to fight that thing a strong attack or gambit might help to break through more quickly if you can break the barrier that power will have nowhere else to go and that will likely cause confusions for that thing it cannot counter while confused which means that is the best time to attack
if you break down all of their barriers not only will they be confused they will not be able to move for a short while without the power flowing around them they will not be able to restore their barriers you might even be able to get something from them
they have such might that they will not fear you alone but a battalion could prove useful on that front  attack them with a gambit to draw their attention and force them to target you
be on your guard when they have realized their full power the damaged caused at times like that is not contained to just one spot once they have charged some power ups their barriers will be restored you really must pay close attention to those things distract them with a gambit or just take them down before they can attack in any case think carefully before you act
but you should be conquering that thing instead of talking to me if youre out of questions get over there and fight
what is that its like watching a bad dream come to life
graaaargh
goddess  the beast is gone yet miklan and the lance remain
it is done lets retrieve the lance and depart at once
its over  lets retrieve the lance and leave this place
we defeated him somehow  lets grab the lance and return to the monastery
miklan my brother 
that man  his form was changed it was as though that lance was swallowing him whole upon that sight it makes sense that your students were upset i wonder if those relics truly hide such power yet even still that power seems familiar that form as well  as one who wields the sword of the creator  does that mean you possess that power too
professor you have returned the goddess is indeed generous with her divine protection i have already heard gilberts report about what happened see to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself people would lose faith in the nobles should rumors spread of one using a relic and transforming into a monster all regions of fódlan would fall into chaos we must avoid that at all costs please ensure the students who accompanied you understand that as well have i made myself clear
yes of course
hm 
his transformation into a black beast was nothing short of divine punishment from the goddess punishment for someone arrogant and foolish enough to use a heros relic even though they were unworthy and unqualified
you knew
of course that is why we rushed to recover it sadly we did not arrive in time
will i share the same fate 
if someone without a crest were to wield the relic you possess they would likely meet the same fate as miklan you however have been chosen you are worthy of wielding the sword of the creator so there is no need to worry
the church will formally return the lance to house gautier if you would 
as you wish
you have my gratitude i can see that i was right to trust you with this please report back i will tell you of your new mission for the coming moon at that time
i will not
what is the meaning of this
ahem excuse me  lady rhea i am overjoyed and beyond grateful to you for recovering the relic of my family house gautier now may i please have that lance i have received direct approval from my father to take possession of it
as the next head of house gautier do you swear that you will never cause such a deplorable incident to transpire
on my familys name and on my brothers life i swear it
very well however i have one condition you must never allow another to wield this lance your brother clearly demonstrated what fate awaits those who break that restriction
yes i i will not soon forget
i assume the archbishop was pleased with your performance did you return the lance of ruin
i returned it
 no need to lie professor i saw sylvain earlier it was written all over his face
i did not return it
 im glad sylvain must be overjoyed as well
 theres no need to lie professor no one could have expected you to disobey the archbishop
i keep thinking about what gilbert told us 
about miklan
about house gautier
yes miklan was discarded by his family because he was born without a crest eventually he became a masterful thief and gathered enough ruffians to capture a fortress right or wrong he was a gifted leader he could have been a great asset to fódlan what a waste its true that a crest can increase your magical abilities and allow you to wield the full might of a heros relic but one cannot measure a leaders worth based solely on whether or not they bear a crest there are plenty of talented people in this world without one
i completely agree
why is everyone obsessed with crests
people believe crests are blessings from the goddess that theyre necessary to maintain order in fódlan but the people are wrong crests are to blame for this brutal irrational world we live in their power is granted only to a select few whom we elevate and allow to rule the world have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the crests do that and people will have no choice but to rise and fall by their own merits
lady edelgard i question whether you revealed too much to the professor
perhaps i did
it is true that our teacher possesses a rare talent even i cannot deny it the ability to wield the sword of the creator is concerning 
ive already explained this to you my power alone is insufficient thats why im borrowing power from those people if our teacher can wield it in my stead  i believe that would be for the best
its a risk a dangerous one you leave me no choice but to take matters into my own hands please excuse me
i cant hide from the truth i cant do all that i must on my own if all i can rely on is my own ambition my path wont be easy is it so risky to reach out my hand father  i swear i will not stop until i succeed my regret my grief my whole life ive thrown it all away into the darkness 
is your meeting over professor
you look troubled
are you weary
i was just thinking about something professor  the possession of relics and crests has been highly valued in faerghus since ancient times its far from uncommon for someone to lose their ability to lead their house because they dont bear a crest just like miklan it happened to my uncle as well the eldest child of the king and yet he never ascended to the throne all families whose bloodlines carry crests of the 10 elites are much the same but house gautier takes it a step further and absolutely requires an heir who possesses a crest
why are they so obsessed with it
why house gautier in particular
to that house the power of crests is a necessity not a luxury house gautier holds the most northern territory in the kingdom and they have fought with the people to the north for many years the head of that house is responsible for protecting that territory from fearsome invaders whom they keep at bay with the power of crests and relics in exchange for that responsibility they are granted special privileges within the kingdom
their crests grant them special privileges
in a way that said ability cannot be measured by the possession of a crest alone 
strength is strength with or without a crest
i believe the same ability cannot be measured by the possession of a crest alone
i believe that margrave gautier was wrong to disinherit miklan because he did not bear a crest still there is always a reason for why such customs stand the test of time imagine what this world would be like if no one placed any stock in crests  bloodlines that carry crests would dwindle the metaphorical blade used to oppose threats would eventually rest this same argument has been made time and time again across the years both sides are at once right and wrong
what do you believe dimitri
i believe those with crests and those without should acknowledge the others strengths and learn to respect each other based on personal merits and that doesnt apply only to crests the same holds true for lineage race faith ideologies  if we could just accept each other and make mutual concessions one step at a time  perhaps  who knows if thats even possible everyone has something that is unacceptable within them i certainly do and id wager you do as well i wonder which is best professor  to cut away that which is unacceptable or to find a way to accept it anyway 
nice work teach its thanks to you that we successfully completed our mission as for miklan  i wonder if he really believed he could wield a relic
hard to say
i bet he just wanted to get his hands on it even though he knew he couldnt use it
i doubt it
agreed he probably just wanted to get his hands on it even though he knew it was futile
though im sure he wasnt counting on turning into a monster like that  i wonder if that monster represents another aspect of the heroes relics what a strange and terrifying power
i dont know
it seems so
stories of misfortune have followed the heroes relics since ancient times
tomas youve caught me by surprise thats not easy to do though i suppose i shouldve expected to see our librarian in his library
i am sorry to intrude i simply heard you speaking of the heroes relics i can tell you more about them if youd like the story goes that nemesis was corrupted by evil because of the sword of the creator other heroes also lost themselves by continuing to use the relics transforming into black beasts with twisted souls there used to be a great many records regarding the dark history of the relics
used to be
they have been destroyed across all of fódlan stripped from their shelves including those that resided at this very library
you make it sound like the church is covering up the truth but now that you mention it rhea was very specific about not wanting anyone to find out what happened at conand tower hey tomas  why are you telling us all this
it seemed like you were searching for answers about the relics what is a librarian if not a guide in the search for knowledge and not only have you been searching but you have been doing so through the night i would suggest you stop before the knights notice and that is enough meddling for today please excuse me
so ive been found out have i i suppose i do spend more time at the library than most students but i wont stop i cant afford to
what are you after
teach  you dont really expect me to tell you something so personal like that do you though i wouldnt mind sharing if you were to tell me some of your secrets in exchange 
i cant let this exchange pass without comment  if youre sharing secrets perhaps i can share one as well
are you sure you could survive that id say youre the least likely to share secrets out of everyone at the academy
heh heh coming from you ill take that as a compliment after all youre easily the student with the most secrets
im afraid you overestimate me my secrets dont amount to much but back to teach 
dont try to change the subject claude were talking about secrets yours who is your father and why did you appear so suddenly as if from nowhere duke riegans eldest son died in an accident having tragically lost other family members as well he was without an heir the alliance would undoubtedly have been shaken if house riegan had lost its position of leadership but then you showed up why did you return to house riegan what brought you to the monastery
i would like to hear this as well
he doesnt have have to answer to you
alas to be surrounded by women as lovely as flowers only to be pricked by their thorns
my dream in truth is a selfless dream but i require power to make it a reality when i learned about the power of my crest i knew i had a chance so im chasing that dream to the bitter end if need be i came to this monastery because i thought i might find someone useful someone to help me on my path so what do you think if you promise to help me achieve my dream no matter what ill promise to tell you anything
 i have my own dream to tend to i pray that yours does not interfere with mine
what about you teach
if its a noble dream 
that may be difficult
i see well now isnt the time to discuss this you are still my teach after all
professor you have done well to complete such a difficult task you have shown exceptional skill in leading your students i am forever grateful for the safe return of the heros relic just as i expected you have mastered the sword of the creator now then i shall tell you about your mission for the coming month 
 rhe  archbishop
seteth what troubles you
flayn is missing i cannot find her anywhere  professor have you seen flayn recently
i have not
i have searched everywhere where could she be
have you looked everywhere
i have searched every corner i can think of i could not find her anywhere
she may be in danger oh no  no no what am i to do
calm yourself seteth professor we shall continue our discussion another time
/***EOF***/
as the sun grows stronger and the nights grow ever shorter the blue sea star returns to the sky once more believed to be the goddesss home her followers look to the star and commence celebrations of her rebirth on the grounds of garreg mach monastery a grand ceremony is held in honor of this much anticipated event every true follower of the church of seiros is sure to be in attendance
our mission this month is to patrol and set up defenses to stop the assassination plot
i wonder if an assassination attempt is truly the goal of our enemy 
what do you mean
you must sense that somethings off about all of this
its a distraction
yes i think so too
a barely concealed secret message trying to distract us from whatevers really going on sloppy to say the least and while everyone is out searching for a phantom assassin theyll be free to accomplish their true goal with ease
the monastery houses many valuable weapons perhaps that is their aim
i hear the monastery has a treasure vault too seems like the sort of place a foe would like some alone time in
garreg mach is immense and not just above ground but below as well perhaps their aim lies beneath the monastery 
it seems to me that we should search the monastery for a clue as to what the enemy might be after of course we must never underestimate the need for preparedness in case a battle should ensue
a secret meeting professor oh we havent been introduced i am shamir
shamir is one of the knights of seiros and this young man is 
so our task for this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery to help put a stop to that assassination plot the knights will certainly have their hands full protecting lady rhea perhaps our enemy is counting on that 
what do you mean
your highness i am curious as to what you mean by that
i agree
please elaborate
why would lord lonato be carrying around a secret note with an assassination plot written on it isnt it possible he hoped to monopolize everyones attention with this alleged plot in order to distract from his true aim
maybe theyre after the treasure vault theres also lots of valuable stuff in the library and professor hannemans quarters
true the monastery undoubtedly houses many weapons that rival even the heroes relics
whatever their aim we cant allow any harm to come to the ladies of the monastery i mean what would i do with my spare time
you mean to say we should search the monastery try to find what the enemy is truly after
yes and we should be prepared to fight them as well should it come to that i wouldnt mind getting in some training just in case
a secret meeting professor oh we havent been introduced i am shamir
shamir is one of the knights of seiros and this young man here is 
ok  so our task this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery in support of the knights who are busy trying to stop an assassination plot heres the thing i dont think the bad guys are really trying to assassinate the archbishop
what do you mean
come on teach dont you think that secret note lord lonato was carrying around was just a little too obvious
its a distraction
precisely that secret note with the assassination plot on it  theres just no way that was real
people dont just carry around secret notes someone wanted us to find it
do you really think the assassination plot is just a distraction
oh yeah that makes complete sense but then what are they really after
if i knew that i wouldnt be so worried lets see  it probably involves somewhere that will be empty during the rite of rebirth yeah
since the ceremony is at the goddess tower it follows that everywhere else at the academy will be severely understaffed
do you think theyre after the churchs donation money i hear noble families tend to donate quite generously
my bets on the dining hall its a treasure trove of delicious food makes me angry just thinking about them getting their grubby hands on it
lets split up and look around ill keep an eye on the reception hall
you should get in some training if you have the time hilda theres a good chance well have to fight
uh well im not the only one who needs to train here its not right to single me out like that
a secret meeting professor oh we havent been introduced i am shamir
shamir is one of the knights of seiros and that little go getter there is 
i work for lady rhea and im shamirs apprentice oh the names cyril
you work for rhea
yep i help lady rhea with all kinds of stuff
shamirs apprentice
yep shes teaching me about the bow and the sword and all kinds of stuff
ive gotta protect lady rhea so thats why ive gotta learn all i can from shamir
cyril adores rhea that aside if you need anything ask
a heros relic 
do you know something
however could i know something still it is heavy on my mind
it represents great power
quite so
the stone within the sword  a glow of red  hm oh it is nothing
our enemys true target  what could it be the monastery has been around for nearly a millennium its only logical that there are secrets here wed better investigate would you mind asking around and seeing what you can dig up once youve uncovered some leads well regroup
we need more information is there anyone else you could talk to
hmm  theres a place that the church values above all others on the day of the rite it will be open to the public that will make it much easier than usual to access
the greenhouse
you must be joking
the holy mausoleum
precisely
the dining hall
you must be joking
we cant know for certain but its a distinct possibility that the holy mausoleum is our enemys target
oh have you been tasked with guarding the monastery as well such a stir over a single letter but i suppose the archbishops safety is too important to risk
if the enemys aim lies elsewhere we had better discern their true intent quickly as i see it our best option is to explore every inch of the monastery we should also speak to everyone here lets plan to compare notes once youve got a lead
hmm im afraid well need more information than that is there anyone else you could try speaking to
so  there is something that the church values above all else on the day of the rite it will be open to the public that will make gaining entry far easier than usual you know the place of which i speak 
the greenhouse
whatever would make you think that this is no time for games professor
the holy mausoleum
yes that is the most likely possibility
the dining hall
whatever would make you think that this is no time for games professor
we do not know their objective but there is a good chance that our enemy is planning to target the holy mausoleum
all this talk of assassination plots  it brings back dark memories i prefer to keep buried i doubt there is any correlation and yet  ah it is nothing i am sorry for allowing my mind to wander my focus should be solely on guarding the monastery right now
to figure out our foes intentions we need information lots of it or any at the least for now try going around the monastery and looking for suspicious locations you should also try chatting folks up to see if they know anything once weve got things narrowed down lets meet up and compare notes
hmm  we still dont have enough to go on teach lets try looking around a little more
hmm something the church values above all else  and on the day of the rite itll be open to the public making it easier than ever to get inside thats gotta be it right
the greenhouse
that would be a resounding no
the holy mausoleum
bullseye
the dining hall
that would be a resounding no
we dont know the enemys intentions not yet but our best bet is that their target will be the holy mausoleum
theres been talk of an attempt on rheas life weve been order to help the knights patrol could that possibly mean that rhea isnt beloved by everyone the world over
can you imagine the archbishop being murdered i prefer not to consider such a gruesome scenario
of course not
awfully calm arent you i wonder what it takes to rile you up
frightening thought
that easy to get under your skin is it
hmm  setting fire to the stables to distract everyone to cause a commotion it is the oldest trick in the book but i cannot shake the thought that our enemies may attempt it  i will stand guard and watch over the stable and the knights horses they are truly magnificent
so sleepy  too sleepy  i found an interesting book in the library got so caught up reading it i forgot to sleep  interesting discovery though the coffins of the four saints in the sanctum each have their crests carved into them ill need to find a way down there to get a look
oh hey professor i was just reading this letter from my father do you know him hes a pretty big deal in the empire he only writes to ask how my trainings going or how many monsters ive killed stuff like that
um  hi right now is um  well right nows ok i guess if you um want to chat a little
didnt i see you in the dining hall last night
hey i get hungry sometimes like anyone else what eating at night is bad for you theres no way thats true wait really
people die in every battle and it can be by sword or spear or magic but  but depending on who it is that died  depending on who died its different
what do you mean
its different if its someone you know who was lost 
i hope nothing bad happens this month
is it true you got caught in the fighting im so thankful you made it out alive i dont know what we would do if we lost you 
in brigid  assassinations are many i have also been the targeted back in the past
how frightening
im happy you survived
the goddess tower has an entrance of narrowness that is most good the windows are not the most good though a target of ease for snipers
fighting to stop a murdering is my specialness no my specialty i will show my best work
the monks declined my offer of assistance they said that no one from duscur is to be trusted especially now given the circumstances i cannot fault them
sending an assassin to the monastery hm hopefully its someone worth crossing blades with
i hope so too
it seems were cut from the same cloth
i hope we can avoid bloodshed
youre entitled to your opinion
lord lonatos rebellion may have been quelled but the unrest in faerghus isnt dying down anytime soon the boar prince should hurry up and claim the throne rather than letting old customs hold him back
i cant stop thinking about lonato  im sorry professor i know this isnt the time but  i just cant get past it
theres nothing to be done
pull yourself together
thank you no matter what happens i promise you ill do my part i checked on my brother and sister who were living in castle gaspard thankfully theyre all right i was worried because theyre both so young but the church in the castle town offered to take them in that much at least is a big relief
no classes on a festival day i thought id get to spend all day relaxing in the company of some lovely ladies but now this has happened hey professor i know theres talk of an assassination attempt but do you really think theyll do it on the day of the rite of rebirth i feel like security would be looser some other time is there some reason why it has to happen on that day
the monastery holds many treasures maybe the enemy is after one of those even so the idea of stealing from the church is just horrible 
i bought the ingredients for making some sweet treats i cant wait to eats huh oh i know it looks like im fooling around but im not im preparing for potential battle during my patrol by making sure i have plenty of food i can eat while walking smart huh
good thinking
i know once theyre ready i promise to share some with you
youre making patrol sweets
i just thought id be more alert if i had something sweet in my tummy oh wait was it spicy food that you liked professor
have you heard rumor has it that death himself has been appearing in garreg mach they say he appears every night and kidnaps folks i wonder what happens to them 
professor while the investigation is important dont forget to make time for your training if we have to battle and cannot win all will be lost we dont know who our enemy is so we must be prepared for anything
lady rhea lifts the spirits of all the people of fódlan we cannot allow her to come to any harm
are we really just taking claudes word for it if so i doubt anything will come of this it is all probably just some sort of distasteful joke i find it highly unlikely that anyone would be foolish enough to barge in here and cause a disturbance
the goddesss rite of rebirth is the most significant ritual for the church of seiros could it be that someone has spread these rumors of an assassination plot merely with the intention to hinder the celebration
i bet the enemys using this assassination nonsense just to sneak in and raid the pantry what do you think professor
you may be right
oh im right all right my animal instinct is telling me that the enemy is after our best meats
i dont think so
you dont think so then dinners on you if it turns out i was right
the monasterys so big how can we narrow down the list of possible targets the only places i can think of are the vault and the library and  i guess thats it
with the whole monastery preparing for the goddesss rite of rebirth this month it feels like everyones a little on edge 
i dont know who to blame for all this commotion but its frankly a huge inconvenience with everyone stuck on guard duty our study and training time has been drastically reduced
some things are more important than that
yes yes i understand that but it doesnt change the fact that its a royal pain
i agree  its very inconvenient
indeed for now lets do all we can to find and dispose of our enemy
it seems there were forces opposing the church beyond lord lonato  i never thought such forces could exist in this world
it makes sense that the church has enemies
i dont understand what would they have against the church
we only know a small part of this world
i suppose that may be true 
hello im in charge of managing all records for the golden deer house oh but i dont have any information of note right now go ahead and continue your investigation and put a little extra effort into it please
did you know that on the last day of the rite the monasterys open to the general public its kinda fun it makes the place feel like a festival
seems like donations to the monastery arent actually kept here that means the enemy isnt likely to be interested in money we should turn our attention elsewhere then again i guess some of the plants in the greenhouse could sell for a lot but that cant really be it can it
hey did you hear a knight wielding a scythe is roaming around town at night if hes a villain id like to get the measure of him
hmm  might you have come looking for me because you were worried about my safety
i was worried
i am quite all right but your concern means a great deal
the enemy could have other objectives
i am aware of the possibility on the day of the ceremony i am trusting that you will not allow your attention to wander or wane
ive been in town procuring some supplies for flayn
did you encounter any danger
no but do not concern yourself for my safety i am very much stronger than i appear
what supplies
nothing out of the ordinary do not trouble yourself over it
professor  i am afraid i have acted a bit childishly toward my brother recently  given the circumstances i requested that he provide me with some candies  silly of me really the timing was improper and i regret it very much now oh but more importantly this place is off limits professor it is only open to the public on the day of the goddesss rite of rebirth
have you visited the goddess tower its a sacred place used for rituals and the like in general students arent allowed entry but as youd expect that rule just excites their curiosity some have even tried sneaking in well at least for this month that kind of behavior is totally unthinkable we have a lot more security what with the goddesss rite of rebirth coming up
youd best keep your distance in this nervous state i might just cut you down
please dont
i dare you to try
oh come on im only kidding
hey professor youre good looking you know that at the same time you look like someone who was born to fight i bet wed get along im also good looking and born to fight heh need any help with your class
feel free to call on me when a fights brewing thunderbrand and i will be there when you need us
you spend too much time roaming the monastery if youre looking for something try less aimless wandering
i was thinking about the enemys objective
do you even know who the enemy is you cant know why without knowing who
im not looking for anything
sure
its none of my business anyway im just here to take care of enemies who get too close
youre skilled why wont you battle me hmph
whats the matter youre running all over creation ah  you dont believe lady rhea is the real target do you even so the knights have their orders we cant abandon our duty to guard lady rhea the goddesss rite of rebirth is an important event for the church of seiros they say its the day when the goddess will return to walk among us not too likely if you ask me uh  best if you keep that to yourself
unbelievable what a terrifying story however an assassination attempt on lady rhea is doomed to fail pardon you think the goal may be different than simple assassination intriguing i suppose the priceless objects in this room could perhaps draw thieves however theres no one but me who could make use of them 
professor i hope youre well as for me i had a date with a splendid specimen of a knight but now hes suddenly not in the mood to see me again i blame all these rumors of a deathly figure showing up in town such an uproar must have beyond reason drawn his attention away from me
i hear you have fought alongside catherine i would wager that her power exceeded your expectations had you the chance to witness her relic thunderbrand glowing red  that glow is a sure sign that her blood contains a crest that harmonizes with that heros relic
excuse me professor i just wanted to let you know that lady rhea is always real concerned with you she expects great things i think please dont let her down ok
of course not
i hope youre not just saying that
well see 
ya know what im watching you
greetings professor nothing to report the goddesss rite of rebirth is this month right the monastery gates will be thrown wide open on that day ill be working as a guide i hope i get to guide some lovely ladies around  heh heh 
the goddesss home is in the sky she lives on a bright and shining star but in the spring you cant see that star that means she cant protect fódlan thats why we all celebrate the day when her star returns to the sky thats the day of the rite of rebirth see see ive been studying i know just about everything
people seem to think that all the knights of seiros are equal but that isnt quite so there are many distinguishing ranks within the order for example there are squires who are training to become knights as well as full knights like myself oh and then we have the holy knights such as catherine those are the knights that can wield a heros relic
about 20 or so years ago there was a big fire in garreg mach on that day captain jeralt went missing everyone thought he was dead  it never occurred to me that he might actually have survived the truly strange part is that in all those years he hasnt changed a bit 
on the day of the rite the monastery will be open to the public including the holy mausoleum the holy mausoleum is where the tomb of the divine seiros lies there she slumbers eternally thats pretty much all that in there just an ancient coffin its sealed with a powerful magic to protect against would be grave robbers
have you heard of the war of the eagle and lion it was the battle that won the kingdom its independence from the empire even the church of seiros had no choice but to recognize the courage of loog the king of lions who emerged victorious the church awarded him a crown and the right to govern the faerghus region backing him in his bid to found the holy kingdom of faerghus in return loog agreed to make the church of seiros the religion of his territory and permitted them to publicly proselytize across the kingdom in the 400 years since the church and the kingdom have continued to maintain very close relations
something in the monastery that someone might go after theres so much here i couldnt possibly name just one even this here kitchen contains previous wares wine bottles from centuries past and the like i hear that stuff is fancy but not very drinkable i doubt anyone would go to the trouble of stealing it
it would be terrible if the greenhouse was targeted the plants in here are incredibly valuable this place contains the heart of garreg machs 995 year history so many beautiful flowers  plants that can save or end lives  they are all my precious children
i have heard talk of students wandering the monastery late at night they wouldnt happen to be from your class would they please keep your students in line professor kids these days 
do you know what this room is it is the churchs treasure vault i say treasure but i do not mean silver and gold and jewels it mostly contains weapons artifacts and the like anything that would cause too great a stir should it be stolen no the church knows better than to store anything too valuable in such an accessible location
there are numerous books in this library that you cannot find anywhere else but once you are here you can read them easily enough i doubt someone would go to the trouble of stealing one sometimes seteth will dispose of books that are deemed inappropriate for the monastery but thats about it in a way i suppose that makes those particular volumes more valuable  right
that boy who assists the archbishop  cyril i believe i hear hes originally from a foreign land to the east called almyra i know hes still only a child but i do wonder about his true intentions 
the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin are we going to move forward with our plan
i believe so how confident are you in our theory professor
were not wrong
no ones intuition is perfect its ridiculous not to have doubts
it could go either way
oh i dont like those odds at all 
im a little doubtful 
you have little doubts that is good we have no room for big doubts on this day
all that matters is how our enemy makes their move not how our teacher feels about our plan
you seem a mite too relaxed for my liking the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin while we are in the goddess tower we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense
may i let you in on something professor my brother can be a bit callous he told me that he was concerned about you and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin
that was said in jest flayn and in confidence please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble as a professor you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness
please excuse us everyone we shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded
a coffin how fascinating
hurry professor we must find a place to hide where we can guard the stairs to the holy mausoleum if the enemy moves as predicted we should be able to cut off their escape path and capture every last one of them
the goddesss rite of rebirth is finally here lets move ahead with our plan
leave it to me professor are you in as well
of course
weve narrowed down our objective kind of so lets show everyone that we can carry out our duties better than anyone
im not sure about this
oh dear our professor seems to lack confidence in our plan that is not very reassuring
im hungry
umm  oh well ill be sure to whip you up some tasty treats when this is all over
were counting on you professor
you seem a mite too relaxed for my liking the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin while we are in the goddess tower we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense
may i let you in on something professor my brother can be a bit callous he told me that he was concerned about you and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin
that was said in jest flayn and in confidence please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble as a professor you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness
please excuse us everyone we shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded
its time
all right lets stick to the plan and go hide where we can watch over the entrance to the holy mausoleum if anyone suspicious enters well follow them in and take them down got it
the rite of rebirth is finally underway time to see if our hunch was right
ugh i hope its not then we wouldnt have to fight anyone
our hunch is right
weve all come to this conclusion together im sure we got it right
we are mistaken
do you really believe that professor claude certainly looks confident
only the goddess knows
dear goddess  please protect us 
right or wrong the clock is ticking all we can do now is stick to the plan
you seem a mite too relaxed for my liking the goddesss rite of rebirth is about to begin while we are in the goddess tower we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense
may i let you in on something professor my brother can be a bit callous he told me that he was concerned about you and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin
that was said in jest flayn and in confidence please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble as a professor you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness
please excuse us everyone we shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded
seteth is way too overprotective he reminds me of my brother
come on teach i know a hidden spot where we can monitor the stairs that lead to the holy mausoleum if theres anyone down there theyll be trapped like the rats they are well just have to take them down without getting bitten
while the plot to assassinate the archbishop shakes the monastery to its core you suspect the enemy may have a different motivation anxiety abounds as the goddesss rite of rebirth commences
we were right unwanted gusts have come to visit
those central church dastards have spotted us  buy me some time while i open the seal on the casket
im on it
it is as we suspected the enemy is within
our enemy appears to be after the tomb of saint seiros in the back are they attempting to steal her bones it would be best to defeat them before the achieve their aim
look closely  there are contraptions of some sort on the floor we must pay attention to our enemies weapons and advance while attacking them from advantageous positions
death knight prove your strength and scatter these fools
i dont take commands or waste my time on weaklings
that knight is a powerful enemy  lets do all we can to avoid him
the enemy is after the casket of saint seiros do they intend to steal her bones we must defeat those enemies before they open the casket
but look closely at the ground  there are contraptions of some sort in place well have to look closely at the enemies weapons and advance while attacking them from the best positions possible
that knight looks like he has experience it would be foolish to challenge him recklessly
our guess was spot on looks like we have company
looks like the enemy is going after the casket in the back maybe theyre going after the saints bones weird id like to defeat them before they can finish the job
but did you notice look closely at the ground theres some kind of contraption on certain parts of the floor the smart move is to advance while finding the best fighting positions we can based on the enemys weaponry
im getting a really disturbing vibe from that guy  no one go near the evil looking knight ok
the reinforcements havent arrived if they approach from behind we can attack them from both sides 
its no use the seal is broken you cant  huh a sword
like moths to a flame 
i told you that if you fled i would not chase you but it seems you wish to die 
i didnt expect to encounter someone like you  how fortunate
youre too late the seal will be broken any minute now 
its no use the seal is broken you cant  huh a sword
theres no way around it  i accept your challenge
oh this will be fun 
oh my how frightening wont you please go easy on me
you  was this meeting preordained
hmm what do you mean
that sword is i see what a pleasant surprise
ugh he got away that sword  why is it  
thats the sword that was in the casket seems to be shimmering almost as though 
he got away  we have no choice but to let them go for now professor  the way that sword is glowing i wonder 
the jerk got away was that magic we cant even chase after him hey professor the way that sword is shining  do you think it could be 
is the intruder here oh  looks like you have this under control you round up any stragglers
will do
as all of you have committed a breach of faith the archbishop will now pass judgement
inciting a kingdom noble to rebel unlawful entry the attempted assassination of the archbishop an attack on the holy mausoleum it is unnecessary to go on followers of the western church
what we have nothing to do with the western church
you have already been identified please spare us your second rate theater
dishonoring a holy ceremony is worthy of death for a member of the church you are well past the hope of redemption if you have any grace remaining you will willingly offer your life as atonement for this crime
no this isnt what we were told would happen weve been deceived
its no use arguing whatever your excuse the punishment stands
may your souls find peace as they return to the goddess 
wait please the goddess would never forgive you for our execution
monster we know youve already slaughtered many of our fellow brethren like this
this concludes the investigation please remove these poor lost souls from my sight
thats that i suppose the assassination attempt the attack on the holy mausoleum  it was all the western churchs doing that masked knight who led the attack somehow managed to disappear without a trace
the church of seiros clearly isnt as unified as it would hope to appear it seems the bishop of the western church was always opposed to the church being ruled centrally from garreg mach perhaps they hope to remove the archbishop in order to completely strip the central church of its authority
the western church 
the central church
ugh thats right jeralt mentioned that you were raised without any exposure to the church in order to function more efficiently the church of seiros is split into several smaller entities the central church is the largest and leads the organization from garreg mach
the western church extends from castle gaspard where lord lonato rebelled into the far west they can be found just beyond the most renowned stronghold of the kingdom the fortress city of arianrhod
it seems the knights have been tasked with subduing the leaders of the western church we may be give an opportunity to help them with their mission
to think our own professor was born in fódlan and yet knew nothing of the church i never imagined explaining something so basic to an instructor of mine youre something of a special case are you not
how strange that the archbishop would ask someone like that to lead her students theres clearly more to that decision than we know
lady rhea is pretty scary sometimes but to execute that whole group just like that it seems harsh even for her
if one of us does something bad i wonder what she would do to us
professor  do you agree with the archbishops actions
there you have it  it seems that the assassination attempt and the attack on the holy mausoleum were all the work of the western church as for the masked knight who led the attack  im afraid his whereabouts are yet unknown
it makes no sense that the western church would try such a thing
it just goes to show that the church of seiros is not completely united the church is led by those here in garreg mach and the western church doesnt have a strong voice on its governing council i imagine the western church has harbored some resentment towards the central church for a while now
the western church 
the central church
ah thats right jeralt did say that you grew up outside the influence of the church the church of seiros is split into a few branches across fódlan the largest being the central church which is headquartered right here at garreg mach
the western church lies far to the west of castle gaspard where lord lonato held his rebellion its situated on the far side of the kingdoms most impressive fortress arianrhod i imagine the western churchs intention was to eliminate lady rhea and the central churchs authority along with her naturally the knights will be riding out to question the western churchs top officials or rather to punish them
when they do your highness we will likely be asked to carry out said punishment
indeed now i dont mean to be rude professor but i must say that your situation is rather unusual for someone to grow up in fódlan and yet never have any contact with the church of seiros is its hard to believe
i wonder why the archbishop would hire someone like that as a professor 
so those people from the western church were  um lady rhea had them killed didnt she
well of course she did going against the teachings of seiros like that quite unforgivable
those who stray must be punished i suppose that said  professor i 
i suppose thats that the assassination attempt the attack on the holy mausoleum  looks like it was all a plot by the western church its just too bad that that masked knight who was leading the attack got away vanished without a trace
but why would the western church want to attack lady rhea
why take your pick of reasons relations with the western church arent exactly friendly
the western church 
what reasons
oh thats right jeralt mentioned that you grew up completely isolated from the church the church of seiros is split into a few different branches across fódlan the central church is headquartered right here at garreg mach
then theres the western church far west from castle gaspard where lord lonato had his little rebellion is the fortress city of arianrhod its the strongest fortress in the kingdom on the other side of it is the headquarters of the western church
not too smart to bicker with people who worship the same goddess as you
the bishop of the western church must be pretty ambitious probably hopes to split off completely in which case hed need to weaken the central churchs influence killing rhea is certainly one way to do that to the shock of no one i hear the knights have been sent to subdue the leaders of the western church well probably get a chance to assist
youre an odd one arent you professor howd you make it this far in life without ever interacting with the church i cant believe someone like you exists in fódlan its too strange
if you think thats weird consider the fact that rhea hired teach despite all that
so those guys they caught  they all got the axe right thats brutal
lady rhea can be rather intimidating at times in fact she can be downright terrifying
professor those who cannot be saved must be delivered to the goddess for judgement is that not so
there you are professor it seems lady rhea would like a word with you come with me
the archbishop lives not that i had ever placed much faith in those swine from the western church
i have news both good and bad the remains of seiros were not in the tomb however something else was the sword of the creator
ah the weapon wielded by that thief the king of liberation
thief hm at any rate it is now in the hands of the academys new professor i doubt you will be surprised to hear that the crest stone had already been removed from the sword when it was found
hmph as expected it would be foolish to keep both in the same location
theres more the professor was able to awaken the swords true power even without the crest stone the sword glowed red the professors crest is compatible there is no mistaking it
absurd using a relic without its crest stone should be impossible  the king of liberations bloodline should not even  hmm
they must be allowed to keep it for now i do not have enough information about the professor to act as for your request i assent the death knight is at your command use him well
good i believe i will enjoy this a great deal 
i cannot thank you enough for defeating those invaders in the holy mausoleum and especially for protecting the sword of the creator that sword is one of the heroes relics and the most precious artifact in the churchs possession it is also a weapon of terrifying power for now i will entrust the sword to you please use it wisely
lady rhea wait do you truly mean to give the sword of the creator to this stranger surely it is not the sort of thing that one hands over so readily even to someone who has the ability to wield it if someone like nemesis were to appear again all of fódlan would be consumed by war
nemesis
nemesis the king of liberation he is an ancient king of mankind who was defeated by seiros over a thousand years ago when fódlan was attacked by wicked gods it is said that the goddess gifted nemesis with the sword of the creator nemesis used that sword to defeat the wicked gods saving all of fódlan henceforth he was dubbed the king of liberation however his power began to corrupt him until he himself turned to the darkness saint seiros was forced to destroy him lady rhea i beg you to reconsider given a little more time we could more accurately assess this strangers abilities
no i have faith seteth faith that our friend here will not be corrupted by wickedness since the death of nemesis none have been able to wield the sword of the creator now after all those long years of being sealed away it has returned and found a new master
i understand as you wish lady rhea there you have it professor see that you do not betray the trust the archbishop has seen fit to bestow upon you
the sword of the creator the king of liberation each tale is more confusing than the last and i really cant read that rhea at all  that sword is clearly precious  so why is she so keen to gift the thing to you
it certainly is strange
the sword chose me
is that a fact
i feel as though we have become entangled in a mystery  and there is one more thing that has been plaguing me the sword of the creator  it somehow feels distinct from other relics we have seen such as the one that  oh goodness what was her name ca  cat 
catherine
yes her
cat
what is wrong with that head of yours of course its not a cat her name is catherine
the sword of the creator differs from her thunderbrand in one key way it bears a hole where something should have been but is no more i despise not knowing what is going on it it frightens me and yet  i place my trust in you i must whatever comes to pass please swear to cut a path that is your own
the sword of the creator  pulled right from the legends i finally found it and yet it ended up in teachs hands could i even use it anyway damn it theres no telling whats to come
