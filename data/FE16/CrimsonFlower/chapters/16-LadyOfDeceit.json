Before Fhirdiad, we must take Arianrhod, which lies near the border between the Empire and the Kingdom. As a city on the boundary of the two territories, it must be taken at once."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What's the plan?"}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "There is another location we must take before moving on to Fhirdiad. South of the capital, there is a fortress city on the border of the Empire and the Kingdom. It is called Arianrhod, and we must take control of it at once."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "There are many mages within Arianrhod. We will also face Cornelia, a general of the Kingdom. We must also contend with Rodrigue, the head of House Fraldarius, as well as his troops. Once we defeat them, Arianrhod will be ours."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "I hear Cornelia has a suspicious magic weapon at her disposal. We must attack before the enemy can respond with defensive measures. That is why we are preparing an assault before even our allies are aware. Even within our ranks, there is no way to know with certainty that there is not a rat among us who would leak such information."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "When Arianrhod falls, we'll focus on striking Fhirdiad from both the south and the east.

I enjoy attacks that are surprising."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why's that?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Because it's like hunting?"}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Yes. Hunting is like doing surprise attacks on prey."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries. That is a wonderful thing. I have no liking for the thought of losing someone."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Since I allied with you and the emperor, my resolve has never wavered. I abandoned my country.

He hates the Empire so much he's willing to do anything to bring it down."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He hates the Empire?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Yeah, because of the role the Empire played in the Tragedy of Duscur. You know, even back at the Officers Academy, he never had much to do with anyone from the Empire."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "He wasn't like that before?"}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "No. Then again, maybe we just didn't actually know him at all."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "We'll be fighting Dimitri and his troops soon.

I know we've got no choice but to fight the Kingdom, but I really don't want Fhirdiad to become a battlefield... Lots of my old friends still live in the city, and many people there were kind to me. If fighting breaks out there, all of those people might get caught up in it..."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "I never thought this day would come--that I'd fight my homeland.

Maybe it was too dramatic...or I didn't yell it loud enough!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Soon we'll assault Fhirdiad, the Kingdom's capital! This'll be one for the history books.

You put on a good show."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Heh, I appreciate the compliment! I worried I was laying it on too thick..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Your performance is a bit stilted."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Is it? I thought I sounded quite sincere."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "In any case, let's do our best! We're coming for you, Fhirdiad! And so on, heh."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I've been informed of the surprise attack. That information could be devastating, were the enemy to find out. It moves me to know I've been trusted with it. Edelgard and those within the army... They really do trust me. Initially, I had my own motives for joining the Black Eagle Strike Force. But now, all I want is to support Edelgard."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "Even though we're denying the doctrine and fighting the knights, I keep praying to the goddess... When I think about those who have fallen in battle... I...I have no choice but to pray. The goddess of the church may be a fallacy, but I'm sure she still exists in some form. I'm weak. I would be nothing without her."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Don't you think this plan to use the entire army for a surprise attack is a bit--I don't know--cowardly? Sorry, the word just kind of slipped out. Maybe don't tell Edelgard or Hubert I said that. No matter the target or strategy, I'll do my job."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "It's hard to feel cheery when you've just gone to battle against old friends. Mraaaugh! No!

Forgive me, Jeralt!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "How about you go fishing?"}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Fishing, huh? That may brighten my mood a bit, now that you mention it."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "I'm sure it must be even harder for you, to fight against your students.

I never believed in Seiros. And my old colleagues are now just enemies."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Sometimes it's easier to get by without any personal attachment or religious beliefs."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "There's a school of sorcery in Fhirdiad, which is staffed by the top minds of magical research. The study of Crests and sorcery should not be separate. I've often thought I should pay them a visit someday. I never imagined I might end up invading the place with an army though. Not how I imagined it at all."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "How have we come to this? Fighting the archbishop and her knights... I'd never imagined... I hate this. So much. Professor, I tried. I gave treatment to everyone I could, but...but lives were still lost.

The demon within me will be satiated only by fighting you."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered.

I have not heard a thing about... Ah... I understand now. I am the target."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "You? Are you sure they do not mean to take Arianrhod for strategic reasons?"}, {"speaker": "Cornelia", "line": "It would appear so from the outside. However, the circumstances are not that simple.

The sweet children I have prepared will protect Arianrhod well..."}, {"speaker": "Rodrigue", "line": "Cornelia..."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Arianhrod is a fortress city that was built about 400 years ago. Originally a base on the front lines of the battle against the Kingdom, it was built using Imperial money and technology."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "However, the head of House Rowe secretly planned to betray the Empire. As the fortress neared completion, it was rebuilt as a base to defend against the Empire. When the fortress was completed, House Rowe declared its vassalage to the Kingdom."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Since then, Arianrhod has never fallen. Not once. The beautiful white walls that protect it against its enemies have earned it the nickname the Silver Maiden.

Now is now."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "A fortress that has never fallen?! Ooh, I can't wait to make it fall!"}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "How savage of you. And yet, I must say I agree with the sentiment. Let us take the sturdy Arianrhod and continue our march against the Kingdom!"}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "An invincible fortress? Sounds perfect!"}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "Unfortunately, it will soon no longer be invincible. The Silver Maiden's iron skin is about to be damaged. It's sad, really."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Is it silver or iron? Use your language with clarity, please."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Really, Lin. There must be a better way to say that. Since we are attacking a heavily guarded place, we must take extra care to prevent allies from getting injured."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Thank you, everyone. I'm counting on all of you.

But it's not like I'm just going to just stand by and watch... I will slaughter them all."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "So this is the Silver Maiden... Seeing it with my own eyes, I finally understand its strength. Especially the fact that its strength is distributed across its frontal defenses.

And that you even deceived some of your allies."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I'm happy to have earned your praise. However, to say that I deceived my allies is a bit misleading. I despise leaks of information, and there may have been a church rat hiding amongst our ranks."}, {"speaker": "Lord Arundel", "line": "Ah, I see. However, there are some unfortunate consequences.

I must take my leave now. Farewell."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Lady Edelgard, there you are. We just received some truly shocking news.

I, of all people, should be able to control my discomposure. The pillars of light descended and exploded, resulting in the complete destruction of the main building and the north wall.

Of the Imperial officers and men we kept at Arianrhod, about a third are unaccounted for..."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "It can't be true... So...this is my uncle's trump card. In exchange for striking down Cornelia, he has destroyed Arianrhod!"}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Perhaps we acted too soon in our disposal of Cornelia..."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "No. If we'll be fighting them soon, there's no disadvantage to weakening their forces. It's also extremely valuable that we forced them to show their hand. Hubert, the investigation you made into the legend of Ailell, the Valley of Torment... This is likely what took place back then as well."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Yes... The probability is high."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Valley of Torment?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The same thing happened in the past?"}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Yes, it is quite likely."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "North of Garreg Mach there is a valley where the earth is always aflame. Once, javelins of light fell from the sky there... They pierced the earth and set the forest ablaze, creating a land of torment. We believed it may have been the work of the goddess, but... It was actually an attack by those who slither in the dark. That sums up all that we know."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "By giving us that knowledge, those who died at Arianrhod will not have died in vain."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Indeed.

I trust you, my teacher."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I'm sure everyone has heard about what transpired at Arianrhod.

Their victims also include members of House Rowe, the Imperial army, and many, many more."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "According to our investigation, the forbidden attack that destroyed Arianrhod cannot be used again so quickly. Even so, we cannot delay our efforts. We must put a stop to all of this by the end of next month.

We are walking down the path to a better tomorrow."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "A cornered church... Hmm, well, count me out from any forbidden sorcery that can destroy whole cities.
