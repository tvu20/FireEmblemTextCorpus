Will they not side with us?"}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "The head of House Fraldarius, Lord Rodrigue, has entered the city.

I have to say, I am impressed beyond words."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "The majority is with us. This conflict will end soon. I am so moved by the Alliance nobles' decision. That is true nobility! Acting in accordance with the people's needs and wishes. As war drags on, those living near the front lines inevitably get the worst of it.

Three hundred years of history...gone and done. They write operas about events like this, you know. I'm sure you'll be played by the most handsome actor of the time.

Our next battle will be there, against him, or in Fhirdiad, which the king is protecting."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Can you fight them?"}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "Ha!

You just worry about yourself."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "Derdriu's fallen. The Alliance nobles have surrendered to the Empire. We made it through with as few losses as possible.

Isn't there some way we can come to an understanding?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Maybe there is."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Yeah, but Edelgard and her idiot sidekick haven't shown much desire to compromise, have they?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "No."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Harsh...but true.

I guess everybody feels that way though."}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "Oh, Claude. I'm so relieved that he managed to make it out alive. You'll be fighting the Kingdom next, right?

Probably the people of a future era."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "While the battle with the Alliance is over, we still need to stay vigilant. Both the church and the Kingdom are not to be taken lightly. I have the feeling we'll draw their attention soon. Weapon prep and training are of the utmost importance now more than ever."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "It seems all that praise of Claude's ingenuity was largely unfounded. A truly clever man would have realized defeat was inevitable and surrendered. Or, failing that, he could have rallied the Alliance nobles to secure a real fighting chance."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "I'm no noble, so it won't make much difference to me... But it hasn't really hit me yet that the Alliance is finished."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "To think, I saw the end of the Leicester Alliance with my own eyes.

Although...I've no desire to continue on with my family, so from here on out, it's up to Edelgard. I have Claude to thank. Ultimately, this ended without the Alliance being entirely consumed by war. It's all thanks to Claude."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "I have Claude to thank. Before the battle, he considered my precarious position and told me it wouldn't matter if we fell to the Empire. So when you invited me, I accepted without hesitation. Ultimately, this ended without the Alliance being entirely consumed by war.

Won't make a very good mercenary otherwise, will I?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I still hesitate."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "That's reassuring. I don't think I'll ever get used to it."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Fighting old friends--there's nothing worse.

Does that make me soft?"}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "I've lived at Garreg Mach Monastery for a few decades now. Still, the other day I got myself all turned around! There are so many secret rooms and hidden passages. Maybe I'll take the time to properly search the place. Care to join me? I expect it'd take a whole day."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "You're too soft. I'm talking about Claude. Our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way... But perhaps she is more tolerant of those who know their place."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way...

The poor boy..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Does this pose an obstacle to your research?"}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "No... At the very least, I think not. There are other, lesser Crests to research. Yet I am a human first and a scholar second. For now, I grieve the fallen and pray for those still living."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "You know as well as I do, the day's coming that we'll have to fight the archbishop and her knights. We've got some strong fighters here, sure. But even with all our training, I don't know if we can win. I just don't see how any of us can compete with the archbishop, say, turning into a monster."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "If we must fight, we will."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "Yeah? What if that fight's to the death--yours and mine in particular?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Sometimes it can be better to retreat."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "That's exactly what I was saying.

There is no other reason for me to be here."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "The Alliance is just...gone. It's hard to believe. The merchants of Derdriu all have nerves of steel. I'm sure they'll be up and running again in no time."}, {"speaker": "Randolph", "line": "Finally, the Kingdom... After that, we'll battle the church. I volunteered for monastery guard duty. It was more for my family than anything. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I want to see Her Majesty ruling this land. Even if it costs me my life, I will protect Garreg Mach!"}, {"speaker": "Fleche", "line": "I just wanted to help out my brother, Randolph, so I aspired to be a soldier.

Eventually the enemy will attack, and when they do, we'll defend this place to the bitter end!"}, {"speaker": "Ladislava", "line": "Your next opponents will be the Kingdom's army and the Knights of Seiros. Both fearsome foes. Put the mobility of my troops to good use, and let us protect the Kngdom's western battle front. When this month has ended, I'll depart. I pray that you have good luck in battle."}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You may already know this, but the Kingdom and the Alliance were once a single entity. The leaders of the Alliance, House Riegan, are actually a branch of the Blaiddyd royal family. In a way, it's just a battle of the part of Blaiddyd family tree that rose in rebellion against the Empire..."}], "intro": [{"speaker": "Imperial Soldier", "line": "Raid from the north!

If so, focus our attacks on her first."}, {"speaker": "Imperial Soldier", "line": "Understood!"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Our enemy knows Garreg Mach from inside and out.

I'll leave the preparations to you."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Heh. The battle looks to be rather cumbersome. We are still guarding all of Garreg Mach, but there are undoubtedly numerous secret passages and magic traps... There is still much about this place that we do not know. It is quite possible that they will attack from a location we cannot anticipate."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I must head out first to give my orders. I'll meet up with you soon.

The same one who saved my life..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "That is true... Though I find forgiveness difficult, we do owe that wayward soul a debt. However, the fact remains that because of the professor, Rhea has long been tormented. To think that the vessel of the goddess, entrusted with the Sword of the Creator, could go on to... Ah, it angers me to even think of it! All that has happened has changed Rhea. I imagine it has changed the professor as well. Even if we prevail, I doubt the church can ever fully return to the way it once was..."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Umm... Brother?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Dear Flayn. I only brought you with me because you were so insistent. Still, no matter what happens, you must not go near the front lines. If something were to happen to you, it would utterly destroy me. You are my reason for breathing. Do you understand?"}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "I...I understand. If something were to happen to you, it would break my heart. I could not go on either.
