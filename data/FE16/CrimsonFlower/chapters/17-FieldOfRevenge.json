I've seen it firsthand."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I hear that House Blaiddyd commands some strong and well-trained troops. People say they're fiercely devoted and will gladly die for their king. Reminds me of Lonato's men-the ones we faced back in Magdred. Unlike those civilian soldiers though, here we're up against the best that the Faerghus army has to offer. It's going to be a hard battle, but if there's a peaceful tomorrow waiting on the other side, it'll be worth it."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "I've been thinking about how we've got our own ideas about justice...and so does the Kingdom. And what's coming, it's not just a battle between us and them. It's our ideals that are fighting. Whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong. That's how it goes... But nobody's willing to talk or compromise, so we'll fight to the death to prove the other guy's wrong. It won't be an easy battle, but let's make sure we come back alive. Right, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "When I first enrolled in the Officers Academy, I never thought it would come to this.

There wasn't a situation he couldn't strategize his way out of. Whereas, King Dimitri is known as the Tempest King. He is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. We still haven't ever faced him head-on. Can we do this?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We can."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Yes. Of course we can! I'm sorry.

Together...we can overcome even the most formidable foe!"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Personally I take no issue with attacking Lady Rhea. But the eagerness of my fellow nobles does vex me, despite so many grand displays of piety from them in the past. It gives me the impression that faith is little more than a tool they use to maintain their positions of power."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Disappointed in the nobility?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "I suppose I am in no position to judge them, being among their number myself. Still, it irritates me."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Is religion obsolete, then?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "If it is no longer useful as a tool, then I expect the nobles will cease to give it any credence."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "What is a noble's duty, truly? I hope we will discover an answer in the conflict ahead."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Hyah! Next up's the Kingdom capital! We're coming for you! Whoa. That sounds familiar. Have I said that before?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You're imagining things."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Really? You're probably right. It's not like we've invaded the Kingdom capital before."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It's not your imagination."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Really? Does that mean we've invaded the Kingdom capital before?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Let's head for the Kingdom capital!"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Yeah! Let's do it, Professor! I just gotta get my muscles prepped and ready first!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Once the Kingdom capital falls, all of F\u00f3dlan will be united under the banner of the Empire.

We're going to make history."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Only if we win."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Well, yes, I suppose that's true."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Unless we lose."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Hah! I don't think that will happen."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Let's stay calm and focus on the battle."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Yes, of course! I'll do my best."}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "Our opponents may be strong, but with you on our side, we can't lose!"}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "If we win this battle, it will be an end to the Kingdom, and to the church. Under the Empire, an era of peace would begin... Many people are cleaving to this notion, but I wonder if it would really end up as such."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It will."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "Such resolve.

Let's both live to see the dawn of a bright new age!"}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "I wonder would the captain would say if he knew we were planning to take down Lady Rhea.

I'm ready!"}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "The idea of defeating Rhea is beginning to feel more like a reality.

It may soon be possible to abolish the nobility, and create a world where none need suffer due to crests."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "You need not say anything.

This army is almost all single men. If that marital status came before or during the war, I'm not to say... The point is, I'm in charge of the infirmary. I wind up treating hundreds of men every week. I get to talk to all sorts of men, from all walks of life, all of the time. And yet..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You don't have a boyfriend?"}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "No! Not one of those men is infatuated with their caregiver!

I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too.

Those petulant fleas must be picked off one by one. There are nothing if not persistent."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "There's no guarantee that we'll win next time."}, {"speaker": "Jeritza", "line": "And if we do not win, then we die. Either has its charms."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "Seems like the war is gonna end soon. Once the dust settles, it'll be back to rolling in fat stacks of gold for me!"}, {"speaker": "Fleche", "line": "Ah! Did you want something?! Sorry, I was a bit lost in thought... Or rather, I was thinking about work. My brother had sorted out all his personal affairs, but apparently he'd forgotten about his work duties. So now I've got a ton more work on my plate... Oh, Brother, why must you be so careless...

Yes, that is the very moment I have long for..."}, {"speaker": "Dimitri", "line": "I was hoping they would strike the church first... We must have miscalculated the rate of their advance.

For you, I will..."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "A flag of blue is flapping in the rain... It must be the Kingdom army."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Yes. It seems that King Dimitri is leading the troops himself. However, the Knights of Seiros have yet to be seen. Perhaps they have split up."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I can't imagine that Dimitri would leave the capital to the church and face us with the Kingdom army alone. He must be planning to use the church to gain the upper hand in battle. With the rain, that must be difficult to coordinate...

Inform the entire army."}, {"speaker": "Imperial Soldier", "line": "Yes, sir!"}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "Now that I think about it, the Kingdom's Army is quite different than it once was. They have taken a position of interception. In the past, the king would have introduced himself before beginning a fair fight."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "A fair fight... The words alone remind me of how he once was. Don't you agree, Professor?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Who might that be?"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Oh, have you forgotten already?
