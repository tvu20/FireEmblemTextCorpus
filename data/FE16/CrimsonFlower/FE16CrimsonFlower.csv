FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Lord Arundel|So, we have finally arrived. It has been a very, very long road.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Why are you here, Uncle? We haven't prevailed just yet.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Lord Arundel|Even better. I decided I wanted to see the end with my own eyes. The very moment that humans will finally be free from the control of that false beast of a goddess..|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Understood. Behold to your heart's content, just don't get in our way.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Lord Arundel|Of course. I could not stand to be dragged into the fighting. When this fight is over, a world completely controlled by the Empire will be upon us.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Not completely... I will only do what I must. But until our reign becomes stable... Uncle... No, all of you. I believe that your power and knowledge may be essential during that time of transition.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Lord Arundel|Perhaps so. We also will do what we must. For that short while, we will lend your our strength.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Yes... We're counting on you. For now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Professor, may I speak with you?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|What's on your mind?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|I know the timing is less than ideal, but there's something I need to tell you. I imagine you've already sensed it, but even still... I must tell you the truth...of the power you wield and of what you are.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|I have sensed it too.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|I expected as much.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|What are you talking about?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Have you still yet to realize it? If so, then it's absolutely vital that I tell you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|You, like Rhea, share a bloodline with the so-called goddess. Your mother likely had some connection to the goddess, whose power has always been sleeping within you. Five years ago when your power awakened, I was afraid you would choose to join with Rhea.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|You thought I would join her?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|I did.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|Five years ago...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Yes. In the Sealed Forest, when you returned from the eternal darkness...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|As you know, my goal is to free our world from the control of Rhea and the other children of the goddess. I seek to obliterate her, as well as those around her who use the church's power to control Fódlan. I swore to free the people from Rhea by striking her down, whether or not it meant making an enemy of you. And yet...you came to my aid and chose to walk with me on the path against Rhea. I was overjoyed of course, but I was also confused. I thought that perhaps it wasn't the path you were meant to take. But I chose to trust in you, to rely on you and your strength. And now, here we are.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|I understand...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Thank you for listening, my teacher. I'm glad I finally had the chance to talk to you about it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|Please explain it once more.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Of course...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|After Rhea is gone from this world, I don't know what will become of you. But whatever happens, I hope you know that you're very special to me. I hope that I hold a special place in your heart as well. But regardless...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|You are the one person in this world who can share the heavy burden I must carry. Someone without equal who I can always speak my mind to...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|It's time. Let's go, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Rhea! Members of the Church of Seiros! Surely there's no reason to continue this fight. What could possibly be gained by shutting yourselves inside the capital of a kingdom without a king? I will give you this one chance...and no other. Throw down your weapons and surrender! Unlike you, I have no desire to unleash wicked atrocities upon this world!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Hubert|Their silence speaks volumes. Shall we commence our attack?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|I'll wait just a moment longer. There are still many residents within the city. Unlike my attack at Garreg Mach five years ago, the church will not allow the inhabitants to evacuate. What the hell are they planning...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|Lady Rhea...Or rather, Lady Seiros. The Imperial army is calling for our surrender. Is it wise to ignore them? Perhaps we could leave Fódlan and devise another plan...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Seiros|We shall not surrender. We must not lose! Even if it must split the heavens, we shall not yield to the wicked ones!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|Understood... I will do as you command. You have my fealty no matter what, until my last moment of life.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Cyril|I'll stay by your side too...forever.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Seiros|Now, Catherine. Set fire to the city. The Imperial army will burn in the flames of eternal torment!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|What?! No, you can't do that!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Seiros|Catherine. Now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|As...as you wish. But is there truly no other way?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Seiros|I have no patience for foolish questions. I shall sacrifice as many lives as it takes! That apostate who insists on taking everything from me...will by crushed by my own hands!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|The Immaculate One|GRAAAARGH!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|That ghastly voice...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Imperial Soldier|Your Majesty! There's smoke coming from every corner of the capital! It seems they've set fire to the city!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|What?! Damn it, Rhea. There really is no depth you wouldn't sink into. Everyone, we must commence our attack at once. Are you ready?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Hubert|Preparations are complete. Just say the word.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Then we attack. We'll head straight for the castle and strike down their leader--Rhea, that vile creature called the Immaculate One! This is the end of our long war. After this victory, Fódlan will finally be united and truly free! The capital we're about to invade is engulfed in flames. Do not rush to your deaths. Survive. Prevail. Do that and we'll witness the birth of a new world. I want to see it with all of you at my side. Understood?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Hubert|Of course. I will not fall and leave you without your protector. That you may live to see your dream to fruition... For that, I shall survive and prevail!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Petra|I am carrying the future of Brigid. I will not be dying here! I will be winning. For myself and everyone, I will be surviving!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Caspar|We've been cutting our own path this whole way. There's no stopping until we reach the end! I can't die, or all my great work so far will have been wasted!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Dorothea|Don't worry about me, Edie. I won't fall before I've found my happily ever after. Maybe when this war is over I can finally snag a good catch and settle down!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Linhardt|Somehow we're already here... I wonder if the peace we secure will allow me to research as much as I'd like. If so, let's end this quickly!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Bernadetta|Edelgard! Professor! I'll do my best for both of you! If I die here, it would be with shame and regret... Oh, I can't let that happen!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Ferdinand|Once the world is united, I will lend my strength to both Edelgard and the Professor. To that end, I will lead us all safely to victory! My pride and duty as a noble demand no less! As do my own principles!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Byleth|Let's win this, together!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Imperial army! Black Eagle Strike Force! Move out!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|At last, we made it to Fhirdiad, but...it's in a pitiful state.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Caspar|It's so awful to see the Kingdom capital go up in flames, but at least we made it this far!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Hubert|We finally stand before the palace. Though these flames will our friends and foes alike.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Those who stand in our way will perish with the flames. Immaculate One...your reign ends, here and now!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|With fire raging all over the city, our enemies won't be able to advance in large numbers. Instead, they may try to defeat us with small squads of elite warriors.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|The Immaculate One|Indeed, I suspect as much. And at their head is the one who stole my mother from me and likely that mutinous whelp, Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Bernadetta|The whole city's burning! oh, this isn't good! I'm flammable, you know!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Petra|If possible, we must be avoiding the flame and be careful of strong enemies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Hubert|If we want to minimize our losses, we will need to be flexible in our approach.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|The Immaculate One|Open your hearts and accept your fate... The immaculate roar saves only the righteous! GRWOAAAAAARRRR!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Linhardt|What? Her howl as unadulterated magic. I didn't know such a display of power was possible.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Ferdinand|That roar seems to have affected the dolls' movements.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Dorothea|Whenever the Immaculate One howls, those dolls become stronger.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Such power resides in the Immaculate One's roar... We must destroy those golems, and quickly!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Gilbert|I was trusted to protect the future of this nation. The royal bloodline itself! I cannot yield! I will fulfill my duty even if I must forfeit my life!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Gilbert|I can only lament that you chose to side with the Empire. I am a royal knight, and I will destroy all of His Majesty's foes!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Gilbert|Annette...I knew this day would come.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Annette|Yes... And so did I, Father. Be warned that I will push you aside, even if I must use force to do it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Gilbert|I understand. Goddess...this is surely a chastisement from you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Gilbert|Majesty... I beg...forgiveness... My promise to you... I...could not...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Annette|Don't worry, Father... I will protect the capital and the whole Kingdom!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Ashe|Our pride, our people, our king. You've torn them all apart. Haven't you had enough?! What else is there for you to take?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Ashe|Don't look at me that way. You'll throw off my aim!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Ashe|I tried...to do the right thing, Lonato...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Annette|I won't let you take Fhirdiad! I'll defend this place with my very life!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Annette|Why, Professor? Why must we fight like this? Surely there was another path you could have taken that wouldn't have led to this...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Annette|Urgh, it hurts... Help me, Father...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Gilbert|Annette! I will avenge you, my daughter.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|I will pour everything into this blade--my body, my soul. Thunderbrand rumbles, urging me on. I am the goddess's servant. You will taste my blade!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|I wish you'd never shown your face at Garreg Mach. I always knew you were trouble, yet I did nothing. Time for me to correct that mistake. Prepare to meet your end!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Shamir|Hello, Catherine. I always knew this day would come.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|What a coincidence, so did I. It seems that we now have no choice. We have nothing in common. Not our backgrounds, not our beliefs.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Shamir|Not the way we lived...or the way we die.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Catherine|Lady Rhea... My service ends here. It's been an honor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Cyril|Get away from Lady Rhea!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Cyril|You made Lady Rhea hurt! I'll never forgive you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Cyril|Lady Rhea, thank you...for everything...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|The Immaculate One|I see the years have not cured humanity of its folly... You still wish to hurt and betray my mother and myself!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|The Immaculate One|Give her back... Give back my mother! Gaaaaaah!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|So it's true. You don't value human life at all. Isn't that right, Immaculate One?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|The Immaculate One|Nonsense! Fools who do not accept their own sins are undeserving of salvation! You humans are the ones who betrayed! You betrayed me, and you betrayed my mother!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|I did not betray you or her. I never believed in you from the beginning.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|The Immaculate One|Give it back!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|When humanity stands strong and people reach out for each other...there's no need for gods. Rhea. Your reign of tyranny is over.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|The time has come.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|I'm ending this once and for all!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|18-ToTheEndOfADream|Edelgard|Is it...is it over?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|The time has come to invade the Kingdom capital. Or so I declared. In truth, we'll be advancing to a different location. Only you and the rest of the Black Eagle Strike Force can know. Please bear that in mind.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Seems you've already anticipated our intentions, Professor. Well done. Before Fhirdiad, we must take Arianrhod, which lies near the border between the Empire and the Kingdom. As a city on the boundary of the two territories, it must be taken at once.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|What's the plan?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|There is another location we must take before moving on to Fhirdiad. South of the capital, there is a fortress city on the border of the Empire and the Kingdom. It is called Arianrhod, and we must take control of it at once.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|There are many mages within Arianrhod. We will also face Cornelia, a general of the Kingdom. We must also contend with Rodrigue, the head of House Fraldarius, as well as his troops. Once we defeat them, Arianrhod will be ours.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|I hear Cornelia has a suspicious magic weapon at her disposal. We must attack before the enemy can respond with defensive measures. That is why we are preparing an assault before even our allies are aware. Even within our ranks, there is no way to know with certainty that there is not a rat among us who would leak such information.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|When Arianrhod falls, we'll focus on striking Fhirdiad from both the south and the east. The deeper we carve our way into Kingdom and church territory, the more favorable our position. As ever, I'm counting on you, my teacher.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Professor? Halt! Don't come in here!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Hasn't this happened before?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Ugh, I thought I told you to forget about that. There's something I don't want you to see.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Is it a portrait?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|So...you know about it. Yes, it's a portrait. Of you. I painted it myself. It's, uh...quite disgraceful. I did a terrible job with it, and it looks nothing like you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Thank you for that, Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|I'm happy that you appreciate my efforts, but...please don't touch that door.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|This was a trying month, but we did manage to hold Garreg Mach—if only just. The power of Seteth and Flayn was certainly a sight to behold. The archbishop's supporters were strong. But with this victory, we have all but cornered the Church of Seiros and its knights. The goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|This was a trying month, but we did manage to hold Garreg Mach—if only just. Honestly, I did not expect such strident supporters of the archbishop as Seteth and Flayn to flee. But with this victory, we have all but cornered the Church of Seiros and its knights. The goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ferdinand|Dimitri, the King of Faerghus. He despises Edelgard and everything she stands for. I am of the opinion that a man seized by such strong feelings is not fit to be king. It is a sad situation, really.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Kings are people too.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ferdinand|If he cannot suppress his emotions to make reasoned decisions, he should abdicate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Kings can't be emotional?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ferdinand|No, they cannot. Kingly judgement has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ferdinand|At any rate, I find it hard to believe that Dimitri could defeat Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Linhardt|There are stories of Heroes' Relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today. So many, in fact, that I'm led to wonder if those Relics are nothing more than legends... Especially since we know of Relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 Fódlan Elites.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Caspar|All right! Off to the Kingdom's capital we go! What's the matter? Should I not be excited? I can't help it. Everyone's gotta have something to look forward to!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Bernadetta|I've got a dream, you know. Not that I think it'll come true, but it's nice to hope. I'd like to get out of Fódlan and travel across the sea. Maybe to Dagda. Maybe even past that. I want to see all the wild jungles out there, the huge flowers, and--oh--the carnivorous plants! I know it's not realistic, and I know it's probably impossible, but that's what I'd like.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Bernadetta|I've got a dream, you know. I don't know if it'll come true, but it's nice to hope. Remember when I went to Brigid, with Petra? I drew a picture of some of the flowers I saw there. Next time, I wanna go even farther. Maybe Dagda. Maybe even past that. I wanna fill a whole book with the drawings of the biggest plants I see! And the carnivorous ones especially! Oh, I hope I get the chance...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Dorothea|I heard that Randolph died in battle guarding Garreg Mach. We knew each other for, wow, more than five years... My chest feels tight. Think about it. There's no end in sight to the fighting. I might be next. Any of us could be.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|We'll make it through together. Relationship with Dorothea goes up)|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Dorothea|Together, eh? That sounds like one of Sylvain's old pick-up lines! But yes, let's get through this war. Together.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|I don't see an end to it either.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Dorothea|When the days are filled with fighting, or preparing to fight, it really does feel like this could last forever.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Petra|I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Why's that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Because it's like hunting?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Petra|Yes. Hunting is like doing surprise attacks on prey.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Petra|Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries. That is a wonderful thing. I have no liking for the thought of losing someone.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|Since I allied with you and the emperor, my resolve has never wavered. I abandoned my country. I am prepared to kill my father, and kill a man I once called my friend. Resolute as I am, my sword feels...heavy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ashe|In Faerghus, there's an amazing knight of House Rowe they call the Gray Lion. I heard about him from Lonato, who was an acquaintance of his. Apparently he's getting old, but with each year that passes, he only hones his skills even more.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Sylvain|Some people are so in awe of King Dimitri, they call him the Tempest King. After he wins, there won't be anything left. He'll be a storm, leaving nothing behind. He hates the Empire so much he's willing to do anything to bring it down.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|He hates the Empire?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Sylvain|Yeah, because of the role the Empire played in the Tragedy of Duscur. You know, even back at the Officers Academy, he never had much to do with anyone from the Empire.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|He wasn't like that before?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Sylvain|No. Then again, maybe we just didn't actually know him at all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Sylvain|We'll be fighting Dimitri and his troops soon. We all oughta train a little harder if we want to stay alive.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Mercedes|Well, that was certainly frightening.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|What was?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|The church?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Mercedes|You're very perceptive, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Mercedes|Having to fight against the Church of Seiros was unnerving. To push back against something I've hinged so much of my life upon... I was terrified. But now we must fight Lady Rhea, and I won't back down!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Annette|I used to live in the Kingdom capital with my parents. I know we've got no choice but to fight the Kingdom, but I really don't want Fhirdiad to become a battlefield... Lots of my old friends still live in the city, and many people there were kind to me. If fighting breaks out there, all of those people might get caught up in it...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|I never thought this day would come--that I'd fight my homeland. My betrothed was a knight who served the king. He died bravely to protect the future of our country. Now I'm betraying the place he fought to protect. I'm betraying him. But I must do this. Professor. I believe in the path you have chosen for us.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lorenz|It seems we will soon set foot in Fhirdiad. I used to live there, you know. Though that was before my time in the Officers Academy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Were you a hostage?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lorenz|No, of course not. There is a school of magic there, which I was enrolled in for a time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Were you an exchange student?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lorenz|That's right. I was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lorenz|Trouble within the Kingdom forced me to return to Alliance lands. There was much I had yet to learn.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Raphael|Hyah! Next up is the Kingdom's capital! We're coming for you! What's wrong? Was that too much? Maybe it was too dramatic...or I didn't yell it loud enough!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ignatz|Soon we'll assault Fhirdiad, the Kingdom's capital! This'll be one for the history books. Our enemy won't hold anything back. I'm quivering with excitement at the very thought of it!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Bravo. You put on a good show.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ignatz|Heh, I appreciate the compliment! I worried I was laying it on too thick...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Your performance is a bit stilted.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ignatz|Is it? I thought I sounded quite sincere.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ignatz|In any case, let's do our best! We're coming for you, Fhirdiad! And so on, heh.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lysithea|I've been informed of the surprise attack. That information could be devastating, were the enemy to find out. It moves me to know I've been trusted with it. Edelgard and those within the army... They really do trust me. Initially, I had my own motives for joining the Black Eagle Strike Force. But now, all I want is to support Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Marianne|Even though we're denying the doctrine and fighting the knights, I keep praying to the goddess... When I think about those who have fallen in battle... I...I have no choice but to pray. The goddess of the church may be a fallacy, but I'm sure she still exists in some form. I'm weak. I would be nothing without her.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Leonie|Don't you think this plan to use the entire army for a surprise attack is a bit--I don't know--cowardly? Sorry, the word just kind of slipped out. Maybe don't tell Edelgard or Hubert I said that. No matter the target or strategy, I'll do my job.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Alois|It's hard to feel cheery when you've just gone to battle against old friends. Mraaaugh! No! I will not let myself be gloomy!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Go easy on yourself.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Alois|You're trying to take care of me, but it's supposed to be the other way around! Forgive me, Jeralt!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|How about you go fishing?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Alois|Fishing, huh? That may brighten my mood a bit, now that you mention it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Alois|I'm sure it must be even harder for you, to fight against your students. When times are tough, just remember, you can always rely on your old pal Alois!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Shamir|Last month's fight with the Knights of Seiros was a disaster.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Are you all right?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Shamir|Are you asking me if I'm OK with killing my former colleagues?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|You seem fine.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Shamir|I am. I never believed in Seiros. And my old colleagues are now just enemies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Shamir|Sometimes it's easier to get by without any personal attachment or religious beliefs.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hanneman|There's a school of sorcery in Fhirdiad, which is staffed by the top minds of magical research. The study of Crests and sorcery should not be separate. I've often thought I should pay them a visit someday. I never imagined I might end up invading the place with an army though. Not how I imagined it at all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Manuela|How have we come to this? Fighting the archbishop and her knights... I'd never imagined... I hate this. So much. Professor, I tried. I gave treatment to everyone I could, but...but lives were still lost. The infirmary is as much a morgue right now as it is a place of care and healing...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Jeritza|The Knights of Seiros... They certainly know how to inflict pain. However. The demon within me will be satiated only by fighting you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Anna|There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Fleche|My brother fought proudly to the end and died an honorable death. He said something to me before the battle. That he was entrusting his dream to me... I'm gonna see this battle through to the end. I'm gonna fight for my brother!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Between Garreg Mach and Fhirdiad stretch the plains of Tailtean. That's the sight of the ancient battle where Nemesis, the King of Liberation, fought the prophet Seiros. If our forces end up fighting our enemies there... It'll be a clash passed down through the ages!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|Cornelia! I have a report from our scouts. The Imperial army that departed from Garreg Mach en route to the capital now appears to be marching here.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|What did you just say?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|The speed of the army's movement quickens... They will be here to invade within days. I just sent some of my troops to support the capital. It is likely to be a fierce fight...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|How could this be? I have not heard a thing about... Ah... I understand now. I am the target.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|You? Are you sure they do not mean to take Arianrhod for strategic reasons?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|It would appear so from the outside. However, the circumstances are not that simple. And will you calm yourself? It will not be a fierce fight whatsoever. The sweet children I have prepared will protect Arianrhod well...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|Cornelia...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Arianhrod is a fortress city that was built about 400 years ago. Originally a base on the front lines of the battle against the Kingdom, it was built using Imperial money and technology.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|However, the head of House Rowe secretly planned to betray the Empire. As the fortress neared completion, it was rebuilt as a base to defend against the Empire. When the fortress was completed, House Rowe declared its vassalage to the Kingdom.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Since then, Arianrhod has never fallen. Not once. The beautiful white walls that protect it against its enemies have earned it the nickname the Silver Maiden. In the end, that is all it is to the Empire... the Silver Maiden stands as a bitter memory.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Petra|We will now be destroying that memory. The past is the past. Now is now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Caspar|A fortress that has never fallen?! Ooh, I can't wait to make it fall!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ferdinand|How savage of you. And yet, I must say I agree with the sentiment. Let us take the sturdy Arianrhod and continue our march against the Kingdom!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Bernadetta|An invincible fortress? Sounds perfect!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Linhardt|Unfortunately, it will soon no longer be invincible. The Silver Maiden's iron skin is about to be damaged. It's sad, really.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Petra|Is it silver or iron? Use your language with clarity, please.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Dorothea|Really, Lin. There must be a better way to say that. Since we are attacking a heavily guarded place, we must take extra care to prevent allies from getting injured.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Thank you, everyone. I'm counting on all of you. Now, let's resume our advance.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|This battle is for the future of Fódlan...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|How could they deceive me and close in on Arianrhod?! But it's not like I'm just going to just stand by and watch... I will slaughter them all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|So this is the Silver Maiden... Seeing it with my own eyes, I finally understand its strength. Especially the fact that its strength is distributed across its frontal defenses. We'll attack the front and keep our enemy occupied while the others by the east gate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|Titanus, my lovely dolls... Seek out the enemy and destroy them! And if the chance presents itself, I wouldn't mind being rid of those unsightly Kingdom forces too!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Are those Cornelia's magical weapons? Impressive.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|Want to die? Step forward. I'll take you all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|We all chose our paths and I've chosen mine. I fight for my lord, to the death!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Traps awaiting us inside the castle... What a nuisance. But with such large-scale traps, there must be some sort of mechanism to control them.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|The traps are still functional. There must be more of these devices.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|The traps are disabled.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|I will protect Arianrhod to the bitter end. This I have promised to my ancestors, to His Majesty, and to myself!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|You have chosen to assist the Empire, even while knowing of their deeds. I am truly disappointed in you, Professor. Prepare yourself, heel of the Empire! A wretch like you will never be qualified to rule over Fódlan!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|Felix, why?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|Urrgh...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|You've betrayed His Majesty, Glenn, and Lord Rodrigue. You've betrayed just about everyone!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|You couldn't possibly understand. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll have to kill you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|Sylvain. This isn't funny. What are you doing?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Sylvain|I'm sorry, Ingrid. I believe in what the professor is trying to do more than I do in my own country.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|Perhaps my blade will cut away the scales from your eyes!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|Maybe...I've become like him...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|There you are, standing before me, ready for death. I will administer the finishing blow.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|Part of me has been waiting for this since I met you. No need for chitchat. Come at me!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Sylvain|Hey, Felix? Remember when we were kids and we made a promise about dying together?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|I remember.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Sylvain|Well, seems we're about to kill each other.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|Sorry, Sylvain. You'll die first.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|All that talk about chivalry and loyalty, only to turn against your homeland.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ingrid|Maybe I'm not a knight after all. Not in the traditional sense, anyway. I've betrayed lord and family alike. And I've done so because I believe in the professor. I fight for that which I believe in!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|So, you won't step aside. Then I'll have to kill you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|I failed...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|Felix, I'm so sorry... I swear to avenge you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|I am the king's shield, devoted to protecting the Kingdom, as well as the king's lance, who kills his foes! In the name of House Fraldarius...I will defeat you all!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|So, my foolish son... You took it upon yourself to leave your family behind.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|I'm not coming back. I won't serve the boar.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|It's a father's duty to settle his child's failures. Felix... You must die here and now!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Rodrigue|So this is it... Your Majesty... Please bring us victory!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Felix|Father... I will fight in your stead.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Gwendal|Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Gwendal|So this is where I meet my end...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|Oh my, what a charming guest. Let me take care of you...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|Gah! So this is as far as I could get...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Cornelia|Ah... All is in accordance with this carefully crafted script of ours... What a masterpiece! What a delightful dance...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Victory is ours! Arianrhod has fallen! Another army will take control of Arianrhod. As for us, we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. It won't be long before all of Fódlan is unified. Everyone, this is our last push. Our goal is within reach!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|What turn of events has brought you so suddenly to Garreg Mach, Uncle?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lord Arundel|Well, my business in the old Alliance territory had roughly finished. I wanted to see the face of my niece, who so bravely took Arianrhod. I have heard that it was done with truly magnificent tact. And that you even deceived some of your allies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|I'm happy to have earned your praise. However, to say that I deceived my allies is a bit misleading. I despise leaks of information, and there may have been a church rat hiding amongst our ranks.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lord Arundel|Ah, I see. However, there are some unfortunate consequences. Cornelia surely planned to betray them, but...she has been struck down. Truly wasteful meddling. Unless... Was it your intention to kill her?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|It was.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Professor, don't joke about that. The only ones we came to kill were our enemies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|It was not.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|I didn't care either way.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Indeed. We came only to kill our enemies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|She used a terrible magic weapon... Dolls that she could move and fight with. Did you know about them?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lord Arundel|Well now... If that were the case, would it not have been better to keep her as an ally? If you are only capable of such imprudence, this dark cloud might hang over the Empire's future as well.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Thank you for your concern. However, I will sweep aside any darkness that comes our way.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lord Arundel|I will be praying. Praying that the Empire will not become another Arianrhod.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Another Arianrhod? Just what do you mean...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Lord Arundel|Hmph. I must take my leave now. Farewell.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Lady Edelgard, there you are. We just received some truly shocking news. It is said that pillars of light have rained from the heavens and disintegrated Arianrhod.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Disintegrated?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|How is that possible...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|It was likely some type of magic... Perhaps a forbidden art.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Was it Lord Arundel...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Why would he do that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Was Lord Arundel just here? So that would mean...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|Hubert! Give me the full report!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Ah, my apologies. I, of all people, should be able to control my discomposure. The pillars of light descended and exploded, resulting in the complete destruction of the main building and the north wall. It is believed that all key people within House Rowe, including its leader, were killed. Of the Imperial officers and men we kept at Arianrhod, about a third are unaccounted for...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|It can't be true... So...this is my uncle's trump card. In exchange for striking down Cornelia, he has destroyed Arianrhod!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Perhaps we acted too soon in our disposal of Cornelia...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|No. If we'll be fighting them soon, there's no disadvantage to weakening their forces. It's also extremely valuable that we forced them to show their hand. Hubert, the investigation you made into the legend of Ailell, the Valley of Torment... This is likely what took place back then as well.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Yes... The probability is high.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|Valley of Torment?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Byleth|The same thing happened in the past?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Yes, it is quite likely.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|North of Garreg Mach there is a valley where the earth is always aflame. Once, javelins of light fell from the sky there... They pierced the earth and set the forest ablaze, creating a land of torment. We believed it may have been the work of the goddess, but... It was actually an attack by those who slither in the dark. That sums up all that we know.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|By giving us that knowledge, those who died at Arianrhod will not have died in vain.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|Indeed. It would be good to control the flow of this information.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|True. We'll conceal this from everyone as best as we can. I trust you, my teacher.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|I'm sure everyone has heard about what transpired at Arianrhod. The church has displayed their cowardice by indiscriminately using forbidden practices to kill the residents there. Their victims also include members of House Rowe, the Imperial army, and many, many more.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Hubert|According to our investigation, the forbidden attack that destroyed Arianrhod cannot be used again so quickly. Even so, we cannot delay our efforts. We must put a stop to all of this by the end of next month. The leader of one of the Imperial factions has already initiated an attack on the Fraldarius territory lost by Rodrigue... Soon, all obstacles blocking our path to Fhirdiad will have vanished.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Edelgard|A cornered animal is at its most deadly. We must move quickly. Next, we march through the Tailtean Plains. After that, we destroy Fhirdiad. At that time, complete Imperial control over Fódlan will finally be a reality.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Caspar|Ah, I'm shaking with excitement! Bring on the battle!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Dorothea|I understand that a confrontation is inevitable. Still... I wonder if there's some path we could take that would cause less suffering...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Petra|This is the only path for the goal we are reaching for, and so we must keep walking on it. We are walking down the path to a better tomorrow.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Linhardt|A cornered church... Hmm, well, count me out from any forbidden sorcery that can destroy whole cities. If only there was an easier way to get more information on Crests and Relics...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Ferdinand|You are as negative as usual, Linhardt. We have but one order. To emerge victorious!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Bernadetta|We're going to win this! We really are! After all, if we lose, everything will be terrible forever! Oh, no way! We can't let that happen!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|16-LadyOfDeceit|Caspar|There's a lot to worry about, but...I'm sure it will all work out! We'll win no matter what!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Professor, what is your opinion of Claude? I can't help but wonder what sort of impression he made on you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|He's a schemer.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|That is inarguable. And his schemes are still going strong. With them, he's managed to keep the Leicester Alliance from the Empire's grasp.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|He's a jokester.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|That much is obvious. He acts like a fool, but still manages to make the impossible happen. That's as true now as ever. He's managed to protect the Leicester Alliance with his cunning alone.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|He would be a good king.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Interesting... I've never thought of him like that. However, I know you have a keen eye for potential. After all, as leader of the Leicester Alliance, he has managed to protect his entire territory all this time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|How has he done that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Since the beginning, territories within the Alliance have been split between those who support the Empire and those who oppose it. Claude has been acting as an intermediary between the two, essentially keeping the Alliance pacified. As both sides are of equal strength, he's created a situation in which they've all agreed to avoid fighting each other and causing undue bloodshed. By carrying on as though the Alliance is united, he's minimized the Empire's influence there.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|Heh. It's quite impressive how well his bold scheme has worked out. However, he is walking on thin ice. One wrong move and the Alliance will shatter.  Speaking of Claude... Your Majesty, we should not delay in our invasion of the Alliance. It would seem that Claude has some fresh scheme up his sleeve, to no one's surprise.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Is that so?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|Yes. The people of Derdriu have suddenly found it difficult to leave or enter the city. We can safely assume he is preparing for battle, but I am certain his plans extend beyond that as well. Do you not think we should take Derdriu at once?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital... A city floating on the ocean certainly poses a challenge. Since it's deep within Riegan territory, we haven't had the opportunity to attack it directly. However, now that we have control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, our situation has changed drastically. They can no longer expand their supply line into the Empire, and so we can finally attack Riegan territory.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|House Riegan is not only Claude's house, but also the flagship of those who oppose the Empire within the Alliance. If House Riegan falls, the other Alliance lords will be tripping over themselves to join us. That is why we cannot fail to take Derdriu.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Let's go.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|Confidence is one thing, Professor, but see to it that you do not underestimate Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|That seems difficult.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|Fair enough. Claude will certainly be a difficult opponent.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|The leader of the Alliance has had many things said about him... They say he is unbeatable in a battle of intellect. I hear they call him the Master Tactician.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|I wish we could settle all of this before the fighting begins. Don't you? I wish it dearly. But few others feel that way. They fight in a bloody battle, take countless lives, and then finally come to understand defeat. They refuse to admit when they're beaten, and they keep it up until they've been utterly defeated. Of course, I understand that sacrifice is inevitable... But if they're going to surrender after being defeated anyway, why raise a weapon in the first place?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|So, we've somehow managed to take the Great Bridge of Myrddin. That means House Gloucester should now be ready to join the fold more formally. We've blown a major hole in Claude's plans to preserve the Alliance. We should press on to Derdriu before he has the opportunity to adjust his strategy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ferdinand|I have been wondering something... If I had not been your student, where would I be right now? Who would I be? Do you ever think that sort of thing, Professor?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Like what if I had led a different class?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ferdinand|Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to go back and try a different path.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Like what if I had turned against the Empire?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ferdinand|Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to go back and try a different path.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|No, I don't.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ferdinand|I see... You are so focused and coolheaded. I wish I could be more like you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Linhardt|I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. I suppose I've told you that though, yes? I've no idea how you cope with it. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. It's all a great deal of a bother, but I will do my part of course.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Caspar|Didn't they used to call Claude the Master Tactician? I want a nickname too! Maybe I'll get one if I can defeat him at Derdriu... I'll come up with a plan that'll beat his and earn me a nickname for sure!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Bernadetta|Claude... Claude... Which was he again? Oh! Right. Yeah, of course I remember him. It's just... I can't picture his face. Don't remember what he looks like. I'm not sure if I ever knew. Oh well. He's just another enemy now, isn't he? What, am I not supposed to say that?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Dorothea|I'm happy when we win battles, and I'm always relieved when our friends make it back safe. On the other hand, it's hard to watch the enemy die. Even worse when it's someone you know. Perhaps it would have been better if I'd just stayed with the opera...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|I don't think so.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Dorothea|You're right, Professor. I'll never regret the choices I made.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Perhaps...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Dorothea|No, Professor. I refuse to regret my past decisions.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Dorothea|Now you just have to lead us to victory so everyone else can let go of their regrets too.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Petra|Since the past, I have learned much of the language of Fódlan. But speaking the Fódlan language still gives me difficulty. I can understand, read, and white with nearly perfection now. But understanding and speaking are...fruits of a different color.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|That's part of your charm.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Petra|I have gratitude for you, Professor. I hope that I will have fluency one day.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Everyone has a weak spot.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Petra|Yes. I will keep practicing more.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Felix|I hear Claude's earned himself a rather colorful nickname. He does whatever it takes to win. I like that. It will be especially satisfying to defeat him. I can't wait to see what his next move is.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ashe|Food has gotten scarce since the war started. Lately the prices have really been going up. Normally that would mean reducing our own take, but we just can't afford to do that. If we lose this war, we lose everything. Still, the townspeople are the ones who will suffer from this the most. The longer this goes on, the more people will starve.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Sylvain|Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital... I've heard it's a magnificent city, you know. If we're going, I wish it wasn't to wage war. It'd be more fun to visit with a cute girl on my arm.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Maybe once the war is over...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Sylvain| You're right. That's something to look forward to.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Sylvain| Yeah? Maybe you and me? That'd be a good reason to survive the war. Heh heh...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Forget it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Sylvain|Aw, come on. Let a guy dream.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Mercedes|Flowers are so resilient, aren't they? Despite the war going on outside the monastery, here they are, blooming beautifully. I hope we get to see more kinds of flowers when the weather warms up...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Annette|Derdriu, huh? I've always wanted to go there. In Faerghus, most of the towns are pretty much glorified fortresses. So to hear about a place called the Aquatic capital...it just sounds so elegant! Let's go for a leisurely visit someday, promise? You know...after the war is over.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ingrid|Judith of Daphnel. You were a force to be reckoned with. You will not be forgotten. In another life, I might have fought by her side.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|What's done is done.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ingrid|As harsh as that is, it's the truth of it. It's over now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|I understand the sentiment.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ingrid|It's a harsh truth, but it's the truth nonetheless. We can't change the past.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lorenz|Now that we've seized the Great Bridge of Myrddin, House Gloucester is comfortable aligning itself with the Empire. The path to Riegan lands lies straight before us. Our clash with Claude draws nearer by the moment.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Having second thoughts?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lorenz|Not at all. On the contrary, I look forward to it. My old rival will be a worthy test for me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Will he put up a hard fight?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lorenz|I certainly hope so. I would be quite disappointed if my greatest rival were to simply roll over.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lorenz|I know Claude better than anyone. He is a schemer. No doubt he has some trap for us in mind. Let us be vigilant, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Raphael|We're gonna go up against Claude next? I haven't seen him in forever. Wonder how he's been... I chose this side because I believe in you, Professor. But it's not like I got anything against Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|What was he like?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Raphael|Hmm... Well, he loved parties, and he was full of some pretty good jokes!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Were you close?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Raphael|Of course! Claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Raphael|I don't mind so much that we gotta fight him, I just hope he doesn't get killed...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ignatz|I thought I was ready for this, but it's not easy to fight against my old schoolmates... I was in the Golden Deer House, so I have a lot of memories with them.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Are you feeling conflicted?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ignatz|No, I'm not. I decided to fight alongside you, and I will not waver.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|It's hard for me too.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ignatz|Really, it is? I wish that we could resolve this without violence.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ignatz|Then again, precisely because they're old friends, I wouldn't leave this to someone else. I have to assume responsibility.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|Without the support of the pro-Imperialist lords, the Alliance is greatly weakened. Even so, I don't feel great about all this. We're gonna be fighting Claude...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|We must not let our guard down.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|We can't--you're right. Claude has such unusual strategies for toying with his enemies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|We can definitely win.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|Even so, we should stay alert. Claude won't be caught off guard. Neither should we.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|Even with you here, this battle will be very challenging.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Marianne|The tide of war is clearly favoring us, but Claude refuses to surrender. I wonder why that could be...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|It's against his principles.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Marianne|Frankly, it seems to me that his ideals are not that far removed from Edelgard's...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|The way he sees it, we can't both exist.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Marianne|I think you're probably right...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Marianne|I suppose even the very powerful can be irrational at times...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Leonie|I'm from Alliance lands, but I'm only a commoner. The idea of fighting Alliance nobles isn't exactly losing me any sleep. Fighting old friends though? That's something else. Ugh. I'd better clear my head. Captain Jeralt used to say a mercenary has to be thoughtless. Guess I finally get what he meant.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Alois|Do you ever regret taking the path you did?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Yes.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Alois|Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|No.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Alois|Hah, the very model of a leader! I should take a page out of your book.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|All the time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Alois|Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Alois|Whatever path you choose going forward, I'll follow you without question.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Shamir|Claude, eh? He always was sharp among his peers. Never let himself get caught up in conventions. He wasn't typical in Fódlan. Then there's Rhea and King Dimitri... I'd stay on their good sides, for different reasons.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|You don't have a choice.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|I have no desire to kill them, but...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Shamir|Yeah, well... If that's the only way forward, it can't be helped.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hanneman|Professor, I think you should be made aware of a certain group working with the Imperial army. They are the same lot that invented a technique to turn monsters into war assets. It's quite obvious their trick draws on the power of the Crest Stones, but... There is something more to it than that. Some secret I have yet to decipher. I suppose I need to better understand what kind of people they are. Who are they? What do they want? For her part, Miss Edelgard is cooperating, yet does not hide her hostility towards them. I suspect we should prepare in case the day should come when we must combat these strange people.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Manuela|Remember the Death Knight who stabbed me five years ago? Of course you do. How could you forget? Well, it turns out he's a general in the Imperial army! He leads the western front against the Kingdom. Once I knew he was at Garreg Mach, I stormed right up to him, told him who I was, and what he did... And he offered me an apology. I'm talking about a sincere, heartfelt, solemn apology. What a letdown. What's going on with that guy, anyway? Who is he under that mask?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Manuela|Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for...someone to talk to?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Yes.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Manuela|I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|No.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Manuela|Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Manuela|Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Jeritza|What is it?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|I just want to chat a bit.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Jeritza|I have no words for you. I have blades, and if you wish to cross them, I'll be more than happy to. Although you may not be.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Nothing.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Randolph|Lately, the Kingdom and the Knights of Seiros haven't made any significant moves. I don't suppose they're going to stand by and watch while we attack Derdriu though. That's why I've doubled our guard and instructed them to be extra vigilant. I will keep Garreg Mach safe! It is my duty and responsibility.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Fleche|Big brother always gets me so fired up... Better keep an eye on him. Oh, sorry! I was just talking to myself. I hear you're heading out to Derdriu. Good luck with the battle!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ladislava|Five years ago, during the attack on this place, you allowed me to join your side. Since then I've risen through the ranks, and now I'm a general leading my own army. In this invasion of the Alliance, I've been entrusted with maintaining the supply lines and keeping the Goneril territories under control. That's why I won't be accompanying to Derdriu. Please look after Lady Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Derdriu is known as the Aquatic capital... It's a beautiful town with streets that seem to float on the water and an impressive harbor. In times of peace, it would be a wonderful place for a holiday... Anyway! Best of luck in the next battle!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|It's almost time to depart. Are you ready?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Leave it to me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|A promising answer. Whatever happens, never allow your foe to see any weakness.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|I don't think we can win.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|I agree that Claude will prove a difficult foe. Still, do not speak such words right before a battle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|We must pay attention not only to Claude's schemes but to the man himself. He's a master archer who wields the legendary bow Failnaught. He won't fall easily.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Failnaught...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|It's the Relic of House Riegan. That bow once belonged to one of the 10 Elites. Professor... Do you know the true story behind the legend? The Relics were created by the hands of mankind. Seiros collected them after killing the 10 Elites. Seiros manipulated the people of the world and defeated the all-powerful King Nemesis.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|I thought he was corrupted by his power?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|That's the history the Church of Seiros maintains. However, it was little more than a simple dispute.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Why would she do that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|The church maintains the false history that he was corrupted and turned evil. However, it was little more than a simple dispute.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Should the one leading the people of the world be someone with humanity or a creature that can merely masquerade as a human at will? In the end, Seiros was victorious. The Immaculate One and her family then took control of Fódlan. I know this because that knowledge is passed down from emperor to emperor. And that is the because the first emperor is the human who cooperated with Seiros, allowing humanity to be controlled in secret.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Perhaps it's fate that you can wield the Sword of the Creator, just like Nemesis, the King of Liberation. And that very fate will lead you to use that sword to stand against those who would distort history.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|It seems they've set out from Garreg Mach... That's sooner than expected. Losing the Great Bridge of Myrddin was a serious blow. So is the fact that Teach is still alive. On top of all that...Judith. I told her to run if things looked grim. Damn it. So many people will die, and by my call.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|And what of it? Would you rather turn tail and run back home?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Nader... You're really getting on my nerves. Do you have any idea how much of the Alliance adores me and believes in me?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|Well, I suppose it's quite a lot. Does that mean that...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Yes. The plan is a go. I'm counting on you, Nader. We'll make a good show taking down those who would assault Derdriu.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|People say our kind may not always win, but we never lose. Let's teach them the real meaning of those words.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Now then... Let's see what you're made of, Teach...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Here she comes, at long last... I've done all I can to prepare. Let the cards fall where they may. It'll be a true test of strength.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|It seems Claude has blockaded the city and occupied the naval port.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|Heh. If that is the case, he will have no choice but to engage us from there.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Yes. Though putting myself in Claude's place leaves me with an unpleasant feeling... If we take over the port and close the entry to the city, Derdriu will be under our control. Each soldier should bear that in mind as they advance.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|There are three gates which connect Derdriu to its naval port. Taking the city will be easy once we secure all three.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Now it's our turn, Almyra's elite! Strike the flanks of the Imperial army!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Those fangs and claws the Alliance fears so much will now be their salvation!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|Leave it to us, kiddo! My undefeated streak will live on. Another chapter in my heroic saga!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|That flag and banner... Is that the Almyran army? Ugh, you really did it, Claude!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|This is no ruse. That is Nader, an Almyran general.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Take care of them quickly! Especially those Almyran wyverns!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|The Almyran reinforcements keep coming. We should try to eliminate Nader...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Villager|We don't have the guts to resist anymore! Here...you can have this! Just please don't attack the city!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|I never planned to touch the city. Our target is the Alliance and their leader, Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hilda|You didn't forget about me, did you? Maybe you should just let me go.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hilda|Professor! It's been too long. But now we're on opposite sides, huh? What a shame. I'm not going to hold back. I can't let down my dear old Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Marianne|I-I'm so sorry, Hilda. I...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hilda|It's OK, Marianne. These things happen in war.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hilda|It's been fun, Claude... Sorry to go so soon...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Hilda! Why didn't you retreat?! I counted on you retreating...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|Don't expect me to go easy on you. Because I won't.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|You are here as well, Professor? That is a shame...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Lysithea. How unfortunate that a talented woman like you should throw her life away on a pointless battle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|Ha, do not underestimate me. The fight is far from over, Edelgard!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|That's the last of my energy. If you're gonna kill me, make it quick. Fair warning though, I'll likely come back to haunt you. It's not like I've had an easy time of it, after all...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|You...want me to join you? The Alliance is over no matter what. The only thing left is to place faith in you and Edelgard. There's still so much I have to accomplish. Thank you for the second chance, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Lysithea|Father, Mother... I'm sorry I didn't listen to you...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|It's been 30-odd years since I set foot on a field of battle. Here's a taste of my undefeated strength!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|The emperor continues fighting at the front line. Is the Empire short on troops?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Unfortunately, I can't deny it. But then, I've heard the Almyran king does the very same. You have traveled far. I do hope it's for a king who would not only lead his army but fight at their side.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|Touché... Yes, he is that sort of king!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Nader|Sorry, kiddo. It seems we'll have to withdraw...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|You've done enough, Nader. Just stay alive. We'll meet again one day!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|We have forced the Almyran forces to flee. I doubt they're expecting more reinforcements.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Heh... So sad that our reunion should take place on the battlefield.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Teach... You should have chosen me instead of Edelgard. No point in whining about it now, I suppose. Sorry, but I'll be taking the win today.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|We haven't seen each other since Garreg Mach. You've grown lovelier than ever, Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|You're not so unfortunate yourself. And as usual, you're here at a most inopportune moment.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Well, I'm sure we have much more to talk about... But how about we settle things first?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|No objections here. Prepare yourself, Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up as an Imperial general...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Enough! You've bested me. If I die here, the Alliance becomes part of the Empire.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Do you yield, then? You've never known when to give up.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Well, I can't just surrender so easily. I'm responsible for the others. If you're as smart as you seem, I bet you've figured out why I was able to summon Almyran reinforcements. Wouldn't it be better to let me go and have me in your debt?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Thank you, Professor. And you, Edelgard. I'm truly grateful for your courageous decision. I will return your kindness one day... I promise.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|I see. Right until the very end, I've read this whole thing terribly wrong... All my hopes have fallen to ash... It's all up to you now, Edelgard... I really hope you do make the world...better...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Everybody! Raise your voices in a victory cheer! Derdriu is ours!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Hey, Teach.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Claude?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Settle down, will you? You're the victor, after all. I could have escaped, but I decided to say hi to Teach. Nothing to worry about. Derdriu has fallen and the Alliance has collapsed. There's nothing I could do to turn things around at this point.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|You want me to drop my guard around someone who evaded detection by my soldiers? Impossible. Did you really risk coming here just to say hello?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|I did. But mostly, I wanted to say good-bye. I'm leaving Fódlan.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Why are you leaving?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Lend us your strength.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Lend you my... I knew I liked you, Teach!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|I daresay Fódlan would be a lot more peaceful without me around. Right, Your Majesty?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|It's as you say. So long as you remain here, the faction of the Alliance that is against the Empire will continue to support you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Too true. It's best if I leave this place altogether. I'll just have to find some other way to pay back my debt to you. All I ask is that you go easy on the Alliance. After all, no one there would dare defy you. And please, treat my former classmates well. I've asked them to cooperate with you if I lost.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Wait... Did your scheming include a plan for if the Alliance lost?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Heh, you think too highly of me. It just seems that way now. Outside of Derdriu, most of the Alliance is unscathed and ready to join your superior strength. In all honesty, I was hoping to become a supreme ruler and lead Fódlan to peace myself. But...that won't be happening now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Claude...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Claude|Good luck to you, Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|We crushed him in battle and yet... He really is difficult to understand.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Derdriu is ours. The Alliance has collapsed, and their leader has fallen.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|Did we really have to kill him?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|If Claude had lived, the faction of the Alliance that is against the Empire would have never stopped fighting us. To keep the bloodshed to a minimum, he had to be taken out of the equation. However, now that it's over, I can't help but wonder if he was in complete control of that entire situation. What will become of the Alliance without him... He must have taken that into account. Without the rule of House Riegan, and with most of the territory left unscathed, the Alliance will undoubtedly ally itself with the Empire. The citizen's lives will be saved from ruin, and no more blood will be shed. Perhaps that's what he wanted from the start...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Byleth|That sounds like Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Of course, if his plan here in Derdriu had worked and I had lost my life...the opposite would have come to pass. The Empire would have rushed to the Alliance without further conflict. No matter how the battle unfolded, Claude secured the shortest, most peaceful possible outcome.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|Lady Edelgard, Derdriu is now completely under our control. As planned, the Alliance's affairs will now be overseen by Count Bergliez.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Caspar|My father is coming here? First west, than east... You sure keep him busy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|Should the others return to the monastery and prepare to face the Kingdom?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Edelgard|Yes. Thank you, Hubert. Thanks to all of your efforts, our battle with the Alliance has reached its conclusion. However, we still can't afford to be careless. We must now join the battle against the Kingdom. With the strength of the church on their side, they will prove to be a formidable enemy. More than ever, your support is invaluable. We'll need it in the days to come. But for now, let's enjoy our triumphant return!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Caspar|Let's get to it!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Dorothea|I'm so happy that the end of the fighting is near. Too bad there's still more violence to come...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Petra|The Kingdom and the Church of Seiros are worthy for fighting. I will crush them into very small pieces!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Linhardt|Crushing wouldn't yield a lot of pieces, but I guess it would get the job done. With the Professor we can't lose...probably.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Bernadetta|Oh no, are we fighting Lady Rhea? But she's scary! And she'll be really angry! But no way she can stay in her spooky beast form all the time...right?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Dorothea|If she could, she would have come and attacked the monastery as many times as she wanted.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Ferdinand|It may be wishful thinking, but perhaps it is a power that she can only access when the situation is dire. But whether she is the archbishop or the Immaculate One, we cannot be stopped! Half remains, but half is finished... We are certainly moving forward.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|14-TheMasterTactician|Hubert|No one can stop us from pushing forward. No one.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|...And that concludes Count Bergliez's report.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Just as Claude said, the old Alliance has willingly fallen under Imperial rule. However, knowing him, there is no telling what manner of poison could be waiting within.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Just as Your Majesty predicted, the old Alliance has willingly fallen under Imperial rule. However, even with Claude dead, there is no telling what manner of poison he left in his wake.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|We must be careful not to expose any weakness.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Of course. Though it seems we can now attack the Kingdom without issue.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|True. However, you should know that Lord Arundel has entered Derdriu. It would seem he has already started collecting the Relics of the old Alliance...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Let him do as he pleases for now. It's not yet the time to chide him.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Understood. As for the Kingdom... As we theorized, it is not entirely united. If we defeat the royal family of House Blaiddyd and a handful of other notable houses, it should fall under our control quite readily. Those we must target include the houses Fraldarius, Galatea, Gautier, and Charon.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|We have allies who are close to some of those lords. Perhaps that can be used to our advantage. Persuasion by tears or threats...Perhaps one would consent to act as an hostage? We must make good use of the tools given to us.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|What about House Rowe in Arianrhod, the Fortress City? Will they not side with us?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|The head of House Fraldarius, Lord Rodrigue, has entered the city. It is possible that he has seized it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|I see. Then it might prove too difficult to strike Fhirdiad right away.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Either way, when preparations are complete, we can begin our deployment into the Kingdom.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|That part of the plan remains unchanged. Professor? Is something wrong?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|No, it's nothing.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Many of those names are new to me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Yes, I don't imagine you have much interest in a running list of noble names. But it matters not. The nobility and the weight of it all those names will be gone once the war is over.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|This month, we must put all of our effort into preparing for battle. I'm counting on you, my teacher.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Aaah!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Professor! You didn't hear anything just now, did you?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Are you OK?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Of course I am! It's nothing...nothing at all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|That was a cute shriek.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Cute?! Huh! Well, be that as it may, it is not your concern. It was nothing.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Are you sure about that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|I told you it was nothing and I meant it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Really, very cute...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|You seem to be trying your hardest to infuriate me. Don't you dare say that again!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Cute?! Huh! Well, be that as it may, it is not your concern. It was nothing.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|It's just... Well, there was a rat. I don't enjoy the company of rats. I believe I've told you about this before...about when I was held captive beneath the palace. There were a lot of rats there. To this day, I just...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|What's that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|What?! Oh! Professor! Leave here at once! I recall now that Hubert needs to speak with me. I must change my clothes. Now. Whatever you do, don't look this way.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|I already saw it...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Aah! Then forget what you saw! That's an order!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|If the Alliance falls, then the Kingdom will... There's no time to waste. If we hesitate, we risk losing the initiative. I do think we should let the troops rest, though... We must maintain morale, Professor. And let's make sure this matter stays between us. If it gets out, I'll struggle to forgive even you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|What matter?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Hmm... It seems you don't comprehend the consequences of angering the emperor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Understood.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Thank you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Claude von Riegan. What an interesting character. Underneath that compassionate exterior, he was always cold and calculating. Ordinary fools run headlong into combat, without even considering the possibility of defeat. But to consider one's chances, and to prepare for plans to go awry--that takes real intelligence. I have to say, I am impressed beyond words.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ferdinand|The majority is with us. This conflict will end soon. I am so moved by the Alliance nobles' decision. That is true nobility! Acting in accordance with the people's needs and wishes. As war drags on, those living near the front lines inevitably get the worst of it. We will not see such a peaceful resolution in Faerghus, I am afraid, as it is ruled by the royal family, not a council of nobles.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Linhardt|I've been exploring the Holy Mausoleum. It's quite interesting in there. There is a mechanism I believe would allow us passage into the Holy Tomb, but I'm unclear on how to activate it. My research hasn't turned up much. It may come down to asking the archbishop for details.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Your research will find something.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|That's a puzzler.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Linhardt|Indeed. We'll see if it's worth the trouble.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Caspar|Did you meet my father in Derdriu? I guess he'll be responsible for controlling the Riegan territory and maintaining popular support. Not really sure what all that means though...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|You should study more.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Caspar|You're probably right. I'll do my best!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|It doesn't matter.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Caspar|Are you sure? I figured you'd say something about me having to study more. Oh, I get it. This is a test! I'm definitely gonna have to brush up.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Bernadetta|War isn't kind to you if you're a recluse. By the time you realize what's going on, you're already under attack. And if you're off by yourself, you can get killed with no one ever even finding out.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Sounds like you're learning.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Isn't that a little pessimistic?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Bernadetta|Got me out of my room, at least! That's good, right?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Dorothea|The Leicester Alliance is no more. Three hundred years of history...gone and done. They write operas about events like this, you know. I'm sure they'll have a talent and beautiful songstress playing you. Probably for Edie as well. I wonder if there'll be romantic tension between your two characters, even if it's not historically accurate?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Dorothea|The Leicester Alliance is no more. Three hundred years of history...gone and done. They write operas about events like this, you know. I'm sure you'll be played by the most handsome actor of the time. Hearts will pound as he takes the stage. A diva will play Edie! You'll fall madly in love, even if it isn't historically accurate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Petra|The Kingdom always is cold. I have hatred for the cold. Brigid is not cold. We have no Cold Spirit. Does the goddess of Fódlan give protection from the cold? I am wishing I knew how to ask her...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Felix|Hmph. My father is holding Arianrhod secure. Our next battle will be there, against him, or in Fhirdiad, which the king is protecting.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Can you fight them?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Felix|Ha! Don't underestimate me. I've been preparing for this for a long time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|I'm counting on you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Felix|Hah. You just worry about yourself.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ashe|Derdriu's fallen. The Alliance nobles have surrendered to the Empire. We made it through with as few losses as possible. Not bad, all things considered... But I doubt it'll be so easy to deal with Faerghus.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Sylvain|First Leicester and next Faerghus? Ah, that'll be really tough. Look, Professor... Fighting Faerghus? Isn't there some way we can come to an understanding?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Maybe there is.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Sylvain|Yeah, but Edelgard and her idiot sidekick haven't shown much desire to compromise, have they?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|No.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Sylvain|Harsh...but true. I don't see how we can avoid what's coming.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Sylvain|Truthfully, I hate the idea of planning to kill people I used to be so close with. I guess everybody feels that way though.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Mercedes|Oh, Claude. I'm so relieved that he managed to make it out alive. You'll be fighting the Kingdom next, right? Then the church? Isn't there some way we can do this without fighting Dimitri and Lady Rhea? I suppose not...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Mercedes|Oh, Claude. It's too late now, but it's such a shame... You'll be fighting the Kingdom next, right? Then the church? I guess Edelgard won't hesitate to cut Dimitri and Lady Rhea down...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Annette|We may be witnessing a key moment in history. Hundreds of years from now, your name and Edelgard's will be written in the history books, Professor!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Perhaps.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|That's a little embarrassing.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Annette|What, how? I think it's just amazing!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Annette|I wonder who will decide whether we did the right thing or not... Well, it won't be us, anyway. Probably the people of a future era.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ingrid|While the battle with the Alliance is over, we still need to stay vigilant. Both the church and the Kingdom are not to be taken lightly. I have the feeling we'll draw their attention soon. Weapon prep and training are of the utmost importance now more than ever.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Lorenz|It seems all that praise of Claude's ingenuity was largely unfounded. A truly clever man would have realized defeat was inevitable and surrendered. Or, failing that, he could have rallied the Alliance nobles to secure a real fighting chance.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Raphael|I'm no noble, so it won't make much difference to me... But it hasn't really hit me yet that the Alliance is finished.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ignatz|To think, I saw the end of the Leicester Alliance with my own eyes. I witnessed a turning point in the history of my homeland. I'm not sure how to express my feelings right now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Why not write about it?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ignatz|No, I don't have a gift for words. But perhaps I'll tell my children someday, if I have any.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Why not paint a picture?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ignatz|That's right, I'll paint it! The Fall of Derdriu.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ignatz|So that posterity can remember our triumph.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Lysithea|The battle ended without House Ordelia getting involved. Although...I've no desire to continue on with my family, so from here on out, it's up to Edelgard. I have Claude to thank. Ultimately, this ended without the Alliance being entirely consumed by war. It's all thanks to Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Lysithea|I have Claude to thank. Before the battle, he considered my precarious position and told me it wouldn't matter if we fell to the Empire. So when you invited me, I accepted without hesitation. Ultimately, this ended without the Alliance being entirely consumed by war. It's all thanks to Claude.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Marianne|I wonder... Was there really no way to end it without fighting Claude?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|It couldn't be helped.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Marianne|You're probably right...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|It's better this way.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Marianne|I hope you're right...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Marianne|I suppose the only thing I can do for him now is pray...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Marianne|That he may live the rest of his life in happiness.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Marianne|That he may rest in peace.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Leonie|The worst part about going to battle is knowing you might have a friend fighting for the other side. You were a mercenary, Professor. Were you always prepared for that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Absolutely.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Leonie|Guess I need to learn. Won't make a very good mercenary otherwise, will I?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|I still hesitate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Leonie|That's reassuring. I don't think I'll ever get used to it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Leonie|Fighting old friends--there's nothing worse. My hands shake just thinking about it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Leonie|I'm glad Claude didn't die. Does that make me soft?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Leonie|I didn't want Claude to die. Does that make me soft?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|I've lived at Garreg Mach Monastery for a few decades now. Still, the other day I got myself all turned around! There are so many secret rooms and hidden passages. Maybe I'll take the time to properly search the place. Care to join me? I expect it'd take a whole day.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|You're too soft. I'm talking about Claude. Our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way... But perhaps she is more tolerant of those who know their place.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|Our emperor mercilessly cuts down all those who stand in her way... Even the Master Tactician.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hanneman|It seems Claude has disappeared...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hanneman|Claude...lost in battle. My goodness.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hanneman|Do you suppose this means the end of House Riegan? While the Crest of von Riegan is not terribly rare... The long linage of the von Riegan family will be broken.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth| It's just another consequence of war.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth| We should mourn his death.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hanneman|Agreed. The poor boy...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Does this pose an obstacle to your research?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hanneman|No... At the very least, I think not. There are other, lesser Crests to research. Yet I am a human first and a scholar second. For now, I grieve the fallen and pray for those still living.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Manuela|You know as well as I do, the day's coming that we'll have to fight the archbishop and her knights. We've got some strong fighters here, sure. But even with all our training, I don't know if we can win. I just don't see how any of us can compete with the archbishop, say, turning into a monster.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|If we must fight, we will.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Manuela|Yeah? What if that fight's to the death--yours and mine in particular?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Byleth|Sometimes it can be better to retreat.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Manuela|That's exactly what I was saying. I've always appreciated how you listen to me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Jeritza|Neither the emperor nor the Empire have my allegiance. It is all simply part of the agreement. There is no other reason for me to be here.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Anna|The Alliance is just...gone. It's hard to believe. The merchants of Derdriu all have nerves of steel. I'm sure they'll be up and running again in no time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Randolph|Finally, the Kingdom... After that, we'll battle the church. I volunteered for monastery guard duty. It was more for my family than anything. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I want to see Her Majesty ruling this land. Even if it costs me my life, I will protect Garreg Mach!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Fleche|I just wanted to help out my brother, Randolph, so I aspired to be a soldier. My brother puts his life on the line to fight, so I'll put everything I have into it too. Eventually the enemy will attack, and when they do, we'll defend this place to the bitter end!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ladislava|Your next opponents will be the Kingdom's army and the Knights of Seiros. Both fearsome foes. Put the mobility of my troops to good use, and let us protect the Kngdom's western battle front. When this month has ended, I'll depart. I pray that you have good luck in battle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You may already know this, but the Kingdom and the Alliance were once a single entity. The leaders of the Alliance, House Riegan, are actually a branch of the Blaiddyd royal family. In a way, it's just a battle of the part of Blaiddyd family tree that rose in rebellion against the Empire...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Imperial Soldier|Raid from the north! Their flag bears the symbol of the Knights of Seiros! One of our troops has already intercepted them! Your Majesty, please give us your orders!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|From the north? Interesting... Could it be they journeyed through Ailell, the Valley of Torment? Is the archbishop among the enemy ranks? If so, focus our attacks on her first.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Imperial Soldier|Understood!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Our enemy knows Garreg Mach from inside and out. They can come and go as they please. It would have been best if we had detected them sooner, but that can't be helped. Professor. We must hurry and intercept them ourselves. I'll leave the preparations to you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Heh. The battle looks to be rather cumbersome. We are still guarding all of Garreg Mach, but there are undoubtedly numerous secret passages and magic traps... There is still much about this place that we do not know. It is quite possible that they will attack from a location we cannot anticipate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|I must head out first to give my orders. I'll meet up with you soon. Call for General Randolph and General Ladislava! Hurry!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|It feels like only yesterday we called this place our home... We must show these fools the error of their ways. They shall pay for the sin of invading Garreg Mach...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|Oh, but the professor is fighting alongside our foe! The same one who saved my life...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|That is true... Though I find forgiveness difficult, we do owe that wayward soul a debt. However, the fact remains that because of the professor, Rhea has long been tormented. To think that the vessel of the goddess, entrusted with the Sword of the Creator, could go on to... Ah, it angers me to even think of it! All that has happened has changed Rhea. I imagine it has changed the professor as well. Even if we prevail, I doubt the church can ever fully return to the way it once was...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|Umm... Brother?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|Dear Flayn. I only brought you with me because you were so insistent. Still, no matter what happens, you must not go near the front lines. If something were to happen to you, it would utterly destroy me. You are my reason for breathing. Do you understand?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|I...I understand. If something were to happen to you, it would break my heart. I could not go on either. I cannot help but wonder...if there is a way to end this without fighting the professor...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|Our surprise attack on Garreg Mach was a success. Now we just need to break through past this point.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Knight Of Seiros|We were successful sneaking up on Garreg Mach. All that's left is to break through past this point.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|Lady Rhea and Catherine are holding back most of the Empire's army. Thereby leaving us, the expeditionary force, free to recapture the monastery!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Knight Of Seiros|The archbishop and Catherine are handling the bulk of the Imperial army. That gives us the chance to infiltrate the monastery!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Our enemies have followed us even here. How unfortunate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Your Majesty, the enemy's movement is suspicious. They may have some tactic in mind.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|If so, then let's face them without delay. Form defensive lines and hold them to the death! Strike down all who approach!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Their troop composition is also strange. I would bet that they are concealing additional soldiers.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|The enemy is transporting large quantities of flammable material into the woods. They clearly intend to attack us with fire. We should do all we can to prevent it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Troops waiting in the woods to ambush? We must avoid any suspicious areas as we advance.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|Now!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Come at me, so that I may put you out of your misery! (Flayn and several Church Soldiers appear on the right side of the map.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|The time is now! As long as we stand here, you shall not pass!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|Now! Light it up! Like the goddess's fiery wrath, these flames will engulf our enemies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Knight Of Seiros|Start the fire!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|Great. A path has opened for us.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Knight Of Seiros|All right, a second route is open! Well done on this one too!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|If they break through here, the monastery will be — ...If that happens, all will be lost.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|How much of this can you take? It doesn't matter. We will be reclaiming Garreg Mach.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|I knew it... Shouldn't have let emotion get in the way...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|Shamir, no! I will avenge you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|You fiend, bearing ill will against the goddess. This place will be your grave!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|Jeralt, I did it... I protected the monastery...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|Alois! How dare you die before me!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Our enemy's plans is in ruins. Still, we must tread carefully.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|You still align yourself with the emperor? What a shame. Let's make this quick. I don't want the loser to suffer.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|Why, if it isn't Shamir! You're still with the knights. What a surprise.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|You're the surprise, Alois. I never thought I'd see the day you'd choose anyone over Rhea. Don't worry, I won't hold back. I owe an old ally the courtesy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|I won't either. I hope you're ready.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|I cannot bring myself to kill you... You're a princess of Brigid. A hostage of the Empire.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Petra|That was the truth in the past, but it is a different truth now, Shamir... I am...the will of the emperor!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|In that case, I won't hold back.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|I can't believe you would try to kill lady Rhea. Jeralt must be turning in his grave. I can't protect you like I promised. I have to kill you and bury you with my own hands.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|So, you're the leader of the Knights of Seiros now? Good for you, Alois.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|Indeed. You seem to be doing well for yourself too. The other knights are always cursing you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Shamir|Don't worry, I won't hold back. I owe an old ally the courtesy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Alois|I won't either. I hope you're ready.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|This makes me terribly sad, but this is my duty, to which I must be true!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|Farewell, Professor. I do not imagine we shall ever meet again.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|Father, please forgive me... I am returning to Mother now...before you do...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|Flayn! Please, no! No!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|When I heard you were alive, Professor, I was so happy. But now... Now this? How can it be that you fight on that side? I cannot take your life, for I owe you mine, even now. And yet I cannot back away from this fight. When this is over, my brother and I will go into hiding. It is the only way.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|Trespassing on holy ground is a grave sin indeed. You must atone for it with your life!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|I'm sorry, Rhea... For Flayn's sake, I must take my leave to retreat...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|I'm sorry, Flayn... I couldn't protect you...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Flayn|Father! Father, why?! Why?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|It saddens me to face you on the field of battle, after all you've done for Flayn. I cannot approve of your actions. But I also cannot follow Rhea on her current course. It may not change anything, but allow me to make a promise to you. If Flayn and I survive this battle, we will withdraw from the world and leave you to do as you please.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|We fought them off. Good work, everyone. We've repelled the principle force of the knights and defended Garreg Mach! Hubert, I require a damage report at once.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Yes, Your Majesty. We will have to make inquiries about the status of the main army.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Indeed. After all, it seems they had Rhea and Catherine fighting on their side.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Catherine|Lady Rhea. The unit that invaded the monastery has been completely driven away. We were able to make a clean sweep of those who came to attack us. However, I fear we can do nothing but retreat for now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Rhea|What of Seteth and Flayn?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Catherine|Seteth and Flayn were able to escape in another direction. I have a message from them.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Seteth|I am sorry, Rhea. I fear we must return to a life in hiding. I detest that person with all my heart. However, Flayn's life is more important to me than all else. I pray that you will one day be free from the burden of your work...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Rhea|I see. As expected, I am the only one left. Mother, please wait for me. I promise that I will save you...The filthy thief who stole you from the Holy Tomb...I will crush them with my bare hands!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Catherine|Lady Rhea! I am afraid I must report...we lost Seteth and Flayn. We were able to make a clean sweep of those who came to attack us. The unit that invaded the monastery has been completely driven away...a bitter disappointment. I fear we can do nothing but retreat for you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Rhea|Seteth... Flayn... First my mother, and now those two have been stolen away as well? Must you take everything from me?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Catherine|Lady Rhea...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Rhea|No amount of repentance will bring your wretched soul salvation. You will be chained to the Valley of Torment...eternally walk the desert until the skin rots from your bones... I will ensure that you pay for your sins, Professor! In the name of the Nabateans, I swear it!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Randolph|Edelgard... Your Majesty... I am so sorry...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Silence. We must tend to your wounds.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Randolph|It will do no good. I can't be saved... You must know that. Ladislava has also passed... The enemy has withdrawn... You are safe now...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Understood. Good work. Another loss on my watch... As more blood wets my feet, they grow heavier with each step. Remorse, resentment, despair... I have dispensed with all such things to come this far.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|And we must keep moving forward...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Hubert. Tell me the status of the enemy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|The battle has ended in a draw with severe injuries on both sides. Some known commanders have been slain.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|The most worthy of mention among the dead was the second in command to Rhea herself, Seteth.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|With the death of Alois, the Knights of Seiros have taken a huge blow as well.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Garreg Mach has not taken much damage, and so it would not be out of line to claim it as a victory for us.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Yes... We'll call that a victory. Although, I'm sure they will say the same.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Yes, Your Majesty.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Bernadetta|Ugh, what a terrible opponent that was! Why is the church always like this?! How am I supposed to train for that?! It was way too scary!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Linhardt|When I saw the enemy enter Garreg Mach, I prepared myself mentally for death. I thought it would be a fine time to die, but I suppose it wasn't quite the time after all...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Petra|Our luck was good to have grabbed victory. The church has great strength. We must not have grief, but must keep fighting. Can we be fighting now?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Ferdinand|This was certainly a momentous victory. We lost a lot, but we also gained a lot. Certain lords in the Kingdom have examined the situation again and decided to join our cause. Changing their fealty based on just one battle... They are all a disgrace to the nobility!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Dorothea|Today, our enemy held many faces I knew well... If we must fight to the death with that kind of opponent, what will become of this world?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Caspar|There's no stopping me! I'm ready go strike the Kingdom here and now! Everyone must see that we can easily unite Fódlan! Don't you think?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Excellent job, everyone. The battle is over now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|Professor, the battle is over now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|While we have sustained heavy losses, our foe has suffered far more.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Hubert|Although not exactly as planned, a win is a win. It may be safe to say that there will be no more obstacles on our way to the next battle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|15-TempestOfSwordsAndShields|Edelgard|We will break through the Tailtean Plains and then set course for Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. The final chapter of our fight with the Kingdom and the church is close at hand.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|???|You... How long do you intend to sleep? Your body is awake. Your eyes must open now, and you must find the strength to stand upon those legs of yours. Like so much rain, a pool of blood has fallen to the ground... As spears and arrows pierce the earth, it weeps. And even now...it weeps. In order to survive, they kill. And so, the people of this world are lost in an abyss of suffering. They weep as well. The only one who truly knows the nature of such things is I... Or rather, you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I'm still sleepy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|???|You are a complete and utter fool! Have you not changed one bit?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Who?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|???|Excuse me?! Are you saying you have forgotten who I am? How dare you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|???|Get on your feet. Right now! I'll coddle you no more! You are just like a child, always needing me to hold your hand...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Hey! A-are you awake?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Where am I?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|We’re in a village at the base of the monastery. What are you doing in a place like this?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Who are you?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|I’m just a villager here. What are you doing in a place like this?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|I honestly didn’t expect to find someone floating away down the river... Garreg Mach is upstream of here, but that place was abandoned.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|What do you mean?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Huh? You don’t know? The Church of Seiros isn’t there anymore. Though there have been some folks still living there in the five years since... Well, you know. Regardless, the Imperial Army has taken over now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Five years?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|What year is it?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Um, are you feeling all right? You didn’t hit your head or anything did you? It’s the Ethereal Moon of the year 1185. It’s been nearly five years since the monastery fell. Tomorrow was supposed to be the Millennium Festival, but who’s got time to think about things like that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|The millennium festival...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Uh, yeah, that’s what I said. But with the war and the archbishop still missing and all, I doubt there’s a soul to be found who has enough blessings worth counting.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Hey! Slow down, will ya? Where do you think you’re going?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|The monastery.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Are you crazy?! The Imperial Army is there! Come on, I promise I won’t say you’re a coward. Just forget about going anywhere near the monastery.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|You just remember I tried to stop you, got it? It’s not on my conscience if you wind up dead.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|My students are waiting for me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Students? You really are crazy, aren’t you? There aren’t any kids anywhere near that place anymore.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|No need to worry about me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Villager|Unbelievable...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Five years ago to the day... If things had continued on as they were, today would have been the Millennium Festival.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Halt! Who's there?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|It can't be! Professor? Is it really you? But I searched everywhere and never found a trace! My teacher... what have you been doing all this time? Where have you been?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I was sleeping.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I was dead.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Joking?! At a time like this?! You do realize it's been five years since you disappeared!  Do you have any idea how guilty I felt? How broken my heart was? I searched high and low after you vanished! Although there was no proof, I somehow knew you were still alive. All this time, I led everyone as best I could, and fought with all my heart. It's been a difficult path to walk alone.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard| Welcome back, my teacher. I'm so happy that you're safe. Five years... Such a short time, but it fells like an eternity ago. Do you... still feel the way you did all those years ago? You said that you would fight at my side no matter how many enemies we should amass. As for me, my resolve has not faltered. I'm determined as ever to see this through to the end. I will defeat the false goddess. I will save this world from those creatures and give humanity its freedom back.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|So, my teacher, are you prepared to stand with me?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I am.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|I...I thank you. Truly. Now then, I assume you understand the situation at hand, yes?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I really was asleep all this time...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Another joke. Or...are you telling the truth? I suppose you must be. In that case, I'll tell you all that has transpired as you slumbered these past five years.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|...And that is where we are now. The war is at a stalemate. Dimitri is the new King of Faerghus. It's clear that his territory will continue to support the Church. Meanwhile, Claude's leadership has thrown the Alliance into chaos. He maintains neutrality in their internal conflict. The situation has created a deadlock. We've been awaiting an opportunity for our squadron to return to the monastery. With you in the fray, I believe the state of the war will shift immediately. The Church, as well as the Kingdom and the Alliance... The time has come to eliminate them all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|The Kingdom and the Alliance...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Although we were of different houses, we were companions who lived and learned together. Some of our ranks are hesitant to battle against them. However, knowing that you're alive is sure to raise their spirits.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|The Church of Seiros...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Rhea, Seteth, the knights, and the others are in prime condition. They've set up their base within the Kingdom capital. The Immaculate One and her family have yet to fight on the front lines. However, we must eventually face and defeat them. It would mean a great deal to have you with us when the time comes.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Good. Well then, I believe it's time for a little reunion. The Black Eagle Strike Force never lost faith. They knew you were alive and have been awaiting your return. Let's not keep them waiting any longer.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|Well now. That face is certainly familiar. I am glad to see you alive and well, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Bernadetta|Professor, it's me, Bernie! Do you remember me? I can't believe you're here!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|I can't believe it! Is this a dream? Can we really be this lucky?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Petra|This is not dreaming. Our professor is with us again!  Welcome to the back! I mean, welcome back!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ferdinand|Our group isn't the same without you. I am overjoyed to see you again!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Dorothea|It's been so long. Seeing you again fills my heart with hope.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Linhardt|Great, now everything will be easy.  Um, that's great you're safe, Professor. I'm deeply, deeply moved.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Quite the reunion, isn't it, Professor? Everyone's happy to see you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|Come on, Edelgard. You must be happier than all of us combined!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|She took it really hard when you disappeared, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ferdinand|Of course, we did our very best in your absence. And there was never a day that we doubted you would return to us.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Dorothea|Edelgard has been leading us as emperor. But...after you disappeared, it became apparent that you were her anchor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Petra|It gives me regret to be admitting this, but...our power is not enough. The only one who can be meeting Edelgard's expectations...is you, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Linhardt|Most impressive of all is your uncanny ability to bring a smile to everyone's face.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|In the years since you vanished, we have not lost anyone from our ranks.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|We all longed for your presence and your leadership. Myself included.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|It seems fitting to view this as a new beginning for the Black Eagle Strike Force. We already have our target.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Yes. We must eliminate the Alliance before moving on to fight the Kingdom and the Church. However, that doesn't necessarily mean we must occupy the entirety of the Alliance. House Riegan stands against the Empire... Therefore, our target is Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|We must cross the Airmid River, which separates the Empire and the Alliance. To do that, we must take the largest bridge across it. The Great Bridge of Myrddin. Myrddin connects the monastery and the Imperial capital to the east. It is the shortest route there.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|An Alliance stronghold has been built at the Great Bridge. We'll take that and then head north. At the same time, we must defeat the one who defends it, Judith von Daphnel. If we can also take control of Daphnel territory, it would be greatly beneficial to us. Prepare yourselves. The next battle will be a momentous one. Join me, my friends, as we begin our journey to bring peace and solace to this war-ravaged world.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Professor... I'm sorry to have dragged you into the fight again so soon after our reunion. But you appeared at a most opportune time. I'm truly humbled by your support, my teacher. Thank you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|You can count on me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|And so I will. I'm hoping your ability from five years prior are still intact.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I hope I'm not rusty...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|You may be worried, but you shouldn't be. You always manage to pull through.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Make sure you're ready to head out, OK?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|Allow me to brief you on the details of our situation. The Empire firmly controls the western portion of Faerghus. However, the central and eastern regions continue to put up heavy resistance. The strongholds in these regions are Arianrhod, the Fortress City, and Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. We cannot control Faerghus until we have taken both of these cities. As for the Alliance, Houses Gloucester and Ordelia seem predisposed to to capitulate to us. However, due to interference from Houses Riegan and Goneril, we have yet to secure their cooperation. Claude obviously hopes to keep the Alliance whole through diplomacy. But because we have had to focus our efforts against the church until now, our forces have yet to meet his. We have only recently begun to take the fight to Alliance territory.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ferdinand|The last five years have been difficult at times. My relationship with Edelgard is rather contentious, due to the incident with my father. Nevertheless, I cannot abandon my family's duties. As Duke Aegir, I must play my part in the Imperial army. Edelgard intends to abolish the nobility, but I know I can dissuade her from doing so.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Linhardt|Professor! Do you know how happy I was to hear you were still alive? I'll tell you how happy--for the past two days, I haven't had my morning or my afternoon naps.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Morning...nap?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Linhardt|Yes?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|You were taking those naps every day?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Linhardt|Well, as long as we weren't marching. Can't sleep much then...but it's not for want of trying...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Linhardt|By the way, with Professor Hanneman not around... I've occupied his room. So I am well equipped to perform research on you. Isn't that exciting?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|All right, I'm ready to fight! Let's do this!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Whoa, slow down.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|You're right! I gotta keep it under control or I'm gonna wear myself out too quickly. Maybe I'll just get rid of a few monsters...or is that too risky right before a mission?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I'm counting on you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|Leave it to me! I can take on the whole...most of the enemy's army!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|I know my limits now, Professor!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Bernadetta|Are we leaving for battle? I heard it's a long march. But it's fine! I've had plenty of time to stay inside lately, so I think it's time I...went out. Yeah! I can do this. No more Bernie-bear!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Bernie-bear?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Bernadetta|Oh yeah. People call me Bernie-bear since I hole up in my den all the time. Not anymore though!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|That's the spirit.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Bernadetta|Yes! But, um. Please don't put me up front, OK?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Dorothea|Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Petra|Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means the common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Felix|For five years, I've fought for the Empire. I've cut down hordes of enemies. Now I have the same look in my eyes that the boar used to have in his. The look of a savage beast who loves nothing but destruction and violence.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I don't see that look in your eyes.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Felix|I hope not.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|You're right.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Felix|Hmph. I can hardly hold it against him anymore.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Felix|You and Edelgard must not disappoint me. Mark my words. The future you're building had better be worth all this bloodshed.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ashe|Since you came back, everyone's been smiling. Just you being here makes an incredible difference. I can't express how reassuring it is to see you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Sylvain|Hey, Professor. It's been a really long time, hasn't it? The last five years have been full of heartbreak-not from girls...but friends and family becoming enemies. One of the things that kept me going was the hope you'd return, and now here you are. A lot has changed, but you're back, and it's the first time I can remember being happy in a while.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Mercedes|I have good friends in both the Alliance and Faerghus, so this fighting weighs heavily on me... I can't bear the thought of battling the Knights of Seiros to the death! I have to keep my chin up though, right? Let's press on together, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Annette|My father used to be a knight in service of the royal family of Faerghus. For a time he was at the monastery, but apparently, he's back in Faerghus serving as a knight again. Which means if I fight with this family, I'll eventually have to face my own father...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|If you want to leave, now is the time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Annette|Don't say that! I know what I'm doing and I'm ready for anything.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Does that frighten you?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Annette|Terribly. But...I've accepted my fate. I'm ready for anything.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Annette|Of course, if at all possible, I would prefer not to fight my father. This is the path I chose. I have no regrets.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ingrid|His Highness, the new king, is in process of unifying the Kingdom under his command. His powerful army has joined forces with the Knights of Seiros, who moved their seat to Faerghus. And now they're presenting a unified front against the Imperial army. They're our greatest enemy, absolutely.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I wonder if we can win.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ingrid|Presently, it's doubtful. That's why I'm in favor of first capturing Alliance lands.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Can you fight against your homeland?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ingrid|I don't relish the idea, but there's no turning back now. For now, we should focus our efforts on the Alliance. The Kingdom and church can come afterwards.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ingrid|Judith, who defends the Great Bridge of Myrddin, is a formidable opponent. We can't afford to drop our guard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Lorenz|House Gloucester will remain staunchly neutral in this war. Even if we press into Alliance territory. My father is no threat to the Empire. Lady Edelgard surely understands that. The Great Bridge of Myrddin, however, is another story. I hear it is held by Judith of House Daphnel. She is renowned for her military prowess. We would do well not to underestimate her.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Raphael|Hey, Professor! What have you been up to for five years? Hope you haven't gone soft! I got myself into perfect shape. Took all five years of pushing my muscles to the limit, but look!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|You look very strong.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Raphael|You bet I do! You gotta get training if you want to catch up!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I don't really see a difference...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Raphael|What?! Can't you see my muscles? Do I gotta undress so you can get a better look?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ignatz|I thought you might be at the monastery. That's why I made my way here. I decided to follow your path, because I believed in you. But then you vanished. Now that you've returned, I have my guiding light once again. Welcome back, Professor!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Lysithea|I'm relieved you're here, Professor. It seems we've reached a stalemate on the war front. I admit I'm feeling apprehensive about fighting the Alliance...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|You have to cast aside your doubts.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Lysithea|I agree. It's time to shelve my personal feelings and focus on the bigger picture.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|You don't have to do anything if you don't want to.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Lysithea|No. I have to shelve my personal feelings. There are bigger things at play here.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Lysithea|I'll fight at full force. I'm counting on you to lead us to victory, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Marianne|My adoptive father sent me here so our family name would be known. He doesn't care which side wins, the Empire or the Alliance. However, even if he tells me to come home, I intend to stay. I want to see this new world Edelgard dreams of.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|I'm so glad to see you're all right. I really regretted not being able to keep the promise I made to my mentor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Mentor?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Captain Jeralt, obviously! I'm still his first and greatest apprentice, you know!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Promise?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Captain Jeralt told me that if anything should happen to him, then I should stick by you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|I'm going to do just what he asked. I'll be right here to support you from now on.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Alois|Ah!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Ah?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Alois|At long last, we meet again! I knew you were alive. I knew you could survive. And five years on, you arrive! We're reunited! I'm glad I kept watch for you in the downstream villages all that time. I was so devoted to finding you that I left the Knights of Seiros. Now I serve no one... Other than you! I'll protect you, just as I promised Captain Jeralt I would all those years ago.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Shamir|What's that look on your face? Surprised to see me? I'm a mercenary. Always have been. Even when I was with the Knights of Seiros. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon. But I might change my mind if you're around.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hanneman|You've finally joined us, haven't you? I attached myself to the Imperial army as well. Seemed the thing to do. I feel I owe it to Edelgard to set my past feelings about the Empire aside. I am happy to help her. It's strange, isn't it? After five years, the three Professors are together once more. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|We can talk about that.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hanneman|Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Uh, maybe later...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hanneman|I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Manuela|After the battle five years ago, the Imperial army occupied Garreg Mach. The cathedral and several other buildings were destroyed, but... We've done some repair work here and there, and we're using the buildings as a base of operations. As for me? Well, the church moved its headquarters to Faerghus, and I've seen no reason to follow. When I returned to Enbarr, I received a summons from Her Majesty, and I chose to answer.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Jeritza|You survived. How very fortunate... Were you dead, I wouldn't be able to fight you. But you are very much alive—now I've a chance to kill you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Anna|There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Randolph|Ah, a new face. I am Randolph von Bergliez. I'm the guardian of this place. Wait a moment... I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Five years ago...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|I'm a professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Randolph|Ah yes! You're Her Majesty's professor. You're alive?! Um... Oh, this is my little sister, Fleche. She's just a rookie, but she's helping me as my assistant.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Fleche|H-Hello. I'm Fleche von Bergliez. It's nice to meet you. I know I'm inexperienced, but I'm going to do my best. You can count on me to look after my big brother!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Randolph|I heard you're planning to march into Alliance territory. I'll be here to guard the fort.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! What's that? Do I have brothers in the church? You really are well informed! My older twin works for the Knights of Seiros, but I think he's just a grunt. Not a noble gate keeper like yours truly. Unlike me, he's very devout. He left the Empire a long time ago.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|We are about to commence the attack on the Great Bridge of Myrddin. But first, allow me a moment of your time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|What do you need?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|It is something I can only ask of you. Listen well... It concerns Lady Edelgard's uncle. The regent of the Empire, Lord Arundel. Although he is currently cooperating with Her Majesty, he maintains his own sizable military troops. It seems to me that his plans differ from our own. I assume you recall a certain group's scheming from five years ago. Solon and Kronya... They both served Lord Arundel.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Why must we cooperate?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|He must be dealt with.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|Professor, I understand how you must be feeling, considering what they did to your father. I know it must be foul to even consider cooperating with their kind. However, their power is essential for us at present. Edelgard also strongly opposed the idea at first. Our enemy is the Church of Seiros itself. It cannot be toppled with the Empire's might alone. Those working under Lord Arundel are extremely hostile toward the church. And the enemy of our enemy is... Well, I think you sufficiently understand by now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Byleth|Are you sure that's a good idea?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|Until all of Fódlan is united, it is a necessary evil. As for how we deal with them afterward...time will tell. Regardless, Her Majesty and I wish to join our power with yours.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|You should know that in her heart, Her Majesty regards that group as enemies of herself and her family. They used her father, the former emperor, as a puppet and murdered her siblings with their vile experimentation. I believe Her Majesty may have told you some of this herself. That is why this was a...very painful decision for her to make.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|I will do all I can to ensure her suffering is not in vain, and I hope I can count on you to do the same. As for all I have told you, please keep it in mind as we march forward. More importantly, I implore you to fight as best you can for Edelgard... From the bottom of my heart, I beg this of you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|We'll be capturing the Great Bridge of Myrddin, a key strategic location of the Leicester Alliance. Claude will surely be sending reinforcements, so we must prevail before they arrive.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|Our opponent is Judith, the so-called Hero of Daphnel. We can handle her. So long as we don't get careless.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Judith|The boy said to run if I was in danger, but... I could never do that. I'll hold out until reinforcements arrive!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Judith! I'm so glad you're safe! Claude sent me here with reinforcements!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Alliance General|Sorry to keep you waiting, Judith! We're the reinforcements!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Acheron|Why do I have to put up with orders from that false leader...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Because you're from the smallest noble house in all the Alliance, you whiner!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Enemy reinforcements... We didn't finish in time. Don't let them secure the ballista!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ignatz|I am helping Claude build the future of Fódlan!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ignatz|Ungh... I should have known this would happen...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Judith|Ignatz! Damn it... Such a good kid. He died too young...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Judith, I'm sorry... I leave the rest to you...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Judith|Leonie! You had such a full life ahead of you... I wish I could take your place...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Doesn't matter who you are. I won't hold back, and I won't fall to the Empire!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|You're all Captain Jeralt's enemies! And I will avenge him here!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Judith|This is it... Claude, I'm sorry. I couldn't defend the bridge. All who are able, retreat!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Don't let her escape! If we take her out now, the Daphnel territory will be ours! That will allow us to march safely through the Alliance.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Judith|Avoided death yet again, huh? I'll join Claude and prepare for a counter attack!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|Judith's escape will widen the battlefront. Our strategy's failed...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Judith|Guh, it looks like I'm done for. Claude... I'm sorry...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Judith! No!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Acheron|The knights on the other side of this bridge are mine. I can't just let you cross!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Acheron|Guh... If only I had joined the Empire...sooner...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ignatz|We can't place the future of Fódlan in Edelgard's hands. If you're allied with the Empire, I have no choice but to fight you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Raphael|Outta my way, Ignatz! I don't wanna have to fight you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ignatz|Stop deluding yourself. You joined the Empire. Didn't you consider the consequences? I don't want to fight you either, Raphael! But this is war.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Raphael|Ignatz...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Leonie|Professor! You know Captain Jeralt's killer was connected to the Empire! Why did you side with them?! Answer me, traitor!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Lorenz|Acheron! What a pleasant surprise! I was concerned I might have to kill someone decent.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Acheron|Ha! House Gloucester is already finished. I've already taken control of your land!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Lorenz|That's quite enough of your spinning, Weathervane. Time for you to die.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Alliance soldiers, Judith has fallen! Further conflict is futile! If you surrender, your lives will be spared. Lay down your weapons immediately.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|You have all fought well. With this victory, we now have a foothold in the Alliance. The Imperial Army will cross the Airmid River and push the front lines forward. The fight will continue, but do not allow that to stop you from taking pride in our hard-won victory.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Ferdinand|Ah, this should put a stop to one of Edelgard's choice phrases. Well done, Professor. I believe it was "if only the professor were here, we could forge ahead and change the tides of this war."|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Ferdinand. It is not necessary to tell the professor such things.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Caspar|We're not the only ones benefiting! The whole Imperial Army is stronger now!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Linhardt|Yes, it seems the Empire finally has both of its legs to stand on. Don't you agree?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|You make it sound as though I can't run the Empire on my own. Perhaps it's more apt to say that the pegasus has recovered its horn.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Dorothea|Judith of Daphnel... What a magnificent warrior. I'm happy to have the professor back just like old times, but I don't think I'll ever get used to this cruel exchange of lives...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Petra|When there is something you must not be conceding, you must keep fighting! The fighting has been continuing for five years, but now I am again witnessing the professor's power.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Bernadetta|I hate fighting! But...with the professor here...maybe it's slightly less terrible? Oh, but everyone is working so hard! Stop it, Bernie, you can't be the only one complaining!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Hubert|I'm glad to see everyone so inspired. It seems the reappearance of the professor has done much to raise your morale.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|13-BeyondEscape|Edelgard|Do you not feel the same, Hubert? Come now, be honest with yourself. Now, we must take advantage of the situation and blaze ahead. Our path is still a long one.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|We somehow managed to escape.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|This is one of the Imperial army's provisional camps. Here we can organize our forces.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Before we go any further, I want all of you to really ask yourselves if you're certain you wish to join us. As expected, Flayn has chosen to leave our ranks.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Caspar|When I saw our professor running off, I ran about as fast as I could to catch up.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Petra|Caspar. Death finds those who run without thinking. You gave no thought to the war fog.  My grandfather was the leader of Brigid, and I hope for us to be allies with the Empire. I will be staying.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Bernadetta|W-Was this a good idea? Did I make the right choice? Oh, but my family is part of the Empire, and our professor is here...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Caspar|You're fine here with us, Bernie. Though it's true that certain houses were against the Imperial princess...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ferdinand|I assume you are referring to my family. I must believe that the conclusion I came to was the correct one.  You are the emperor now... I am the only one left who is qualified to guide you at this point.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Linhardt|I'm only here because I know it would be troublesome to stand against you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Dorothea|I'm not just here for you, Edie. I'm here to follow our dear professor. Of course, I don't have any territory to offer... so Hubie may not even want me here.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|The greater our numbers, the better. Your reasons for being here are of no consequence.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|I think I understand where you are coming from. But now, I wish to hear of your resolve. Like you, I have risen to meet my destiny. I cut this path, and I will see it through to the end. Following me is akin to pointing a sword to the goddess herself. One misstep, and we fall to ruin. You have now witnessed the archbishop's true self. She is a cruel beast. Those who rule this world use that beast's power to fabricate miracles, all to control those who blindly believe in the goddess. They conceal the truth and force their lies on the nobility. They mercilessly annihilate anyone who defies them. I know this because I have lived it. After what you have seen, is there any room for doubt? The Church of Seiros has great influence and power. Their control over the lords of the Kingdom and the Alliance is nearly absolute. We are the only ones who can stop this indomitable enemy that has plagued our world for ages. We fight for humanity! For all of Fódlan! If you dare walk this path with me, take your first step. It's now or never!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Thank you, my friends. We are the true face of the Empire, and we will triumph!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|That was incredible, Lady Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Thank you. Honestly, I'm relieved. They really chose to follow me... I was resolved to move forward alone if I had to, but in my heart I hoped it wouldn't come to that.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|So long as I am here, you will never be alone. Please do not forget that. And...it would seem that the professor also has a key role to play in this.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|You're right. Now, I must speak with our teacher. Please, make preparations. The messenger should be here shortly.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|Consider it done.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Professor, may I speak with you?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|I appreciate it. I...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|What's wrong?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|I'm just...anxious. It feels like the weight of this burden is crushing me. At this very moment, on my orders, I'm starting a war. An army far larger than the one that attacked the Holy Tomb last month will soon be locked in battle. Long-devised strategies are unfolding across Fódlan. Leaders are deciding their loyalties and preparing to fight... So many generals and soldiers will die. It's inevitable that civilians will get caught up in the chaos as well. There will be countless casualties. With a single command, the flames of war will rage across all corners of this realm. And I am the one who is giving the order.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|This is the path you chose, isn't it?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Yes, it is. There is no turning back.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|Do you wish to stop?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|No. There is no turning back now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|No matter how much blood flows at my feet, I will not relent. We must break the bonds that the depraved church has placed on Fódlan. These sacrifices will allow us to create a future where we never need sacrifice again. It may seem contradictory, but it's the only way. Heh. Listen to me. I made up my mind long ago. Yet here I am, seeking your approval. Tell me the truth, my teacher. Are you happy with your decision to stand by my side. Unlike me, you can still walk away from all of this. This path leads to the death of the archbishop and the servants of the church. Can you live with that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|I chose this path too.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|I never thought... I'm sorry. It was a foolish question. I believe in you, professor. And you believed in me. With that knowledge, I have the strength to keep fighting. Let's go... There's something I need to say to Hubert.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|Your Majesty, the latest report indicates that our main army is advancing as planned. Also, the preparations for your manifesto are almost complete.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|Manifesto?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|We will distributing our manifesto to every lord within Fódlan. We will expose the dark side of the Church of Seiros and the foul practices of the nobles from the Kingdom and the Alliance. We will force the people of Fódlan to open their eyes to the truth and relinquish any remaining conviction to unite against the empire. Certain nobles have already offered their support.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|There are other nobles who oppose the church. We will condemn those who deserve condemnation and forgive those who deserve forgiveness. We have already purged some of the Imperial nobles who are morally rotten. My father among them. How unfortunate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|And soon we will invade and conquer Garreg Mach. Our main army has already departed the Imperial capital. They will arrive at the monastery in two weeks' time. There, we will join forces with them. As for us, I'd like your opinion on how we should be positioned within the army.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|We are the Imperial shield.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|We are the Imperial sword.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|Your majesty wishes to fight alongside the professor, correct? In that case, you will not be incorporated into the Empire's main army. Your squad can move freely about the battlefield under supervision of the Imperial forces... That would be most prudent.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Now that I'm the emperor, we can't let it slip that I'm following your command in battle, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|I fully object to the notion of you fighting on the front lines.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Hubert. We've already discussed this.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|My apologies... I overstepped.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Now that the details are settled, all that's left is come up with a name for ourselves. In honor at our time at the academy, how about we call ourselves the Black Eagle Strike Force?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|I love it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|I'm so happy you feel that way. I must confess that I spent all night thinking about it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|I hope we can live up to that name.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|With you as our leader, I'm confident we will. To me, that name represents us soaring toward a new dawn, freely as an eagle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|Isn't that a bit much?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|It seems we have differing tastes. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|I'll leave it to you to prepare the Black Eagle Strike Force for departure.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|We will join forces with the main army and attack Garreg Mach. It's a fortress built on steep ground, but it's never seen battle. That means we don't know much about it from a military perspective. But if we use all of the power at our disposal, we will capture it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|I wonder if we can win.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|We have to try.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|From a purely mathematical standpoint, we most certainly have the power to win. If the battle becomes a clash of beasts with inhuman strength... You will be our only hope. I believe in you. I'm relying on you to lead the Black Eagle Strike Force to victory.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|It is not up to Her Majesty to bring the students to our cause. That task falls to you. Those who have forsaken their homelands to join the Empire will be feeling...vulnerable. You are uniquely able to provide emotional support. Please use that gift to guide others down the path that Lady Edelgard has laid before us. I ask you to do this from the bottom of my heart.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ferdinand|I asked Edelgard what happened to my father. He was dismissed as prime minister and is under arrest in the Imperial capital. He always was a greedy, arrogant man. Some would say that this is the fate he deserves. And yet I cannot help but feel indignant. After all his hard work for the Empire, to be disgraced like this! I am conflicted, Professor. I do not know what to do. As the next Duke Aegir, should I follow Edelgard into battle?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Linhardt|The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Caspar|That could have gotten dangerous fast. If I stayed at the monastery, I would've had to fight my father! We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! Anyway, it looks like he's going to be leading the western units. I wonder if we'll wind up fighting the Kingdom's army, and who decided to fight for the church...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Bernadetta|I don't even get my own room here! At least I had that at home. But speaking of home, Hubert told me something. He said my father was stripped of his title. I guess he did as he pleased and opposed Edelgard. Wait, does that mean my father's going to be home all the time now? On second thought, I think I'm fine right here.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Dorothea|Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|It's worrisome.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Dorothea|It is. We might have to fight against others from the academy, and that's... I can't think about it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|We will not lose.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Dorothea|Thinking about it makes me scared. We're fighting the Knights of Seiros! Still, I know you'll figure something out.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Petra|The Empire and Brigid were once warring with each other. But now, I have made the decision to be fighting with the Empire. It is a choice of irony, I feel. But I am having no regret. My belief is with you and with Edelgard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Felix|I've been preparing to take this path. My own path--not my old man's, and not the boar's.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ashe|I can't bring myself to trust the Church of Seiros. Not after they killed Lonato and my brother. I need to know the truth. Even if it means...turning my weapon on Faerghus. I guess Lonato would be happy to hear me say that, if he were still around.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Sylvain|I've gone and done it now, huh? What would my old man say if he knew I'd sided with the Empire? His Highness must be angry. Dimitri gets super scary when he's like that. I wonder how I'm going to die... Ugh, my knees turn to jelly just thinking about it. No, I can't think that way. I promised to fight alongside you. I'm here until the end. Heh, listen to me. I'm terrified, but I feel so calm.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Mercedes|Surely this is what the goddess willed, isn't it? I feel she would not have wanted the Church of Seiros to become what it has...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Annette|Um, Professor... I'm OK with fighting whoever we need to, but I really don't want to battle my father... Oh, but I know that something is wrong with the church... And more than that, I believe in you, and I trust your word. You lead and I'll follow.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ingrid|I may return to Galatea territory and try to convince my father to join our cause. It's possible that... No. In my heart, I know that my father won't never listen. Still, I must get him to see reason. That this is the only way to ensure our family's future.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Lorenz|I've decided to ally myself with Lady Edelgard. Father will doubtless understand my reasoning. House Gloucester has always had good intentions in its dealings with the Empire. Of course, this does mean that I will no longer be able to avoid a confrontation with Claude. It is unfortunate. We were classmates, after all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Raphael|No need to worry about me. I got no complaints as long as my little sis is safe. Sure, I lived on Alliance land, but that doesn't mean I served their lords. I'm sure this is the right path, seeing as you're the one who picked it, Professor!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ignatz|To think that things would come to this. Even a few months ago, I never could've imagined it. I believe in you, Professor, so I'm steeling myself. I can't promise that I'll be useful in battle, but I'm not running away from the fight.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Lysithea|If the church is behind the current state of things--this society in which only Crests are valued--then I have no need of it. Edelgard is taking the shortest path to change. No matter how drastic her measures, I agree that this is the only way. That said, if Edelgard strays from her noble path, I trust you will set her straight again. Won't you? I am counting on you, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Marianne|Imagine making half the world your enemy for the sake of realizing your own ideals... Edelgard is so radiant and strong compared to someone like me... What if I have the power to change the world too? Even just a little bit...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Leonie|So, you've turned against the church to ally with the Empire too, huh? I never pressed him for details, but Captain Jeralt was always suspicious of Lady Rhea, wasn't he? I'm on your side, no matter what. I promised him I'd support you, and that's what I plan to do.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ladislava|I believe this is the first time we have met. My name is Ladislava. I have the great honor of leading Lady Edelgard's personal guard. Her majesty is hard on others as she is on herself. She may seem composed, but that is only because she conceals her more passionate emotions. For that reason, she is often misunderstood. But now she has you by her side... I find that most reassuring. I look forward to working with you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Randolph|I'm Randolph von Bergliez. I'm not very high in the ranks yet, but I'm more or less a general. Just like Caspar, I am from House Bergliez. My mother married into House Bergliez after I was born, so my position within the family is rather lowly... But I'm determined to make something of myself in this battle to bring glory to my part of the family, for the sake of my mother and sister!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|We will soon arrive at Garreg Mach Monastery. Forcing a surrender here is extremely significant, both strategically and symbolically. Of course, this is personal as well. This is where we all came together to learn and grow. I have no intention of yielding to our former classmates, so I ask that you prepare yourselves for anything.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Linhardt|I'm not thinking about friends right now, and I'm certainly not prepared.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Caspar|Damn it, don't go around saying things that lower morale before we even get started! I'm ready! Let's go! Let's fight!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Dorothea|I have nothing to lose aside from my friends who are here with me. Does that answer satisfy you?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Petra|I have been ready for this since leaving my land of home. I will fight and win!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Bernadetta|How can you prepare to fight? Maybe I can prepare to prepare...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ferdinand|There is no reason I cannot be prepared. It is my duty to stand up and battle!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Thank you all. Now, let's talk strategy.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|As the raiding force, we will attack the area nearest to the monastery. The Knights of Seiros certainly won't stand down after they catch sight of Her Majesty and the professor. At the same time, the remaining areas will be surrounded and annihilated by the main army. In other words, we are the decoy that must suppress the enemy's most elite soldiers.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|We know more about the area near the monastery than anyone else in the Imperial army. Still, we must prepare for the worst. It's possible we will have to face the archbishop's true form--the Immaculate One. Fight with all you have, but don't be reckless. As promised, I will leave the command to the professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|We will not lose.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|Naturally. With both Her Majesty and yourself on our side, defeat is impossible.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|I will protect you all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|Not only will we all survive this, but we will undoubtedly emerge victorious.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|This will be our first battle as the Black Eagle Strike Force. All the more reason to prevail!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Seteth|Friends! Our opportunity for victory will come, but first we must see to our defenses!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|The city's defenders are trying to stall for time. We must crush them swiftly. We should be wary of ambushes as well.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Ladislava is being pushed on the left flank. We must push back with equal force.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ladislava|Just what we need! I knew Her Majesty's allies would help us out.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Ladislava|Apologies for the trouble, Your Majesty!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Death Knight|We will lend the Empire strength...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Byleth|?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Don't worry. We're allies now... I understand you must have many questions, but they'll have to wait until after the battle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|Seteth, Flayn, Gilbert... You put your lives on the line to protect us. I would have preferred to have more time to prepare, but we cannot delay any longer. Come forth! Protect Garreg Mach Monastery from these despicable rebels!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Catherine|I'll crush them all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Cyril|Her enemies are my enemies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Flayn|You shall not pass! I will protect Garreg Mach!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Flayn|Must protect...Garreg Mach... I must protect...everyone...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Seteth|Retreat while you still can, Flayn! I beg you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Flayn|Understood... Stay safe Fa--Brother!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Gilbert|Unfortunately, you must die here. You should never have defied the goddess.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Gilbert|In my master's name, I cannot allow myself to fall here... I must withdraw.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Seteth|You will survive this hardship! Just hold on!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Seteth|I will show no mercy to anyone who attacks Rhea!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Seteth|I cannot yield...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Flayn|Seteth! Please, do not overextend yourself! I am still in this fight!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Seteth|I'm sorry, Flayn... Withdraw if you must...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Flayn|Professor, why?! Do you not see the cruelty of this?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Gilbert|If you side with the Empire... If you turn your sword on the church and the Kingdom... I care not who you are. I will end you just the same.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Gilbert|Annette, throw down your arms!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Annette|I'm sorry, Father. But I have made my choice. I'm not going back to the monastery, to the Kingdom, or to you, Father!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Gilbert|Forgive me, Goddess. Annette. If you side with the Empire, I will have no choice but to kill you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Seteth|Traitor! I will not forgive you for turning on Rhea!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Catherine|I am Thunder Catherine, and I will slay all of Lady Rhea's enemies. Including you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Catherine|Lady Rhea, I'm sorry. Please stay safe.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|All is well, Catherine. You must not die here.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Cyril|I gotta kill you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Cyril|Lady Rhea, I couldn't fight hard enough. I'm sorry...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|Cyril... Your sacrifice will not be in vain.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|So you have sullied yourself by joining with the rebels? I hope you came prepared to breathe your last.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|Raaaargh!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Catherine|I trusted you. Lady Rhea trusted you. I won't let you live after what you've done.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Cyril|I'll protect Lady Rhea against anyone! Even if it's you, I'll fight ya as hard as I can!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|You... How dare you betray me... You worthless piece of garbage... I will punish you myself!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|No matter your reasons, I cannot permit you to go on living any longer!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|The feeling is mutual. I must put a stop to your reign of tyranny!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Rhea|You must know what a fool you are! The greatest of sins is to make an enemy of the goddess herself!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|I have only made an enemy of the church, not of the faith.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|The Immaculate One|You will not be forgiven!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Professor, look out!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Imperial Soldier|The castle is crumbling! We must escape!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Hubert|Professor, take cover!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|12-OutsetOfAPowerStruggle|Edelgard|Professor!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|So... Arianrhod has fallen. Rodrigue... I swear that I will not allow your death to be in vain...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|So... Arianrhod has fallen. Rodrigue, Felix, Ingrid... I swear that I will not allow your deaths to be in vain...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Rhea|The scouts have just now returned. It seems the Imperial army is marching toward the Kingdom capital. Are you certain about this, Dimitri? As king, do you think it wise to intercept them yourself?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|No need to worry yourself. Even if I am defeated, the Blaiddyd bloodline will live on. And the Kingdom's territory has never been rich in resources. If the castle falls under siege, our loss is inevitable. I will deploy my army onto the plains and wait for the enemy. Please position your forces so that they can flank the Imperial army.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Rhea|Yes, given the present situation, making the plains our battlefield is a logical choice. I have no objection. However...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|There is only one person I am after. I have no interest in any other prey.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Rhea|I will take you at your word. Erasing the other child's existence is my task, and mine alone. I will get you back, Mother... I promise...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|What do you think, Lady Edelgard? Will they shut themselves inside of Fhirdiad?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|They will try to intercept us. Of course, Fhirdiad will not fall so easily. Even so... If were to cut off their supply with a large army, it would eventually fall. It makes much more sense for them to wager everything on a victory at the Tailtean Plains.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|The Tailtean Plains...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|The same plains where the so-called divine Seiros defeated Nemesis, the King of Liberation, in a comeback victory over 1,000 years ago. And about 400 years ago, the hero Loog created the Kingdom by defeating the emperor of the time on those very plains. Their goal must be to recreate that scene.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Yes, I suppose so. Although the Imperial army is powerful, if we were to compare the strength of our best to the best of the Knights of Seiros, we would likely come up short. The Kingdom's army and House Blaiddyd are also renowned for their unmatched persistence. On the battlefield, it can be assumed that their one and only goal will be to strike you down.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Are you telling me to stay off the battlefield?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Naturally. You are their aim, Your Majesty. You must know it only makes sense to keep you out of their reach.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|And you must know that, at a time like this, I absolutely cannot withdraw.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Of course I know that. That is why I will refrain from asking you again to stay away from the battlefield.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|The Immaculate One, descendants of the 10 Elites, and other extremely fearsome foes await us. But with the help of our friends, we have a chance of defeating them. We're the only ones who can. Within our group, I am included among those with the king of strength we need to win. I absolutely will not remove myself from the front lines. Professor you have that same strength as well, whether or not you realize it yet.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Of course.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|As emperor, I must not die in this war, and it would be unacceptable to lose you as well.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|I will protect you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Please, don't get yourself killed trying to protect me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Until the very end, we'll survive this trial together. Understood?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|This month, we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. I have no intention of retreating to Garreg Mach after we've come this far. We will only return after we've conquered Fhirdiad and put an end to this war. Be sure to steel your heart and ready yourself for the battle ahead.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|I'm ready for anything.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Are you certain? If so, please help me raise the morale of our allies.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|I'll do what I can.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|I'm sorry to burden you, but please look after our allies as well.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|I'm not sure I'll be ready in time...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|We have no choice. I have every faith that you are capable of this.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Tch. Lord Arundel. As long as he exists, Lady Edelgard will...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Just who is that man?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|I believe I have explained before that he is the one who commanded the likes of Solon and Kronya. Cornelia, whom we defeated Arianrhod, was also one of his. An irksome sort. We must not fail to be rid of him. He is a maggot, crawling in the filth of the world, feeding off the Empire like a parasite.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ferdinand|Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital... From the Empire's perspective, it seems like the northernmost edge of the world. I have come a long way, following you and Edelgard. To think, what if I had succeeded Duke Aegir as prime minister? I would never have had all these experiences.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You've really grown up.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ferdinand|I hope that is true. I used to be so naive...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You'll always be a noble, through and through.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ferdinand|Please do not tease, Professor. I think all of this has changed me a little bit.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ferdinand|For now, let us join together and walk the path that Her Majesty lays out.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Linhardt|When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|We're far from safe ourselves.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Linhardt|Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our own lives, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It's a necessary sacrifice.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Linhardt|Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It's better than dragging the war out.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Linhardt|I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Caspar|All right! Off to the Kingdom's capital we go! Huh. I feel like I've said that before.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You're imagining things.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Caspar|My imagination, eh? You usually know what you're talking about. Still, this is gonna bug me...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It's not your imagination.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Caspar|Yeah, you usually know what you're talking about. I just can't remember when I woulda said it!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Let's head for the Kingdom capital!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Caspar|All right! I'm fired up and ready to go!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Bernadetta|Professor! What should I do!? Everyone's acting like this is leading up to the final chapter in a book or something! Is the battle ahead really going to be that climatic? Am I not taking it seriously enough?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You're doing just fine.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Bernadetta|You think so? All right, I believe you. I'm...ready for this. I am. Yeah! We're going to win!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You could be showing more resolve.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Bernadetta|I know, I know, but I...don't wanna die!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|What you really need to do is relax.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Bernadetta|Yeah, you're probably right. I should take a breath and try to calm down.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dorothea|We're almost to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. Just imagine...the war might almost be over. But is it true that Arianrhod was annihilated?! What in the world happened?! What is the Seiros Church, really?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|We'll find out if we conquer the Kingdom capital.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dorothea|Fair enough. Let's just focus on this battle right now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It's impossible to say right now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dorothea|Of course, Professor. I trust you, OK?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|For now, just trust in me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dorothea|I always have, and I always will.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Petra|I have...worries. What have I been achieving? When the war is ended, I will be returning to Brigid with many...much new potential. But have I had enough growth to become the ruler?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Yes. You should be proud.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Petra|I have gratitude. I will take your words into my heart.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Only you can answer that.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Petra|This is the truth. I will fight with all of my strength so that I will know with certainty!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Petra|Brigid pride, technique, and culture... I will be showing all of the world who we are!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Felix|They used to call my father the Shield of Faerghus. Now he's gone, and Arianrhod has fallen. Yet the Knights of Seiros remain. As does the boar. What terrifies me most is his stubbornness. He'll keep on fighting to the last man. He's a monster. I've seen it firsthand.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ashe|I hear that House Blaiddyd commands some strong and well-trained troops. People say they're fiercely devoted and will gladly die for their king. Reminds me of Lonato's men-the ones we faced back in Magdred. Unlike those civilian soldiers though, here we're up against the best that the Faerghus army has to offer. It's going to be a hard battle, but if there's a peaceful tomorrow waiting on the other side, it'll be worth it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|I've been thinking about how we've got our own ideas about justice...and so does the Kingdom. And what's coming, it's not just a battle between us and them. It's our ideals that are fighting. Whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong. That's how it goes... But nobody's willing to talk or compromise, so we'll fight to the death to prove the other guy's wrong. It won't be an easy battle, but let's make sure we come back alive. Right, Professor?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|When I first enrolled in the Officers Academy, I never thought it would come to this. I can't believe we're waging war...against the church, no less.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Do you regret it?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|There are some things that I regret, but I don't think I made the wrong decision.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Are you ready to face this?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|Yes, of course.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|Even if our enemy is Lady Rhea herself, I am prepared to fight.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Annette|I'm sure my father will be waiting in Fhirdiad. If I can avoid it, I'd rather not fight him... But I don't think my father is capable of betraying the royal family...of betraying Dimitri. I must be prepared to do...what I have to.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|I'm counting on you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Annette|Right!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Don't push yourself too hard.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Annette|I'm alright. I still stand by my decision to trust in you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Annette|Professor... Let's make sure we win!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ingrid|Claude was known as the Master Tactician. There wasn't a situation he couldn't strategize his way out of. Whereas, King Dimitri is known as the Tempest King. He is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. We still haven't ever faced him head-on. Can we do this?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|We can.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ingrid|Yes. Of course we can! I'm sorry. I let my uncertainty get the better of me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|I'll see this through.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ingrid|Ah, Professor. Ever the reliable one.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ingrid|We have you, and we have Edelgard. Not to mention many other allies we can rely upon. Together...we can overcome even the most formidable foe!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lorenz|Personally I take no issue with attacking Lady Rhea. But the eagerness of my fellow nobles does vex me, despite so many grand displays of piety from them in the past. It gives me the impression that faith is little more than a tool they use to maintain their positions of power.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Disappointed in the nobility?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lorenz|I suppose I am in no position to judge them, being among their number myself. Still, it irritates me.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Is religion obsolete, then?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lorenz|If it is no longer useful as a tool, then I expect the nobles will cease to give it any credence.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lorenz|What is a noble's duty, truly? I hope we will discover an answer in the conflict ahead.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Raphael|Hyah! Next up's the Kingdom capital! We're coming for you! Whoa. That sounds familiar. Have I said that before?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You're imagining things.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Raphael|Really? You're probably right. It's not like we've invaded the Kingdom capital before.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It's not your imagination.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Raphael|Really? Does that mean we've invaded the Kingdom capital before?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Let's head for the Kingdom capital!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Raphael|Yeah! Let's do it, Professor! I just gotta get my muscles prepped and ready first!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ignatz|Once the Kingdom capital falls, all of Fódlan will be united under the banner of the Empire. Isn't it thrilling? We're going to make history.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Only if we win.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ignatz|Well, yes, I suppose that's true.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Unless we lose.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ignatz|Hah! I don't think that will happen.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Let's stay calm and focus on the battle.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ignatz|Yes, of course! I'll do my best.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ignatz|Our opponents may be strong, but with you on our side, we can't lose!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lysithea|If we win this battle, it will be an end to the Kingdom, and to the church. Under the Empire, an era of peace would begin... Many people are cleaving to this notion, but I wonder if it would really end up as such.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It will.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lysithea|Such resolve. It's convincing, to say the least.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It won't.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lysithea|I worry as much myself.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|It's hard to say.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lysithea|It's true—it's nothing but hypotheticals at this point.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Lysithea|I wonder... Was the collapse of Arianrhod really the church's doing? Or could it be that... Hm. Never mind me. Just thinking aloud.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Marianne|Dear Goddess...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Praying again?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Marianne|Yes. I was praying for your safety.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|What are you praying for?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Marianne|Um...for your safety.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Marianne|I'll do all I can to survive, but please...please don't die out there, Professor.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Leonie|Looks like we're finally getting to the end of this thing. Don't go dying on us now, all right?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Not a chance.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Leonie|Ha! I like your confidence.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Same to you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Leonie|Not planning on it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Leonie|If you're still alive when this is all over, then I'll have kept my word to Captain Jeralt. Let's both live to see the dawn of a bright new age!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Alois|I wonder would the captain would say if he knew we were planning to take down Lady Rhea. Lady Rhea and Captain Jeralt went back pretty far. But hey, it's your decision! I'm sure he would have understood in the end. Now, onward to Fhirdiad! I'm ready!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Shamir|The idea of defeating Rhea is beginning to feel more like a reality. Some may say that I'm returning her goodwill with betrayal, but I believe I've worked off my debt. The real problem is a certain someone else.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Catherine?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Shamir|That's right. She was my partner, after all. I haven't seen her since leaving the knights...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Cyril?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Shamir|I taught him some archery, but we are of different birth and hold different values. I was speaking of Catherine.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Gilbert?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Shamir|I have no particular interest in him. I was speaking of Catherine.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Shamir|I can see her coming to slaughter me. Driven by her mixed emotions of love and hate.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hanneman|When Edelgard first invited me to join this army, I, to be frank, thought her dream utterly ridiculous. But at my advanced age, I was tempted by the notion of chasing a seemingly impossible dream through blood, sweat, and tears. Five years on, the unification of Fódlan is slowly becoming a reality. Now I feel... It may soon be possible to abolish the nobility, and create a world where none need suffer due to crests.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hanneman|You need not say anything. I will stay by your side, and hers, to the very end.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Manuela|Professor, do you mind if I complain about something, well, personal? Of course you don't. This army is almost all single men. If that marital status came before or during the war, I'm not to say... The point is, I'm in charge of the infirmary. I wind up treating hundreds of men every week. I get to talk to all sorts of men, from all walks of life, all of the time. And yet...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You don't have a boyfriend?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Manuela|No! Not one of those men is infatuated with their caregiver! Isn't that supposed to happen in wartime?!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|You aren't married yet?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Manuela|Forget that, I can't even find a boyfriend! Marriage is just—pffftt! A joke! Just a sick joke.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Maybe you should give up on love.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Manuela|Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Manuela|At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Jeritza|The war is at its end. Has the time finally come that I might kill you?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|The battle will continue even beyond the war.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Jeritza|It is true... Those petulant fleas must be picked off one by one. There are nothing if not persistent.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|There's no guarantee that we'll win next time.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Jeritza|And if we do not win, then we die. Either has its charms.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Anna|Seems like the war is gonna end soon. Once the dust settles, it'll be back to rolling in fat stacks of gold for me!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Fleche|Ah! Did you want something?! Sorry, I was a bit lost in thought... Or rather, I was thinking about work. My brother had sorted out all his personal affairs, but apparently he'd forgotten about his work duties. So now I've got a ton more work on my plate... Oh, Brother, why must you be so careless... Once this war is over, I'm gonna take a vacation and get some well-earned rest back home with my mother.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Gatekeeper|Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! The time has finally come to set out for the Kingdom Capital, Fhirdiad. I thought the same thing last month, but I still can't believe the plan was to ambush Arianrhod. I know it couldn't helped, but even I wasn't let in on the secret. Me! Not gonna lie...that hurt a little. Ah well, let's forget about that! I'm praying for your victory and your safe return!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Jeralt|Sorry... It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now. (groans) One day, I hope you'll give this ring to someone you love as well as I love her.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|(Someone I love...)|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|Mother... Oddly the rain has come to fall yet again. At this place, once again... I will fight to take you back... The one who keeps me from seeing you again... I will be sure to return them to the earth from whence they came. The foolish descendant of Hresvelg who bares her fangs at me will suffer the same fate...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Church Soldier|Lady Rhea...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|Call me Seiros now. I am no longer the archbishop, but rather a warrior.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Church Soldier|Yes, Lady Seiros. Because of the rain, we have not yet confirmed the position of our enemy or of the Kingdom army...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|Search the route to Fhirdiad. It is unlikely that they have strayed far from it. When you discover the Imperial army's main force, commence the attack. If the Kingdom's army has already engaged, flank the enemy as planned.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Church Soldier|As you wish.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|Wait for me, dear child... I will be paying you a visit soon... When this sword has been plunged into your chest... Yes, that is the very moment I have long for...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|I was hoping they would strike the church first... We must have miscalculated the rate of their advance. Reorganize the formation. We have no choice but to buy time until the church arrives. It will be a long battle... Are you afraid, Dedue?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|No. So long as I am at your side, there is nothing to fear.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|I can always rely on you. Just watch, my friend... We will prevail. I will not fail to get revenge for all who have fallen.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|I would follow you anywhere, Your Majesty. Good luck out there.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|You as well, Dedue. You as well.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|Your Majesty... For you, I will...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|A flag of blue is flapping in the rain... It must be the Kingdom army.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Yes. It seems that King Dimitri is leading the troops himself. However, the Knights of Seiros have yet to be seen. Perhaps they have split up.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|I can't imagine that Dimitri would leave the capital to the church and face us with the Kingdom army alone. He must be planning to use the church to gain the upper hand in battle. With the rain, that must be difficult to coordinate... Still, the Knights of Seiros must be around here somewhere.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Then we should be on alert for attacks from the side and rear as well. Inform the entire army.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Imperial Soldier|Yes, sir!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Now that I think about it, the Kingdom's Army is quite different than it once was. They have taken a position of interception. In the past, the king would have introduced himself before beginning a fair fight.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|A fair fight... The words alone remind me of how he once was. Don't you agree, Professor?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Who might that be?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Oh, have you forgotten already? Dimitri often spoke of such things back at the monastery.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Dimitri?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Yes. He often spoke of such things back at the monastery.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Claude?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Of all the people in the world, why would talk of a fair fight remind you of Claude? I'm talking about Dimitri. Have you forgotten? He often spoke of such things back at the monastery.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|Well, at the present, the words fair fight do not seem to suit Dimitri anymore. He dislikes making victims of his friends, but other than that, he will do most anything these days... If he stops at nothing to continue the onslaught, I cannot imagine what will become of the battlefield.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|True. As soon as we can take our battle formation, we must advance. Dimitri, that past you cling to... I will soon free you from it.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Ah, here you are, Edelgard...at your eternal resting place. You have trampled and stolen and blinded yourself to the truth. Today, I will have vengeance for all you have done!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|With this battle, the main force of the Kingdom will be annihilated! Leave no enemy general alive. Least of all King Dimitri!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|We are uncertain of the enemy's plans, so let us advance our troops with caution. The Knights of Seiros have yet to show themselves. They will join the battle at some point. Be ready.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Kingdom General|We're first in line! Charge!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|Don't let this chance for vengeance go to waste!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|Time to join the front lines. We should all show a little loyalty from time to time, yeah?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Kingdom Soldier|Glory to the flag of the knights! Good fortune to His Majesty! Fortune...to Faerghus... Graaaaargh!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|What the— That Kingdom soldier just changed into a Demonic Beast. Did Thales... No. This is something simpler.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|This is the work of a Crest Stone... But why...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|I gave them Crest Stones from the castle vaults.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|You fool! Why did you do that?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|If we lose here, the Kingdom falls. It's our only hope.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|You call this hope?! Well, we must now claim victory so their deaths were not in vain.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|Yes, Your Majesty. I am with you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Kingdom General|Gautier reinforcements have arrived! We shall crush the Empire weaklings!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|Don't worry everyone! The reinforcements have arrived!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Reinforcements... We're in danger. We must defeat the enemy's generals before we're overwhelmed.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|This battle may turn against us if we allow any more of them to transform. We don't know which soldiers have Crest Stones. We must do away with all of them, and quickly!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Rhea|How could I be late, when I finally have the opportunity to destroy the fallen one? This rain...it is the lamentation of my mother... Observe. I shall not fail in restoring balance.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|So what are you waiting for? Let's finish this today.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|Professor! Has it really been five years? We ought to raise a glass for the occasion. Celebrate your return. Nah, I'd rather commemorate it with your death.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|Professor, there's something I should admit. I've got some regrets about how our lives have gone. I should have made a proper attempt to woo you before now. Instead, I have to kill you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|Stand down, Ingrid. I know you don't want to die here.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ingrid|I will not. I'll never ally myself with the likes of you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|Stubborn as ever. I always did like that about you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Ingrid|And you never cease to amaze me with your false flattery. Don't waste your breath.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|I was such a fool. So...this is how it ends. Forgive me, Your Majesty. I'm...going on...ahead.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Thank you, Sylvain. Until we meet again on the other side...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|It makes me so sad to fight against you, but I suppose that's how things go when you're at war. Why follow an emperor who would start such a war?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|I'm sorry, Professor. I can't join you... There are important things I must stay and protect.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Annette|Mercie...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|Now now, Annie. There's no need for that. This is a battlefield, after all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Annette|I'm so sorry... You know that, don't you? And also know that you don't have to forgive me...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|I was going to say the same thing. I'm so sorry if I cause you any pain.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Jeritza|Step back, Mercedes.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|I won't. This is the path I have chosen. It's the same for you too, Emile. Is it not? Someday, we may meet again in another life. Whenever that happens, I hope that we'll remain side by side, always...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Jeritza|My dear sister... I am sorry.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Mercedes|I'm...I'm sorry, Dimitri... I can't seem to stay...on my feet.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Forgive me, Mercedes. Were it not for me, you wouldn't have gotten caught up in all this, and you might still be alive...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|You will never understand the burden His Majesty carries on his shoulders!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|It is a shame. I really believed you would come to believe His Majesty's perspective.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|It is time. Your Majesty... I will avenge your father. You are the one true king...Dimitri. Grr... Grrrr!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Dedue! I will fight by your side until the bitter end... As long as I am with you, this lance of mine will know nothing of defeat!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|Your Majesty...you must survive...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Dedue... You fought well, my friend.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|Urghh...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Dedue... You fool...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|You will not kill one more soul. You will not steal one more thing. I will not allow it. Here and now, I stand against you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Why did you choose Edelgard, Professor? Why did you choose to walk this savage, bloody path? I cannot shake this feeling of regret... Regret that I must kill you now.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Must you continue to conquer? Continue to kill?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Must you continue to reconquer? Continue to kill in retaliation? I will not stop. There is nothing I would not sacrifice to cut a path to Fódlan's new dawn!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Enough of this madness! This future of yours is built on a foundation of corpses and tears!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Not only have you become the emperor's lap dog, but you have turned against your own people. From the depths of hell, you will regret tainting the land of Faerghus!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|You killed Rodrigue... your own father, Felix.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Felix|I said I'd cut down anyone who stood in my way. Even my father. Even my friends.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|I see. That was all I needed to hear to finally work up the resolve to kill you.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|No! Not yet... I can't die just yet...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Sylvain|Dimitri, you idiot! Retreat! Wait, your injury... No!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|Fall back, Your Majesty! We cannot lose you!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|King Dimitri! There is no retreat for the Knights of Seiros! Fight until none are left standing! Slaughter them all and send them straight to hell!  No... It can't be... There is no retreat for the Knights of Seiros! Fight until none are left standing! Slaughter them all and send them straight to hell!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|You are all damned, with no hope of salvation. For the sin of insurgency, you shall be consigned to hell!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|I once walked this world as Seiros, the warrior... and defeated the Fell King Nemesis. Now, here I stand, facing one who wields the same sword as he... The fate you have chosen is also the same as his... To die in torment upon my sword, as the very lifeblood you have forsaken spills onto the earth!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|An ancestor of the Hresvelgs, who became Adrestia's first emperor... He saved me. Supported me. Gave his all to the cause of defeating Nemesis. That I should find myself here at Tailtean, striking down his scion...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|I don't advise presumptions, Rhea. I will not die by your hand.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|How can this be? I lost to that thief?! Unacceptable!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Knight Of Seiros|Watch out, Lady Rhea! Please retreat!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|Gyhh!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|The Church of Seiros has fallen back, but we have no such luxury. Everyone, fight for your lives! Victory to Faerghus!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Edelgard! You... I will kill you! You will know the regret of my father, who was killed for you! Of my stepmother, who was slain by her own daughter! You will bow your head before all the lives you trampled for your ideals before you die in misery!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Your obsession with me is appalling. If you were a normal human, you would most certainly have died already. Farewell, King of Delusion. If only we were born in a time of peace, you might have lived a joyful life as a benevolent ruler.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|To the fires of eternity with you...El...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|Your Majesty... Your Majesty!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Stop calling me that.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|Ah, thank the... No...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Dedue... It seems I will die...before I can get revenge for everyone...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|My family, my friends, my home... Everything that truly mattered to me... I couldn't...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|You're wrong! Because of you, I was able to live on until today. You saved me. These past nine years... I am proud to have been at your side. It was a joy I never could have hoped for. Despite all, I count myself a lucky man.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dimitri|Is that so? I see... I am glad...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Dedue|You must be weary, Your Majesty. Please...rest in peace.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Church Soldier|Lady Rhea! King Dimitri has fallen in battle! The Kingdom's army has retreated! It is impossible to preserve the front line!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|Gah... Everyone withdraw immediately! Fall back to Fhirdiad! The goddess is watching over us! If we hold strong we will surely be saved!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Church Soldier|Understood! Retreat!|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Seiros|Why do you insist on being such a loathsome obstacle... You stole my mother's heart and wield the Sword of the Creator. Just like that savage King Nemesis... I swear...with these very hands... I will take her back... Until then, wait for me, dear Mother...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Rhea... She is our enemy, but I must admit that she plays her cards magnificently.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Hubert|You mean using the goddess's name in order to boost morale?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|That's true, but she also shows great skill in devising her tactics. Using the bewildered Kingdom army as a shield while she and the knights retreated... If they ran all the way back to Fhirdiad, it will be very difficult to pursue them.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Can we defeat them?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|If you're low on confidence, Professor, I'll put an end to this myself. Actually...that's what I'd like to say, but in truth I hope to confront them with you at my side.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Next time, we will end this.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Yes. Together, we'll end this once and for all.|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|For all of the lives lost in battle, by our allies and foes alike... And for Dimitri, as well...|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|For Dimitri?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|Yes. The thirst for revenge that imprisoned him was the result of my uncle's strategy. He believed that I was the cause of everything...and he lost sight of his path as king. There was nothing I could do to save him. And so, the very least I could do was--|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Byleth|Are you crying?|
FE16CrimsonFlower|17-FieldOfRevenge|Edelgard|No. The Edelgard who shed tears died many years ago. Everything that's happened...it's all just part of the ebb and flow of history. The Tragedy of Duscur, our days at the academy, Father's death, and the five years you were gone... After all of that, at long last, we're here at this point in time. I hope you'll stay by my side until the very end. It's time for humanity to take this world back.|
