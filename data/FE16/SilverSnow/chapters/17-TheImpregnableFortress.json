To have lost His Highness... How tragic. Our only solace is that Edelgard sustained severe injuries. This is all quite unexpected, but we must find a way to use this situation to our advantage. The Empire's main force has suffered a mighty blow. Edelgard will most certainly avoid the front lines.

I see. You are saying you met with Dimitri? But you could not tell if it was reality or a dream. Hm. I wonder what it could mean."}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "I'm rather curious to see what stratagem we'll devise to capture the fortress. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? But there must be one or two gaps in its defenses..."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when a fortress was a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "It's always so peaceful coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And assaulting that huge keep? That sounds hard. Oh, really, hard!

Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We'll be fine."}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "Of course you'd say that! Why'd I even ask?!"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "I heard that a staggering number of people lost their loves in the battle at Gronder. And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think about war as theater, with the stage an entire continent."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Though actors die, the show goes on?"}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must be unaffected."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "It really doesn't seem like theater."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why's that?"}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "Surprise attacks are safe with friends.

Fewer injuries."}, {"speaker": "Felix", "line": "It hasn't sunk in yet. They slaughtered the boar... I can hardly believe it. I thought he was alive all this time. He must have really hated Edelgard to lead such an ill-advised assault. Hmph. No point in feeling sorry for the poor scoundrel now."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "I've heard Dedue's passed on. Just like His Highness."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We can't know that for certain."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "That's true. I did hear that his body was never found."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Don't believe everything you hear."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "You're right. I don't think anyone's found his body, so I guess he might still be out there."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Dedue is dead?"}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "That's what I've heard. But no one's found his body."}, {"speaker": "Ashe", "line": "If, somehow, he's still alive...I hope we'll meet again."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Ya know, Professor, laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date. First, you get past her defenses...then you make your move."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's not the best analogy."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean . I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You might be right."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Ha! I knew you'd get it, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Sylvain", "line": "Anyway, you know more about tactics than me, so I don't know why I'm offering you advice."}, {"speaker": "Mercedes", "line": "Oh, Goddess, hear my prayer. Please bless the deceased with peace everlasting... And may his soul rest in tranquility. You know, I used to see him praying quite often when I would come to the cathedral at night. I wonder who it was he prayed for back then..."}, {"speaker": "Annette", "line": "Professor. They tell me my father died at Gronder. Was that... Was that really a fitting end for one such as him? I don't know. I just...don't know."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "I only know what little I overheard. But what I did hear implied that the Empire was involved in the Tragedy of Duscur. If it's true, that may explain why His Highness chose to fight the Empire. Perhaps I should have fought alongside His Highness."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Why is that?"}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Because...I too, lost someone to that tragedy--the most important person in my world."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Are you having regrets?"}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "No. Not anymore. I am where I belong."}, {"speaker": "Ingrid", "line": "Those of us still on this plane of existence will carry on the torch. The inhumane actions of the Empire must not be repeated."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Fort Merceus is old and strong. It's reputation for durability is equal to that of Arianrhod. Are you certain your plan is sufficient? It seems to be a little simplistic."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Guess we'll find out."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "That's not terrifically reassuring! Shouldn't you have more faith in your own plans?!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We'll be fine."}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "I suppose I must take you at your word, mustn't I?"}, {"speaker": "Lorenz", "line": "Incidentally, have you heard any news of Claude? I, for one, have a hard time believing he is dead. He was always a clever and tenacious sort."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If you're muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't see how you'd do that."}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Whaddya mean, how? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You can tell how your muscles are feeling?"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!"}, {"speaker": "Raphael", "line": "What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatz", "line": "It sounds like the battle at Gronder Field was pretty gruesome. We don't know for certain whether Claude's alive or dead. Maybe he's all right? I wish I could make sure somehow. But it doesn't seem possible now."}, {"speaker": "Lysithea", "line": "If Claude somehow survived, I imagine he's terribly wounded. All three forces have suffered heavy losses. We're incredibly lucky to have not been involved. This is a perfect and unique opportunity to go on the offense. Now is the time to prove ourselves, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Marianne", "line": "I never used to care whether I lived or died... But when I think of all those who died at Gronder, I realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little..."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "I like this idea of yours--dressing as Imperial soldiers so they'll let us in. But don't you wish there was one more twist in the plan? Come on, Professor, think! How could we add another wrinkle, hm?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We can dress you as the emperor."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "We could dress Seteth as a woman."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "Seteth, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be."}, {"speaker": "Hilda", "line": "On second thought, let's just stick to the plan as originally conceived. That seems safer."}, {"speaker": "Leonie", "line": "Under your leadership, we can win any battle, no matter the odds. That's what everyone's saying anyway. Hope you can keep up with our expectations, Professor."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "The battle at Gronder Field certainly took an unexpected turn, did it not? Let us press on, so as not to waste the opportunity. Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. I will make the necessary preparations. Be ready."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle... How inhuman war is--how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The Silver Maiden."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "F\u00f3dlan's Locket."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "That one is a fortress that stands at F\u00f3dlan's Throat."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The Stubborn Old General."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."}, {"speaker": "Hanneman", "line": "Seems F\u00f3dlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose..."}, {"speaker": "Manuela", "line": "Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all. And if I'm honest...sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "You're quite a tactician! Disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in, undetected. A stroke of brilliance. In a frontal attack, our losses would be tremendous. With this strategy, we can really snatch victory from the jaws of...deceit!"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's a good point."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? Deceit? Again?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "That's a bad pun."}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!"}, {"speaker": "Catherine", "line": "I hardly recognize everyone... Their faces have changed so much. More experience in the eyes, and more pain. I'm glad that they're stronger, but I hate to think they've all become hardened killers. Look after them, OK? Try to keep 'em on the straight-and-narrow."}, {"speaker": "Shamir", "line": "Did you give the ridiculous order to prepare Imperial armor for every one of our troops? I've reached out through all my channels, but there are limits to these things. I'll have to recruit an entire town's worth of people if I ever plan on making enough."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You could detect enemy movements in advance."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful at least."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "You could find our targets quicker than anyone."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too."}, {"speaker": "Anna", "line": "A Class reunion on the battlefield? That's...bleak. That must've been so hard on everyone. You gotta keep looking after them all. I mean, they still look to you for guidance, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Gatekeeper", "line": "Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone..."}], "intro": [{"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "We are just about to pass through Gronder Field. We should be in view of Fort Merceus soon.
