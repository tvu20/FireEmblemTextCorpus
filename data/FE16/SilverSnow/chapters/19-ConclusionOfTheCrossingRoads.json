It is probable that Rhea is within the castle walls. We must defeat Edelgard and rescue Rhea in one fell swoop, no matter what stands in our way."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I don't want to kill Edelgard."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Perhaps we can walk the same path as Edelgard..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "She is one of your students. I understand your desire for a path to peace. But she will never bend to our will. You do understand that, do you not? We have no choice but to kill her."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "We have already killed Hubert. Now is no time to hesitate."}, {"speaker": "Caspar", "line": "She has it coming! After all, she started this war!"}, {"speaker": "Bernadetta", "line": "Someone has to stop her, and that someone is us!"}, {"speaker": "Linhardt", "line": "As her former classmates, I feel we owe it to her to try talking it out."}, {"speaker": "Petra", "line": "This battle will be a deciding one. I am believing that it is her wish to be facing us."}, {"speaker": "Dorothea", "line": "Poor Edie... Professor, wherever you lead, I'll follow."}, {"speaker": "Cyril", "line": "I... I'll fight with all I got to save Lady Rhea!"}, {"speaker": "Alois", "line": "In the name of the Knights of Seiros, we'll bring the hammer down on the Imperial army!"}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "The lives of Lady Rhea and everyone here are more important than all else. I shall be prepared."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "I leave this mission in your hands. Say the word, and we shall begin!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "They've made it into the palace, but it's actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them. Defeating them all will turn the tide of the war instantly. Taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option. Everyone! Prepare for a bitter struggle! Victory to the Adrestian Empire!"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "The throne room is tightly locked. But wherever there are locks, there are also keys."}, {"speaker": "Dedue", "line": "So close... Must press on..."}, {"speaker": "Imperial Soldier", "line": "Infiltrators! Kill them!"}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "I must confess I never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far. I don't mean to belittle your skills, Professor, but you've far surpassed my expectations."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Block off the stairwells! Stop their reinforcements from getting through!"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Well done! Their reinforcements are cut off."}, {"speaker": "Edelgard", "line": "Clever tactic.

I have a letter. The Imperial general asked me to deliver this to my instructor."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Who is it from? Hurry up, Professor. Read it at once."}, {"speaker": "Ferdinand", "line": "It is from...Hubert? Though he has left this world, he is reaching out through this letter..."}, {"speaker": "Hubert", "line": "If you are reading this letter, that means I have perished. As Her Majesty would never surrender to another, I can only assume she has fallen as well. It greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass... That said, as the survivors, I must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead. You must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark. I am sure you must recall Monica and Tomas."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "What Hubert has written here... I cannot... No, I know it must be true. And if that is the case, then all else makes sense now. I must speak with Rhea. It seems our battle is not over just yet. Those who slither in the dark... We must kill every last one of them, or F\u00f3dlan will never again know peace."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "They are allies of Monica and Tomas... Correct? The ones who were after my blood. And also the ones who destroyed Fort Merceus with that mysterious light..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "We shall discuss this more after we have rescued Rhea."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "You... You have come to save me... Is this... Is this a dream? I have longed to see you again... all this time... Is it truly you?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Seteth, Flayn... You are here as well... Thank you for supporting the professor, and for rescuing me."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Rhea... I am overjoyed that you are unharmed. I could not stand losing another of our kind."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Yes... I am reminded of the past... of reuniting in Enbarr..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "It is truly nostalgic. I would love nothing more than to lose ourselves in memories of the old days, but... I must tell you something, Rhea. We have received incredible news, albeit from the Empire. They have told us the identity of our enemy. Those who slither in the dark... It is time for us to stop hiding the truth about the goddess\u2014the progenitor god. The truth about us. It is time for us to tell the people everything."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Those who slither in the dark..."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "We are told they despise the children of the goddess, as well as those who live above ground. They are planning something horrible."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Please, tell the professor everything about these vile people. There must be things that only you know."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "I understand. Dear child... I will now tell you all that I know. It is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of F\u00f3dlan since ancient times. I am sure you have heard the stories of a man named Nemesis..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The King of Liberation..."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "The wielder of the Sword of the Creator..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Nemesis, the King of Liberation... The man who received the Sword of the Creator from the goddess and became a hero. However..."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "Nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits. He plundered the Holy Tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god. When Nemesis appeared in Zanado some time later, he already wielded the Sword of the Creator."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "In Zanado?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "The Red Canyon. We journeyed there five years ago. Do you recall?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "How did he get the Sword of the Creator?"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "The legend that the goddess gifted him the sword so that he could fight the wicked gods...is false. That story was created after the fact."}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "I do not know how Nemesis obtained the sword, or why he appeared in Zanado. But he used that sword to massacre the people there. The children of the progenitor god. From their corpses he gained even more power, and brought war to F\u00f3dlan... A mere bandit like Nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "It was surmised that someone was collaborating with Nemesis, and there was a massive investigation to uncover who it was. But the truth was never discovered. I am now certain that his accomplices were Those who slither in the dark. And this time, they have utilized the imperial army to send F\u00f3dlan back into the flames of war..."}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "So, Edelgard has made a temporary alliance with them in order to achieve her own aims... Professor, we must journey to Shambhala and stop them!"}, {"speaker": "Rhea", "line": "You must not allow F\u00f3dlan's bloody history... the Red Canyon Tragedy... to repeat itself..."}]}
