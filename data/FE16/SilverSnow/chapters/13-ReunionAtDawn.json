Well if you don't wish to tell me, I won't persuade you.

Where were you, and what were you doing all of those years?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "I was sleeping."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "You slept for five years... In that case, I suppose there is nothing more to say. You should know that Rhea also disappeared after the battle at Garreg Mach five years ago.

They have yet to find a trace."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Was she captured by the Imperial army?"}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "Was she murdered by the Imperial army?"}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "It is possible. However, the Empire has not made any such statement as of yet. Even if that were the truth, there is no way for us to confirm. We have searched all over, but we have reached an impasse. Unless we do something, our efforts to find Rhea and rebuild the Church will be stalled indefinitely. Our opportunity to strike back is close at hand. Sadly, we are short on military strength. However, now we have you. Do you recall what Rhea told you five years ago? She asked for you to take her place should anything ever happen to her.

Well, it would be easier to just show you. Come with me to the Holy Mausoleum. I realize that since you have been slumbering for so long, you have no idea what has transpired in the various territories. Allow me to explain... After the Battle of Garreg Mach, there was a change of regime in the Kingdom. House Blaiddyd suffered a series of brutal massacres, which claimed the lives of Dimitri and Regent Rufus. The Kingdom capital fell and was absorbed into the Empire as the Faerghus Dukedom, which is now under Cornelia's control. Some still resist the Empire. As of now, Rodrigue of House Fraldarius is at the center of such efforts. In the Alliance, Claude leads the faction that opposes the Empire, and Lorenz leads those who have sided with them. The front lines are ever in motion, but the war effort has stagnated overall. In short, both the Kingdom and the Alliance have been swallowed up by the Empire and are on the verge of collapse. We must gather our generals and soldiers under your command and reverse this dire situation."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "Flayn, look! The professor has returned to us!"}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "Hm? What do you mean... Oh! Goodness! It really IS you, Professor! I cannot believe you are still of this world! We were so worried we would never see you again."}, {"speaker": "Byleth", "line": "What are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Flayn", "line": "I forgot something important at the Holy Mausoleum... I told my brother I had to go back for it no matter what, and so here I am..."}, {"speaker": "Seteth", "line": "After we finished here, we were going to continue our search for Rhea. But now that you are here, things have changed. We must not waste this opportunity. We shall send word to the knights scattered all across the land. The time has come for the Knights of Seiros to return to action. We are counting on you, Professor!"}]}
