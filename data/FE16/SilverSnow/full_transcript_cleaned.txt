the ambitions of those who slither in the dark are forever shattered with shambhalas destruction but in the process rhea is grievously injured what fate awaits her and who will bear the weigh of fódlan on their shoulders
ugh 
hang in there lady rhea
she needs help hurry
thats a serious injury  its a miracle that shes even alive right now ill do what i can but 
five years ago when this place fell an enormous white creature appeared on the battlefield it was the immaculate one  rhea
she tried to save me 
what you already knew rheas true identity
thinking back i suppose so
i see in the past the children of the goddess were all able to change their appearance just like the immaculate one i lost that power long ago but it seems rhea has not
youre one of the children of the goddess
is it not obvious flayn and i both are we have protected garreg mach and all of fódlan for a very long time but now  the light of rheas life is on the verge of disappearing from this world it is flickering  i do not know if she can be saved even if she is i wonder if she will remain unchanged 
professor are you able to carry on rheas work as the protector of fódlan and as leader of the people who live here  you must defend the people guide them and teach them join their hearts and spread peace across the whole of the land
it is not as though you must become the archbishop but fódlan needs leadership it is up to you to govern this war torn land
i 
you need not reply right this moment we will strive to heal rhea as best we can
perhaps it would help to seek counsel from our friends at the monastery about this matter
i agree when your mind is made up please speak with me i would ask that you give me your decision in the presence of rhea herself
well done professor we have brought the war to a magnificent conclusion the empire alliance and kingdom are no more nor are there any factions that could blindside us and cause conflict now it falls to us to rule fódlan and bring about an era of peace and prosperity you would be a fine choice for the first ruler of this new era i sincerely believe that
thank you
so your heart is already set on it excellent in that case congratulations are in order
im not sure
well if you are unsure what does that say about everybody elses chances
i will follow you professor i aim to be a great and respectable noble
congratulations on a job well done professor i do hope lady rhea is well is it true what i heard you will be taking over her post would that make you archbishop or higher still am i in the company of the future ruler of fódlan
either would be a hassle
i agree imagine all that responsibility until now youve always fought with all of us by your side bring ruler would be a much lonelier job though i am certain you would excel
the latter i will rule over fódlan
so youve already decided  such proactive thinking is the hallmark of a good ruler
me i have no interest in a leadership role im happy to spend the rest of my days studying and napping
all  right we did it professor we really gave it to em out there with all the fighting and hardships i dont know how we did it  but im glad we made it through together
me too
now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler thats gonna be a fun coronation
it was a lot to push through
sorry if i made your life more difficult none of that matters anymore though right now all we gotta do is make you the new ruler thats gonna be a fun coronation
phew  its all over professor though i am worried about lady rhea  but still fódlan is united and those terrible people lurking in the dark have finally been destroyed looks like its the dawn of a wonderful new era of blissful seclusion for bernie
that wont do
wh what why not hey that better not be your first official decree youre going to ask for my help again arent you oh why
suit yourself
woo hoo you finally did it bernie now take your reward of eternal peace and quiet
finally an end to the fighting have you ever felt happier ive worried that i might not live to see this day but here we are and everything is going to be ok isnt it huh my heart feels like its ready to burst im so full of happiness yet i feel a sense of loss too 
we did lose a lot
yes we certainly did but we managed to keep a great many things safe as well
we protected more than we lost
i agree i suppose if i think of those who are gone as the people who ensured our freedom it hurts less
please do what you can to keep the peace so we never have to face such awful times again
war has been ended i will now be returning to brigid i hope in the new fódlan brigid can be accepted with friendship when my professor becomes the leader i think that will have a possibility please choose well
same to you
yes now i must be packing
im not sure yet 
is that the truth i will be waiting for your decision i will be packing while you are thinking
its over what will you do i heard you intend to lead
im not sure
you shouldnt need that long to decide make up your mind
im more interested in what youll do
well if you do choose to lead i might like to work for you but first ill go back to the old faerghus territory where my father and my old friends once lived i need to pay respects put flowers on their graves
well it took a long while for us to get here but we did it the war is finally over weve been through a lot together havent we let me just say its truly been an honor
the same to you
im flattered to hear you say do
oh cut it out
hey come on i mean it theres nothing to be embarrassed about
for whatever its worth i think youd make a great monarch and id support you every step of the way
ah yow she didnt have to slap me that hard oh professor its you whats up need something
lovers quarrel again
i dunno if id call us lovers exactly not yet anyway its was just a dinner invite
dont need anything but 
heh you worried i might cause trouble again nah i just invited a girl out to dinner
all fighting and no loving makes sylvain a rusty boy well i can get back in practice now peacetime is the best for love  nobody dying nobody getting hurt except me apparently if youre gonna be the ruler you need to keep the peace going so i can catch up on my love life
i heard a rumor that youre going to take over for lady rhea
it hasnt been decided
oh so the rumor was really true i hope you accept i dont think theres anyone else who could do it
thats the plan
so its already been decided thats very admirable of you professor
you have nothing to worry about were here to help you if you need anything at all well support you no matter what path you choose to follow
is lady rhea ok she was quite weakened to start and then she took all those heavy injuries  i dont want to imagine it but what will happen if lady rhea passes away like this
well cross that bridge if we come to it
i suppose youre right
im sure shell be fine
yes im praying every day that shell get well as soon as possible
anyhow  youre going to be the ruler professor its so strange to think of for some reason
can it really be are we truly at peace to think that my days will not be spent debating war tactics and preparing for battles it doesnt quite feel real now that we are finally at peace im not quite sure what to do with myself
just take it easy
that sounds challenging for how easy it must actually be
maybe you should think about the future now
thinking of the future has never been my forte
as long as i have a routine in place for myself i can find contentment
the day is ours professor and this victory will ensure our names are immortalized in history or perhaps this is but the opening chapter in the tale they will write of our glory after all if you are to rule this reunited land surely there is bound to be a place for me at your side
absolutely
i read your mind didnt i fear not i will not fail to rise to the occasion
nothings decided yet
is that so it seems to me that everyone has already assumed you would take the position
regardless your decision will have an impact on my future so be sure to make it a good one
hey professor i was just thinking i might go train i know the wars over but that doesnt mean i can stop working my muscles
that makes sense
im glad you see it my way i always knew you were a smart one
you should work on other things too
really i wouldnt know where to start but 
theres no harm in keeping up with my training
after all thats happened to lady rhea all of the stuff with solon and the others and everything thats happened with you professor  theres still a lot i dont understand please teach me professor  everything you know everything youve learned
ok
thank you oh thank you
if i get the chance 
if its at all possible i hope youll speak about it not just to me but to everyone else as well i think everyone should know what happened here if were going to build a new united fódlan thats absolutely crucial
those who slither in the dark will never harm anyone again theyre finally done for thank you professor finally i feel some vindication for what ive gone through
no thank you lysithea
ah professor ever the modest one i do like that aspect of you
keep up the good work
uh sure thing
as long as im of use here im happy to stick around professor
and with that we can finally enjoy a time of peace im honored to have fought by your side even if you havent made plans yet i know youll do your best whatever your future may hold
youve grown much stronger
if true thats all thanks to you and our allies
youve become quite the optimist
i never wouldve dreamed my heart could have grown this way
please let me know if theres anything more i can do
hey professor the war is finally really definitely over now right were not gonna find out there was some evil shadowy figure hiding behind the subterranean guys are we
who knows
well whatever no matter what comes i know we can triumph in the end
i dont think so
ah thats good though to be honest theres not much that would surprise me at this point 
i feel invincible a nice perk of being your student dont you think
well we both made it and we avenged jeralt too cant say it gets any better than that youve got a lot of work ahead of you i hear people want you to govern dont they
its a hassle
yeah sadly this isnt the kind of burden i can take off your hands
its a dilemma
well at the end of the day its your decision just take your time think it through
youve got to consider it carefully so you dont have any regrets whatever you choose though just know that im here for you
we did it captain
make sure youve got no regrets
at last the day is upon us the captain would be pleased dont you think leonie
definitely and hed be proud of the professor too
it seems like our efforts have been rewarded it was certainly a long difficult struggle to get here
it was oh jeralt  we worked so hard for this
uh hello
whaaaaaah
aaah how long have you been standing there
er ahem whether or not you choose to succeed lady rhea we will forever be by your side
yeah well be here no matter what you decide but make sure you think it through you dont want to have any regrets
well is your mind made up
no
i understand just know that we are applying all our power right now toward healing rhea you should take this opportunity to speak with everyone i am certain it will do you good
yes
i have faith in lady rheas convalescence but even so what she needs now is rest and while she is recovering somebody must watch over fódlan there is no one more fit to wear such a mantle than you professor that is what i believe i do not doubt the others feel the same
shambhala  an underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess strange phenomena driven by a source totally alien to the crests that we understand most unsettling could it be magic some manner of technology i would like to know the truth of it all very much so i want to know their history their knowledge why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy
well i dont know
no i suppose you wouldnt  it seems we will have to excavate shambhala to know more although i heard you will be the ruler here should i ask your permission to proceed with the dig
life can be tough you know but if youve got your friends to help you through it can be a lot easier maybe you butt heads sometimes but thats ok thats how you build bonds right and ive got friends professor plenty of those its true love that seems to have passed me by
you should relax
relax im relaxed
theres still hope
but where is my true love to be found where is my ray of hope
time to give up
yeah  im starting to figure thats the most realistic option
at this point im just hoping you stay single too then at least we can share each others misery
jeralt  weve done it weve finally brought this creaky old ship ashore the fight was long and bitter but finally i can lay down my burden
uh hello
whaaaaah its you dont creep up like a ghost next time announce yourself er ahem whether or not you choose to succeed lady rhea i will forever be by your side you should live your life however you want thats what the captain would say i think
lady rhea stopped the forces that threatened to destroy fódlan shes trying to realize her own dream of peace isnt that enough cant you let her rest if youre the only person whos fit to replace her you should just do it im sure lady rhea wishes for that too right i cant think of anyone whos more well suited to the job
the wars finally over  i have to admit even i got a little emotional rheas condition doesnt look good theres nothing to do now but wait more importantly are you serious about becoming fódlans new ruler
im not sure
its pretty sudden either way do what you think is best
i am
you made up your mind pretty quickly either way do what you think is best
professor do you figure lady rhea will be ok she will wont she i dont care one bit wholl succeed lady rhea cause nobodys gonna need to shes gonna be happy and healthy again youll see
i can tell that things will settle down soon enough gotta get back to slinging wares and making moolah and hopefully no more messes to spoil it after this 
greetings professor nothing to report say how is the archbishop faring the soldiers and citizens are all concerned just when we thought peace had finally arrived  whats to become of fódlan
sweet child  you have finally come  i am so happy it does my heart well to see you here safe and sound
have you made your decision professor thankfully rhea has survived her trying ordeal however  there is no telling how much longer her light will continue to shine
professor have you decided will you become the next ruler of fódlan
 
before i hear your answer i shall fulfill the promise i made to you you will know the truth about your identity  i will hold nothing back i  created you and within you is the crest stone of the progenitor god  i hid the crest stone within your heart in order to revive her sweet child  i am sorry i wanted to see her  see my mother  even if it meant doing that which is forbidden
what does it all mean
i thought that i could regain all i had lost if only i could revive my mother  and so i tried to bring her back by creating a body and then burying a crest stone within it a young woman i created  my twelfth try after much heartache  was a failure she grew up lacking the conscience of the progenitor god and fell in love with the captain of the knights of seiros in time she became pregnant  but she and the child were not able to survive the birth the child she bore was not breathing and she herself was in grave danger the new mother pleaded with me to take the crest stone of the progenitor god from her own body and place it within the baby if i had done nothing both mother and child would have died and so i granted her final wish as she had hoped the baby started breathing again  the new life was saved your life sweet child
 
well before that i had saved jeralts life using the power of my blood that means you are the child of a mother born of the progenitor gods crest stone and a father who carried my own blood i knew deep in my heart that you would be capable of housing the conscience of the progenitor god i was right  and yet she merely gifted her power to you and then disappeared once more my dearest wish did not come true  but here you are you alone wield the power of the progenitor god and now i must ask you to use that power to save this world you must 
what  no  arrgh
rhea rhea
what is wrong please calm yourself rhea
graaargh
is the power of the crest taking over her body why is this happening
seteth its terrible white beasts have appeared all over garreg mach its hard to believe but there have been reports that the priests and knights have been changing form
white beasts  are they the ones rhea shared her blood and stones with
seteth demonic beasts are heading this way
they are after rhea  professor our situation is dire if we do nothing fódlan will be destroyed by a rampaging immaculate one and these children of hers there is only one way to stop this we  we must  damn it we have no choice but to kill the immaculate one  to kill rhea
though showing brief signs of recovery even rheas strength has its limits having changed form to the immaculate one she is unable to control her power as if in response priests and knights who are directly related to rhea by blood change into white beasts themselves facing this unexpected threat the resistance army prepares for its final battle to save fódlan
with shambhala in ruins the five year war is finally at an end and a new age of peace has arrived not long for this world rhea wishes to discuss fódlans future with youyou but all is not well 
it is kept secret but there is a certain rite that all initiates to high office in the church must undergo in this rite one pledges to serve the goddess and in return receives a crest stone fragment and blood the ones who have transformed alongside rhea just now are the ones who have accepted those gifts they will shield rhea  the immaculate one i should say  with their very lives but if we do not strike her down fódlan will have no future to arms
surrounded already it seems the white beasts are those in whom rheas blood flows strongest until we get rid of them we will not be able to so much as touch rhea
damn after all thats happened why do we have to kill lady rhea
isnt the fighting already over why do we have to do this to lady rhea
the immaculate one we cannot afford to lose here whoever our foe may be
stop any damage to the immaculate one will only be transferred to those beasts
it is seeming that my understanding of fódlan tradition is insufficient what is happening
it is too dangerous to approach her now capture the southern stronghold first to seal the beasts away
theyre coming one by one from the southern stronghold if we do not capture it there will be more
let us turn our attention to the immaculate one
this is it the final battle
graaaargh
rhea not even i have seen this form
well thats something isnt it a shame we must kill her consider the research potential 
i will inherit the pride of nabatea rest in peace by sothiss side
rhea  how tragic but there is no time to waste she must be stopped
lady rhea  with my sword i will put an end to your suffering
this is me paying ya back no matter what ill stop lady rhea
rhea please
youre here mother 
a rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for fódlan rheas wild rampage was put to an end averting what could have the greatest crisis in the history of fódlan after five and a half years of war a new age was set to begin the empire kingdom and alliance all political structures that had once shaped the continent were gone a unified nation began to take shape under the watchful eye of the church of seiros the churchs new leader became a champion of the people working tirelessly to help them overcome the horrors of war and to carve a path towards reconstruction just as saint seiros tended to those who suffered in wars of the past fódlans new ruler embraced their role as mother of all life and arbiter of every soul
/***EOF***/
the resistance army successfully takes fort merceus their victory celebrations are cut short however when javelins of light pierce the sky and destroy much of the fort with nowhere else to go the resistance army withdraws to garreg mach under the guise of surrender they secretly prepare for a surprise attack on the imperial capital
it seems the preparations for our invasion of enbarr are advancing smoothly all has been laid out so we can move swiftly to the necessary locations until the time comes please try to keep your spirits up
i understand
there is something else  i have heard that rhea is potentially being held captive in the capital the information could not be confirmed nor even properly sourced but even still  we cannot ignore the possibility please bear that in mind
if its true well find her
yes we must not let anything get in the way of rescuing her
i dont believe it
do not say that to receive any information at all is surely a boon if it is true we must not let anything let in the way of rescuing her
were finally heading to enbarr the capital city of the empire  so many memories there 
oh yeah so youve been there before
oh um yes though it was a very long time ago
a very long time you must have been really young im surprised you remember
the main stage of the mittelfrank opera company is in the capital  i hope no one from the opera gets swept up in the coming chaos 
there are many buildings straight out of the history books in enbarr i hope they remain unharmed 
youre worried about the buildings what about the people youre an odd one lin
i am also worried about the people im sure my father is in a palace in the capital
many people reside in enbarr so we must take care to avoid needless casualties
i dont think edelgard cares much for avoiding casualties so thats probably impossible i bet well be fighting until one side or the other is completely destroyed
bernie you should be staying away from thoughts like that we will be defeating her with our full power our enemy has great strength but we will not be losing
i could not agree more remember even if our surprise attack works a force even greater than all of our troops combined awaits us in the capital zero casualties is always the goal but we must not underestimate the situation at hand
still we must not hold ourselves to the same twisted morality that she does after all we are here to stop her not to follow her down her dark path we all choose to fight back we are all in this together
youre right flayn weve got to try our hardest
a different path from edelgard 
there is no stopping her the only way to end this is to kill her
our choice  flayn your words are wonderful and full of bravery
lets go we cant lose
the situation is dire and so i will do what must be done
i am certain that if we can join our strength we can win this battle without losing a single soul
professor at last the end is nigh i love the empire part of me wants it to survive but i know that is not reasonable the empires time has come what we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild fódlan and rule it as a single nation nonetheless it saddens me that we will not have an adrestian emperor 
they used to call enbarr the city of seiros  to assault it together with the knights is surreal if seiros were alive today i wonder what she might make of our war  in enbarr there was once a southern church and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it a hundred years ago the southern church became entangled in an insurrection until five years ago the empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another
its such a relief that weve made it this far without having to fight my father
youll have to face him at some point
hey dont try and scare me
it sounds like youre scared
you bet im scared the imperial army hasnt lost a single battle with my father on the field
if he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault we might lose i better make peace with that
professor my um my mother might be in the city i dont have many good memories of her if im being honest but shes dearer to me than my father if you happen to see her please make sure shes not caught up in all the fighting shes only a civil servant so hopefully she takes a cue from her bernie and stays inside
the whole of the capital is going to be a battleground the city has such a long heritage  even so perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once but we cant let the commonfolk get hurt we should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town
five years ago edelgard said a thing to me brigid is a vassal of the empire but she also said i always have the freedom to be choosing whether i am with or not with her i will become the ruler of brigid so she said i must make my own path so now my path and her path will be colliding
the death knight is no ordinary knight i will prey upon him i will quench my blades thirst with his blood his focus is on fighting you im sure but mine will be the last face he sees
those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in fort merceus
so enbarr the capital of the empire its finally time i never thought id live this long its like any battle really  stay calm stay focused dont give in to the enemy or your own fear
you seem more serious than usual
hey im always serious when im chasing girls or preparing for battle always serious thats me 
well get through this together
striking down the empire is my offering to his highness heh i left the kingdom  what am i saying
its been so long since ive been to the imperial capital i used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother i never thought my return would be like this 
enbarr  never in my wildest dreams did i imagine id be returning like this of course most of the nobles in the empire make their home in the capital in the kingdom all nobles live in their own domains so if the capital is attacked it doesnt affect them directly what will happen to the imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield
once this battle is over what will become of faerghus and fódlan
peace will reign
peace you say it sounds so foreign so unattainable but maybe just maybe
what would you like to see happen
my hope is for a world of peace a world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past  the stuff of legends i believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new better world so the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil the better we must win professor there is no alternative here i wont allow for anything else
i have been to the kingdom capital before but never to the imperial one they say it is the biggest city in all fódlan so we will no doubt have many civilians to worry about i hope we can preserve the city if it is destroyed in the battle the people will face hardship i would say we should avoid the use of excessive force but i suppose that hinges upon the empires terms of engagement
were heading up to enbarr next i hope i make it back safe so i can tell my little sis about it i hear they got a neat opera house there where manuela used to perform what was it called again
mitreflanc opera company
nah that doesnt sound right
mittelfrank opera company
ah thats the one
nah that doesnt sound right
my little sis always goes on about how much shed like to see them perform i know we cant see a show but do you think we can at least see the building
were about to put the finishing touches on this war i wonder how fódlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction i cant wait to see it on the other hand im terrified of what the future might hold who knows if ill survive the assault on the capital
invading the capital and smashing the empire i wonder if doing so could really end this war care to share your thoughts professor
i think itll end the war
you say that with such confidence i want to believe that its true
i dont know
perhaps you feel similarly to me the whole mess puts me on edge
although for now better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand
so if we win the war will you become the ruler of fódlan
that might be the case
i dont really know
you seem unsure so i guess anything is possible for what its worth i think youd make a good ruler you could bring peace to the land 
fighting in the capital ugh and were fighting against edelgard double ugh but with you leading us professor i know well win yeah wahoo fighting im a little scared to be honest im just shouting to relieve the tension but ill be fine
were finally going to the capital this will be my chance to avenge captain jeralt once we smash the empire im sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace
i think youre right
who can say for sure
monica killed captain jeralt for the flame emperor and the flame emperor was edelgard i know that the future of all fódlan rests on this battle nothing else is more important but for me this is personal for captain jeralts sake im going to give it all ive got and more
rhea will be somewhere in the city i wonder if she can sense us coming if we are able to save her then i expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you are you prepared for that
i am
excellent
i dont think im ready yet
that is unfortunate well you must become ready
the battle will soon be upon us let us both be at our best for what is to come
i was born in enbarr my mother and father met in a church there not too long after i was brought into the world i do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place it is most regrettable
enbarrs streets are paved with unhappy memories professor ive avoided the darned place ever since i abandoned my nobility swore never to return now here we are to return in this manner  well i cant say it is something i ever imagined
in the opera actors came and went all the time but the people behind the scenes would stay forever ill bet id know a few of them now even after all these years i wonder if theyve left the capital i certainly hope so 
here we are facing the final battle with the empire its been a long difficult struggle we have to get lady rhea back and we have to crush the empire in the name of captain jeralt i dont know what comes next but we can sort out those details later
looks like were nearing the end of this struggle im sure lady rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her
probably
i was just kidding pay me no mind
i doubt it
oof  you dont mince your words try being a bit more mindful of other peoples feelings
lady rheas not waiting for me i know no matter how much i might wish she were shes waiting for you
ten years ago dagda and brigid attacked the empire from the west their final target was the capital but they were countered at a port town long before they reached their destination i guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs all things considered
whenever i think about how well be seeing lady rhea real soon i get happy and really get cleaning well get there for sure right well see her again
well meet her for sure
we dont know for sure
i just gotta believe lady rhea is waiting for us in the capital  we just have to find her
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report momentums really picking up for this final battle huh even im starting to feel tense me enbarrs history goes back 1400 years that even predates the founding of the empire its one of the sacred sites of the seiros faith so its a pretty big deal but hey no need to worry about the monastery while youre fighting the final battle ive got it covered ill defend it to my last
the resistance army having finished preparations for their surprise attack on the imperial capital departs garreg mach along the way they join forces with ally soldiers who had already secretly entered empire territory together they storm the streets of enbarr giving the imperial army no time to counterattack
vastly outnumbered by imperial forces it becomes clear that a surprise attack followed by a short and decisive battle is the only path to victory with this in mind you stealthily approach enbarr the imperial capital
there it is the greatest city in all of fódlan  enbarr the imperial capital deep within are the palace grounds where the emperor resides if rhea is being kept here she must be within the palace  we shall tear through the city streets capture the palace and kill edelgard at last
if the enemy spots us theyll call back any troops deployed in other areas we have no leeway here
lady rhea please be safe
now we must organize our reserve troops and invade enbarr
it appears that hubert and the death knight are in command of the empires forces in the city weve not the time to deal with them one by one split up and take both on at once
its here the crest of flames banner there on the other side of the canal
uninvited guests i see heh lets ensure they receive a warm welcome ready the artillery prepare to attack rocks arrows magic  rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave reinforcements will fly in shortly defend the heavy weapons until they arrive
our first wave of reinforcements is here it will not be long until the next
their reinforcements just keep on coming we need to secure the artillery that will make it easier to deal with them
we have reinforcements coming in from another direction deploy them as soon as they arrive
that church  it looks familiar i believe that is where my parents first met
ah  that church ive such memories of that place from a time before i was seteth
has it really been so long since i was in that opera house couldnt have imagined any of this back then
the battle is nearing the opera house i hope everyone in the company is safe
we have finally made it i am sure that edelgard is hiding in the palace awaiting our arrival 
who is that is that not dedue
i heard knights had arrived i came here to find you
how long have you been in enbarr
i arrived not long after the battle at gronder field i am here to kill edelgard
what are you doing in enbarr
im waiting for a chance to kill edelgard i have not yet been blessed with the opportunity
will you now fight alongside us
we fight for different objectives i swore to offer edelgards head to his highness but  should i fail i will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you this is the information i have gathered during my time in hiding here it includes details about the inside of the castle theres more the archbishop is being held in the palace i do not know the exact location
indeed just as we suspected
it seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the empire
ive done what i came here to do farewell
wait a moment
he is gone i believe we should make our way there as well
/***EOF***/
the resistance army having received reinforcements from house daphnel in ailell is finally ready to unleash its invasion on the imperial territories
the messenger we sent to claude has returned it seems he will be initiating the plan immediately we will advance when house riegans forces move out we will take the great bridge of myrddin with minimal casualties and in doing so initiate all out war with the empire we must prepare for battle professor
someday well take it back
thank you professor i will not give in not until i have restored my noble pride
taking it back would be difficult
yes i know it would be difficult but i will not give in
im sure theyre not 
if i were in charge its what i would do
probably
i knew it war makes people crazy huh
the airmid river separates the empire and alliance its the largest river in fódlan sometimes itll flood when theres lots of rain but  at least the land gets some extra water
sounds like youre learning
isnt that a little pessimistic
no its not ok
makes sense a commander running away would be terrible for morale
i wouldnt blame you
really if something happens will you keep me safe
if we can suppress this myrddin we can invade into the empire right i was in the empire now i will be an enemy  i am having strange feelings it is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy 
we have the empire and alliance situations under control the problem is faerghus the eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the dukedom but ive heard nothing about that conflict as of late its strange i havent heard much from my father either i cant help but find this silence unsettling 
its thanks to you that im here now i owe you professor you saved my life i swear ill do all i can to repay that debt
i had an encounter with lord gwendal  how many years ago was it back before the academy i met this girl who i fell madly in love with and her dad tried to kill me i suppose he just tried to scare me but i was sure i was gonna die oh yeah her dad lord gwendal crazy right i never thought id seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle i kind of dont know how to make sense of it
lady rhea is in the empire isnt she we should hurry up and find her so many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried  i want to ease their minds as soon as possible professor lets work together to find her
next we face the great bridge of myrddin  we actually crossed it a long time ago do you remember it was five whole years ago
during the battle of the eagle and lion
it seems like so long ago doesnt it its odd how fast time flies 
when we went to remire village
what are you talking about professor it was on the way to the battle of the eagle and lion
everyone was still friends then after the fighting we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses i often wish we could go back to those peaceful days 
so that was judith just as id heard of her she was an upstanding person the same daphnel blood runs through my veins and yet i feel as though i am nothing like her i am but a phantom of what could be 
youre actually quite alike
you think so wow thank you
true you do differ
if only i could be even half of who she is
thanks to all that food from judith im full for once ive got so much energy let me at that great bridge of myrddin ill bust it down myself oh but then how do we cross
the great bridge of myrddin isnt just a bridge it has the features of a fortress i believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the adrestian empire in other words its even older than the monastery so if we occupy the great bridge well have to search it from top to bottom
im sure you know this already but house ordelia is aligned with the empire they face the empire from across the river similar to the gloucesters even so i refuse to yield to the empire a second time the empire did unthinkable things to my family and to me the only option here is winning professor you must promise we will overcome the empire
legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged ailell i was reminded of that when i saw it  up professor do you think those legends are true
its likely
i think so too i dont know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger but 
yes and itll likely happen again
oh i suppose you may be right theres no way to be sure it wont 
there are still so many things we dont understand in this world
it looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town i guess they feel safe now that you and the knights of seiros have returned peddlers have become more common too so therell be food and supplies available after being run down for all those years its really becoming livable again
things would have gotten a lot more interesting if judith had joined us i only spoke to her briefly but i really liked her i hope someday i can be as strong kind and levelheaded as her
if rhea really is in the empire then we must defeat the imperial army by any means necessary the people at large are just as concerned for rheas safety as we are the sooner we can settle all our unease the better
judith is a wonderful person so strong and confident as well looking upon her i was sharply reminded of my mother
did she look similar
not in the slightest rather it is her way of being  her demeanor brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
did she act similar
very much so both brilliantly bright and positive like a warm ray of light
i lost my mother long ago i miss her desperately
the battle at ailell was a tactical marvel you grow stronger with each passing day where does you talent end and your crests power begin are they one and the same i wonder most intriguing yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions given the situation it is quite unfortunate i did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out so much unknown now i fear i will not have those answers even by conflicts end so very frustrating
oh hello there professor did you need something from me it doesnt look like youre wounded or anything you just looking for someone to talk to
yes
i thought so well im here for you making you feel better is my top priority
no
come on now you dont have to be shy helping you feel better is important to me
whether its physical pain or worries of the heart you can come to me for anything professor
so lady rhea was in the empire all this time glad as i am that judith told us i wish we had known this five years ago we spent all that time spread out over fódlan searching for the archbishop and you it was a mistake to abandon the monastery to leave it in ruins now were paying for that mistake
id heard of the hero of daphnel but that was the first time ive met her in person shes the head of a prestigious noble family just like claude the alliance nobility is so odd
you dont think she acts like a noble
is it different in the kingdom and empire
kind of but i dont mean that in a bad way you wont find such big hearted nobles elsewhere plus judith can drink with the best ofem a woman after my own heart
five years ago when the imperial army attacked garreg mach they moved with incredible speed but in the middle of all that chaos she still had operatives watching the hero of daphnels spy network is impressive she shouldnt be taken lightly
is it true lady rhea was dragged off by the imperial army i heard that was true whyd they take lady rhea professor they didnt take her to kill her did they
i dont think so
thats good we just gotta beat the imperial army and get her back right
they probably havent killed her
yeah good point if they did wed have heard about it by now
you gotta help her professor im begging ya
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report oh i heard what happened at ailell i cant believe imperial spies have been lurking in garreg mach under my watch but ill make sure no more of em get in trust me
this is the great bridge of myrddin one of the bridges that cuts across the airmid river between the empire and the alliance its defenses have been fortified since i last was here it seems the enemy is sufficiently prepared
lets end this quickly
thats the idea professor lets make this quick and painless so much that its over before they even know its started
steady now
if they are fully equipped we must prepare ourselves for anything we must be ready to change our approach in an instant
yes that is most sound i do not distrust claude but there is no guarantee that the other alliance lords will not move against us onward with caution
after we cross the great bridge the greatest plains in fódlan will be before us you do remember do you not i speak of gronder field where we fought the battle of the eagle and lion
the ones defending the great bridge  it isnt my father or brother is it i really want to finish this battle without seeing them especially my father 
yes i hear your father can fell a bear without even a weapon in hand when we run into him ill be sure to let you take the lead family matters and all
thats not funny you jerk
should we be burning the signal of uprising
theres no need for that petra smoke or no smoke theyll get the idea losing the bridge should be a pretty big clue
oh no i cant believe were actually going to invade if edelgard gets angry  oh i get nervous just picturing it stop that imagination oh and if she destroys the monastery with her army were all gonna die
the hour of questioning has long since passed i assure you whatever happens this will not end as it did five years ago back then the empire was able to focus its entire army on garreg mach now their front lines are stretched thin along their borders with both the kingdom and the alliance their allies have grown in number but so have their enemies they should not have too many soldiers they can readily send our way now then let us set forth this shall be the first step in ending the chaos that has engulfed this realm
sights set on enbarr the resistance army avoids the oghma mountains choosing instead to move south along the eastern route that passes through the alliance to make it safely through the territory of house gloucester   supporters of the empire   the army seeks help from the head of house riegan claude claude vows to draw away house gloucesters troops so that the resistance army can advance to the airmid river   a dividing line between the alliance and the empire
after fending off the empire your forces decide its time to advance but first you must capture the great bridge of myrddin a strategic crossing point over the airmid river which borders the alliance and the empire
that symbol  its an enemy raid stay calm and face them head on send a messenger to acheron immediately if were quick we might be able to pull off a pincer attack
that is ladislava she has of late made quite a name for herself as a general be on your guard
we will control this fortress if we can eliminate all the enemies within it
enemies approaching get the soldiers standing by to join the fight we may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too protect the fortress
you think well let you take this bridge form us
it appears enemy soldiers are stationed in the fortress more will come stay on your guard
i lorenz hellman gloucester have arrived to join the battle in my fathers stead
well ally ourselves with the imperial soldiers too
thanks for making your way here annihilate the enemy with the rest of them
acheron nows the time to show your loyalty to the empire attack the enemy from behind
ive got to make her name known to her majesty through distinguished service
that is acheron a minor alliance noble if he has allied with the empire then we must destroy him
goddess please forgive the sins of the enemy leaders and the brave soldiers who followed their orders
somehow we managed to capture the great bridge of myrddin to see the imperial army hold its ground until every last soldier fell  that is true dedication it is clear that edelgard is not some cruel emperor who holds her people in a vice like grip there is something more driving our foes from here on out our journey will not be an easy one 
excuse me sir gilbert is here
gilbert what was he doing all this time we had better go and meet with him
so youve captured the great bridge of myrddin im impressed you were able to break through their defenses
save your praise gilbert lets get to the heart of the matter why are you here why now
i am once again in the service of dimitri he was in hiding in fraldarius territory where he was biding his time for a counteroffensive
dimitri is alive
yes he was to be executed in fhirdiad but dedue stepped forward to rescue him i am here today by command of dimitri himself we realize that our enemies are the same and that it may be advantageous to join forces
i see i shall hear you out
we are preparing to advance against the empire will you join us as we march toward the imperial capital if that is too much to ask then at least allow us to freely cross the great bridge of myrddin
we will join you
hold a moment we have just finished a fierce battle and our forces are few
you may cross freely
agreed we have just finished a fierce battle and our forces are few
to march straight for the main body of the imperial army and challenge them it is too soon i am happy yo allow you safe passage over the bridge but to lend our aid asks too much of us is that not so if you would be willing to wait a few months we might be able to offer something more
i am afraid his highness is not able to stop his advance 
if that is the case i am afraid we cannot join you please send our regards to dimitri
i understand its unfortunate that we were not able to secure the help of the knights of seiros still im grateful that we can cross the great bridge of myrddin safely thank you for that this will be a fight to the death it is highly likely that we will meet our end i wish you both the best of luck in the battles ahead
and may the goddess protect you as well

following edelgards defeat and rheas rescue the resistance army discovers the existence of another adversary a group operating behind the scenes within the empireto prevent disaster from befalling fódlan the resistance army heads for shambhala the enemys stronghold
the empire has been defeated and we have rescued rhea but still the flames of war burn on we journey to shambhala where those who slither in the dark reside
we know nothing of the place or what we can expect to find there
what flayn says is true if we are to prevail we must be prepared for any eventuality before we advance
i will accompany you
what no that would be far too dangerous your long confinement weakened you greatly did it not
those people have opposed us since ancient times i wish to learn the truth about them for myself
i i understand i will not stop you but please take care not to overexert yourself
what but shes been hiding away so long she shouldnt just up and go somewhere scary trust me its a bad idea
bernadetta hiding away seems a poor description for someone who was imprisoned
we must be careful not to put undue stress on lady rhea
if the going gets tough well have to carry her on our backs and make a run for it
you think you can carry her um maybe someone else should do that part 
no matter what enemies are appearing we will be protecting her we will be winning
if we work together i am certain all will be well 
the ones we are soon to face have eluded us for a long time there is much to fear  we must all proceed with utmost caution lest we fall prey to one of their traps
the history of the empire spans 1185 years and just like that it ends but the hresvelg legacy could live on  when edelgard assumed power there were no other rightful heirs she said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by the virtue of merit not blood and she truly meant what she said at any rate  i feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart who knows if it can ever be filled
as history proves everything comes to an end eventually i knew that all along but it still came as a surprise those who slither in the dark  its all so fascinating and strange they must certainly have a long history of their own and when they fall that will come quickly too dont you think heh that almost sounded like a prophecy there am i spooking you yet
hes dead  my fathers dead  im ok though really i was ready for it he was a general in the imperial army after all minister of military affairs  he gave his own life so the empires soldiers wouldnt have to lose theirs thats a fight that only he could take on he was such a tough guy i fought side by side with you this whole time but did i ever get any stronger will i ever be as strong as my father
with edelgard gone maybe fódlan will finally find some peace thats all well and good but um  she was also the one to put my father under house arrest so now hes been released and hes taken charge of house varley i cant handle it i cant deal with him please you have to do something
how about we exile him
we can put him back under arrest
thank you so much
so the moment we defeat edie the nobles cozy up to the alliance and the church  that lot really does think only of themselves and no one else but then theres count bergliez he used to be minister of military affairs  he sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter  when i heard that  i dont know  that simple act of humanity  i couldnt help it i burst into tears you know count bergliez is caspars father right i cant even imagine how caspar must feel about it
the empire has broken in  in smithereens now it is possible for me to go back to brigid but  i cannot choose that choice the time is still too soon for that we must be stopping the evil for everyone in fódlan we will be fighting until the end of it
i thought that after the empire fell the boar might finally be avenged  but something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows   an organization behind the empire well have to take care of them if the boar  if dimitri is to rest in peace
ive only ever done what i thought was just ive got no regrets but sometimes i do wonder if ive done the right thing was all this really for the best sorry   thinking about the end of the war makes me reconsider all kinds of things but its not over yet is it i need to steel myself for the next battle
this war might be over but not war in general human beings thrive on conflict we cant get enough of it i dont know when but you know someday another war will begin
even so 
heh heh  thats the way it is right
youre probably right on that
yeah but the fight is still worth it
war may always come back but so will peace and peace is what we fight for
lady rhea still seems weak  but at least shes safe now im praying that shell be well as soon as possible goddess  i beg you  protect lady rhea
finally that awful war is over everyone lost something and everyone had to make sacrifices  but maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now lets hurry to shambhala professor we have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war
is it really prudent to bring lady rhea on our upcoming expedition it would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous considering how long she was confined 
its her decision ultimately
i feel similarly
there are still many in fódlan who are seeking lady rheas salvation for their sake we cannot put her in harms way
a mysterious power threatening the very future of fódlan certainly we cannot give it leeway right now the empire the kingdom and even the alliance no longer exist there is only fódlan   and fódlan must fight together as one
arent you frightened
fear will serve no purpose here the only path to survival now is victory
do you think we can defeat it
there is simply no option but victory the alternative is unthinkable
perhaps i will have the opportunity to strike the decisive blow on the enemy commander that would secure my place in history for certain
wake up eat train eat train eat sleep we gotta prepare for the assault but that hasnt changed my routine
youre doing plenty
isnt there more you can do
all the training  and eating  i do is for the sake of fódlan gotta stay strong  and fed  to keep it safe
our next opponent is an ally of solon do you remember what solon called us
traitors
no he called us beasts
beasts
thats right he called us beasts
insects
no he called us beasts
meanwhile he refers to himself as the savior who exactly is he saving
those who slither in the dark  it seems well finally discover their true form i get the sense that theyre in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child i wouldnt be surprised if edelgard was subjected to them too theres no telling what their true motives are but whatever their motives what they have done is unforgivable they must be exterminated
i thought the war would end with edelgards defeat  but that wasnt the case this may be premature but im feeling a little relieved ill have to consider what ill do with myself and where ill go when this war is finally over  i dont have an answer yet  lets make sure the next battle puts an end to this war that way we can all move forward
shambhala it was called right scary that its so close to the house goneril territories whod have thought all those creeps were living under my nose i was hoping my big brother would help us in the next battle but he says that i can represent house goneril without his help that i have it in me im glad he recognizes that i have some ability still i wish he wasnt leaving it all to me
these are monicas people arent they the ones who killed captain jeralt then this is my real opportunity for revenge theres no way i can back down from this one
youre not scared
no im ok actually im eager to get out there and fight this is what ive been training for
i wonder if we can win
if we lose its the end for fódlan so we have to win even if it kills us
rhea is sleeping right now if it is not absolutely urgent please do not disturb her rest the long confinement took its toll on her health truthfully she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all   to say nothing of a military expedition to make matters worse we are now facing a very old enemy one that has conspired against us since time out of mind please proceed with caution i have a bad feeling
i am so glad that rhea is unharmed my brother continues to worry about her however of course i am worried myself i cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state  i hope she will rest now and leave it up to you and my brother to see things through
a mysterious organization slithering in the dark of fódlan  like something out of a midnight tale it appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the empire after the fall of enbarr theyve remained well concealed  that said i would keep an eye on edelgards uncle lord arundel something about him sits ill with me
professor i just got word from the opera company i dont know if everyone survived but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival they even asked if id consider making a return to the stage someday  i suspect i may refuse though were at the dawn of something new no reason to look backwards eh
youve done it you did it you crushed the empire and rescued lady rhea im sure the captain is proud of you right now as am i of course im as proud as if id done it myself
lets not celebrate just yet
we still have opponents left to fight
sorry i didnt mean to overdo it we still have to deal with monicas group  those who killed the captain well knock em down so hard that they cant get back up
we rescued lady rhea i can hardly express my joy but now we know about a new foe who intends to bring her harm in time well realize the peaceful world that lady rhea has always hoped for ill have to keep that in mind when im fighting
we saved rhea and the empire has crumbled the kingdom may as well be finished too the reasons for me to remain in fódlan are fading
please stay with us a little longer
of course ive come this far may as well see it through to the end
is it time to bid farewell
thats a little hasty ive come this far may as well see it through the end
lady rheas back lady rheas back im so happy but  things arent gonna be like they used to be any time soon are they theres still folks out there that want us all dead and lady rhea still hasnt regained her strength yet speaking of which professor please dont ask too much of her right now ok
greetings professor nothing to report i can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that everyone did sterling work i really thought wed know peace after that battle but were not quite there yet huh
relying on a map entrusted to them by hubert the resistance army sets their sights on the base belonging to those who slither in the dark beyond its entrance they are met by a sprawling underground city
though the flame of war is quenched its embers endure you travel deep underground to confront those who slither in the dark and bring lasting peace to fódlan
to think there is such a vast space hidden beneath the ground how very creepy
hmm the atmosphere here is very different from the holy mausoleum or the holy tomb look at the shapes and the light 
its too strange  its all really old but you get the feeling that its also new i dont understand it
this decorating is not of fódlan  what is the meaning here
i hate the look of things in here is this some kind of city i would never ever live here
living underground all safe and isolated  it sounds really  um really awful
an underground city hiding those who slither in the dark i would not mind finishing up here and returning to the surface with haste
let us search for a way to descend further still we should survey our surroundings carefully
 
something on your mind
are you not feeling well
no it is simply  we must defeat those who slither in the dark no matter what happens but if my conjecture is correct the one who they will wish to kill the most 
is you dear child
why me
they are aware that you can use the sword of the creator your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon nemesis that is why i must protect you no matter what even if i must die to do so 
i dont understand
somewhere in your heart i believe you do understand you must at least have your suspicions there is something i have not yet told you dear child  i swear to illuminate you once this awful battle has concluded and at the same time  i will offer my apologies to you i must because when you learn the truth you will also learn what you are and how you were born into this world it will be a hard truth to hear when the time comes i hope you are prepared for it 
for thousands of years we have existed underground living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized here and now that vengeance is finally within our grasp there is but one thing left to do destroy them damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion away from the world of the living
now is the time remove the binding spell of titanus let their metal bodies be drenched in blood
what is that
demonic beasts  no i think not they appear to have no will of their own someone must be controlling them
initiate all that remain we must advance our preparations
viskam has been activated increase output gradually depending on the amount of magical energy charged i dont care if we destroy shambhala as long as our goals are fulfilled
theyre trying to take something out of here we should capture them before they escape
more of these giant weapons they must be controlled by someone nearby that facility over there seems suspicious
those awful weapons have been stopped they were being controlled from that facility
finally theyve stopped that should make things easier
you
that is the leader of those who slither in the dark we must go after him with all our might
/***EOF***/
it is imperial year 1185 nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at garreg mach and war continues to plague the lands of fódlan fhirdiad has been captured the holy kingdom of faerghus is in shambles the leicester alliance is on the verge of collapse fractured by two opposing factions those who support the adrestian empire and its ruler and those who seek her demise meanwhile under emperor edelgards rule of law the adrestian empire continues to expand its reach the path to a new fódlan unified by imperial strength may yet be in sight
sighs why am i even here i know they wont come but here i am anyway how has it already been five years time stops for no one i suppose
huh its   its you what are you doing here
i came here for you
for me
im not sure myself
a whim
highly doubtful so you were alive what have you been doing all this time
i was sleeping
i was dead
joking at a time like this well if you dont wish to tell me i wont persuade you all that matters is this will you return to the empire with me
before you answer know that friends from our black eagle days have chosen to join me in the fight ahead
i 
hesitation it betrays your true answer
i cant
as expected i knew your answer before i had even asked the question
that means  were enemies now you and i my teacher the time for discussion has come to an end
even though our swords may cross as they do now  
  theres no denying that our chosen paths never will
goodbye my teacher when next we meet one of us will breath their last
who is it is that   its you
its been a long time
yes it has been but this is no time for casual chatter
what are you doing here
i was going to ask you the very same thing
after you disappeared five years ago do you have any idea how dire the churchs situation became where were you and what were you doing all of those years
i was sleeping
you slept for five years  in that case i suppose there is nothing more to say you should know that rhea also disappeared after the battle at garreg mach five years ago since then the knights have been fully devoted to searching for her they have yet to find a trace
was she captured by the imperial army
was she murdered by the imperial army
it is possible however the empire has not made any such statement as of yet even if that were the truth there is no way for us to confirm we have searched all over but we have reached an impasse unless we do something our efforts to find rhea and rebuild the church will be stalled indefinitely our opportunity to strike back is close at hand sadly we are short on military strength however now we have you do you recall what rhea told you five years ago she asked for you to take her place should anything ever happen to her she entrusted you with leading the people of fódlan
i remember
then i beg of you please heed her words
i cant do that
i will not accept that please  you must lend me your strength
it is up to you to lead us and to defeat the empire   no to defeat edelgard
why me
there is a very good reason but it is not yet time to divulge it just know that without you we have no hope
you should lead them
it is not for me to do you are the only one who can rise to this task someday you will know why that is until then i ask that you trust me
i dont want to fight edelgard
what are you saying she is tormenting all of fódlan and you are the only one who can save us how can you not see that
sir bandits have entered the area they stole some hidden weapons and ran off theyre heading for the town so that might be where theyre hiding out 
vile thieves even with the knights gone i cannot believe they would dare trespass here this is unforgivable come professor let us give chase
in the holy kingdom of faerghus imperialist loyalist cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of blaiddyd to prevent further revolt prince dimitri has been sentenced now the backbone of the former kingdom houses gautier and fraldarius struggle to continue the resistance cornelia operating out of the royal palace has accepted the support of the empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining kingdom forces
in the leicester alliance house riegan leads an anti imperial faction while house gloucester directs the empires supporters despite the undeniable threat of fracture the alliances adept new leader claude deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front
in enbarr the imperial capital of the adrestian empire emperor edelgard fights to strengthen her regime she has extended her reach to the kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western fódlan
in the meantime the knights of seiros have been dispatched to find archbishop rhea who remains missing despite their searching left unattended the monastery at garreg mach has fallen to ruin and become a haven for thieves
looters deserve no forgiveness after them
what the  intruders protect the goods
stop the thieves retrieve our stolen goods
we had no place to go so we came back to garreg mach but then    huh professor
looks like theres a fight im ready to join the battle
it is confirmed that professor is alive i will be cooperating
what are you doing here never mind well have to talk later help us with these thieves
people a battle oh there wasnt supposed to be anyone here wait is that  professor
professor  youre alive after all well then i am quite pleased with my choice to come here
professor never mind  we have to focus on winning this fight
lend us a hand lets beat them back
if we split our troops in two we can attack from the north and the south to trap their leader
do you remember our promise from five years ago professor todays the day
im so glad i get to see you again professor
i went back to brigid once but i had to be returning to fódlan
ah professor you have not changed a bit i am so glad to fight alongside you again
so what have you been doing these past five years sleeping why i must say im a bit envious
took all my will to come out here today but seeing you again professor thats worth a little torture
no im not the one you want gah i guess ive got no choice
it isnt looking good for us should we retreat
he has some treasure from the monastery too do not let him escape
it seems we were able to expel the bandits who were hiding in garreg mach how fortuitous that you students should gather at the monastery like this 
we made a promise with the professor that was five years ago to the very day
we all gave our promise to be meeting here when the millennium festival arrived
though the one who came up with that plan is not here  edelgard still how incredible that those present gathered despite the terrible state of things 
pfft the most incredible part of it is that you didnt oversleep and miss the reunion
so that is the reason  professor the monastery is safe because of your devoted students i am now fully convinced you are the only one who can save fódlan
thats taking it a bit far
no not so
you can count on me
ah so you have finally accepted your destiny
on the very day i return to garreg mach you awaken and return as well this is no mere coincidence but rather the work of the goddess
whats your reason for being here
actually  well it would be easier to just show you come with me to the holy mausoleum i realize that since you have been slumbering for so long you have no idea what has transpired in the various territories allow me to explain  after the battle of garreg mach there was a change of regime in the kingdom house blaiddyd suffered a series of brutal massacres which claimed the lives of dimitri and regent rufus the kingdom capital fell and was absorbed into the empire as the faerghus dukedom which is now under cornelias control some still resist the empire as of now rodrigue of house fraldarius is at the center of such efforts in the alliance claude leads the faction that opposes the empire and lorenz leads those who have sided with them the front lines are ever in motion but the war effort has stagnated overall in short both the kingdom and the alliance have been swallowed up by the empire and are on the verge of collapse we must gather our generals and soldiers under your command and reverse this dire situation
flayn look the professor has returned to us
hm what do you mean  oh goodness it really is you professor i cannot believe you are still of this world we were so worried we would never see you again
what are you doing here
i forgot something important at the holy mausoleum  i told my brother i had to go back for it no matter what and so here i am 
after we finished here we were going to continue our search for rhea but now that you are here things have changed we must not waste this opportunity we shall send word to the knights scattered all across the land the time has come for the knights of seiros to return to action we are counting on you professor

after seizing the great bridge of myrddin the resistance army starts making preparations to invade imperial territory when a surprising piece of information comes to light
emergency in gronder field  theres a  its 
we are in the middle of a military conference please calm yourself and tell us what is the matter
yes sir it seems that the kingdom and alliance armies clashed with imperial forces on gronder field amid the chaos of three armies battling each other out there the imperial army was routed edelgard sustained heavy wounds and retreated to enbarr
well then i suppose 
sir the kingdom army was also decimated and  his highness dimitri has been counted among the dead
what
the alliance sustained heavy casualties as well and the whereabouts of their leader claude is currently unknown
unknown i 
edelgard is injured 
dimitri is dead 
claude is missing 
it must have been a brutal fight to have lost his highness  how tragic our only solace is that edelgard sustained severe injuries this is all quite unexpected but we must find a way to use this situation to our advantage the empires main force has suffered a mighty blow edelgard will most certainly avoid the front lines now is the time for us to infiltrate the empire and aim for the capital
but what will happen to the lords of the old kingdom and alliance territories
they have lost many leaders and soldiers i am sure they must be hard at work rebuilding we will foster cooperation by aiding them through the local churches the remaining lords of the kingdom and alliance must join together to form one union and you should be the one to lead them  what do you say
in time 
i cant decide that just yet
indeed it is a question for another day we must focus on our battle with the empire for now what is our next course of action
we should set out
lets decide where to invade first
we must choose a place within the empire that will give us solid defenses for our front line  that will become the foothold for our invasion of the capital there is one massive fortress that boasts the greatest defenses in the empire fort merceus but we will stand no chance if we attack by traditional means we must gather everyone and devise a plan of attack
  it has been a lifetime  hasnt it professor
 i thought you were dead
yes  i thought so too i wanted to slice her throat but i did not get the chance i let people die and yet  i still stand rodrigue gustave dedue 
there must be a reason you survived
you sound just like rodrigue a reason 
you can still atone for your sins
you sound just like rodrigue a way to absolve my sins 
everyone gives such complicated advice and i can never quite grasp it all that is why  professor i came here to explain my decision
what decision
i have no resources to take back the kingdom capital much less to defeat the empire and that is why 
professor you will catch a cold sleeping in a place like this is something the matter
where did he go
hm i am the only one here were you dreaming
 
i cant say for certain that you were dreaming but if someone did come here to see you  that person only wanted you to see their face perhaps they wanted you to guide them 
dimitri the late prince of faerghus he despised the empire with all his heart he should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive
leaders are people too
dont leaders have feelings like everyone else
true enough but i suspect the reason he died is that he could not keep his emotions in check i see you are saying you met with dimitri but you could not tell if it was reality or a dream hm i wonder what it could mean
im rather curious to see what stratagem well devise to capture the fortress you know fort merceuss nickname i assume the stubborn old general but there must be one or two gaps in its defenses 
fort merceus is next huh ah the memories its a huge stronghold in my fathers domain the towns completely surrounded by high walls i used to run around there when i was a kid  way back when a fortress was a playground for me yeah those were the days
its always so peaceful coming back here but its hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon and assaulting that huge keep that sounds hard oh really hard dont you think itll be hard
its going to be tough
i knew youd think so i knew you   ow oh ow cant believe i tried to hug you through the door 
well be fine
of course youd say that whyd i even ask
i heard that a staggering number of people lost their loves in the battle at gronder and here we are preparing for the next battle as if nothing happened the day before its almost easier to think about war as theater with the stage an entire continent
though actors die the show goes on
something like that if an accident happens on stage the next days performance must be unaffected
it really doesnt seem like theater
even if an accident happens on stage the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened
everyone just pretends like everything is fine  focusing on their role in the play
i have excitement in my heart for secret tactics i enjoy attacks that are surprising
whys that
surprise attacks are safe with friends fewer injuries
because its like hunting
yes hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey surprise attacks are safe with friends fewer injuries
it hasnt sunk in yet they slaughtered the boar  i can hardly believe it i thought he was alive all this time he must have really hated edelgard to lead such an ill advised assault hmph no point in feeling sorry for the poor scoundrel now
ive heard dedues passed on just like his highness
we cant know that for certain
thats true i did hear that his body was never found
dont believe everything you hear
youre right i dont think anyones found his body so i guess he might still be out there
dedue is dead
thats what ive heard but no ones found his body
if somehow hes still alive i hope well meet again
ya know professor laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date first you get past her defenses then you make your move
thats not the best analogy
trust me i know what im talking about im a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing girls i mean  ive never actually you know captured any keeps 
you might be right
ha i knew youd get it professor
anyway you know more about tactics than me so i dont know why im offering you advice
oh goddess hear my prayer please bless the deceased with peace everlasting  and may his soul rest in tranquility you know i used to see him praying quite often when i would come to the cathedral at night i wonder who it was he prayed for back then 
professor they tell me my father died at gronder was that  was that really a fitting end for one such as him i dont know i just dont know
i only know what little i overheard but what i did hear implied that the empire was involved in the tragedy of duscur if its true that may explain why his highness chose to fight the empire perhaps i should have fought alongside his highness
why is that
because i too lost someone to that tragedy  the most important person in my world
are you having regrets
no not anymore i am where i belong
those of us still on this plane of existence will carry on the torch the inhumane actions of the empire must not be repeated
fort merceus is old and strong its reputation for durability is equal to that of arianrhod are you certain your plan is sufficient it seems to be a little simplistic
guess well find out
thats not terrifically reassuring shouldnt you have more faith in your own plans
well be fine
i suppose i must take you at your word mustnt i
incidentally have you heard any news of claude i for one have a hard time believing he is dead he was always a clever and tenacious sort
you know when you work your muscles and they start screaming that means you gotta be nice to them if youre muscles are hungry you gotta feed them and let them rest when theyre tired
i dont see how youd do that
whaddya mean how you just gotta eat and sleep its pretty obvious 
you can tell how your muscles are feeling
of course if my muscles hurt then i hurt if theyre hungry well then im hungry too
whats with the confused face professor you look like you dont get a word im saying
it sounds like the battle at gronder field was pretty gruesome we dont know for certain whether claudes alive or dead maybe hes all right i wish i could make sure somehow but it doesnt seem possible now
if claude somehow survived i imagine hes terribly wounded all three forces have suffered heavy losses were incredibly lucky to have not been involved this is a perfect and unique opportunity to go on the offense now is the time to prove ourselves professor
i never used to care whether i lived or died  but when i think of all those who died at gronder i realize how precious life truly is im ashamed of how arrogant i was to think that death could mean so little 
i like this idea of yours  dressing as imperial soldiers so theyll let us in but dont you wish there was one more twist in the plan come on professor think how could we add another wrinkle hm
we can dress you as the emperor
dress me as edelgard but we look nothing alike
we could dress seteth as a woman
seteth dressed as a woman i dont understand what the point of that would be
on second thought lets just stick to the plan as originally conceived that seems safer
under your leadership we can win any battle no matter the odds thats what everyones saying anyway hope you can keep up with our expectations professor
the battle at gronder field certainly took an unexpected turn did it not let us press on so as not to waste the opportunity fort merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the imperial capital enbarr we cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort but once we have it the city should be almost entirely at our mercy i will make the necessary preparations be ready
standing face to face with those whom i went to school with on the field of battle  how inhuman war is  how horrifying my heart feels shattered it is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior
fort merceus is the empires single most fortified military installation utterly impregnable they say i wonder do you happen to know the nickname given to fort merceus
the silver maiden
no im afraid that name refers to the fortress city of arianrhod
fódlans locket
that one is a fortress that stands at fódlans throat
the stubborn old general
indeed a very good answer but of course youd know that
seems fódlans give everyone and everything a nickname why you were called the ashen demon myself i have been called the father of crestology which is a nickname as well as a title i suppose 
each step closer to enbarr im reminded of another part of my past riches and poverty glory and failure that city has it all and if im honest sometimes i miss it thats how the past works though isnt it its always a different story than what you really lived
youre quite a tactician disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in undetected a stroke of brilliance in a frontal attack our losses would be tremendous with this strategy we can really snatch victory from the jaws of deceit
thats a good point
yes  with you leading our fighters ive no doubt the empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit get it deceit again
thats a bad pun
ah rats youve seen through my cunning punning
i hardly recognize everyone  their faces have changed so much more experience in the eyes and more pain im glad that theyre stronger but i hate to think theyve all become hardened killers look after them ok try to keep em on the straight and narrow
did you give the ridiculous order to prepare imperial armor for every one of our troops ive reached out through all my channels but there are limits to these things ill have to recruit an entire towns worth of people if i ever plan on making enough
guess what i noticed i can see further than most other people can see but i cant figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly since i cant shoot what i see
you could detect enemy movements in advance
i suppose i could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away thats kinda useful at least
you could find our targets quicker than anyone
yeah i suppose it could be real useful for finding lady rhea too
a class reunion on the battlefield thats bleak that mustve been so hard on everyone you gotta keep looking after them all i mean they still look to you for guidance you know
greetings professor nothing to report is it true that well be assaulting fort merceus next that doesnt sound like the brightest idea  ive heard that its built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies not to tell you how to do your job but dont do it im not ready to say my final good byes to everyone 
we are just about to pass through gronder field we should be in view of fort merceus soon it looks like the battle made quite an impact  the imperial army has lost some of its luster we should soon be able to invade the fort without too much trouble
because of the alliance and kingdoms sacrifices 
yes we must win for them as well
we cannot let this opportunity pass us by
yes after a few short months they will already be back on their feet we cannot waste this opportunity
professor the soldiers have finished changing into their disguises we are ready to masquerade as imperial troops and infiltrate the fort
disguises
infiltrate the fort
i believe this was your idea was it not it is impossible to take fort merceus with a frontal assault we must take it from within we will infiltrate the fort as imperial troops and kill the enemy general all preparations are complete
according to the scout reports my father and the others are not inside the fort it seems they were moved to the front lines of the kingdoms western region
the death knight became the general of this fort after the battle at gronder field
what the death knight i think ill be taking a break now  you guys go on ahead
bernadetta you cannot be hiding on a field the enemy will be seeing you
no place to hide i guess  i have no choice but to fight
the death knight  i hear that he is counted among the greatest heroes of the empire at the moment we never determined whether or not he was truly jeritza so in capturing merceus we have encountered another obstacle
weve beaten him before
i suppose you have a point if we challenge him again with conviction we are sure to attain victory
lets be careful
yes now more than ever
the impenetrable fortress city of arianrhod goes by the name silver maiden yet she pales in comparison to fort merceus  the stubborn old general those who approach are driven back but once we make our way in its all ours
that fort has been brought to life on stage for countless operas 
let us commence we must puncture a hole in the empires defenses
that manwoman approaches  will deaths scythe claim you  or will i fall to that sword of yours 
at gronder field the armies of the kingdom alliance and empire collide the three forces engage in a fierce battle each suffering significant losses before deciding to withdraw seeing an opportunity the resistance army quickly plots an invasion of imperial territory in order to gain a foothold in the empire they will attempt to capture fort merceus
fort merceus said to be impregnable lies between you and enbarr the imperial capital seizing the sturdy fortress will require a carefully devised strategy
report a group posing as imperial soldiers has infiltrated they seem to be affiliated with the church
close the gates leave no survivors
the time is ripe
do not let him get away circle around and cut off his retreat
the time of ruin draws near  but their slaughter must wait until next we meet 
hes fled has he let us deal with the remaining foes and then make haste in our pursuit
you leave
no i wont i  i refuse to run from you anymore
so its you death knight remember me
you again here to lose more blood
never you will not lay a hand on me ever again
you will not escape death knight today you will be unmasked
my true identity has no value
i will be the judge of that once ive seen your face
if you desire to slay me follow the appointed hour is at hand 
it is coming  leave now or all of you will die
run we have to evacuate immediately
what just happened here
the fort its  its just  gone
whatever could that have been  it was almost reminiscent of that terror of legend 
what legend
we havent the time for stories 
we need to get out of here
agreed we must retreat for now
all we can do is retreat to the great bridge of myrddin and assess our situation
well now that marching was nearly as trying as the battle itself
we wasted a few days but now that were this far back we should be safe  or so i believe
i still cant believe it the fort was destroyed just like that 
the death knight knew about the attack was it the empires doing
guess that means theyd rather destroy the fort than lose it
whatever the case we need to get our bearings and decide what were going to do next
we all have many questions but for now we must focus on our next move
lets give up
what how could  ah yes i see
lets attack the imperial capital
i wish for that as well but we are sure to fall if we charge in without a plan hmm  but by the look on your face i have the feeling you are working out a plan even now
lets return to the monastery
what if we return to the monastery then our situation is sure to  ah yes i see 
now youve got it
whatever do you mean
no need to hide your intentions from me
so we make it appear as though we have ceased our invasion by returning to garreg mach then we divide up our soldiers and infiltrate nearby areas of the capital right under the empires nose finally we gather all of the soldiers somewhere we can get to swiftly from garreg mach and proceed to invade enbarr is that what you are thinking
are you serious you know theres no guarantee that we wont be spotted by the enemy right
if we fail to intervene we will be isolated inside the empire and be utterly obliterated
i will be embracing the nearness of death if i am needing to with each other
that sounds dangerous really incredibly dangerous
make no mistake if we fail in this plan there will be no coming back from it are you sure about this professor
its our only hope
i see if you are resolved then i will follow suit we may be weaker and the terrain may be against us but all we can do is use our resources the best we can that and pray for the blessings of the goddess
/***EOF***/
having parted ways with edelgard former students of the black eagle house now work alongside the knights of seiros at garreg mach they begin to create a resistance army strong enough to take on her imperial forces
ah thank the goddess  i couldnt bear the thought of letting jeralt down by not finding you
guess you lucked out
weve been looking everywhere for you but i see lady rhea isnt with you damn
everyone was real worried about you professor
seteth has told us everything from here on out you will have our aid
i am so grateful that everyone is safe i am sorry things are moving so rapidly but there is something we must discuss come with me
the time has come to make our true stand against the empire
lets win no matter what
lets all work together
i dont feel confident but well do our best
our base will be garreg mach monastery the interior is in less than pristine condition but we should be able to utilize it much the same as we had before
surely those imperial jerks have this place staked out right its a highly strategic location
it may be an area of importance but it is far removed from the front lines considering the burden of transport it is possible they are not paying too much attention to it
nothing escapes the emperor there must be at least a spy or two
professor what do you think
i have no objections
i see then it must be the right idea
im worried about supplies
your concern is valid however 
the town and surrounding hamlets are still present and though far from abundant the church still has funds at its disposal
thats true  professor i think we can leave expanding our army to my brother he was always good at negotiating and i believe he is best suited to the task
in that case i have a request please allow my soldiers to join your ranks as well house aegir already tried taking on the emperor as a result our territory was stolen from us as a consequence i do not have many soldiers left to speak of but those i have are yours to command
i feel like i should tell you that ive been protecting some kids who lost their parents in the war theyre in the town right now but maybe we can move them to the monastery im sure theyd be happy to chip in however they can
hm  yes i understand i will make the necessary arrangements
i nabbed some valuables from my house father is with the emperor now so  its not much but its yours
i dont have a thing to contribute in fact im still in my same old clothes
ive been wandering on my own for five years i wont go back to that house or my father thats for sure
i understand leave it to me no labor is too great if it means saving fódlan 
i have lost my dominion my nobility may seem like nothing more that a title but i will never lose my noble heart i will stop edelgard even if it costs me my life i have turned my blade against her now i cannot go back on that decision professor  do you think i chose the wrong path
not at all
you are right 
well find out soon enough
you are right 
the promise was made five years ago but i must say im rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it personally i only showed up because i hoped to see you again professor ive been with my family in the empire until recently i admit to feeling a little guilty betraying her majesty but only a little now that were all together again i suppose the fighting will begin soon
hey professor you wont believe what happened i figured i couldnt go back to the empire after garreg mach fell so i started drifting across the kingdom and the alliance then i just happened to run into our old class so we came back to the monastery together
ah at last i return to my domain my lonely paradise my realm of exquisite solitude huh professor is that um is that you you um you didnt hear that just now did you
sorry
oh forget you heard anything
hear what
right you didnt well um good
laaa la laaa la laaa  professor oh my its so good to see you these days so many old friends seem to be disappearing but you  youre here its incredible to see you again after five years i have a feeling your name will go down in history
edelgard is controlling the empire she is putting the pressure on the kingdom and alliance empire and religion are at open war it will be difficult for us at first but corrupt nobles are many that means that common people will rebel and be joining our side with you professor the battle tides will ah will turn i have certainty
a country with no king has no future thats why i made my way here professor dont let me down
country with no king
hmph youll understand soon enough
lets forge ahead
yes lets find me a worthy opponent to battle and ill be content
i left home without telling my father did you know that i can just imagine my fathers face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me kind of a scary image actually but regardless ive put my faith in you professor and im hoping i havent made a big mistake
hey professor its been a while its really good to see you again gorgeous as ever might i add an awful lot has happened in these past five years there were so many times i wished you were around im glad youre back your skills are worth more than a whole army
youre here professor along with everyone from our old class its like weve gone back in time when i think that ill be around you again all of my sorrows just drift away
frankly i dont feel too happy
hmm i understand especially with lady rhea missing  it sounds like the kingdom and alliance have been in a sorry state too but we cant let that get us down
lets do our best together
hmm yes ill at least try not to hold anyone back
lets work together for the common good like we did five years ago
members of the knights tell me that father left their ranks five years ago they say he announced he was returning to the kingdom but nobodys heard from him since i havent received word that he went back home to mother  where could he be  where are you father 
professor i have a proposal why not go beyond the knights of seiros  instead uniting with allies from all across fódlan to fight for our cause looking back it would have been best to ally with the kingdom and join forces against the empire but now the kingdom is not exactly  well 
fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true professor and dont worry about my little sis right now shes back home helping out with the family business i kinda figured i was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her but thanks to you guys i get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight
its been fixed up quite a bit but its battle scars arent so easily erased  to think that a glorious cathedral with a thousand year history would end up like this ill rebuild this place someday this cathedral is the symbol of fódlan maybe i should paint a picture of the beautiful cathedral of old while i still remember what it looked like 
ive grown weary and impatient  these past five years my hands have been bound but now i can finally take action with a clear goal im grateful to you and to everyone
i didnt do anything
nonsense your presence steeled everyones resolve
and that goal is
down with the empire surely peace will soon follow if the empire is overthrown then my parents can finally find peace themselves
even with the church in shambles we can still pray the goddess will surely hear our prayers but still  i hope the church can return to its former beauty someday
hey professor i know that we didnt plan to stop at the monastery but im glad we did im happy to be here with everyone again
youre happy at a time like this
what good does grimness do us lets try to enjoy our time together while we still can
im happy too
right its as though we went back in time five years i feel like my old self again
its not just for my village that im fighting alongside you here you know its also that captain jeralt asked me his first and greatest apprentice to look out for you of course it wouldnt be enough just to keep you alive its my duty to make sure you win too so do your best professor and count on me to watch your back
with the return of its knights garreg mach is finally coming back to life the church of seiros will follow you from now on but please do not abandon the search for lady rhea
well do whatever it takes to find her
thank you i know the battles ahead will be dire but we will support you with all our strength
we dont know what the future will bring
wherever she is rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you please do not let her down
professor i am so glad you are unharmed no matter the path you walk i will be with you every step of the way anything you ask of me i shall see it through you saved my life and i am in your debt
thankfully it appears the records and equipment i need for my research have not been damaged i am most curious though you say you were asleep for five whole years incredible perhaps this is another effect of your crest i do look forward to investigating you in greater detail
we can talk about that
wonderful news i am most excited to begin we must find the time of course
uh maybe later 
ill have to be content with observing you wherever you go then i cannot waste any opportunity
my professor you havent changed a bit at your age id expect your while demeanor to have changed greatly over five years  though i suppose i havent changed either right thank you for noticing by the way ah just the two of us forever young oh let me have my fun
id given up on ever seeing you again where have you been hiding anyway now that were reunited in the land of the living i must fulfill my promise
what promise
the promise i made to the captain to keep you safe i cant believe youve forgotten how cold 
right the promise
thats right i promised the captain id protect you in his stead and now ill make good on my word
in lady rheas absence i will follow you thats what she would want me to do know that wherever you might lead us ill continue searching for lady rhea
thats fine
good because i will not budge on that point welcome back professor
sounds like a lot of trouble
i dont care how much trouble it is i will rescue lady rhea at all costs
im more of a mercenary than a knight these days i work to get paid i never was too attached to fódlan i was considering leaving soon  but i might change my mind if youre around
i dont know anything about rebuilding but i can sure do my best to clean up the mess im gonna keep lady rheas room spotless so she can use it right away whenever she gets back you gotta find her professor you just gotta
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report you know its such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again i almost died in the battle five years ago but i wont allow any enemies to get into this place again i promise you that even if the death knight shows up ill be sure to  well for now ill keep training so i can eventually feel confident that i can stop him
your attention everyone the knights of seiros and our most trusted allies have gathered we have rallied our troops for the purpose of stopping the adrestian empires efforts to rule all we have prepared a new flag to fight under 
much like the professor it bears the crest of flames i hope everyone finds this suitable beneath this flag we will bring back peace to the great land of fódlan
professor im not sure i understand  why is the empire intent on making an enemy of the church
i dont understand either
quite perplexing  if the church disappears from fódlan i wonder if the empire thinks it will benefit them in some way i feel i feel that it will only confuse the people
they must oppose the way of the church
what is meant by the way of the church what do they dislike about it
i have no idea what edelgard was thinking or how she arrived at the decision to raise an army however i do have some small insight as to what she is after she is attempting to destroy the existing social order that is why the church of seiros is first on the list of institutions that must be destroyed it may very well be her goal to rebuild fódlan from the ground up 
i see  but that is only edelgards desire is it not i cannot imagine that the people of fódlan would want that for themselves she may have high ideals but she certainly lacks any compunction about throwing the world and its people into an awful war  it just seems so illogical
you have a point flayn i do not believe the people will ever understand her aim so long as she makes the people suffer our knights of seiros will fight on and strive to protect them if we do not defeat edelgard and retake control of this world fódlans future shall be as dark as night
thank you dear brother i finally feel i understand what is going on
i am always happy to answer your questions flayn is there anything else you wish to ask
well um  actually i have a question for the professor my brother mentioned that you slumbered for five years where was it that you slept
at the bottom of a valley
the bottom of a valley in the water that certainly sounds frigid i would never choose such a place myself i am surprised you did not fall ill
under a rock
under a rock  how similar we are as it were i took my rest in a casket made of stone
oh well i suppose ones first long slumber is difficult to recall 
 
pardon the intrusion but we must prepare a counterattack now it seems the imperial army found out about us entering the monastery
hm that is sooner than expected they must have been spying on us 
i wonder if we can win on our own 
there arent many of them  it looks like well just be facing the ones who were stationed nearby
did they move on us too soon perhaps if we fight by using the land to our advantage 
lets proceed carefully
of course if we are careful we will not lose
lets destroy them
yes i agree let us take them out in one fell swoop
never again will those imperial scoundrels disgrace garreg mach with their presence onward professor
though preparations are still being made to raise troops for the resistance army at garreg mach the imperial army is already one step ahead anticipating the resistance armys actions general randolph and the imperial vanguard under his command begin their advance towards garreg mach to reclaim the monastery
fulfilling a promise made five years ago your former students gather once more at the monastery as do the knights however your joyful reunion is cut short 
the knights of seiros are a powerful enemy but we have more soldiers well take them down all at once
clever tactics are our only hope here we will use fire to deal with the main enemy force
report the enemy has entered the periphery of garreg mach
if we allow them to take the interior the monastery will be lost we must drive them back
what that strange battle flag is  but isnt our enemy the church of seiros
they didnt have enough soldiers with just the church so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues it doesnt matter what flag they fly theyre nothing more than a mob well destroy them all
our troops are preparing the attack protect them until they reach their destination
ugh  to think wed let garreg mach fall twice to these rebels 
a total loss  but we cant just return home like this 
watch out professor theyre coming for you
our fire unit was destroyed the plan has failed 
it looks like they were planning something but it failed
all is prepared now we just need to draw the enemys attention traitors repent of your sins and the goddess may yet show you mercy
quiet dont think youll get away with mocking me attack make sure they never speak again
now begin
fire gyaaaaaah
it burns save me
argh a fire attack  the damage is too great we cant fight anymore all units retreat ill take on our pursuers carry away the injured soldiers
press the attack give them no quarter
we drove back the imperial army the real fight has only just begun 
i never thought id be fighting randolph  i guess it cant be helped seeing as how ive left my own territory and all but what will i do if my father or brother get involved i really dont want to face them 
we must stay strong
too true professor so long as the empire is our enemy we cannot avoid fighting those we are acquainted with though i suppose i have it easier since my house is no longer on the empires side
my friends from the opera said they would leave the capital and go west  so at least i wont be seeing them in battle
hmm i dont think i care if my own house falls lets make it a grand fight after a grand nap of course 
it does not give me happiness to have the people of brigid involved but it is not the time to be thinking of that if it is a possibility i will be having their strength
i dont mind at all really i have no friends anyway and my father hasnt done much to make me care for him not that hed ever step on a battlefield anyway oh but i do wonder how mother is doing 
each of our situations is unique what we share is companionship and the will to fight as one professor you are the heart of our efforts we will support you as best we can
i have a proposal it would be most difficult to fight the imperial army with the forces we have now as such i believe we should send messengers to whatever lords we can trust in the kingdom and the alliance so that we may gain their support do you agree
i agree
it is heartening to hear you say that
it concerns me
it is difficult to know who we can trust of course but we cannot just stand idle either
if all we do is bide our time out enemys main army will come down upon us like a hammer from above
who are you planning to ask
sadly house charon is out we can trust them but they have no help to offer
hm how about house daphnel of the alliance their leader is sure to at least respond
oh how about house daphnel of the alliance i recall that their leader was quite exceptional
judith the hero of daphnel  yes that is a fine suggestion that territory is on the border of the kingdom and the alliance it has not yet been claimed by the fires of war if they agree to lend us their troops out forces will be greatly strengthened we shall send along a secret messenger at once
/***EOF***/
after storming the streets of enbarr and bringing imperial forces to their knees the resistance army surrounds the imperial palace to topple the empire and save rhea from its clutches the resistance army steels itself for battle against emperor edelgard
everyone it is probable that rhea is within the castle walls we must defeat edelgard and rescue rhea in one fell swoop no matter what stands in our way
i dont want to kill edelgard
perhaps we can walk the same path as edelgard 
she is one of your students i understand your desire for a path to peace but she will never bend to our will you do understand that do you not we have no choice but to kill her
we have already killed hubert now is no time to hesitate
she has it coming after all she started this war
someone has to stop her and that someone is us
as her former classmates i feel we owe it to her to try talking it out
this battle will be a deciding one i am believing that it is her wish to be facing us
poor edie  professor wherever you lead ill follow
i  ill fight with all i got to save lady rhea
in the name of the knights of seiros well bring the hammer down on the imperial army
the lives of lady rhea and everyone here are more important than all else i shall be prepared
i leave this mission in your hands say the word and we shall begin
theyve made it into the palace but its actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them defeating them all will turn the tide of the war instantly taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option everyone prepare for a bitter struggle victory to the adrestian empire
the throne room is tightly locked but wherever there are locks there are also keys
so close  must press on 
infiltrators kill them
i must confess i never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far i dont mean to belittle your skills professor but youve far surpassed my expectations
block off the stairwells stop their reinforcements from getting through
well done their reinforcements are cut off
clever tactic its going to be difficult to turn the tables now
at last it is over  now we must find rhea
professor brother i have a letter the imperial general asked me to deliver this to my instructor
who is it from hurry up professor read it at once
it is from hubert though he has left this world he is reaching out through this letter 
if you are reading this letter that means i have perished as her majesty would never surrender to another i can only assume she has fallen as well it greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass  that said as the survivors i must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead you must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark i am sure you must recall monica and tomas
what hubert has written here  i cannot  no i know it must be true and if that is the case then all else makes sense now i must speak with rhea it seems our battle is not over just yet those who slither in the dark  we must kill every last one of them or fódlan will never again know peace
they are allies of monica and tomas  correct the ones who were after my blood and also the ones who destroyed fort merceus with that mysterious light 
we shall discuss this more after we have rescued rhea
you  you have come to save me  is this  is this a dream i have longed to see you again  all this time  is it truly you
seteth flayn  you are here as well  thank you for supporting the professor and for rescuing me
rhea  i am overjoyed that you are unharmed i could not stand losing another of our kind
yes  i am reminded of the past  of reuniting in enbarr 
it is truly nostalgic i would love nothing more than to lose ourselves in memories of the old days but  i must tell you something rhea we have received incredible news albeit from the empire they have told us the identity of our enemy those who slither in the dark  it is time for us to stop hiding the truth about the goddess the progenitor god the truth about us it is time for us to tell the people everything
those who slither in the dark 
we are told they despise the children of the goddess as well as those who live above ground they are planning something horrible
 
please tell the professor everything about these vile people there must be things that only you know
i understand dear child  i will now tell you all that i know it is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of fódlan since ancient times i am sure you have heard the stories of a man named nemesis 
the king of liberation 
the wielder of the sword of the creator 
nemesis the king of liberation  the man who received the sword of the creator from the goddess and became a hero however 
nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits he plundered the holy tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god when nemesis appeared in zanado some time later he already wielded the sword of the creator
in zanado
the red canyon we journeyed there five years ago do you recall
how did he get the sword of the creator
the legend that the goddess gifted him the sword so that he could fight the wicked gods is false that story was created after the fact
i do not know how nemesis obtained the sword or why he appeared in zanado but he used that sword to massacre the people there the children of the progenitor god from their corpses he gained even more power and brought war to fódlan  a mere bandit like nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own 
it was surmised that someone was collaborating with nemesis and there was a massive investigation to uncover who it was but the truth was never discovered i am now certain that his accomplices were those who slither in the dark and this time they have utilized the imperial army to send fódlan back into the flames of war 
so edelgard has made a temporary alliance with them in order to achieve her own aims  professor we must journey to shambhala and stop them
you must not allow fódlans bloody history  the red canyon tragedy  to repeat itself 
/***EOF***/
having repelled the imperial vanguard the resistance army in desperate need of troops seeks help from judith head of house daphnel   the governing body in the northwestern regions of alliance territory
ah its you
we were just talking about rhea 
we have searched for five long years but have not found a trace of her it is possible that she is sleeping somewhere  just as you were sleeping all those years
is that what you think
that is my current theory yes
perhaps
do you think so i truly hope that is the case
we have moved against the empire with the intent of defeating them but have not given up hope of recovering rhea if she is alive we will find her rhea is like family to us and to you as well please lend me your strength 
the messenger we sent to daphnel returned with a reply please read it at once
i understand your situation i will help you with whatever strength i have to spare but there is a problem openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the alliance therefore i will secretly gather troops in ailell the valley of torment will your group be able to receive the soldiers in this location from there it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the alliance and the kingdom
ailell the valley of torment 
ailell is a deep valley located on the border of the kingdom and the alliance people stay far away there we can meet without anyone finding out it is decided make plans to meet up with our reinforcements at once
ailell the valley of torrment 
some day we will take the imperial capital it is odd to think that i will be invading the very city that i once called home ah that is still a ways off i will prepare for our journey to ailell
i never do get used to the sight of blood it always makes me feel as if i might faint i suppose ive told you that though yes ive no idea how you cope with it i hope this war ends soon i dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain 
i didnt think wed end up fighting randolph  hes my uncle well not by blood so  i guess i can handle it
im still worried about you
dont worry about me im ready for anything
youre very resolute
dont worry about me im ready for anything
ailell the valley of torment what kind of a name for a place is that it sounds scary do i really have to go with you hey um heres an idea  maybe let the recluse stay home and hold the fort
hey professor thanks for your hard work again nothing to report today was i convincing was it like he was standing right in front of you some things are the same as they were five years ago but i guess a lot more has changed 
since the past i have learned much of the language of fódlan but speaking the fódlan language still gives me difficulty i can understand read and write with nearly perfection now but understanding and speaking are fruits of a different color
thats part of your charm
i have gratitude for you professor i hope that i will have fluency one day
everyone has a weak spot
yes i will keep practicing more
some in faerghus believe dimitri is still alive my father is one such eccentric hmph they cant accept reality dimitri is dead hes not coming back
ailell the valley of torment aw man  i really do not want to go there
pull yourself together
professor have you ever been to ailell if you had youd know that place is crazy hot for guys like me who grew up somewhere cold man  its gonna be rough though i guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay
why not
that place is crazy hot for guys like me who grew up somewhere cold man  its gonna be rough though i guess that climate will keep our enemies at bay
we may not be students anymore but its still important to read we might even learn something thats useful for our next battle
studying is important
i couldnt agree more i hope the officers academy reopens when the war is over
training is important too
i suppose that may be true i always try my best at both
its a shame the monastery was ruined but  at least the books are still intact
professor is it really ok to rely on judith i hear there are still quarrels within the alliance  this generous offer of soldiers and supplies seems a little too good to be true i mean its also really impressive but im just a little worried i suppose 
my family the galateas are an offshoot of the daphnel family the family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance despite blood relations the families lived apart from one another so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged im not so much acquainted with judith the head of house daphnel
sharing her food with us for nothing in return judith really is a great person shes more like a goddess than the goddess is
she is very much like a goddess
i never met her so i dont know for sure but she must be beautiful and kind
im not sure about that
no well she can be a demon for all i care so long as she feeds me
the valley of torment  id heard of it but i never expected to go there its exciting i wonder what the landscape is like
it sounds dangerous
it probably is dangerous but i still want to get there and see it as soon as i can
it sounds painful
hmm that is an interesting point  the name does seem to suggest that
ailell the valley of torment lies on the border of three noble territories the kingdoms fraldarius and galatea families and the alliances daphnel family in the fraldarius lands to the north the former kingdom army and new dukes army are fighting
valley of torment  valley of torment 
something wrong
i once read a book full of legends surrounding ailell but i cant seem to remember 
are you chanting some sort of curse
n no  im trying to remember the legends surrounding ailell 
my big brother told me stories of judiths bravery with just one look she tamed a runaway horse that nobody else had been able to touch when an almyran general provoked her she talked him into a tearful apology shes spectacular i wish shed fight alongside us
youre not a teacher anymore and were not your students but everyone still calls you professor is there something youd rather be called
professor is fine
guess thats what were used to huh all right
call me by my name
oh all right then ill call you  ugh nope sorry cant do it too weird
meeting reinforcements in the valley of torment seems like an astute decision to me in that land of oppressive heat it is unlikely that we will be disturbed it also means we will contend with those harsh conditions ourselves however best ensure we are well prepared
it has been only five years yet so much has changed half of the kingdom has fallen to the empire skirmishes are rife throughout the alliance despite such tumult we look upon the same sky unchanged by the storm happening beneath it
do you wish you could return to those days
yes it would be nice i suppose things were  simpler then or so they seemed to be at the time
its true  its just like it was all those years ago
indeed i gazed up at this same sky with mother and father it does not feel so long ago at all wait but how would you know professor
the monastery repairs have made solid progress most excellent news when we first returned here i was unsure what we were going to do with the ruins of this place  but if we can get the cathedral rebuilt well have it looking just like old times soon enough
hearing that an old student has died cuts me right to the heart  as this war with the empire continues well see more of it professor we have a duty to fight alongside our students we taught them how to fight after all now lets help them win
even though were getting reinforcements we should still be prepared for the worst never shirk your training no matter what to practice im going to chop something up with my sword unless youd like to train together care to spar
ive heard people talk about the hero of daphnel if the stories of her courage are true no one will be able to stand against us in different circumstances id have wanted to try crossing swords with her right now we have to focus on getting those reinforcements lets hope nothing goes wrong
there are enemy spies around remain vigilant capture anyone who seems suspicious
to kill them
what else would we do with them
all right i will
im glad you understand im counting on you
gotta clean out the storerooms tend the flowers do the washing dust the library 
that sounds like a lot of work
well its my job ya know gotta do your job
do you need any help
nah this is my job lady rhea herself gave it to me even if lady rheas not here right now i still gotta do my duty
like you you gotta have other stuff you oughta be doing yeah
theres unrest everywhere these days all of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered i hope things go back to normal soon people need more to smile about aside from my great deals
greetings professor nothing to report is everyone setting out on a big campaign not exactly ah so youre meeting up with the reinforcements well you can leave guarding this place to me ill keep an eye out for anything suspicious
in response to the resistance armys plea judith has agreed to provide soldiers to meet up with the reinforcements the resistance army sets out for ailell the valley of torment unbeknownst to them something else awaits them there 
im overheated and have changed my mind id like to return to my cozy bed now
who knew somewhere so hot existed in fódlan i wonder if its ok to walk everywhere 
just use the superior emotional fortitude of nobility and well be very careful
it is said that this land was born of the goddesss wrath there was an immense battle here long ago to end it she set the entire valley aflame of course there is no record of this some theorize this was done by another and then blamed on the goddess 
my head is being defeated by this heat i think i am seeing visions  there within the mountains  a shadow 
thats just the   whoa i see it too
it appears to be a military force but in a different location than the one we agreed to
its an enemy raid
they are dressed like kingdom soldiers  they fooled us
they might be allies
hold a moment  they are dressed like kingdom soldiers is this an ambush
damn  i thought we had disposed of all the spies
they carry the flag of house rowe  theyve joined the empire then to think theyd travel all this way
are you ready to confront them professor
im worried about judith
as am i we have no reason to believe she was intercepted en route but we must act quickly let us take them down and locate judiths army
we must break through
yes we must defeat them quickly and locate judiths army
they have chosen the valley of torment for this battle and so we shall send them to the flames of eternity
your party travels to ailell the valley of torment to meet up with allied troops and secure reinforcements it should have been a safe march 
the valley of torment  perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight only if that puny force of children is able to kill me of course 
that lion banner  it seems gwendal is the one leading the troops of house rowe he is an experienced general renowned throughout faerghus let us hold nothing back
this is ailell the valley of torment expect this smoke and fire to assail us at every turn touching the flames of torment will get you worse than a scorching proceed carefully
the crest of flames ha quite full of themselves arent they
just as i thought  the professors army but its too late to back out now in lonatos place i have to do my duty
here we go attack them from both sides
oh old gwendal is here and he doesnt look to be an ally 
oh the hero of daphnel is here ill expect more from her than the young ones 
all of your units fall in battle or judith is defeated
you  no lets leave the pleasantries for later first i want you to take this its nothing important but it may prove useful
forgive me  but as lonatos son i have a duty
i dont want to fight you professor  but this is how it has to be theres no turning back
i know this is it but  i dont want to die 
you want to spare me why ill  ill do it ill join your side let me fight for you
does a whelp like you really expect to kill me i am gwendal the gray lion a knight by the hand of count rowe do your worst
ah so i have found a place to die  young ones  i thank you 
that was quite a predicament but now we can see to the objective we had in mind
to think wed get into a scrap here of all places were lucky we all made it out alive
im sorry for involving you in this
dont worry about it in this day and age its a miracle ive been unscathed this long
i see why they call you a hero
well thats ancient history
so youre that professor everyone talks about youre just as claude described
claude
he asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy
that professor everyone talks about
you used to teach at the officers academy five years back right i guess you didnt teach claude though he asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy
claude of the alliance how did he learn of our plans we cant underestimate someone like him  there is a reason they call him the master tactician but i suppose we are both fighting against the empire now the enemy of our enemy is our ally
thats right i have a letter from him as well
its up to you to decide how to use it
that is yours professor please tell me what it says when you see fit
ok lets wrap up this hand off of soldiers not that i suspect you of anything but  i must warn you that these are very important soldiers for my territory dont treat them like expendable equipment
oh by the way i have some important information a witness saw lady rhea being dragged off by the imperial army after the battle five years ago
are you sure your source is reliable
one of my own saw it happen im certain
it seems we chose wisely when decided to fight against the empire
thank you for the information we will rescue her at all costs
now that we have reinforcements it is time to advance against the empire and yet we do not have enough troops to face our enemys main army head on we have no choice but to use our small numbers wisely by taking over key locations as we blaze our way to the imperial capital
its an easy win
do not indulge in being overly optimistic it would be our ruin
it will be a fierce fight
yes it will we must brace ourselves
as you know the oghma mountains lie south of garreg mach towards the empire in order to enter empire territory we must travel around those mountains there are two possible routes  through the kingdom to the west and through the alliance to the east
lets go west
the western half of the kingdom is under the empires control it may be too dangerous to pass through there i suggest we take the eastern route for safety
lets go east
yes that makes sense
there are lords in the alliance who support the empire but they are at least not completely under their control furthermore you hold a key to the empire within your grasp
claudes letter
yes precisely
the sword of the creator
my charm
this is no time for tomfoolery i am referring to the letter from claude
hey there teach its been a while hasnt it i never dared to imagine you might still be alive wonders never cease i dont know exactly why but i feel that i can trust you so im going to do just that to that end i propose an exchange youre intending to invade the empire that much is clear and that means your only option is to pass through the east youll have to cross the airmid river which runs along the border between the empire and the alliance that means youll need to gain control of the great bridge of myrddin the one closest to garreg mach it just so happens that my family house riegan is in conflict with house gloucester right now it would be easy enough for us to eliminate them but i would prefer that we settle things without it coming to that do you see where im going with this well act as a distraction and draw house gloucester away from there that will allow you to cross through their territory and take the great bridge of myrddin after you take the bridge from the imperial army house gloucester wont be able to receive their aid youll get to cross myrddin without any trouble and ill be able to maintain stability in the alliance not a bad deal eh i hope to hear from you soon be well teach
the master tactician indeed somehow he is already aware of our plan the conditions are not bad  all is he says it is if we take the great bridge of myrddin and house gloucester bows down to house riegan  the route from the monastery to the empire will be much safer for our forces
lets do it
it seems you are decided we will send our answer at once
im suspicious
i am afraid we have no choice considering the circumstances
