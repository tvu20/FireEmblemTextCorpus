FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Vigarde|General Glen of the Grado Imperial Army, also known as the Sunstone...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|Yes...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Vigarde|Your orders. Capture the leader of the rebel army in Carcino. Capture Eirika.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|Eirika... Do you mean the princess of Renais?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Vigarde|Eirika invaded Carcino. She massacred the citizens of Port Kiris. Then, she fled south. Glen. Go. Crush the rebels who brought ruin to Carcino.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|...Understood, sire.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|......|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Cormag|What did the emperor say, Brother?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|I’ve been ordered to kill the princess of Renais. Cormag, I want you to remain here in the capital. I’ll go alone.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Cormag|If that’s what you want, Brother, so be it. But you seem troubled... Don’t tell me you’re concerned about fighting the princess of a ruined land!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|...Hm... I never was able to slip anything past you, little brother. You’re right. This duty falls heavily on my shoulders, more then any other.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Cormag|Tell me, Brother, do you know this princess?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|Yes. When Renais and Grado were still close... I met the girl– I met Eirika only once. We spoke briefly, but I felt she was a woman of great kindness. I cannot bring myself to believe Princess Eirika is evil. I cannot.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Cormag|...Glen. The emperor has ordered–|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|There’s the rub, Cormag. That’s it exactly. His Majesty has never spoken a falsehood in all the time I’ve served him. And as a servant of the empire, I am duty bound to obey his orders. But I can see no reason to think Princess Eirika’s heart is any less gentle now.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Valter|What are these cowardly mutterings? It is because you three generals are weak that we others must work so hard. And yet you get the honor of killing the girl. How I long to do your duty for you!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|Rrrr! Valter, you treacherous swine...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Valter|What’s this? Is this how you speak toward your peer knights of the realm? Lest you’ve forgotten, I, too, am a general–the same rank as you.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|You wretch. You were cast out from the army for mistreating civilians. What lies have you told to receive pardon and reinstatement at the same tome?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Valter|Our beloved emperor felt my skills were needed, and his word is law. His majesty has earned my sincerest and most undying gratitude. And then we have you three. Duessel, Selena, and you... The three of you have proven to be unreliable time and time again. We were brought in to plug the holes, don’t you see? You ought to thank me, Glen!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Cormag|Valter! If you dare insult my brother further...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Valter|Come now, Cormag. And what would you do to me if I did? Would you fight me? Here? Would you show such disloyalty to the emperor?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Cormag|...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Glen|Peace, Cormag. We are His Majesty’s men. We will honor his commands. Mark my words, Valter: your crimes are neither forgotten nor forgiven.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Valter|Hmph...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Prince Innes. What do you say? Can you continue?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Yes, of course. Do you believe this is enough to make me give up? I am surprised you mercenaries haven’t turned and fled, though.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Naw. You see, Gerik’s Mercenaries takes its name from me, Gerik. I’m the chief here. If I quit while our employer still fought on, they’d want a new name, you follow me? So... What’s the plan?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Same as before. We remain surrounded. They’re not going to allow us simply to walk out of here... I send a messenger off with news of our plight. However, even on the wings of a pegasus knight, Frelia is days away. We can expect no help from them.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|So we tighten our belts and survive, is that it? Or would you rather quit this place and rest in comfort?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Surrender? I’m the prince of Frelia. I don’t know the meaning of the words. The fate of the world rides on my shoulders, and I’ll make it to Jehanna. Even if I have to crawl to do it.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Now, that makes me feel better. If you’re so determined, we may all live a little while longer...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Hey, Chief, Prince.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|What is it, Tethys?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|I’ve got bad news...and then I’ve got worse news.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|What’s the bad news?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|We’ve no more weapons in reserve. What you’re holding is what we’ve got. Once those are gone, there won’t be much fight left in us.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|That is bad news... Well? What’s the worse news?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|They’ve begun to move. They’re going to attack again. Looks like they’re sending up the whole lot of ’em this time.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|...... Right. You two, you’re done here. Discharged. Fired. Whatever. You can surrender or flee. The choice is yours.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|What?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|I’m the one they’re after. Throw down your weapons, and you’ll walk away alive. I don’t need you here. You’ll only be in my way. Who knows? You filthy sellswords’ll probably sell me out anyway.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Hold on there! That’s not true, and you know it!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Peace, Tethys. Hey, Prince. What are you going to do?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|I’m going to get out of here on my own. I’ll break to the south and escape into the mountains.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|That ain’t gonna be easy. How you plan on doing that?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|I’m not telling you. I’ve no idea when you’ll decide to betray me. Go on. Get out of here. I’d rather do this alone.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Sounds like you’re trying to make sure you’re the only one who dies.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|...... Fool. I’ve no intention of dying. But there can be no false hope of reinforcements riding in to save the day. You and I are not the same. You’re a commoner, and I’m Frelia’s heir. We of noble birth do not shirk the duties to which we are born.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|......|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|What are you waiting for? You may go.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Well played, milord. I’ve always loved the melodrama of martyrdom... There’s no way I can abandon you after that fine performance. I’m staying with you. To the end.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|To the– What are you saying? You dare ignore the orders of the one who’s paying your wages?!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Tethys, I want you to go and surrender. Give my regards to Ewan and Marisa.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Don’t be ridiculous. I’m not going anywhere. Now would the two of you kindly stop acting like such...men? And you! You’ve already fired us. You can’t order us to leave now.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Unbelievable... And you people call yourselves mercenaries? I thought you fought for money, not for duty.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Yeah, that’s one of the rules. Guess we’re lousy mercenaries, eh? Now let’s get thinking. We still need a plan to get us all out of here alive. You’re supposed to be a good tactician, so I figure I won’t die easily. Tell us what to do, Prince. We’ll follow your orders.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|...... Hm. Very well. I’ll see what I can do to avoid getting us filled with arrows.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Ah... Say, Prince. If, by some miracle, aid were to come, from what direction would it arrive?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|...From the north. But there’s little or no hope of that. Even if Frelia were to send us aid, they would not arrive until...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|This may be good news... Then again, it may be more bad news. There. On that northern mountain path... Someone’s coming.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Prince Innes!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Seth|Princess Eirika, the prince is surrounded by the mercenary armies of Carcino. He looks vastly outnumbered. I doubt he can hold out much longer.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|I can see that. Let’s hurry!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Pablo|Heh heh... My plan to get rid of Klimt has yielded some unexpected fruit. The head of Frelia’s Prince Innes will make a fine gift to Grado.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Soldier|Lord Pablo, Prince Innes and his men have taken refuge in a mountain stronghold. Do we have your permission to finish them off?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Pablo|Yes. Flush the prince out and cut him down. We’ll find Klimt later and roast his old bones as well. Heh heh heh...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Man|Lord Klimt, Pablo’s troops are moving toward the stronghold. It looks like they’re planning on chasing down Prince Innes and his men.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|Pablo, you mad, reckless imbecile... If Prince Innes dies here, the bond between Carcino and Frelia is sundered forever. Carcino will be nothing more than a vassal paying tribute to Grado... We must find some way to aid Prince Innes.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Man|Wait, my lord Klimt! Pablo is after you as well. If you reveal yourself here...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|Ahh... May fortune keep you safe, Prince Innes...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Soldier|Hey! You’re up! You’re getting paid a lot more than us common soldiers. Time you earned your gold!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Marisa|I hear you. Where do I start killing?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Soldier|Th-that way! The Frelian troops! Don’t point that blade in our direction!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Marisa|I’ll do what I can. No promises. Good day.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Soldier|Whew... So that’s Marisa, the Crimson Flash of Gerik’s Mercenaries... She’s a beauty, but I’ll keep my distance...and keep my head.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tana|Brother!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Tana?!? What? How did... What are you doing here?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tana|I came with Eirika. Wait here, Brother. It’s my turn to protect you.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Stop playing the soldier, Tana. You will return to the palace at once.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tana|I will not! Eirika, Ephraim, and you are all risking so much... I can’t sit at home and watch! I have to do something to help.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Tana... ...We’ll talk about this later. For now, we join forces with Eirika.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tana|Thank you, Brother.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Prince Innes! Are you well?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Eirika... Is that you?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|We’ve come to aid you. You must be exhausted. Please fall back and rest. We’ll take care of these dogs.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|I cannot allow that. I will not run and hide while a woman protects me... We will continue the fight. You can join us.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|If that’s how you want it. Let’s go then.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|...Eirika, a moment.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Prince?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|I would give you my thanks. You, the princess of Renais, came to my aid... ...I am in your debt.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Reinforcements have arrived, Gerik.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Lucky us, eh? Good thing we held out as long as we did.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|That was your doing. Thank you.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Don’t let your guard down now, Prince. There are still enemies to fight, and it’d be such a shame to die now.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|I agree completely. Let’s go.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Hey, Tethys. Looks like help is on the way.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Really? Perhaps faith is a good thing. I’ve never had much before, but perhaps good things do happen to good people.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Good things? I like the sound of that. What do you suppose might come my way?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Ha ha... I wonder...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Reinforcements have arrived, Tethys.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Really? Perhaps faith is a good thing. I’ve never had much before, but perhaps good things do happen to good people.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Faith had nothing to do with this. Let’s go. We must join them.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|What a strange nobleman.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Say, Chief. I’ve got good news, and I’ve got better news.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Eh? What’s the good news?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Within our band of mercenaries... There are two women enamored of you.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Huh? What’re you talking about? You a fortune-teller now? And what’s the better news?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Help has arrived. Looks like we may survive after all.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Young Lady|Elder Pablo used his fortune to build his own private army. Now he’s using it to wrest control of Carcino from the council’s hands... Please...help Lord Klimt, so that he can help us.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Man|You know we have no king in the Republic of Carcino. We’re governed instead by a council of elders. It’s a lot better than any stuffy, old monarchy, I can tell you that. You see, anyone can be a leader in Carcino if he’s old enough. Of course, maybe that’s why the country’s in such a mess right now.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Young Man|I’ve heard that Prince Innes of Frelia is a fantastic tactician. Grado took Renais with no trouble, but Frelia still has yet to fall. They say it’s because Prince Innes has spies reporting every move the empire makes. At the same time, all enemy spies in Frelia are exposed and executed swiftly. That means that none of Frelia’s secrets are ever reported back to the empire. I’ve never met Prince Innes, but he doesn’t sound like a man you’d want as an enemy.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Is that you, Marisa?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Marisa|Chief.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|What a mess... Looks like the guild bungled. They’re usually diligent about making sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen. But here we are, two people of the same troop, working for opposite sides.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Marisa|What should we do?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Aye, well, that’s a good question... As a mercenary, your loyalty should always lie with the person paying your wages. You decide. We can cross blade if you want, but I’d rather you retreat. ‘Course, if you betray your employer, you’ll soil your sterling name.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Marisa|C’mon, Chief. What would YOU like me to do?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Well, that’s easy. I’d like you to come over and join my side.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Marisa|Right. Done.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Ho-hold on... Is that it? Just like that? You know what this will do to your reputation, right?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Marisa|Uh-huh.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Pablo|No one can withstand the might of Grado... Logic dictates we join now or be subjugated later. I made the rational decision. The only decision!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Pablo|Urrgh... N-no. I cannot die when there is such wealth to be had... Re-retreat! Mercenaries, to me!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Valter|...I’ve found you, Eirika. Seems you’re as skilled as reports say. This is going to be fun. Yes, yes, yes. I do so love strong women.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Soldier|Shall we attack, General Valter?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Valter|No, we’ll pass on dessert for now. Allow them to escape. We’re leaving.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Prince Innes, are you well?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Eirika...I’m sorry for troubling you.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|No, it was no trouble.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|Oh, Prince Innes! Thank goodness, you’re unharmed!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Who are you?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|Oh, where are my manners? I am a member of Carcino’s Council of Elders. My name is Klimt.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|A council member?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|So you’re one of the traitors who ordered–|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|P-please, please! I have no intention of opposing you or quarreling with you. I, too, have been marked for death by Pablo...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|What is this all about?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|It’s a shameful tale... Carcino is a nation divided. As you know, Carcino has no king but is ruled by a council. But now the council has broken apart into factions mired in discord...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Factions... You’re saying that the whole of Carcino has not betrayed Frelia?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|Correct. The moderate factions prefer to preserve our alliance with Frelia. Pablo’s faction wishes to endear us to Grado, to surrender us to their armies. Once Pablo realized he couldn’t ply us with brides, he began to have us assassinated. Those of us who remain have taken refuge underground. We oppose him where we can. If you hadn’t shown up, I’m not certain I would still be breathing...|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|I do recall enemy troops combing this area when I arrived... They were searching for you, is that it?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|Pablo has usurped rule of the council. We had no choice but to hide. Not all of Carcino’s council has gone over to Grado’s side, though... You must believe me–the whole of Carcino does not believe as Pablo does.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|...I see.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Lord Klimt... I understand the hardships you’ve endured. I am pleased to hear all of Carcino is not our foe.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Klimt|I will depart at once for Frelia to explain our circumstance to the king. I think it is best if you return to Frelia as well. Pablo has considerable wealth, and he commands a vast mercenary force. I’m sure he’ll send more of them this way as soon as he is able.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|Prince Innes. Tethys and I are staying with you. Is that gonna work?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Yes, I would appreciate the help. Starting now, you’ve got a new contract, though–the pay’s double. If the two of you hadn’t stayed with me back there, I would not have survived. Gerik, Tethys... Thank you. You have my gratitude.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Tell me something, Prince. Did you get...er...hit on the head during that last skirmish?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|...That’s unkind. My neck is not so stiff that I cannot show gratitude. I would ask for your continued support in the days ahead.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|We both ask for your help.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Gerik|We’ve got a deal. Let’s keep each other alive.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|Ah! There you are, Sister.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Ewan! How is it... What are you doing here? I told you to wait in the inn and behave yourself, didn’t I?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|Yeah, but you always run off and disappear. It’s not fair. I want to have adventures, too.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|You are such an imp... I am not out here running about having fun, you know?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|I know. That’s why I came to see you. I can help. My teacher finally got around to teaching me some magic. Check this out.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|H-hey! Knock it off! You shouldn’t be using magic here!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|Well, I just thought maybe I could help you work is all. I can protect you now, sis. Come on, take me with you. I don’t wanna stay in that inn anymore.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Oh...all right. I’ll go speak and speak to the Chief and Princess Eirika. Don’t wander off while I’m gone.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|Yahoo!|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Seth|Princess Eirika, Prince Innes. I think we should follow the advice we’ve been given and return to Frelia. Continuing on through Carcino like this is too great a risk to your safety.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|The peril is self-evident. However, I have to reach Jehanna, and the only way is through Carcino. If I don’t hurry, nations will fall, one after another, to Grado’s hunger.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Innes is right. And the road to Rausten leads me through both Carcino and Jehanna. However, pressing on will only invite more mercenary attacks.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|Hey, I’ve got an answer. I know a way that leads over the mountains straight to Jehanna! Want me to guide you?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|...And who might you be?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Ewan! Shush! You know better than to interrupt people when they’re talking. I’m so sorry. Please let me take my brother out of the way. Come on, Ewan. Let’s go.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|No, no–wait, please. Do you really know a route through the mountains?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|That’s what I said. At the top of that mountain, there’s a village named Caer Pelyn. That’s where my teacher lives. I’m sure he’ll lead you through if you ask him nicely.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|What is your teacher’s name?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|My teacher? His name is Saleh.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Saleh... I’ve heard that name on the lips of Frelia’s spy network lately. He’s a powerful wielder of magic who has been fighting bandits and monsters. The spies mentioned something about a Caer Pelyn, if I remember.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|What do you think?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Innes|Hm. If my spies are accurate, this Saleh is someone we can trust.|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Eirika|Very well, Ewan. Will you take us to meet your teacher?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Tethys|Are you sure you can do this, Ewan?|
FE8|10A-RevoltAtCarcino|Ewan|Not a problem! All right, everyone. See if you can keep up!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Seth|We’re approaching Serafew, at the border of Renais and Grado. Once we cross, we’ll be in Grado... Renvall won’t be much farther.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|That is, assuming we can cross the border without mishap... Oh! Look! Over there!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Those strange figures... What...What are they? Are they...human? I’ve never seen anything like it. What could they be?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|What have we done to deserve the trials before us? What is happening to us? How could such abominations walk out lands while the Sacred Stones protect us?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|......|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Lute, please, it’s dangerous outside the walls. Stay here in the village.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|Those are revenants, aren’t they? They were the vanguard of the Demon King in the days of darkness. The Tome of Nazania describes them in chapter 2, section 7, paragraph 8.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|You know of them?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|Duh! I’m a prodigy. I can recall almost everything I see or hear. According to the book, revenants attack using razor-sharp claws. Sounds painful, wouldn’t you say?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Yes, er, well... Be that as it may, I must go aid those travelers outside. You should stay here within the safety of the village.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|Very well. I don’t mind staying here. In fact, it seems that smarter choice.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|Magic is far more powerful than any monster’s claws. The thickest hide and the strongest armor are useless against magic’s power. Yes, I supposed I could have studied swords, but only magic is worthy of me. Even if this village were to be assaulted by monsters, I could defend it perfectly.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Travelers, you must listen to me! The ancient forest of Za’ha is dangerous. Head south and pass through this place before the fiends surround you!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Who are you?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|My name is Artur. The temple has assigned me the task of cleansing the forest of these...things. There are so many of the fiends, though. I wonder if I stand much chance alone. So if you would, please flee now while you have the chance.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Fiends? You’re not talking about the same fiends that served the ancient Demon King? That can’t be right... They’re nothing but legends and fairy tales...|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Yes, I felt the same say when I heard. And yet here they are. This place is filled with them. I wonder how far they’re spread... Surely they’re not in Renais alone.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|But..why are they here? How?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Seth|Beware, Your Highness! Something approaches!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Please allow me to deal with this. Evil shade! May the blessed light drive you from this land!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Seth|We ought to help. He can’t fight them all alone. Do you have orders?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|One of my companions is in that village to the south. If you can get there swiftly, I implore you to watch over her safety.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Man|Do you see that old snag to the south of here? Bet it would make a handy bridge if you could knock it over. Take a weapon to it and give it a few good whacks. That should do it. Here, take this and give it a try. It ought to do the trick.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Oh, my! Those travelers are being besieged by the agents of evil!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Dozla|Ha ha ha! Right you are, Lady L’Arachel!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|I cannot allow this to happen! Come! We must charge down these cliffs and rush to their aid!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Rennac|We charge down these cliffs, and the only thing we’ll be rushing to is death. How about we find us a nice, gentle path down, hm?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Ah...Yes, well...Let us hurry nonetheless. I simply cannot abide those wicked beasts running amok!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Lute, help has arrived.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|......|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Lute?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|Your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction. It seems you’re not a revenant.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|Well, I should hope not! I wanted you to know help has arrived. Please be patient a bit longer...|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|No, no. I insist on joining you in combat. I’ve been reading up on these revenants. They are, quite simply, no match for me. I am superior after all.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|......|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Hm?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|Your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction. It seems you’re not a revenant. I’ve decided to join you in battle now. My name is Lute. I’m a mage of superior wisdom and rare ability. I’ve been reading up on these revenants. They are, quite simply, no match for me. I am superior after all.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Seth|We’ve killed all the monsters. Still, we’d best burn the bones to ash to be sure they don’t return.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|I still can’t believe what we’ve been fighting here... I’d thought those fiends nothing more than myth and legend.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Seth|Those revenants are said to be the least of the dark creatures. And yet, the weakest of them could outmatch any normal man. We cannot take this enemy lightly.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Lute|Oh, yes. There are much worse then those revenants and the entombed... Let’s see, there’s the bonewalkers, mauthe doogs, gargoyles, baels... Why, I’ll bet you just about any creature of lore could be walking again. Yes, we’re in for some trouble. Even my fabulous power may not be enough.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Artur|O divine light, show me... Is this a sign of dark days to come?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|By all that’s holy, what is happening?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Seth|Princess Eirika, perhaps it would be wise to return to Frelia and regroup. Pressing forward seems foolish in light of recent events. We cannot face both Grado’s forces and more of those terrible things.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Seth, I follow your point, and nothing would please me more then running for safety. But what of my brother? He and his men are still trapped in the same situation we are. I know full well that I may be leading us into even greater danger, but... Please try to understand.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Seth|I do, my princess, and I vow to see you through this safely.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Aha! Foul creatures, beware! I, L’Arachel, bestow upon you the honor at banishment at my blessed hands!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|......|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Oh...Where are the monsters?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Well, we just finished...|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Ah, glad tidings indeed! The heavens must be rejoicing! I am.. a tad disappointed however. After all, I did rush all the way here to show you the splendor of my might.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! It’s a real shame, innit, Lady L’Arachel?!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Rennac|What’s shameful is the way you drag us around the countryside.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Pardon me, but...who are you?|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Me? Since you ask, please allow me to introduce myself. It is I, the true light and glory of the sacred realm of Rausten...|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Dozla|Stop! Lady L’Arachel, you mustn’t continue! You cannot reveal your true identity here!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Oh, yes, you’re right. Oh, I get so careless sometimes! Now, I must ride off in anonymity. Oh, how beautifully romantic!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|Uh... Right.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|L’Arachel|Fare thee well, strangers. Perhaps our paths will cross again. Come, Dozla! Rennac! We ride!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! Let’s go, Rennac!|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Rennac|All right, all right.|
FE8|04-AncientHorrors|Eirika|...What was that about?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Well, well. There’s an arena in this town. Perfect. My pocket’s feeling a bit light. Say, is that a cleric? It is! And a gorgeous one at that.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Something amiss, Sister? You look flustered.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Ahhh! P-pardon me.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|No, pardon me! I never meant to startle you. May I offer my apologies....|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|No, it’s not necessary... It was my fault. Excuse me, I must be going... Good day to you.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|...And there she goes. Not my lucky day... She was quite the beauty, too. Ah, such is life. I think I’ve time still to visit the arena, though.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Glen|Captain Saar of the Serafew Border Guard. How fare you? I bring orders from His Majesty. Rumor has it that Princess Eirika of Renais is making her way to Grado. You are to find her and to place her in custody immediately.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saar|Yes, sir!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Glen|One more thing... A traitor to the empire has fled Castle Grado. We’ve received reports she is hiding somewhere here in Serafew. I don’t care if you have to tear this town apart. Find the turncoat.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saar|Yes, sir, General Glen! If she resists, do we have permission to execute her?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Glen|...Yes. Permission granted.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saar|Understood! Grado’s will be done. The Grado Empire will repay the debt of betrayal with blood!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Glen|...His Majesty relies upon you, Captain. Be sure his trust is not misplaced. That is all.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saar|Yes, sir!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Glen|Such loyalty to the crown. If only I could hold such conviction in the righteousness of our emperor.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Cormag|Something troubling you, Brother?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Glen|No...Pay no mind to me. Come, Cormag. Let’s go. From here, we ride northeast, back to the fort.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Cormag|Very well.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|It’s been so long since I last visited Serafew. My brother and I used to pass through here en route to Grado. I remember the harmony in which the people of both countries lived. No walls divided our borders. No soldiers stood guard in high towers. The border town... It was to me a symbol of the trust between Grado and Renais.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|...And now, it is firmly under the thumb of Grado’s emperor.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|The peace I remember in this city... It seems like something from another time. It seems lost now... Forever.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|...The city doesn’t seem to be very heavily patrolled. They must feel it’s not worth guarding with Castle Renais under their control. We must try to not draw attention to ourselves. The west gate is undermanned....|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saleh|Pardon me, may I ask you a question?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|What is it?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saleh|I’m looking for someone. Have you seen a young girl with indigo hair?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Indigo hair? No...Sorry.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saleh|Hmmm... Thank you. Sorry to intrude.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|There was something very odd about that man, wouldn’t you say?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|He did seem unusual. He didn’t strike me as a Grado spy, but...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Soldiers|Catch her! Don’t let her escape! That way! She went that way!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|What’s that?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|It’s coming from over there.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Let’s see what the commotion is.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Soldier|Traitor Natasha! Surrender peacefully. Come quietly, and you may have the chance to explain yourself before His Majesty.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Wait, please. You must listen to me!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Soldier|Take her.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|No, you must believe me! The emperor is not himself. You MUST be able to see that!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Soldier|Impugn the emperor at your peril! We’ve been ordered to execute you if you offer any resistance. But your words condemn you!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|That cleric is a traitor to the throne of Grado? What madness is this?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Ah...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Are you all right?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Who are you?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|I’m from Renais. Why are these Grado men after you?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|You’re from Renais...Oh! I have something I must tell you. It’s about Grado–|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Wait–Grado soldiers are coming this way. We’ll have to talk later. Now we must fight!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|So much for my dreams of making my fortune here... First the girl, now the gold. It really isn’t my lucky day.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Soldier|You there! Mercenary! What are you doing here at the arena? Get back to the staging area now!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|C’mon, why don’t we both hit the arena? It’ll be good training, If you’re going to risk your life anyway, you may as well try to earn some gold.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Soldier|I’m reporting you to the captain! You’ll be lucky if he just docks your pay! Don’t forget–You can be replaced in an eyeblink, you filthy sellsword!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Don’t worry, little man. I won’t forget. Work’s work, but I don’t like fighting women... Now then, what’s the rest of the day got in store for me? ...Tails huh? That’s nothing but bad luck and more bad luck...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|They may not want to hear what I have to say, but... I must speak with one of the Grado soldiers. Oh, if only one of them will listen to my words... Please! Grant me strength.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Brigand|Look at this. Now’s our chance! C’mon, lads! Let’s join the fights and steal our way through this pathetic town!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Tethys|Oh, hello. Did you come to see me dance? I’m sorry, but I just finished a few moments ago. Oh, by the way…Would you be interested in one of these items? A wealthy patron left me a small ransom in gifts after watching my performance. You can sell one for gold if you’d like or use them to improve your skills. I simply cannot carry all of this by myself, so please, take this one. Wealth is useless if you can’t use it to bring happiness to others, right? Thanks for dropping my. Perhaps we’ll meet again someday.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Man|Life in Serafew’s been harder since the Grado occupation force took over here. Serafew’s got Renais citizens as well as Grado, but it’s been hardest on us. They’ve singled out families from Renais for the most awful atrocities. Please, traveler, take this sword. It’s an armorslayer. It’ll cut through even the strongest armor. Take it and strike down that blackheart, Saar.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|You...You’re that man I met... Are you here to capture me? You’ve been hired to silence me, haven’t you...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Yeah, Grado’s paying the bill. They want you dead, you know? But don’t feel bad. It’s not personal.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Wait, please... It doesn’t matter what happens to me, but you must hear my words. The emperor of Grado is changed. He is not the man he once was. The other nations must be warned before he extinguishes all light from out lands.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Hey, no offense, but I’m just a mercenary. I don’t care about Grado or its emperor. Everything you say may be true, or it may be lies. I don’t care either way.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|But that’s...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Even so...killing a beautiful lady like you would leave a bad taste in my mouth. Tell me, do you like to gamble?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|What?!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Gambling’s what I live for. Even when I lose, I never want to stop. Let’s have us a little wager. If you win, I’ll believe you. Heads or tails, you call it.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|You can’t... This is no time for games...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Would you rather I get on with the job I was hired for?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|...... Um, heads... No! Tails!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|All right. So I’m heads, and you’re tails. Here we go. ... ... ...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|...... Which...Which is it?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|What do you know?! It’s tails. You win. Figures. I haven’t won anything all day. Well, Lady Luck has spoken. Guess I’m on your side now.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Are you serious?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|Yeah. Sure, I might cheat, but I never worm out of a bet. It’s a rule of mine.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Oh, thank heaven! Thank you, blessed light, for your protection!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Joshua|I got nothing against heaven, but I’m right here if you want someone to thank... No? Well , get behind me then. I’ve got to take care of these fools.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Old Man|In my youth, I was a knight of some renown, I’ll have you know. I’ve even crossed blades with one of Grado’s most famous generals, I have. Ah, but I’m an old man now... I’m starting to worry... What if I die without passing on my techniques? So I decided to write down what I’ve learned in a book. I have it here. You seem like a strong warrior. I’d be honored if you would accept it.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Amelia|Hope everyone’ well back home in Silva. Just a bit more, and I’ll be in the empire. Let’s see, I’ve got vulneraries, antitoxins... Oh! And I can’t let myself forget torches for when it gets dark. Yep! I’m all set! Now I just need to get to the capital. I’ll be the finest soldier the Grado army’s ever seen! I swear it!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Hm? What’s this...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saar|Enemy of the empire! Death’s too good for you!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Saar|Emperor Vigarde... Glory to His...Majesty...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|That was a tight spot.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Yes, yes it was... Thank you so much. I don’t know how to repay–|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|You’re from Grado, aren’t you?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Yes... My name is Natasha. I was a servant of the people at Grado’s Imperial Temple.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Then why the trouble with the soldiers? Would you tell us your story?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Of course... A few days past, my mentor was arrested without warning. They executed him. They said he as a traitor... But those were false accusations. The emperor had him killed–a holy man!–to keep him silent.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|Keep him silent?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|Yes. My mentor told me with his final breath. The emperor plans to destroy the Sacred Stones.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|The Sacred Stones? Destroy them?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|As you must know, the Sacred Stones drove back the power of evil long ago. Even now, each of our nations is home to one of these legendary treasures. There’s one in my homeland, Grado, and one in your Renais...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Yes, the Sacred Stone of Renais is still housed in our royal temple.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|The emperor plans to destroy the five stones, one by one...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|Why would he do such a thing? Legend says the Sacred Stones are even now all that keep evil at bay!|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Natasha|I cannot begin to guess his motives... You must know, our emperor was a gentle man. But one day, he changed. Utterly. Before my mentor died, he said the keepers of the Sacred Stones must be warned. I tried to slip across the border, but the soldiers spotted me...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Is that what happened... What do you think, Seth?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Seth|I think we can trust no one from Grado. Not in these times. Not without proof. However, if what she says is true, we cannot ignore the danger we face. Destroying the Sacred Stones... We cannot allow that to happen.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|I agree. If only we knew if there were some reason for the emperor’s actions. I must tell you, her story chills me to the bone. I pray it is false...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Man|A moment, please. Are you perchance... Princess Eirika?|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|I am.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Man|Oh... Thank goodness you’re safe! I can’t tell you how happy I am. And please accept my gratitude for driving off that Captain Saar. That Saar treated all the citizens of Renais with such contempt and brutality....|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|Not here...not in this city. My brother and I spent such happy times here with Lyon...|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Man|I beg your pardon, but it will not be long before Grado sends more troops. Please, you must go quickly.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Eirika|I’m so sorry. There’s nothing I can do for you now. Please forgive me.|
FE8|05-TheEmpire'sReach|Man|Do not be troubled. Princess Eirika... We will survive and wait for the day of liberation to come. There will be a day when you, Prince Ephraim, and all of Renais rise up... Until that day of glory comes, we will wait unbowed and filled with hope.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Brother...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|What has happened to our home? What has happened to Castle Renais? How did it come to be so ruined? So desolated?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Spies report that the castle is being held by the traitor Orson.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|Orson... In retrospect, I realize he’s been acting odd for a while now. He seemed so... dispirited.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|His wife passed away some six months back. The loss may have been too much for his mind to bear. His love and devotion for his wife were well known among the knights.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|......|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Now, he sits alone in the king’s former bedchambers. He makes no effort to govern. No one is allowed to enter the chambers, and he takes no meals.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|What could he possibly be doing?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|I do not know. The spies had no insight into his behavior. He does nothing to deal with the dark creatures and bandits roaming the land. Reports say all of Renais is engulfed in chaos. Region after region is revolting, and Orson’s reign is already crumbling. Left alone, it may very well collapse under the weight of its own neglect.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|We cannot allow the situation to reach that point. We’re going home, Eirika. We’re going to the castle.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|I hear you, Ephraim.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Myrrh|Um, Ephraim?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|What is it, Myrrh?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Myrrh|I-I will fight with you. Now that Selena has returned my dragonstone to me... I’ll do what I can until its power runs out. Let’s take back your home.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Are you sure about this?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Myrrh|For the two of you... I simply want to help.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|All right. I understand. But you must make me a promise. You are never to stray from our sides. Got that?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Myrrh|Of course...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|What is it, Monica? You seem so happy today. Of COURSE I know what today is. I’d never forget your birthday! I have a present for you, dear. I think you’ll like it....|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Guard|You know something? That Orson... He gives me the creeps. What do you think he’s doing back there? I’ve heard lots of bizarre rumors from the master of the mess hall. ...Do you think he needs help? Could he be dangerous?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Guard|I don’t care. I’m here for the money. As long as I get paid, I’m happy. But on the subject of rumors, have you heard the stories of the secret treasure? There’s supposed to be some fabulous wealth hidden in Castle Renais. I tell you, if I find it, I’m gone.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Riev|Heh heh heh|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Riev|It does my heart good to see you looking so happy, Orson. See what joy your treachery has brought you? I told you treason would be sweet.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|Get out. This is Monica and my place. I will not have our home disturbed by anyone. I did as you asked. I betrayed Renais. My promise has been kept.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Riev|Heh heh heh?How long are you going to continue this nonsense? Eirika and Ephraim have joined forces. Even now, their united forces march toward the capital, toward you.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|Eirika?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Riev|You can’t imagine they’ll forgive you for your treachery, can you? I expect the sin of your betrayal has shattered you entire family’s name. And after all you did to free your wife from the cold clutches of the grave?It’s a shame she’ll be sent back there dangling from the hangman’s noose.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|No! That can’t happen–|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Riev|Heh heh heh! Oh, but it can, and it will. Unless you do something to stop it. You understand what is required, don’t you? You have your orders, Orson. Heh heh heh|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|...Monica, I’m sorry. I have something I must do. Please wait for me here. Oh, darling, don’t look so sad. I’ll be back soon, and then I’ll never leave. I must do this to protect our happiness. You understand that, don’t you? All right then. I’ll be back.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Lyon|?..|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Riev|Heh heh heh! He believes that thing is his wife! Aren’t people amusing?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Lyon|Urr? Why? This terrible? Uh! Urr? gaa? Ahh|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Riev|Oh my, your nasty little illness rearing its ugly little head again? There’s no need to worry. The pain will pass shortly. Leave everything to your humble servant, Riev. Heh heh heh!|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|...I won’t let you come between us. Monica and I will live here happily together. Forever...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Orson|Monica...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika. The castle has been secured. And...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|What is it?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|...This way. This is the room Orson was holed up in.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Monica|...Darling...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|You, you’re Orson’s...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|......|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Monica|Darling. Darling. Darling...darling...darling...darling...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|...What?! This...is horrible...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|......Oh!|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|This same magic was used to control Emperor Vigarde. She’s already dead, and her corpse was used to...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Who? Who could...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|You needn’t look any longer, Eirika. Let’s go outside.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Monica|Darling. Darling...darling...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|...You can’t say this thing is truly alive anymore. I’ll...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|No... I’ll do it. ...The two of them spent every day in here, did they? Orson was mad. But I think he was happy...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|We’ve finally made it back. Yet...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Mmm... We can repair the castle, and what was stolen, we can do without. But the wounds and suffering inflicted upon the people of Renais...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|It’s too late to undo their pain. Once I become king, I must set our country right. I doubt the people will give me a warm reception, though. I did abandon them. All I can do is try to win back their trust, no matter how long it takes...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Princess Eirika, Prince Ephraim. You should look outside.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|Outside?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|People|Prince Ephraim! Princess Eirika! The king has returned! Our king! Glory to Renais! Long live King Ephraim!|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|......|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|...They’re not cheering for you. They cheer because Orson’s misrule is at an end. They cheer the possibility of a better tomorrow, not the deeds we did today. But how will the hearts of the people move tomorrow and the next day? That is for you to decide.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|I will not let their hopes and dreams be shattered again. I will be king. Like my father before me, I will dedicate myself to their happiness.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|And I will do all I can to help, Ephraim.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika. Before Renais fell, King Fado entrusted me with this message: Raise the twins?bracelets in the hall of kings. The seal will be broken. The resting place of the Sacred Stone will be revealed...?br>|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|I understand.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|So we’re supposed to raise our bracelets over our heads, right?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|Let’s try it, Eirika.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|I’m ready, Ephraim.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|This is the Stone of Renais...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Yes. This is one of the five stones that defeated the Demon King.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|If Lyon had acquired our bracelets, the stone would have been destroyed by now. Together, we protected the only power that can help us stop Lyon’s insanity.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Yes. It’s the only hope left to us. Hope for you and me, and the last true hope for peace...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|Let’s get back, Eirika.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|...Huh? Brother, look! Our bracelets, they’re...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|What is this? Are they reacting to the light of the stone? Eirika’s Lunar Brace and Ephraim’s Solar Brace glow in response to the Sacred Stone. With the power of the bracelets, the twins can now change classes.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|I can’t believe the bracelets contain so much power...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|I wonder if Father anticipated all of this long ago. When I was growing up, I never thought about becoming king. I only wanted to be a good soldier, a good warrior. The best on the battlefield. Father never understood what I wanted, but... I never understood him, either.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|......|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|It was the same when Grado invaded Renais. I should have stayed home to defend the kingdom... Instead, I raced off to fight for personal glory.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Brother... I don’t think you know how well Father understood your feelings. When I last saw him, he was concerned for nothing but our safety...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Eirika is correct. King Fado asked after your exploits every day. He always told me what a fine king you would one day make.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|Father...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Now Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika. Please follow me. The Sacred Twins of Renais should be near the stone’s reliquary.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|Ah, here we go. This lance can only be one of the Sacred Twins of Renais. Please, Prince Ephraim, take this sacred relic and feel its weight.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Ephraim|So this is one of our Sacred Twin relics, is it? I’ve never seen them. Look, there’s a name inscribed here. Siegmund, the Flame Lance.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Seth|And this blade is sister to the lance, the other Sacred Twin of legend. Princess Eirika, if you would?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Of course. There’s a name carved here as well. Sieglinde, the Thunder Blade...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|These are the ancient weapons of our ancestors–the weapons of heroes. They were enshrined generations ago, to be used only by the king... and only in times of dire need. Such an awful power they possess, and yet we need them to restore peace. I’ve seen enough of the horrors of war, but I can’t turn my back on it. If we merely turn our eyes away, we surrender our world to atrocity. And so, I must fight. I’ll do whatever I must do to bring back the peace we once knew.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|L’Arachel|What is happening? Have you found the Sacred Stone?|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|Yes. Here it is...|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|L’Arachel|Wow! It truly is spectacular. This goes some way to brighten the dark shadows that loom over us.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Innes|Our countries? Sacred Stones have been shattered by Grado’s men. The Stone of Renais is our last remaining weapon.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|L’Arachel|No, it’s not. You have forgotten the stone of my beloved Rausten. Remember, there were five Sacred Stones for our five nations. The Stones of Grado, Frelia, and Jehanna are gone, but hope is not. We have the Stone of Renais, after all, and that of Rausten is safe. Our road is clear, my friends. I must guide you to Rausten.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|Eirika|You’re right. L’Arachel, we’re counting on you to lead the way.|
FE8|16-RuledByMadness|L’Arachel|Of course. And you will all be welcome to stay in the palace. And, Eirika, you shall be my guest in my own private quarters! Let us be on our way.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|...Hh...hh...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Seth|Perhaps we should rest, milady. Master Saleh, is it much farther?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|We’re close. It’s only half a day ahead.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Seth|I would ask for a moment’s rest before continuing. We are all exhausted. We can go no farther today.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|No, Seth. I’ll be fine. We must not be delayed by my weakness.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Innes|Whew... Hah... I didn’t realize we’d be climbing so high.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Whoops!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|...As I warned you before we set out, the footing here can be treacherous.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Innes|Do you people truly live in this place? These barren crags seem unfit for human habitation...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|Material wealth brings strife. We’ve no need of these things. In this, we are of one mind with the Great Dragon.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|The Great Dragon?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Seth|Ah! Princess Eirika, watch out!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|More monsters... Master Saleh, do these creatures normally inhabit this region?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|No... Those things come from Darkling Woods. It’s been a long time since they’ve wandered this far afield. It’s as the elder says... Evil omens take many shapes.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|L’Arachel|It looks like those fiends have noticed us as well. We should move, Eirika.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|I’m concerned for Ewan as well. I’ll go with you. I hope he is safe.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Hey! Wa-wait a moment. We can work this out... You, uh, aren’t interested in talking, are you? Aaaaaa...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Where’d all those freaks come from? I’ve got to get back and warn everyone... But... I do wonder if Grandmother is all right.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Oh, Sister!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Tethys|Ewan! Are you all right?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Yeah. I tried to fight those monsters. And you know what? I killed four of ’em! With my magic! That’s pretty good, huh?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Tethys|What am I going to do with you? Anyway, it’s not safe here. Come with me, Ewan.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|...... You-you don’t believe me... You watch and see. I’ll show you how far I’ve come!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|Ewan... You’re safe.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Oh, Teacher! It’s you! You probably had to fight a ton of creatures to get here! You’re the best! I hope I can study with you forever.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|I’ve told you before... My mission is my life. If you wish to learn magic, you’d be better served by another.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|No way. I wanna be just like you. Why would I go study somewhere else? Wait... You’ve gotta go out on a mission again, don’t you! Take me with you! I’ve practiced a lot. I can already use all the magic you taught me!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|...... Well, you seem quite adamant. All right. You may accompany me. I think being with me might be safer than remaining on your own.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Yahoo!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Ah, hello!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Ewan! How wonderful. So you’re safe, are you?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Yep. I took care of a whole mess of those things. More of ‘em might show up at any time, so I’ll just follow you to the village. That’s all right, isn’t it?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|I guess so... It’s probably safer than leaving you here by yourself. Let’s stick together, Ewan.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|Wahoo!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Ewan|You were one of the people with my teacher, weren’t you? You think I can fight at your side? I can use the magic my teacher taught me. Well, what do you say?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Woman|I can’t believe monsters have appeared here in the realm of the Great Dragon. What is this world coming to? This staff you help to protect you against the beasts. Please travel safely.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Saleh? Is that you, Saleh? Tell me, is the Great Dragon well?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|I’m sorry, Elder. I searched to the west, but I found nothing.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Is that so... Hm? Who’s that with you?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Innes|I am Innes, prince of Frelia. The circumstances of our journey have led us here. We would like to pass through.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Please.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Hmmm... We of Caer Pelyn have turned away from the world outside. The Great Dragon alone holds all our honor and esteem. In this place, princes and pauper are equals. Do you have a problem with that?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Innes|...No. I understand.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Hm... Well then, be welcomed as guests in our homes. I see some of you are injured. You should use this rock moss. We have little beyond what we need, but we will prepare food and bedding. You can rest as long as you like.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Innes|We’ve no wish to trouble you. We’d just as soon pass straight through.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Don’t let your pride drive you to foolishness. That girl there looks like she’s ready to collapse at any moment. She’s ill from the height of the mountain. Saleh, prepare some tea for the lass.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Thank you, Elder...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Call me Grandmother, child. That is what the villages call me.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Uh... Grandmother, may I ask you a question? This Great Dragon...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Ah, the inquisitiveness of youth. Come, lass, listen to my words. The Great Dragon is...a blessing, one that watches over all mankind. Why, in days long past, when the Demon King appeared...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Demon King? Are you speaking of the legend of the Sacred Stones? The hero Grado used the power of the five Sacred Stones to defeat and seal away–|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|No, no, that’s not right at all. Ah, how quickly did mankind forget its debt to the Great Dragon. To hear the story now, one would think humans alone brought about victory. That is a gross mistelling of the tale. Only through the Great Dragon’s strength could the Demon King be sealed away!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|The Great Dragon and the Demon King...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Mankind may have forgotten its debt, but the Great Dragon never forgets. It watches over the bones of the Demon King in Darkling Woods. It keeps the Demon King’s dark brood from swarming the world of men. The Great Dragon’s vigilance alone has kept us safe from their blind rage.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Is that so? I’m... I’m sorry, I never knew...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Hmph. You don’t need to know everything, but you should remember that.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Yet, Grandmother, we encountered those creatures on the way here. And they have begun to appear in the land we live in as well. What does this mean?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Ah... You have seen the effects of the omen that has appeared in the south. There is an energy there that has fouled the air and darkened the sky. The Great Dragon left Darkling Woods and went south to investigate. We of the village wished to protect the Great Dragon, so I sent my grandson, Saleh, as long as well. But they became embroiled in battle, and the Great Dragon disappeared. Since that time, there’s been no sign of the Great Dragon either here or abroad. We grew worried and directed Saleh to look for any trace of the Great Dragon. I am worried that the source of that foul energy may be responsible.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|A foul energy... From the south? Myrrh said something similar to this, too. Is the Great Dragon you speak of...one of the Manakete?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Manakete?!? How dare you speak so of the Great Dragon!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|I-I’m sorry.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|But if you’ve seen the noble Myrrh, perhaps I can proceed more quickly. You see, our Great Dragon took the form of Mistress Myrrh in her travels. And you tell me that you have seen the Great Dragon yourself, lass?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Yes. Myrrh was with my brother.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|What?! Where is this brother of yours!?|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|He leads a force of men against Grado. Myrrh rides beside him.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Saleh, this is urgent! You must leave for Grado at once and rescue the Great Dragon!|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|Understood. I will...|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|L’Arachel|Oh, where are you off to? If you’re going to Grado, the swiftest route takes you through Jehanna. It would be to your advantage to join us in our journey for a time. It’s far safer then being on your own.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|You have a point... Mistress Eirika, protecting the Great Dragon is my duty. Please allow me to travel with you on the road ahead.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Innes|We are in your debt, Matron.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|Not at all. All of our guidance comes from the Great Dragon. Saleh.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Saleh|Yes, I know. The road to Jehanna lies here.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Eirika|Grandmother, thank you so much for everything.|
FE8|12A-VillageOfSilence|Grandmother|I know you’ll help the Great Dragon, but please look after Saleh as well. He’s not very personable, but he’s the only grandchild I have.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Seth|Princess Eirika, are you well?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|......|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Seth|Princess Eirika!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|...Oh...Seth?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Seth|Yes, it’s me. Please, you must rest. If we continue like this, you’ll...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|No... it’s all right. We’re all suffering... We’re still completely surrounded by Grado’s armies... We may all die at any moment... I can’t lose focus now. Has anything changed?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Seth|Unfortunately, no. On every front, our forces meet with defeat upon defeat. Rausten’s knights are scattered and worn, and the enemy is closing in around them. And this accursed sand... Most of the units can’t get proper footing and are being slowed down. Mounted units are having the worst time, as their movement is severely limited. Princess Eirika... I ask that you leave for safety. We’ll use flying units and magic users to hold the foe here.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|No. I will not retreat. If I give up now... My brother would not forgive me. I’m the princess of Renais. I will fight, either to victory or to death. Brother, I...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Riev|Valter... You should stop playing around. If you don’t’ finish off Eirika’s forces swiftly... Her brother’s left the capital. He should be arriving here shortly. You don’t want to be fighting her still when he arrives. Trust me. We are equals here in Grado’s army. Would you like me to assist?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Valter|All you need to do is vanish, you disgusting old man. Eirika is mine. I won’t let you have her. She is so strong, so beautiful... She’s the prey I’ve dreamed of.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Riev|Heh heh heh... Your fangs are still sharp, eh? Good. Very good. Ah, Valter... You’re a beast. You’re bound to no country. You care nothing for friend or foe. Kill a man, claim a woman... You live for nothing more, you wretched beast. That’s your strength. That’s what makes you stronger than any many alive. A beast acts without remorse. Man’s morality cannot win. It’s nature’s way... The stage is all yours, Valter. Do not fail to get the girl’s bracelet. Our master demands it...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Valter|The time is nigh, Eirika... Come to me!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|That building beyond the dunes is Jehanna Hall. I expect that’s where we’ll find Eirika and her companions. Duessel, Knoll. It’s time we rescued Eirika. I’ll need all your strength.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Duessel|Of course, Your Highness. I’ve pledged my service and my axe. You shall have both.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Knoll|Princess Eirika... She’s a friend of Prince Lyon’s, isn’t she? I’ll do what I can to help you. I feel like that is what Prince Lyon would want.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|The enemy’s numbers are great, but we do not need to face them alone. We must move quickly to join forces with Eirika and her company. I’m sure Seth and Innes will be there waiting for us. Let’s move!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Man|According to this ancient document... ...There was a huge battle here long, long ago. Every day, I’m out here digging up ancient weapons and artifacts out of the sand. There are still more to be found, of that you can be sure. It’s even said a long-dead sage left a copy of Metis’s Tome out here... Oh! But I won’t give that to anyone if I find it. Not a chance!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Young Man|All the highest generals in Grado’s army receive titles named after gemstones. The emperor currently has six gemstones fighting in his service. Caellach, the Tiger Eye, commands the forces fighting here. The Moonstone, Valter, is taking part in this battle as well. Glen, also known as the Sunstone, died in the mountains of Carcino. Selena Fluorspar was killed in western Grado. Duessel, whom they call Obsidian, is missing in action... The Blood Beryl, whose real name is Riev, has also gone missing. Hm? How do I know all this? I know I may look young and naive, but this is my job. I’m here to pass this information along to help you out. And it’s good information, too, so don’t waste it.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Old Woman|Jehanna Hall...has fallen. I wonder what’s become of Queen Ismaire. You there... Take this, and do some good with it.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|Eirika!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Brother? Is that really you? You’re not some phantom, are you?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|No, it’s really me. Hold. Enemies approach.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|...Ephraim. Even when we were children, you were always there to protect me.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|It’s been a long time, Ephraim.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|Innes, is that you?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|You arrived sooner than I’d expected. Eirika is safe. You’ve no need to worry.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|I’ve heard that you’ve been watching over Eirika. I should like to offer you my gratitude.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|It’s not necessary. Besides, there’s still a war to be won. We can’t rest easy till every last Grado soldier’s been defeated.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|You’re right. Let’s go!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Caellach|You’re a stepping-stone... And I’m moving up. Don’t take it personally.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Caellach|Bla-Blast... A bit more, and...a crown... would have been...mine...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Valter|I’ve no use for these bloodless minnows... Give me prey that will sate my bloodlust... I hunger!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Valter|Urggh... Gaaaah!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Brother!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|Eirika!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Oh, Ephraim... I’ve missed you so.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|And I’ve missed you. I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you safe. Oh, I almost forgot. I have something to give you.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|What are these?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|These are called Sacred Twins. We took these relics from Grado. The dark tome Gleipnir and the black axe Garm... I doubt either of us can use them, but... Why not see if one osf your companions can use them. They might have better luck.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|They’re from Grado? Does this mean Grado Keep has fallen?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|Yes. I conquered the capital and defeated Emperor Vigarde. But still...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|L’Arachel|Eirika, may I make a suggestion? We’ve been able to join forces here so... How about if we all get together and trade information. There are people on both sides waiting after all.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|I see unfamiliar faces among you here, so allow me to introduce myself. I am Ephraim, Eirika’s brother and crown prince of Renais.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|L’Arachel|I’m Princess L’Arachel of Rausten. The pleasure is mine, of course.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|I’ll begin by telling you of how we’ve fared in our mission. We seized the Grado capital and defeated her emperor, Vigarde. Grado’s capital guard have, to a man, surrendered and laid down their arms. Pockets of resistance remain, but the war itself is over.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|Is that so?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|However, something remains that still bothers me. A Grado man named Knoll told me about something called a Dark Stone.?Their mages had uncovered lore that led them to craft a powerful magic stone. This Dark Stone may have been the catalyst of Grado’s transformation. It seems to be the source of that black wave of energy Myrrh described. Vigarde died some time ago, but the power of the stone played him like a puppet. The war and everything that passed since was planned by the Dark Stone’s master.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|Well? Who is it?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|...I still can’t believe it, but I’ll tell you nonetheless. According to Knoll, the man behind this is Lyon, the imperial prince. He said Lyon’s got the Dark Stone.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|Figures it’s Prince Lyon...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|No, that doesn’t make any sense. Ephraim and I know Lyon better than that. We’ve been friends for years. Lyon’s not the sort of person who could start a war like this.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|But, Eirika...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|I saw Lyon recently. Ephraim, you might know this, but after I abandoned the sea route to Rausten, I traveled overland with Prince Innes to Jehanna. We ran into trouble with Grado’s forces, and I chanced upon Lyon. He didn’t share the details of his situation, but he intimated that he was on our side. Despite all appearances, he was on our side. So Lyon...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|Eirika, I also met Lyon.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Did you really?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|Yes. But, he was like a completely different person. To be honest, he didn’t seem to be completely...human.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Ephraim... What are you saying?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|I’ll tell you what I saw. I found Lyon inside Grado Keep. This is what he told me: He said he was behind this war. He said he’d befriended us solely so that, one day, he could invade Renais... He told me he killed our father.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|That... That can’t...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|I know. I can’t believe it either. I refuse to believe it. How could he have planned all this since he was a child... I simply can’t fathom it. I’ve heard Lyon changed when he acquired the Dark Stone. I’ve no interest in magic, but... There was something uncanny about him. It seemed almost as though he were being controlled by something himself.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|......|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|The two of you might find this hard to accept, but... The state of Prince Lyon’s heart matters little. He has the Dark Stone. That rock is the cause of all that’s happened. The prince must be stopped.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|L’Arachel|Not yet. There is something that needs doing first.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|L’Arachel?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|L’Arachel|Prince Ephraim, I do believe you felt it as well. The Dark Stone held by Prince Lyon... It exudes a malefic miasma... We might be able to handle Prince Lyon alone, but that stone is beyond our ken.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Then what do you suggest?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|L’Arachel|The Sacred Stones.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|The Sacred Stones?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|L’Arachel|We’ve all heard the legend of the five Sacred Stones. They alone possessed the power to seal the Demon King away forever. So, of course, to dispel demonic magic, we must use the Sacred Stones!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|You expect us to pin the outcome of this war on some fool legend?|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|...Not just the legend. We also have hope. According to Lyon, he has already seen to the destruction of Grado’s, Frelia’s, and Jehanna’s stones.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Hm. That explains something... Grado forces attacked me, intent on destroying the Stone of Renais. If that could be the reason they chose to invade Renais... The power of the Sacred Stones may be greater than we’d ever known.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|L’Arachel|Yes, exactly! If we acquire a Sacred Stone, we’ll be able to oppose the Dark Stone’s might!|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Innes|But three of the stones have been shattered, and our options are few. Do you suppose that, during the invasion of Renais...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|No, I don’t think so. The Stone of Renais is hidden by the power of Eirika’s and my bracelets.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Eirika|Grado has made many attempts to take our bracelets. Every one has failed, and so the stone may still be safe.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Ephraim|We have to confirm that, of course. We’ve defeated Grado, and we must turn our eyes to our homeland. It’s time to return to Renais.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Saleh|Lady Myrrh.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Myrrh|Saleh...|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Saleh|I’m grateful to see you well. The people of Caer Pelyn will be overjoyed that you’re safe.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Myrrh|I must apologize to you, Saleh. You were there to protect me from the very start of my journey. When we were attacked, I was separated from you, and... I’m so sorry to have worried you.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Saleh|Lady Myrrh. As long as you are safe, we have nothing to be worried about. It will be my honor to serve you until your mission is complete.|
FE8|15A-ScorchedSand|Myrrh|Thank you, Saleh.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|This way, Princess Eirika. Prince Ephraim is being kept in a cell back here.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Very well, let’s go.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|...Sir Orson. How long ago were you taken prisoner?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|Some two weeks past. Prince Ephraim and I were forced to surrender. We’ve been held captive here in this dungeon since that black day.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Did you gain any news from your captors during that time?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|Unfortunately, no. Not a word... Our daily meal was brought to us by servants from the neighboring village. They were instructed not to speak to us, and we heard nothing of the war. Tell me, Seth. How fares Renais?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|...Renais has fallen. King Fado... The king is dead.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|Dead... My King... My apologies, Princess Eirika. I have served you poorly....|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|You’re not to blame, Sir Orson. We must look to the future, not find fault in the past. The Grado army pursues me in hopes of acquiring my bracelet. My brother wears this bracelet’s twin, and he is in danger, too.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|Bracelet? Ah, I remember... Prince Ephraim still wears the bracelet. And Grado is after them? If that’s the case, Princess... Perhaps you should entrust the bracelets to someone else.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Perhaps, but...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|Give them to me or Seth. Let someone you trust guard them. If the empire desires you bracelet, you are in danger as long as you hold it. For your own safety, Your Highness, please. What say you? We must not allow the Sacred Stone of Renais to be taken.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Everything you say is true and sensible, yet...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|... Sir Orson. I am sorry for this, but please give me your weapons.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Seth?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|What are you talking about, Seth? Can’t you see I’m unarmed? Do you think they allow prisoners weapons? What kind of injury have you taken that you suggest such foolishness?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|If I am mistaken, then I will give you all due apologies. However, there are questions I have that I cannot answer. Too many questions. Why did no enemy reinforcements come from the castle during our battle outside? Why would you escape your cell and yet leave Prince Ephraim in chains? How do you know of the tie between the bracelets and the Sacred Stone?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|Seth, there is some misunderstanding here. I...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|And why... Why do you conceal a blade within your doublet?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|...What?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|...Very well. You haven’t changed a bit, Seth. If only Eirika had been alone. You, however, simply will not be deceived.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Orson! What is the–|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Orson. Why did you betray Renais?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Orson|My fondest with will be granted... To spend the rest of my days in the embrace of my loving wife once more...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|What are you saying?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Tirado|That’s enough. You’ve done well, Orson. I’ll take over now. You may return to your beloved wife.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Who are you?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Tirado|We’ve never met. I am Tirado. Loyal and talented aide to Valter, general of the Grado army.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|You’re that monster’s–|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Tirado|And you are General Seth of Renais, yes? I thought to catch a little bird in my net, and it seems instead I’ve snared a hawk.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Where is my brother?!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Tirado|Ah, yes. Your brother. He’s not here. The coward fled Lord Valter’s pursuit... Somehow, he escaped the castle. And escaping under these conditions... Tch! Such stubbornness is quite annoying. It was my cunning that led us to turn this unfortunate blunder to our advantage. I spread the rumors myself. I led the villagers to believe he was our prisoner. What better trap with which to catch his sweet, devoted sister?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|My brother escaped?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Tirado|Yes, but your no-doubt emotional reunion will have to wait until the afterlife. Let’s end this, shall we? First, to destroy the bridge and cut off your only avenue of escape... All soldiers to arms! Kill the princess! Take her bracelet!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Princess Eirika, we have to get away from this place!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|But how? The bridge is gone!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Blast!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Oh, Brother... I’m so sorry... I...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|Eirika!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|Prince Ephraim, I hear sounds from the east corridor. Sounds like fighting.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Forde|Do you think it could be General Seth and Princess Eirika?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|We have two goals here, men: save Eirika and vanquish the enemy. Kyle. Forde. Are you ready?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|Yes, Your Highness.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Forde|As always.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|Lord Ephraim, we should join forces with Princess Eirika first. We should be able to reach them by way of the eastern corridor.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Forde|Come now, Kyle. That seems like a lot of trouble when we could just crush Grado between us.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|A lot of trouble? Forde, you’re as insolent as you are careless! If anything were to happen to Princess Eirika, we Knights of Renais would...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Forde|Fine, fine. I see where you stand. Calm down, before you boil over. Prince Ephraim will decide. How shall we proceed, Your Highness?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|We await your command, Prince Ephraim.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|Both of you, follow me!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|Eirika, are you well?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Brother!? Is it really– You’re alive! You’re alive!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|Well, of course I am. After we escaped Renvall, I thought I’d strike a blow against the emperor himself. When I heard that you’d been waylaid by the enemy, however, I turned back to find you. Looks like my timing was impeccable.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|I’m so sorry. The irony is that I was trying to rescue you. All I did was interfere with your plans...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|What are you talking about? You came to help me, didn’t you? Your efforts alone are enough to inspire me. Come on, Eirika! The enemy awaits.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|All right!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Prince Ephraim.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|General Seth! You’re safe!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Princess Eirika is safe as well. I’m afraid I have much news to relate to you. That will have to wait, though. For now, we must cut our way out of here.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|Yes. Let’s conclude our business here before we talk of other matters. Come on!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Yes, sire!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Franz|Brother!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Forde|Ha! Franz! How’ve you been?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Franz|I should ask you! We’d heard you were captured by Grado’s men. I was worried.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Forde|Worried? I ride with Prince Ephraim, little brother. Death will have a tough time catching anyone who rides with our prince! But it’s not like we’ve avoided trouble altogether, that’s for sure. Hm? Say, have you grown taller on me?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Franz|I have. I’ve also finished my training. I’m now a sworn Knight of Renais. You just watch–I’m going to be on par with General Seth one day!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Forde|You want to be like the general, eh? ...What about me?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Franz|Oh I... I still want to be like you, too, Brother!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|General Seth!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Well met, Kyle. I never thought for a moment that you could be bested easily.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|No, sir! And I never doubted that I would see you again.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Kyle. About Orson...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|We heard it all. Unbelievable, isn’t it? But facts are facts.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Yes. If Orson can turn his back on Renais... We remaining knights will have to work all the harder to prove ourselves! Let’s go, Kyle.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Kyle|Yes, sir!|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Tirado|Hmm... My men were unable to finish the job, were they? It falls on me to show you my own special brand of power.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Tirado|Very...impressive... However... I expect you’ll wish you’d died here on my steel. Lord Valter is...not nearly as merciful as I...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Brother...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|I worried you, didn’t I, Eirika? And you as well, General?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Seth|Not at all. We’re happy you’re safe. But tell me, Prince, do you know of Orson’s treachery against you and all of Renais?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|Yes, though I learned of it all too late, after we’d been trapped at Renvall. I still find it difficult to believe that after all his years of service to Renais... I am morally responsible for his plight.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Ephraim...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Myrrh|...Ephraim.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|What is it, Myrrh?|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Myrrh|Something’s coming... It’s drawing near. Dark...big...and great in number.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|I understand. It looks like we should get out of here.|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Eirika|Um, Brother? This girl... Her hair is indigo... Where did...|
FE8|08-It'sATrap|Ephraim|Ah, that’s a long story. For now, we must move. Suffice to say Emperor Vigarde has enlisted some... otherworldly powers. We must warn everyone of the danger.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|My brother is...dead? That can’t be! That’s impossible!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Valter|There’s no mistake. Look for yourself. I’ve brought his corpse with me. That’s him right over there, isn’t it?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|No... Brother...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Valter|Not a pretty sight, eh? You’ll be hard pressed to ready that for a proper burial. But listen, Cormag. There’s no reason for you to grieve. After all, who is better than you to replace your brother in His Majesty’s service? Picture it: General Cormag, the new and improved Sunstone, eh?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|Who did this... Who is responsible? Who!?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Valter|Glen’s last orders were to find and subdue Eirika. ‘Tis a pity I was delayed. I arrived to witness the final blow myself. I watched Eirika run her blade right through his chest and then flee.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|Eirika?! Where is she now?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Valter|Hm? What would you do if I told you? Without orders from His Majesty...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|ANSWER ME!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Valter|...In the eastern mountains of Carcino. The forests are thick in that region. It won’t be easy finding her, but...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Valter|Gone already? I’ve sent a gift your way, Eirika, but I trust you can handle it. You’re my girl after all. I need you to be strong for me... Heh heh... ha ha ha ha ha!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Messenger|Messenger! Messenger! I bring word from Frelia!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Innes|Go on. What news do you bring?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Messenger|Prince Innes! You’re alive and well! When the reinforcements rode into Carcino, you were nowhere to be seen... We thought perhaps the enemy forces had reached you and... It’s good to see you well, milord.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Innes|I’m sorry to have troubled you. But remember, the duty I bear is a harsh master. It will not let me die easily.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Messenger|Of course. Prince Innes...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Innes|Yes, what word do you bring of Frelia? Speak!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Messenger|Yes, Your Highness! Frelia has invaded Carcino and engaged the traitor Pablo’s mercenary army. With aid from the elder Klimt, we are crushing the foe where we find them. Pablo’s faction is retreating ever southward, toward Jehanna...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Innes|Towards Jehanna? They must be planning to join with the Grado forces there.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|Pardon me, but I must know... Do you have word of my brother?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Messenger|Yes. Prince Ephraim has forced them surrender of Grado’s fortress at Rigwald. He is now marching onward toward the imperial capital.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|Toward the capital...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Innes|That fool... Emperor Vigarde himself and his imperial guard are in the capital. It’s too strong a force... Even for Ephraim.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|No... I believe in my brother. I know he fights still. The bracelet tells me so.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|Ah, Eirika. Is it time to go already?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|L’Arachel. We’re going to break through the Grado lines and join the army of Jehanna. You should keep to the rear where it’s safe...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|No, I will stay with you. Confronting evil boldly is the sworn duty of any ally of justice. And it may be that Grado’s goal is the Stone of Jehanna... I cannot stand by and let it be destroyed.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|L’Arachel? Where did you come by such information?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|Hm? That...uh, well...the...wind whispered to me in the night.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|The wind? Whispered to you?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|Yes, that’s right. ...And according to that gentle breeze, there are knights riding this way from Rausten even as we speak. If we can but hold out until they arrive, the battle will surely be ours. Come, Eirika. Let us be on our way.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|W-wait a moment. L’Arachel? Who are you?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|They should be arriving anytime now. Are you ready, Aias?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|Mm. Everything’s in place. This Princess Eirika supposedly defeated General Glen. I wonder... If it’s true, then she’s a foe to be reckoned with, and no doubt. Still, there’s no reason to worry. I can best her. I know it.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|You’ll take her, I’ve no fear. We fought as mercenaries together, and I know what you’re capable of. I could search the continent over and not find a man to match your skills.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|I’m honored to hear you say that. But I’ve no interest in the titles and trapping of Grado’s Imperial Army.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|Don’t say that. You’re glad you came with me, right? You know we were both sick to death of living like desert rats. I’m going to be king one day. This war is just the beginning.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|Ah... It starts again.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|Word has it that the Knights of Rausten are riding from the north. They’re mine. I can trust this mess to your capable hands, can’t I, Aias?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|You remember what they called me when we were mercenaries, don’t you? I was never once wounded on the field of battle. Not once... My skill is not garnish and loud like yours, but I’ve never known defeat.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|Yes, that is true. I’m depending on you, Aias.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|..... All units prepare for battle.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Seth|Princess Eirika. The enemy is arrayed before us. We’ve word that Pablo’s mercenary army is closing in from the rear. You must be cautious.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|All we have to do is hold them off until the Knights of Rausten arrive. If we can do that, victory is as good as ours. Let’s get started, shall we, Eirika?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|Indeed!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|It’s not over yet. Victory still hands in the balance. They key is defeated the enemy commander, but...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|Very...impressive. You’ve pierced the battle formations I’d perfected... No one’s ever done that. Renais’s tactician has earned my highest regard.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Soldier|Rausten Knights?! No... All troops! Retreat at once!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|You’re Eirika, aren’t you?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|And you’re...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|You don’t know me, but you know my brother well enough. I’m Cormag. I’m the brother of Glen, general of the Grado army, whom you killed?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|What?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|This is no longer war, and this is not a battlefield. This is a duel, and I fight to avenge my brother. He died in combat, and I’ll not foul his name by murdering you unarmed. But I will have vengeance.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|Hold! What is the meaning of this? Glen... Are you telling me General Glen is dead?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|Do not play me for a fool! You will not... Your lies do nothing but stain your honor. Nothing more.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|You’ve got it wrong! You’re making a mistake. Your brother and I never fought. He lowered his lance and left the battlefield to confront your emperor.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|...My brother? You lie! Where is your proof?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|I’ve no proof. But... Here are the words he spoke to me. He told me he believed I possessed a gentle heart when we met before. He said I had not lost that quality...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|..... I see... Those are indeed my brother’s words. But then who? Who benefits from– ...Ah! ...Valter!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|What is it?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|...Princess Eirika of Renais. I would be your ally.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|What?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Cormag|I don’t care why you’re fighting. I’ve no interest in your goals. I want nothing but revenge, and I will have it. If I can kill Valter with these two hands, what care I if Grado brands me a traitor?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Soldier|Elder Pablo, there’s fighting ahead.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Pablo|Grr...I’ve misread the situation. I can’t believe I’ve been forced out of Carcino. It’s those accursed Frelia Knights riding down on us from the north. If things don’t change quickly, I’ll be forced to appeal to Grado for aid. We must prove ourselves worthy allies of Grado. We must have them in out debt! First, I’ll use my magic to bury those enemies in the distance.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Pablo|Grrr... I’ve got more money then you’ve ever seen. What say you? Join me, and take a seat of power at my side.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Pablo|Argh... It can’t be...I... You can’t have my gold... It’s all...mine...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|Rausten knights?! That means Caellach’s– Curses... All troops! Retreat at once!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Soldier|Forward the lances! Show them the might of Rausten!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|The Knights of Rausten! Just as L’Arachel said... Reinforcements have arrived in Jehanna!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|What I’d like to know is what took them so long! However, it seems that all has worked out in the end.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Soldier|Princess! Knights of Rausten, 2nd battalion, reporting for duty!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|Well done. You may lift your eyes.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|Princess? L’Arachel, you’re a–|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|What? Oh, you mean... Don’t be silly. This is nothing. Please don’t concern yourself.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Dozla|I do believe, milady, that your disguise has been penetrated.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|Oh... I suppose there’s naught to be done about it now. Very well, Eirika. You’ve found me out! The beauteous wanderer who’s been your boon companion is none other then... the jewel of the theocracy of Rausten, Princess L’Arachel herself! I was acting under divine order to strike down evil in this land.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|..... Is that so? But why did you...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Soldier|The truth is... The princess was enflamed by the words of the court troubadour, Saaga... She forced us to allow her to journey forth anonymously on a quest for justice.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|I-I see...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Soldier|Princess. This is from King Mansel.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|What’s this? War funds? Oh, what a grand uncle. He’s just so thoughtful. Princess Eirika of Renais. Rausten will not yield to Grado. Together, let us defeat the empire in the name of righteousness!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Seth|Princess Eirika. Princes Innes. I’ve received word from the front. The palace of Jehanna was attacked by Grado forces and has surrendered.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Innes|What? How did that...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|And the queen? Is she safe?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Seth|That remains unknown.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Innes|She may yet live. We must hurry.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Seth|The palace has already been occupied by imperial troops. The Grado army is being led by Lyon, the imperial prince.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|Lyon?!|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|L’Arachel|What it is, Eirika?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Eirika|It’s nothing... ...Lyon...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|Hey, Aias.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|Caellach...|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|That was something awful. I never expected to see you get beaten so roundly.|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Aias|Yes. It was a complete failure. The Rausten knights arrived far more quickly then I’d anticipated. But it doesn’t matter, does it? Whether I won or lost? You were planning on abandoning me from the start, weren’t you?|
FE8|13A-HamillCanyon|Caellach|...Yeah, sorry. I’m not going to let things end for me here. I want to rise... To climb higher and higher. I will not be chained to my past. I will not be chained to you. I truly apologize, but you die here. Good-bye, my friend.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Riev|So, tell me... You have ascertained Eirika’s whereabouts, have you not?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|I have. I sent some of our men to follow the princess as she fled Serafew. They tell me Eirika and her friends will be coming this way shortly. Our ambush is ready and waiting. There’s no way they can escape. Like rats in a sack, as they say. Heh heh heh...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Riev|Very good... Won’t that wretched Valter be delighted. Now about this Princess Eirika... I hear she’s quite a handful. They say her paladin withstood Valter’s lance... Tell me, Novala, are you certain you can handle this assignment?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Don’t worry. Everything is under control. I’ve brought along a certain something from Renais. It will negate whatever futile resistance they offer. Ha ha ha...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Riev|Heh heh heh... Pray it goes as you say. Very well. Do what you must. I must return to the capital.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Will you not stay and see how Eirika looks in captivity?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Riev|Unlike two other layabouts I know, I do not have such time to waste. I have much to do for out master. A mountain of tasks awaits me. My time is far too precious to waste on the likes of that royal whelp. Trifles such at these are best left in the hands of servants...such as you.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Y-yes, of course... Then...travel well.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Hmph... Freakish old man. You should have watched. You might have learned something. I will capture the princess, and I will replace you at our master’s side. You will stew in regret, and I will enjoy every moment.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Ha ha ha... Princess Eirika of Renais! Accept your fate. You have nowhere to flee!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|What?! Who are you? And where...where did you come from?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|You’re as beautiful as I’d heard... And you’re even wearing your bracelet. I suppose we should begin there. Would you surrender your lovely little trinket?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Ah!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|My bracelet... Why do you want it?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|His Majesty desires it. That’s reason enough. Once I present it to him, he will make me a general, and I will be famous. Come, hand it over. Do it quickly, and I’ll leave you alive.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Princess Eirika, you will do no such thing.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Of course not.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Obedience will save you pain. You came all this way to aid Prince Ephraim, have you not? A fool’s errand. Ephraim fell before the empire’s might. As we speak he wastes away in a cell in Renvall, meekly awaiting his execution.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|My brother?! You lie! A pitiful worm like you could never defeat my brother!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Bah. Protest all you like. It does not change the truth. Ephraim has lost, and it was Grado that defeated him!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|......|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|You’re not going to acquiesce, are you? Very well. Bring me the child.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|H-help me...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Ah!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Look familiar? She’s a citizen of your precious Renais. Now give me the bracelet! Do it, or the child dies!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|No, please... You win. But I must have your word the child will suffer no harm.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Princess, wait. That bracelet–|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|It’s not worth a child’s life. Forgive me, Seth.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Yes...there can be no mistaking it! Next, your weapons. Take them off and hand them over.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|No. Surrendering our weapons would be tantamount to suicide. You demand too much of us.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|I see years of peace and idleness have not dulled the wits of all Renais’s knights. Well then, my hostage has no more use to me, does she? Ah, such a waste. Wait a moment... I’ve just had a delicious idea. Have you heard of the giant spiders prowling about this region? They’d appreciate a nice, hot meal, wouldn’t you agree?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|You can’t–|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|Nooo!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Ha ha! This will be a delight to watch! These fools will curse the day they were born to Renais!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Why...why would you... How can you do such a thing?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|This is WAR! There are no rules here! In war, you can do anything! Anything! You curs of Renais have lost! Your idiotic ravings mean nothing...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Enough. Hold your tongue.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Wha...what?!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|I... We, the people of Renais, have long honored our allegiance with the Grado Empire. And you invaded without warning. You ravaged our land. You killed my father... Even then, I told myself, I must not hate Grado or her people. If I gave in to my hate, the bond between our lands would be lost forever. I refused to hate. Instead, I lived for the day our nations would know peace again. But... If this is Grado’s true face... If you could extinguish Renais without pity, without remorse... If this is the case, then there is no room in my heart for forgiveness.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Impudent girl! Do you expect your words to save your countrymen? They will not. Your beloved people will all die, as will you.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Ha ha ha! If you must curse someone, curse your dear princess.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|Help, someone!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Cry! Scream! HAHAHAHAHA!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|Are we gonna get eaten?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Mother|We’re going to be fine. Someone will rescue us.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Father|......|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Boy|I heard there are monstrous spiders living in the mountains to the east. They’re said to be poisonous, so I stocked up on antitoxins… This antitoxin’s strong stuff. No need to worry about poison with this around. Hey! Why don’t you go ahead and take one. Go on, you may need it. They might still eat you, but at least they won’t be able to poison you!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|Eeek! S-s-spider... Nooooo! Go away! Please, somebody, help! HEEEEELLLLPPP!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|N-noooooo!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|Eeek! S-s-spider... Nooooo! Go away! Please, somebody, help! HEEEEELLLLPPP!|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|No! It can’t be... They’ve made it this far?! Grrr... Must I do everything myself!?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Novala|Aah... Is this...the end? No fame? No...glory–|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|......|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|You’re safe now.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Girl|Wa... Waaaaaaa! I was so scared... So very, very scared.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Mother|Thank you. You saved us both. If you would like, please take this... And thank you again.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Your late father, King Fado... He ordered to keep me silent until the proper time arrived. However, with all that has happened, with Emperor Vigarde’s actions... I feel it imperative that I tell you everything, Princess Eirika. Are you ready to hear the secret of the bracelet you wear?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|I am...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|As you know, Princess... Renais houses one of the legendary Sacred Stones.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Of course. It’s in the temple. It’s supposed to be a ward against evil.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Yes, the true stone is. But the stone in the temple is nothing but a forgery. The real Sacred Stone of Renais lies beneath the royal castle. Guarding it is a powerful seal, an infinitely complex lock of sorts.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|What? Is this true?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Yes. King Fado confided in me himself. The Sacred Stoned banished evil long ago and possess power beyond our ken. The ancient kings of Renais felt it prudent to seal ours away. They feared its power could be misused. They thought to remove the temptation. The keys to break the seal were hidden, too... Forged into bracelets... ...The very ones that you and your brother, Prince Ephraim, wear.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Our bracelets? How could Father keep this a secret from me for so long?|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|They must know nothing of the bracelets. Tell them only if some great peril strikes.?These were King Fado’s exact orders. Prince Ephraim knows nothing of the bracelets?secret, either. The king told me this out of fear that something might happen to him. So that, when the time came, the two of you would learn the truth.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|The bracelets have such meaning...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Yes. And we are the only living souls who know the secret of the Stone of Renais. At least, that’s what I was given to believe. And yet...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Yet the Grado army has made it clear that they want me only for my bracelet.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Yes, quite clear at that... I don’t know how, but Emperor Vigarde must have learned the secret somehow. And now, his troops pursue the bracelet, and we are no closer to knowing his motives.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|He would use the bracelets to unlock the Sacred Stone and destroy it in secret...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Perhaps.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Which means that my brother... and his bracelet...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|If he’s been captured, they may have the bracelet already, and he may be–|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|Ephraim...|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Seth|Princess, we must take Novala’s words to be true. We must hurry to Prince Ephraim. The enemy soldiers who fled the battle will have reported our location by now. If the prince is being held prisoner at Renvall... I fear they might execute him once they learn of our approach.|
FE8|06-VictimsOfWar|Eirika|You’re right. We’ve no time to waste. We must hurry to Renvall! Let’s go rescue my brother!|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|Princess Tana! Grado’s forces are approaching!|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|What? So soon? Ah, we’ve had no time!|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|Milady, we lack the arms to defend this place. You must return to Castle Frelia.|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|I can’t! Not yet. We haven’t found Eirika and her companions yet. Eirika is my friend, and she needs my help. I won’t abandon her. Oh, I know! Go and ask Father– I mean King Hayden for more troops.|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|Yes, Your Highness!|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Eirika, please be safe.|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|Commander Breguet, the enemy appears to be fortifying its position in the castle.|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Hmph. They’re tenacious, but they have no hope of stopping our advance.|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|What are your orders, sir?|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Ha! Orders? You just stand here and watch. I’ll crush them myself!|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|As you command, sir.|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Ha! That’s what happens when you face my lance!|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|St-stop right there! Call off your forces and turn back, or you’ll have me to deal with!|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Is that so? And who might you be?|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Who–? I am Tana, Princess of Frelia. I will not permit you to abuse my country any longer.|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Frelia’s royal brat, huh? How convenient...|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Leave this castle immediately. If you harm me, my father and brother will chase you to the earth’s end.|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Yes, I’ve heard of how King Hayden dotes on his precious little daughter. Let’s see how true that is. You’ll make us a fine hostage, my dear. Seize the girl and lock her up!|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|Right away, sir!|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|No! Let me go!|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Seth, look...|
FE8|01-Escape|Seth|I see it. It seems like Grado’s army has already reached Frelia. Princess, this place is perilous. We should bypass Mulan altogether and head straight to the castle.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|But we can’t just ignore this... You were there when Renais was invaded... You saw what I saw. You saw how the people suffered at the hands of Grado’s soldiers. Homes were destroyed, possessions stolen, women kidnapped... Anyone who resisted was executed without question, without hesitation.|
FE8|01-Escape|Seth|...|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Please, Seth. I can’t allow that to happen here. I don’t want to see any more people harmed by Grado’s atrocities.|
FE8|01-Escape|Seth|All right, Princess. I understand. Perhaps we can retake Mulan. But, Princess, you must act with caution. Your people need you, too.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Of course, Seth. Come on! Let’s go!|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Hm? Is that the princess of Renais? Ha ha! It really is my lucky day! Fame and fortune ride to meet me! Move on, you slugs! Bring that girl to me!|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|Sir Gilliam, is that Mulan? Have we reached Frelia’s border already?|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|Aye, we have. Her Highness Princess Tana should be inside the castle.|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|But look — the countryside is crawling with Grado soldiers! Where’s the castle guard! Has Mulan fallen? Are we too late?|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|Too tough to say from here. Princess Tana’s in no danger if they want her as a bargaining tool. We men of the Eastern Watch will see her to safety.|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|Yes...Yes, of course. We mustn’t give up. We must move. We must retake the castle. Then, we ride forth to Princess Eirika’s aid.|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|I’ve stronger armor then you do. I’ll take the lead. Watch my back.|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|Princess Eirika, it is good to see you’re well.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Franz, you made it through unscathed...|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|Y-yes, Your Highness! I met up with Sir Gilliam of Frelia and explained the situation in Renais. He told me that Princess Tana was in danger as well, here at Mulan. We rode as swiftly as we could.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Tana is here? Franz, we must hurry!|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|Understood!|
FE8|01-Escape|Seth|Is that you, Franz? I’m relieved to see you’re still in one piece!|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|Y-yes... and you as well, General. As long as you lead us, sir, the Knights of Renais cannot lose!|
FE8|01-Escape|Seth|Franz, you and I must work together to protect Princess Eirika. I want you to ride with us.|
FE8|01-Escape|Franz|Sir! With honor, sir!|
FE8|01-Escape|Man|The rumors are true, aren’t they? The Grado army’s taken over the castle. It looks like they’ve seized the castle gate, too. Smart work–the gate provides defense and heals wounds to boot. They must be fierce warriors to have taken the gate. Watch yourself.|
FE8|01-Escape|Man|That knight encamped at the castle was wearing the finest armor I’ve seen. It looked like it could turn aside almost any blade you swing at it. I know my armor, though. I wager a good rapier or armorslayer could get through it.|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|Bah, what a worthless lot of curs I’ve been assigned!|
FE8|01-Escape|Breguet|This...this can’t be... I...|
FE8|01-Escape|Soldier|I’ve found them! Stragglers from Renais! Don’t let them get away!|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|Princess Tana.|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Sir Gilliam... I’m sorry, I never meant to cause you such trouble.|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|It was no trouble. I live to serve, Princess.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Tana!|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|...Eirika?!? Is that really you?|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Tana, what are you doing, so far form Castle Frelia?|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|I heard that Renais had fallen, and I was so worried... But I’m glad to see that you’re safe... Wait! Where is Ephraim? Is he well?|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|I wish I knew.|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|You haven’t heard from him? Oh, I hope he’s not been harmed... Come, we must go to Castle Frelia. My lord father may know something.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Thank you, Tana.|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Oh, Tana... I’m grateful to see that you’re safe and home again! You’ve no idea how I worried when I heard you were under attack at Border Mulan. You are not to leave again without my permission. Do you understand?|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Don’t be mad, Father. Look, I come bearing good news. Eirika! Come out now!|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|King Hayden, I am please to see you again, even in these sad times.|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Ah, Eirika! It does my heart good to see you safe.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Thank you. I was able to escape the castle before Renais fell. But I’m not sure if my father...|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Yes. I... have received word of your father.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Your Highness? Please tell me. If my father well?|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|...My friend King Fado...did not survive the fall of Renais Castle.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|...No, it cannot be...|
FE8|01-Escape|Seth|......|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Rest assured, Grado will be punished for its cowardly act. This is Frelia’s promise. Eirika, please stay here and rest. I cannot imagine how exhausted you must be.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|......|
FE8|01-Escape|Seth|King Hayden. You know of Prince Ephraim’s disappearance, do you not?|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Yes, we hear the prince and his men hound Grado at every turn. It’s said that he’s led his forces into the empire itself. Reports suggest he’s crossed the border and now fights in Renvall.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|My brother... He fights on? Even now?|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Yes. My pegasus knights bought this information at a great price. Even though Renais has fallen, he charges into the enemy’s heart. He is truly Fado’s son... What a valiant youth. I wish I knew whether he remains unharmed, but I do not.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|King Hayden, I thank you for your offer, but I cannot stay. I intend to ride to my brother’s side with reinforcements.|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|I cannot allow it. I know how you feel, but this plan is suicide. I would be betraying Fado’s memory if I allowed any harm to befall you. Stay here. Rest and mourn. Leave this war to the warriors.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|I know you mean well, Your Majesty. However, I have lost my father, and my twin brother is in peril. My brother, he is a part of me... I cannot rest here in peace while he risks his life.|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|No. Renais has no more army. Grado’s forces decimated it. I wish Frelia could provide you with support, with soldiers, but... My son, Innes, is on his way to meet the empire’s forces. We cannot spare a single brigade. Your own retinue of knights cannot possibly face Grado alone. Are you so determined to go?|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Yes. ...With apologies.|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|...As resolute as your father, eh? What am I to do in the face of such foolhardy determination? Vanessa.|
FE8|01-Escape|Vanessa|Here, Your Highness!|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Moulder.|
FE8|01-Escape|Moulder|You called, my king?|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|Gilliam.|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|Yes, sire?|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|You are to accompany Princess Eirika of Renais into Grado territory. I expect each of you to provide aid and support for her brother.|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|Hmm. Quite a grave responsibility you’ve given us.|
FE8|01-Escape|Vanessa|No matter the obstacles, we will perform our duty.|
FE8|01-Escape|Gilliam|Our lives are yours.|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|These are some of my most trusted and stalwart vassals. They will, no doubt, prove themselves quite valuable on your journey. Remember, you are venturing behind enemy lines. You will need supplies. I will have a supply convoy readied to carry your weapons and provisions. It will remain at your side, no matter how far afield you venture.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|King Hayden, I... Thank you.|
FE8|01-Escape|Hayden|No, save your thanks for your return... with your brother, Prince Ephraim.|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Yes, Your highness!|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Eirika, you don’t really intend to go through with this, do you? I can’t guess how you must feel, but its’ just too dangerous. What would happen if you were captured by Grado’s men?|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Thank you for your concern, Tana. But I have no choice. Don’t you see, Tana? I have to go.|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Eirika... Oh, why is this happening? What’s gone wrong with the world?|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|Tana...|
FE8|01-Escape|Tana|Why would Grado invade? Emperor Vigarde is a man of peace. His people adore him. And you and Ephraim are friends with Prince Lyon, are you not? What could be behind this madness? Why is this happening...|
FE8|01-Escape|Eirika|I have no answers for you, Tana. I don’t want to believe it, but the reality is that we are at war. If I do nothing, I may lose my brother as well as my father. This is why I have to fight. It’s the only answer I have.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|We’re almost there! Come on! My teacher lives just up ahead.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Slow down, Ewan. Let’s stick together.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|...This fog’s getting thick. I don’t expect any more surprise attacks, but that doesn’t mean we–|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Quick worrying, mister! You’re gonna get left behind.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|...Don’t speak to me, boy. I don’t tolerate insolence.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Innes, he’s only a child. There’s no reason to be so rude. He is helping us after all.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|That’s right. Without me, you’d never get where you’re going. So come on already!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|Stop. Don’t take another step.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Huh? That’s gonna make it awfully hard to get where we need to go.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|...What do you know about that fort? It looks like it’s been abandoned for some time. Is anyone using it?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Nope. It’s really run-down. Nobody ever goes there. It’s been empty for ages. I’ve been inside, so I know.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|Is that right? Then what’s that sound, and where is it coming from?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Huh? What sound? Hey, you’re right... I do hear a weird noise. You could hear that? Neat! You’ve got really good hearing. I wonder what it is...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|There it is again. Prince, is this...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|Eirika.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Yes?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|Get your troops ready. Tell them to prepare for battle... We’ve been spotted. Monsters are coming.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Tethys|Ewan, it’s dangerous here. Get behind me.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|No way. I’m gonna fight too.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Tethys|No. You’re too young. You’re not ready for this. Are you going to do as I say or not? I don’t know what I would do if you were to get injured.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Oh...OK.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|What spacious chambers. Hm... A bit musty, but I like it. I’ve decided. We’ll bed here for the night. I do wonder where Rennac disappeared to, though. I told him not to wander off, but...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Hmph! Lady L’Arachel, this could be trouble.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|What is it, Dozla?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Look there! Through that break in the fog... Looks like we’ve got some nasty creatures running ’bout this place.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|...I can’t see a thing. But this can be nothing but good fortune shining down on us again. Losing our way in the mountains and running into these abominations? There can be no doubt: we were brought here to destroy these foul things! Come, Dozla! We fight!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! My heart cries out for battle!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|You... L’Arachel!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|Hello! So it’s true! Blessings do come in threes!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|L’Arachel, this place is dangerous. You should find safe haven elsewhere.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|Oh, you needn’t worry about us. As you well know, my divine mission is to purge the land of these obscenities. I will show you the splendor that is L’Arachel in action! Bear witness!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|If you insist. At least let us join forces for the time being.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|Dozla.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! What is it, Lady L’Arachel?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|We’re going to join these good people and eradicate these unclean monstrosities.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Sounds fun! What would you have me to do?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|Oh, just carry on in your normal manner: destroy, destroy, destroy. But do be sure to enjoy yourself.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! I am your obedient servant!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Thank you, L’Arachel.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|Please, speak nothing of it. It is heaven’s dictate that I come here to cleanse this charming place of monsters. What’s important is– Oh my! I just realized I have not yet had the honor of your name.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Oh, you’re right. How strange... We’ve met so often now that I had assumed you already... Please forgive my lack of manners. My name is Eirika.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Seth|Milady...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|It’s all right, Seth. She’s clearly not our enemy.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|Eirika... Aha! So you must be Princess Eirika of Renais! It is simply an honor to meet you. And how strange that we should meet again in this place. You must be lost as well. This continent is so confusing.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Um, yes. Actually, we’re not lost at all. You see...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|Is that so! Well, clearly, I must be allowed to accompany you.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|You want to travel with us? I appreciate your offer, but our journey is far too perilous. I do not wish to pull you into this madness.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|No, no, no. There can be no doubt that we were sent here to aid you. It is all part of the grand design. I, L’Arachel, shall play my role and fulfill my divine duties. This I swear!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Seth|Are you sure this is wise, Princess?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Don’t worry, Seth.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|...Well, that’s that, Dozla. You and I are now traveling with Eirika and her companions.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! I understand. For you, Lady L’Arachel, I would do absolutely anything! I would run to the ends of this world and dive into a sea of evil!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|L’Arachel|How very like you, my dear, dedicated Dozla! So noble! Come! We’re off!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Dozla|Gwah ha ha!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Teeeaaaacher... Hellooooooo... That’s strange. He’s not here. Must be out wandering again.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|He’s out? That poses a problem. Do you know when he’ll return?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Hmmm... I don’t know. He often goes out and looks for people in need.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Saleh|...I believe I told you it would be best to stay away.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Saleh|I’ve been charged with a mission and must depart again soon.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|Ah! Teacher!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Y-you... We’ve met before, haven’t we? You were looking for someone...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Saleh|...Oh, yes. And now we meet again.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|These people say they want to go through Caer Pelyn. I could guide them myself, but I thought it might be better if you went, too. That’s why I brought them here. What do you say? Will you guide them?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Saleh|......|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Would you, please?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Saleh|...Very well. I’m heading there now. If you need to go to Caer Pelyn, you’re free to follow me.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|You don’t mind?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Saleh|We have little interest in the outside world, but we do not refuse travelers. I should warn you: the road is not easy, and you look very weary. You should rest a night before attempting the mountains.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|We do need rest, it’s true. We are all exhausted from our encounter with those creatures. We must give our men time to heal, or they’ll be useless in an emergency.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Ewan|It’s settled then. I’ll go on ahead and let the elder know we’re coming. See? Even when there’s no fighting to be done, I’m still useful!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|No, wait! ...He’s gone. I wonder if he’ll be all right.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|Idiotic boy. I understand his need to be helpful, but...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Saleh|Ewan knows this land well. You needn’t worry about him. We’ll depart at sunrise. I suggest you all get some rest.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|Princess Eirika of Renais. Hold.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Who? You.. You’re General Glen of Grado. We met once in the capital, didn’t we? You were very kind to me. However, if you’re here now, I have to assume this means...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|Yes, it does. I wish our reunion could come under different circumstances. Eirika, I must tell you, I come here on the direct orders of the emperor. I’m to bring to justice the rebel army leader who’s been terrorizing Carcino. It’s you, Eirika. They say you’ve been murdering innocents.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|What? Wait! What do you mean? I...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|...If you have something to say, I would hear it. I know all too well that Grado has robbed you of your homeland, but even so... I do not believe revenge could drive a woman like you to such depths. And yet... here you are in Carcino with a small army under your command. And the emperor tells us that you massacred everyone in Port Kiris.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|That... That’s a lie! I could never...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|Go on.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|...This is ridiculous. Believe what you want. Could one of the legendary Imperial Three honestly be as stupid as this?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|...What do you mean?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|Carcino betrayed Frelia and set a pack of mercenary dogs to kill me. And you paint Eirika a rebel instigator? It’s an absurd farce. Your emperor commits horrors, and you believe Eirika is a criminal?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|...What are you saying?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Innes|You truly are blind, aren’t you? You’re one of the Imperial Three, and yet you can’t see your emperor’s plan?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|That’s enough, Innes. There’s no need to provoke him. General Glen, we’ve told you what we know to be true, what we’ve seen firsthand. We don’t want to fight you... But if you push us, we will drive you back to Grado with your tail between your legs.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|...I see. You...are more observant than you know. I am ignorant of the emperor’s designs. General Duessel and I both questioned the wisdom of this war. And if you really are innocent of the crimes attributed to you... Why would His Majesty lie to us? I must know the answer.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|So, you...believe us?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|The Princess Eirika I met long ago was kind and merciful in spirit. You’ve faced relentless hardship, and yet that selfsame spirit remains true. ...Let’s put our fight aside for now. I will learn the truth. Then I will once again perform the duties of my office. If you have lied to me today, I will hound you to the very grave itself.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Eirika|Very well...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Glen. Where do you think you’re going?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|Valter...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Tsk, tsk. What am I to make of this? Those little birds I saw flitting away into the mountains looked vaguely familiar. What do you suppose would happen if it were known you let Eirika escape?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|Do as you will. I’m returning to the capital. I have questions for the emperor. Clear the path, Valter.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Hold on now. No reason to rush off, is there? After all, this is where you’re going to die. See?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|...What are you babbling about?|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Heh heh... We were a grand trio–the Imperial Three: You, Duessel, and me. But my place among you was stolen, and I was exiled from Grado.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|You slaughtered people who had no intention of fighting. The emperor’s punishment was just and warranted.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Heh heh...heh heh heh... After my fall from glory, only desire kept me alive. Desire for revenge. My hatred burned so fierce that I was only barely able to keep my sanity. That hatred keeps me warm still today. Oh, how it burns...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|......|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Hear me, Glen, wyvern general of the Imperial Three. I live for battle. I crave it. I have no need for peace. That is why you must die.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|Cur! You’re mad!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|A battle between generals... Sends the spirit soaring, eh? Come, Glen! Entertain me! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Glen|Urrgh...|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Go. The small fish are yours.|
FE8|11-CreepingDarkness|Valter|Heh heh... This is merely the beginning. Endless battle, war without end... Heh heh... ha hahahahahaha!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|The local villagers tell me that Bazba’s Bandits keep their lair nearby. A few of them saw a lad matching the description of our bracelet thief. It seems a fair guess that the youth is one of these bandits.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|Bandits...Here in Renais, our homeland. I had no idea... Burning out villages...Stealing from out people with no fear of reprisal?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|It wasn’t always like this. The knights used to protect the citizenry... However, with Renais in ruins and her army tattered, law and order are hard to find. It doesn’t look like the Grado army is interested in maintaining order here. If nothing changes, Renais will continue this sad plunge into savagery.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|......|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Uh...Hello?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Pardon me for asking... but are you all some sort of...mercenary troop?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|Why do you ask?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|P-p-please, you have to help Colm. You have to! I told him it was too dangerous, but he wouldn’t listen to me!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|Please, you must calm yourself. Start at the beginning, and speak slowly.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|All right...Sniff. I’m Neimi. I’m from... I used to be from a village named Lark... Except the village is gone.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|Gone? What do you mean?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Bazba’s Bandits burned it down. Only Colm and I escaped. The other villagers... The bandits attacked them and...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|......|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|Neimi, what are you doing here?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Bazba’s Bandits... They have a hideout here in these mountains. That’s where Colm... Um, Colm’s my...uh...We’ve known each other since we were kids. He went to steal back something the bandits took from me...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|He went alone? That’s a very dangerous thing...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Yes, I know. Th-that’s what I told him, but he wouldn’t listen to me. If I lose Colm, too, I don’t know... I...I’ll... sniff...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|Wait, please don’t cry. Don’t worry. We’ll find your friend and see that he’s not harmed.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Really? Really and truly? Oh, thank you! Thank you!!! I... I don’t have much money, but.. I’ll do anything to help.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|Your Highness? What will it be?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|If the thief we’re after has gone to the bandits?lair as well... Well, it seems as though we share a common cause with Neimi. She is a citizen of Renais, after all. And isn’t it our duty to defend our countrymen? I’m only sad that we weren’t here to protect her friends and neighbors... So, yes, I feel we must help her.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|Very well. Neimi, I trust you can lead the way?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Er, yes... It’s this way.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Um... Is there anything I can do to help? I feel so... When I was little I used to go hunting with my grandfather. What I mean is I can– I’m not bad with a bow.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|Really?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Uh-huh.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|I see. You should remain behind and protect Princess Eirika.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Bazba|Hm. Not sure who’s out there, but it looks like we’ve got guests. Let’s give ’em a warm welcome, lads. You see a stranger, stick an axe in him!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|And here we go! Ha! And not a soul saw me. These bandits are easy picking. I guess I might as well start with these chests here.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|C-Colm...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Neimi?! What are you doing here? I told you to wait for me, didn’t I?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|I couldn’t... It’s too dangerous. C’mon, let’s go home.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|We don’t have a home! Don’t you get it? Look, just leave everything to me. I can take care of it in a flash, but I don’t need a clumsy oaf like you tagging along.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|But...but...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Oh, this is ridiculous. We’ll talk later. Don’t leave my side, Neimi.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|I–All right.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Bazba|I’m the head of this bandit pack, the mighty Bazba! Hope you’ve enjoyed your life, ‘cuz it’s about to end!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Bazba|I’m the...mighty...Bazba... This...ain’t–|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|C-Colm...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|What now? I told you not to worry. I could’ve robbed these bandits blind on my own, thank you very much.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|I was... worried...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|H-Hold on! I’m sorry! C’mon! Don’t start bawling!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Aaah...sniff... No more...dangerous stuff... by yourself...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Fine, fine. I promise. But you have to stop crying all the time. All right?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Uh-huh...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Oh, yeah. Take a look at this.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Hm?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|I got your mirror back. Remember how you cried when we left Lark? You thought you’d lost this. I knew it was your mother’s, and I knew those thugs had taken it. So I went and got it back! See what happens when you give me a job? Guaranteed results!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Neimi|Colm... Aa...Waaah... Colm...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Hey Wh-why are you crying this time? C’mon! Stop! Knock it off! Please, Neimi...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|...This is quite touching, but... I think you’d best return Princess Eirika’s bracelet to her now.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Wh-what are you talking about? Are you trying to say that I–|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Whoa! Whoa there! Hold it! It’s right here! Take it!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|...... Tell me, boy, is this the path you’ve chosen for your life? If this girl matters to you, you must quit this dark road.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Uh, yeah...Right.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|We’re leaving. Do not expect to be rescued again. Farewell.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|...Hey, wait! Let us go with you. You can’t just leave us here.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|Pardon?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|Neimi and I... We’ve got no home to return to. No matter where we go, there’s just gonna be more fighting. You’re mercenaries, right? Well, then take us with you. I’m a handy guy to have around. I know I can help you out.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|I would prefer not, but I’ll agree with Eirika’s decision. Our duty is a grave one however. We’ve no time to waste shepherding you.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Colm|That’s fine with us You just wait– I promise you won’t regret your decision.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|I retrieved your bracelet from the bandit’s stronghold. Here you are, Princess.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|Thank you, Seth. You know...Father gave me this bracelet when I was a child. It has only one match in the world, and my brother wears it.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|Lady Eirika, you must take care never to lose that bracelet. It is the proof that King Fado entrusted the future of Renais to you, his children.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|Seth...What is it you’re not telling me?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|...I apologize, Your Highness. When the times comes, I will tell you what I know. Until then, I...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|I see. If you tell me it must wait, then it can wait. I trust you.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|Then we should get moving again. We’re safe from bandits for now, but I can’t guarantee for how long.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|This... This is just the beginning, isn’t it? If we hope to free out homeland, it will take battle after battle...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Seth|I’m afraid so, Your Highness. The day you and Prince Ephraim win back the freedom and honor of Renais will come. But I fear it lies at the end of a long and treacherous road.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Eirika|I know. I must fight for that day. In the names of all those I could not save, I’ll lead us home. Let’s go. My brother awaits!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Selena|General Duessel.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Duessel|Selena. Have you been back long? Tell me, how fares the campaign in Renais?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Selena|Signs of chaos abound. Brigands ride without fear, and the peasant’s cries fill the air.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Duessel|Hmm... If Grado’s troops do not enforce public order, the situation will only worsen. And still, His Majesty has given us no orders. Perhaps, just this once, I should take the lead...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Glen|What could His Majesty be thinking? Breaking our long-held alliance with Renais–invading without warning... He’s never been this way before. He abhors violence.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Selena|......|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Glen|And have you noticed the recent promotions? Who are they are going to? Certainly not to the soldiers who have Grado’s best interests at heart. I feel this invasion is the prelude to a much larger war. I feel as though His Majesty is no longer the man we knew him to be.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Selena|Glen, it doesn’t matter what any of us might think of our orders. We are his servants, and we will not question His Majesty’s intentions.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Glen|I know that, Selena. And yet...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Duessel|That’s enough. Both of you. His Majesty summons us. Let’s hope we can learn a little during our audience.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Vigarde|...I appreciate your work in fulfilling your previous orders. You are the hammers that drive the nails of the empire’s will... You will continue to operate ...without hesitation... wherever I send you.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Duessel|By your command.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Selena|In Your Majesty’s name.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Glen|Yes, sire...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Vigarde|...However, I know this... You, my Imperial Three, lack the strength to conquer the remaining nations alone. In the invasion of Renais, certain soldiers performed beyond expectation. I have chosen them to join you as new generals in the empire’s service. ...Come.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Vigarde|...The performance of these men surpassed even your own. With the addition of these three... The empire will have six generals strong enough to conquer this land. Do you understand?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Riev|Heh heh heh... I am Riev, given the name Blood Beryl by His Majesty. I know I am a newcomer, but I pray for your favor.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Duessel|...Understood.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Caellach|I’m Caellach. I was a mercenary, fighting in the desert. Seems I’m to be called Tiger Eye... You’re a fine lookin’ lass, aren’t you? Yeah, I’m gonna love working with you.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Selena|......|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Valter|So we meet again. You know me as General Valter, but you will call me the Moonstone. I’ll save you worthless dogs from your own incompetence. You’ll thank me later.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Glen|Valter... You scum!|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Duessel|Peace, Glen.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Vigarde|Selena. Caellach. You will bring me Frelia.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Selena|Yes, sire.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Caellach|Sure. Good as done.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Vigarde|Riev. Duessel. You are charged with the defense of the empire. ...I will speak to you individually with more details later.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Riev|Heh heh heh... Understood, Your Majesty.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Duessel|By your command, sire.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Valter|And me?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Vigarde|Valter, Glen... I have other duties for you...|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Glen|Yes, Your Majesty?|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Vigarde|Renais has fallen, but Princess Eirika still eludes us... Her brother, Prince Ephraim, leads a resistance within our borders. Bring the siblings to me.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Valter|Ha ha.. Of course.|
FE8|03-TheBanditsOfBorgo|Glen|......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|...I yield. The point is yours, Eirika. You’re swift, aren’t you? Compared to you, I’m– I’ve been bested at fencing by a woman. Pitiful crown prince, am I not?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|That’s not true...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Oh, no, Eirika. It is. The people need a strong ruler. They don’t want a weakling like me. They want the strength you and Ephraim share. My body is frail. I prefer to spend my time locked away in the castle, reading... I think my father would be better served if someone else took my place. I’m sure all of our retainers feel the same...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|You’re wrong, Lyon. An emperor without compassion will never hold the people’s love. And one day, your compassion will surely save us all. I believe that.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Eirika... Thank you. Yes. I...I will do my best. Even though I lack your strength, there must be some good I can do.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|There is.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|By the way, Eirika... If it please you, would you accept this?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Seth|Princess Eirika? Is there something wrong?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|N-no. It’s nothing.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Seth|Jehanna Hall has been completely occupied by Grado soldiers. I’m sorry to report that Queen Ismaire is already...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|And the one giving orders to the troops in the palace is Crown Prince Lyon?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|What is there to give us pause? Should we not storm the palace and retake it by strength of arms?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|Frelia’s spy network reports that Prince Lyon is an initiate of dark magic. If this is true, even approaching him will be a serious challenge. I’d heard the prince dislikes violence. However, it could all have been a ruse.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|.......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|Still, if we don’t retake the palace, we’ve no hope of defeating Grado. We must rescue the queen, no matter the cost...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|I understand. Let’s go!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Queen Ismaire... Please do not resist. I have no desire to see you harmed.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Carlyle... Why have you betrayed us? After all these years of loyal service as Jehanna’s most decorated commander... Without you, I could not have ruled these long years since my husband’s passing. It was through your unwavering support alone that I still sit upon the throne. You are the cornerstone of Jehanna. You have held my trust more than any man. So tell me why. Why have you betrayed us? Why have you betrayed me?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Your Highness–No... My queen... Ismaire... It is your own fault. You are too lovely, my queen.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Carlyle...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|The first time I met you, twenty years ago now... I saw you in the garden of this very palace... and I was bewitched. Your pale beauty far surpassed that of any flower. I was in the grips of an unforgivable desire. You were the wife of my king, to whom I’d sworn life and loyalty. I told myself a grand lie that day. I told myself I could be happy simply serving you as your most loyal knight.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|After years of duty, years of service, years of...of silence... I became aware once more of the feelings I’d buried deep within myself. How could I leave this world without expressing my true desires? Could anything be more desolate? More devoid of meaning? That is when I made my decision. I would follow my heart and claim your hand as my own.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Carlyle... You forget yourself. You ruin our country and kill our countrymen. Did you think I would be pleased? Did you think I would love you for this?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|I need no country. I care nothing for my countrymen. I can see nothing but you. If you would only be mine...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Carlyle...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Soldier|To arms, mercenaries. We’re under attack! You there! Ready your weapons!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|What?!? No, no, no. That was never part of the deal. The only fight I’m here for is with the locks of the treasure chamber.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Soldier|Hah... Don’t get so excited. I doubt you mercenaries will see any action at all once we soldiers’ve finished.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Yeah, great. You go do that. Whew... With all these soldiers around, I shouldn’t have to lift a finger. I’ll just sit here and wait for them to win they day. Then, I collect my pay! No more being ordered around by that selfish princess and her moronic bodyguard. This is the life. Lady Luck loves me. But something doesn’t feel right...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Hey, Carlyle! Impressive work you’ve done here. My compliments.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|...I gave you everything I promised. I opened the hall to your forces.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Yes. The palace is mine. My palace... Oh, how I do like the sound of that.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Do whatever you want with the royal treasury. The only treasure I wish to leave here with is the queen of my heart.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Oh, yeah, about your queen?.. There’s been a change of plans.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Ah!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Don’t move, Carlyle. You twitch, and the queen dies.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Blackheart! What is the meaning of this?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Calm down. You’ll get her back as soon as I’m done with her. Jehanna’s Sacred Stone is around here somewhere. I’ve got to find it and destroy it. I need this woman to guide me to its hiding place.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Do not lay a hand on my queen!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Don’t get so incensed. I’m not going to harm her. I’m not like that freak Valter. I’m kind to women. But if you make a wrong move, you’ll lose your prize. Understood?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Yes...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|There are some annoying pests outside who think to win back the hall. I want you to take care of them. Lose, and the queen will never be yours.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|...... If my queen comes to any harm in your care...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Yes, of course. I know all about the might of your sword arm. As long as the Sacred Stone is destroyed, you’ll get all you ask for.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Greetings, Prince. Let’s get going.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Caellach... You will put an end to this. Destroying the Sacred Stones is... Ugh...ack...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|What’s this? Are you still ill? You know, you’re not very princely. C’mon. Follow me.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Caellach...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Hey, that’s a comely lass. Think I’ll have a few words... Wait. Er, haven’t I met you before?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|You... You were traveling with L’Arachel before, weren’t you?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Oh, yeah... Renais... I’ve got to get–|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|L’Arachel is traveling with us. Should I let her know you’re here?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Uh, no! Wait a moment! You... You don’t have to bother her. Actually I wanted to ask you something. How would you like to hire me? The name’s Rennac. I’m a world-class thief, and proud of it. A man of many talents. Lockpicks are for amateurs. I can pick chests and doors with my bare hands. And I’m better with a blade than most swordsmen.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Uh...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|I’m a useful fellow to have around. And cheap, too! Only 9,980 gold! Well, what do you think?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Fine. I’ll pay the 9,980 gold.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Very good! You know a bargain when you see one, don’t you? Not at all like a certain pious princess I know.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Were you speaking of L’Arachel?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Uh, no... Idle chitchat about that lass is bound to land me in hot water. Right, then! You’re my new boss. Point out any doors or chests, and get out of my way!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|Aha! So this is where you’ve wandered off to, Rennac!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Princess L’Arachel? Uh-oh, um...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|Come with me.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Wait... hold on now. Go with you where? Look, sorry, but I’ve been hired by the Grado Empire, and... Hello! I’m talking to you!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|Rennac, whatever is the matter? I promise to listen to your story later, but now, we must be going!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|No, I’m no servant, like that kook Dozla. I’m a mercenary. I escorted you to Renais like I was hired to do, didn’t I? You have no right to drag me across creation without any pay whatsoever!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|Is this about wages? I believe you’ve received ample compensation.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Ample?! Do you even know what that word means? You’ve the princess of Rausten! I thought working for you would pay well. Yet your purse strings are knotted tight, and I’ve almost been killed so many–|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|The joy that comes from doing good is not something that can be purchased. There. All better? Let’s go.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|NO! I said I don’t want to! Riding with you is– ...And there she goes. Oh...By the Stones, why did I ever take that job in the first place?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|We must hurry, Rennac.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Rennac|Right, right. I’m coming...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|I...I just wanted the two of us...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Carlyle|Queen Ismaire. I’m–|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|This is as good a place as any. All right, Your Majesty. Hand over the Sacred Stone.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|...I know nothing of the Sacred Stone’s keeping place.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Don’t waste me time. My partner here sees everything. When the rebellion began, you went straight to the palace altar. You had hoped to prevent us from smashing the Sacred Stone. But you have the Stone of Jehanna with you right now, don’t you?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Hand it over. Cooperate, and I’ll let you live.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|...I cannot.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Oh, give it up, will you? I’ve no time for games. If you resist, I’ll just kill you and take it anyway.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|H-hold! You mustn’t harm her, Caellach...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Shut up, Prince. My orders come from higher than you. You’ve not going to start disobeying his word, are you?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Last chance. Give me your Sacred Stone.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|...I cannot.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Ha ha! A queen to the end. I like you. You’ve got guts. Good-bye.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Ah!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|And here’s the Sacred Stone. That makes two for me. I’m on a roll now.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|And another Sacred Stone has been destroyed. Grado, Frelia, and now Jehanna... Only two stones remain.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Uuh...ahh...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Ah... What should I do? C-Caellach... You must help her.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|Leave her. Let her last breath be a harsh and ragged rasp. She’s not long for this world. Why, if you really wanted to help her, you’d deliver the final blow yourself!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|N-no. I couldn’t.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Caellach|...What a joke. I have a little work to wrap up in the hall before we leave. You should hit the road pretty soon, too, Prince.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|I wonder where Queen Ismaire is.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|I heard she was in the throne room, but there’s no sight of her. And there’s no Sacred Stone, either.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|We must search quickly.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Ah...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Lyon!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Eirika...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Wait, Lyon! Don’t run away! My brother and I have been so worried about you... We know more then anyone the gentleness of your spirit. Your father is deranged, isn’t he? That’s why Grado invaded Renais, right? Tell me, Lyon... Please... Tell me what has happened.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|I’m sorry, Eirika. I’ve wanted to see you and Ephraim for so long now... I wanted to see you so that I could apologize. The invasion of Renais... I couldn’t stop it. I’m sorry, but I still cannot talk to you. Not yet...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|You... You have a reason, don’t you?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Mm... I can’t talk about it now, but... I promise I will tell you everything someday.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|I see... I believe you, Lyon. I must tell you, I’m a little relieved. I was afraid you’d changed as much as your poor father has. I’m so glad.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|Me, too, Eirika... No, you have changed. You’re even more beautiful than you were before.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|L-Lyon...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Lyon|I’m sorry, I have to go. But please remember this. This war started because I was too weak to stop it, but... I’ll always be your friend.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Lyon...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|Eirika, what are you doing? It seems Queen Ismaire has been found. This way!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Y-yes. Coming!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|Queen Ismaire... Is she...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Seth|We’re too late. Her injuries are... She will not last much longer.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|...Jo...Joshua... ...Joshua...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Queen Ismaire!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Oh, Joshua... Where is...that boy...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Queen Ismaire...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Please forgive me, Joshua... I was a foolish mother... I was so intent on being queen that I spared no time to be your mother. But I loved you nonetheless... Please understand...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|..... I know, Mother.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Joshua...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Joshua... It really is you... Joshua...my son...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|I’m sorry, Mother. I should never have left you. I’ve no excuse... I wanted to see the world as a man, not as a prince. I wanted to be worthy. I planned on returning to your side afterward... I was so foolish. If I’d been here, I could have–|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|No, it’s fine. You’re here now... Listen to me, Joshua. The Stone of Jehanna has... been destroyed. The one who tempted Carlyle is responsible...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|What? Who was it?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|...Carried a dark stone... It is...the origin of all this... It should not exist... Joshua...you must... Our country...our people...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|I understand, Mother.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Thank you...Joshua... I have something... Something I must give you...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|This is...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|It’s one of the Sacred Twin relics, unique to House Jehanna... He who would rule our land must possess it... I’ve watched over it since your father passed away. I kept it safe and waited for this day to come...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|Mother... I have it now. I understand its meaning...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Ismaire|Joshua... My...dear, sweet child...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|Mother...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|It’s been more than ten years. I’d grown tied of the formality of palace life, so I...just left. I wrote a farewell and left the palace, taking nothing with me. I felt I could never understand the people while I stayed sequestered in a castle. I abandoned my identity and roamed the continent, working where I could. I wanted only to be worthy of becoming king. I knew one day I would return. Gods, I was so foolish! I was such a child, I see it now. Was I simply rebelling against my mother? Punishing her for tending to her duties?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|......|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|I was a fool, yes, but I learned much over these ten years. I have learned about the hearts of our people, how they need to be governed. I have learned how our country needs to change and to grow. I have learned much, but I’ve lost much more. Mother...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Prince Joshua...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|I made a promise. I want to continue what she began. I will help defeat Grado. I will defend Jehanna and her allies. ...I know it doesn’t sound like me, but...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|On behalf of Frelia, I came to Jehanna with a letter to the throne. I give it to you. Prince Joshua of Jehanna... Let us fight together.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|Renais, Frelia, Rausten, and Jehanna. Four nations...united!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Yes, I suppose that’s true. And my brother is with us as well. And if it were possible... Lyon... I wish you could be here with us, too.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Soldier|Fire! Fires have broken out all through the hall!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|What?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Soldier|The curtains were soaked in oil, with torches set about the hall. It’s a trap! Someone did this during all the fighting. You must flee! Quickly, before the flames engulf us all!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Seth|Princess Eirika. We must evacuate...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|I know. Joshua, we must go. Now.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Joshua|No... Mother... Forgive me...|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|Is everyone well? Did anyone get left behind?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|We all made it. It’s so smoky that it’s hard to tell, but we’re here. What a cowardly act, setting fire to the palace hall. But we’ve escaped without injury. The enemy’s trap has failed.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|...No, it hasn’t. Assemble the troops now. The enemy is coming.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|What did you say?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|This is the reason for the fire. To drive us from the palace. They’ll be attacking soon. No other plan makes sense.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|How is it that you know that?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Seth|Princess Eirika. I’ve just received word that Grado reinforcements are headed this way. There are two armies, led by Generals Valter and Caellach.|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|No!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|Two armies... They’re willing to send so many here and leave the capital defenseless?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|L’Arachel|Why does everyone seem so distraught? It matters not who stands in our path. We shall smite them all with the power of righteousness!|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Seth|Princess Eirika... It’s going to be very difficult for us to continue. One of Grado’s generals alone is more than a match for us. Compound that with the exhaustion of our troops, and I’m not sure we can–|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Innes|Bah... With Jehanna Hall in flames, we’ve no place to hole up and dig in for a siege. We have to retreat. We have to win ourselves time for form a plan. Grado sent two generals... What could be happening in their capital? And what of Ephraim? Is he still alive?|
FE8|14A-QueenOfWhiteDunes|Eirika|...Brother...|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Tirado|What a pleasant surprise. It’s Master Valter.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|What’s the situation, Tirado? You have captured Ephraim, haven’t you?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Tirado|No. Prince Ephraim still fights in the lands north of Renvall.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|And why is that? What has happened to all those mercenaries you hired?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Tirado|They’ve proven to be less then adequate. Ephraim’s clever. His band strikes quickly and then vanishes into the woods. We more than double his numbers, and yet he uses the terrain wisely to fight us. He has no army–just a small force of knights loyal to Renais. Prince Ephraim’s reputation as a superb strategist would seem to be well earned.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|Hmm... How interesting. The lad’s beginning to whet my appetite. Tirado...Bring him to me as quickly as you can, will you?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Tirado|As you command. Just grant me an army, and I’ll bring him down swiftly.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|What sort of plan do you have?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Tirado|Master, I am your loyal adjutant, and you are my general. For you, my lord, I have many plans ready and waiting.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|Really? Well then, let me hear them.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Tirado|Very well. First, you and I will leave this fort and head north. Then, we will find Prince Ephraim in his leafy playpen.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|But he’s not easily found, is he?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Tirado|Do not worry. At Prince Ephraim’s side is... a friend, shall we say. When the time is right, our friend will move on our behalf...|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Forde, how are we on supplies and equipment?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|It’s not looking good. Our weapons are in bad shape, and we’re running low on food. We can probably restock at a nearby village, but–|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|No, that’s not an option. We’re in enemy territory. I will not involve innocents if I can avoid it.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|Yeah, I knew you’d say that. I mean, it’s because of stuff like that that we’ve stuck with you so far. But eventually, we do need to face reality. What are we going to do?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|Word of mouth has it that the invasion of Renais has progressed quite far. I’ve heard that the capital has fallen.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Hm...So soon... Still, my father is in the capital, and he won’t surrender easily. Forde, Kyle. Our mission here is to harry the troops, to distract their eye. Hopefully, we’ll be able to give my father and Eirika time to escape. Kyle, have you heard anything from Orson? I sent him ahead to scout.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|No word yet, and it’s about time he returned...|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Orson|Reporting in, Prince Ephraim. I can confirm Grado presence at several points around our camp. Also, a large battalion of soldiers has been dispatched from Renvall. We shouldn’t tarry here any longer than necessary...|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|I see.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|Seems as though we’ve certainly caught Grado’s eye this time. Should we retreat back to the capital, Prince Ephraim?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|No. We press onward. We’re going to capture Renvall.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|Wh-what?!?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|So this is Renvall, is it? All right, let’s go.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|Um...Are you...sure you’re quite sane, Prince Ephraim? We’ve an entire army after us, and you want to charge their stronghold?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|Forde! Watch your tongue! This is our prince you’re addressing!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Kyle, please, it’s all right. We’ve heard nothing from home, So what harm could a little reckless besieging cause?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|Prince Ephraim...|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Don’t worry. I haven’t lost all sense of self-preservation. Renvall holds an important place in Grado’s national defense. If we can get the upper hand and take control of it, then Grado will waste many valuable soldiers trying to take it back I hope our attack proves useful to my father and Eirika.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|I understand what you’re saying, but... can we do it with our current strength?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Every soldier in this area is trying to find us. The enemy has us vastly outnumbered. Attacking the castle is a ridiculous idea. If the enemy thinks the same... then we may have our opening.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|You have a point. I’m sure Renvall won’t expect us to attack with these numbers. Either way, we can’t run forever. And we’re running out of supplies. What’ve we got to lose? Shall we get ready to go?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Yes. If we don’t move quickly, we may never get another chance. Trust me. I don’t pick fights I cannot win.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|Yes, sir!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Zonta|An attack? By Ephraim’s troops? To arms! Prince Ephraim’s circled around and brought the fight to us! If we capture the prince here, we can line our pockets with gold! Do you understand? We’ll be rich!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Orson.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Orson|Yes...|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Your wounds still haven’t healed from that last battle, have they? Don’t push yourself. If we’re defeated, you must return to Frelia. Understood?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Orson|Understood...|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Let’s go! Kyle! Forde!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Zonta|Do you truly think you can take us with those numbers? Imbecile! You’ll learn the error of your ways.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Zonta|L-lord Tirado...It can’t be... Were we...merely pawns?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|We’ve secured the entire castle. You were brilliant, Prince Ephraim! What a plan! What a battle!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|I estimate at least half of the enemy troops are in the field. We took the castle, but we don’t have the manpower to hold it in a siege. There’s no point in lingering here. Let’s continue on to Grado Keep.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|Prince Ephraim, things have taken a turn for the worse. I took a look around the castle perimeter... We’re surrounded.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|What?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Grado’s sent reinforcements? So quickly...?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|What should we do?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|...... We must escape!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|So, you’ve captured Renvall, have you? And with such a small force! Impressive! You’ve earned your reputation. I must say, I quite admire your work. I take it you’re the leader of this pack–the misguided Prince Ephraim.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|I am.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|I’m General Valter, the Moonstone of Grado’s Imperial Army. Catching up to you has caused me no small amount of trouble. We’ve reduced your wretched home of Renais to ruin, and yet... you and your little band of bravos continue to be a thorn in our side. But that all ends here.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|We’ll see...You claim you’ve taken the capital of Renais... Tell me, how did you know I would attack Renvall?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|Ha ha... Patience. You’ll have your answer soon enough. Now, be good lads, and drop your weapons, will you?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|Prince Ephraim, let us attack!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|......|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|Listen to me, Ephraim. You’re a smart man. You know it’s futile to fight me. You cannot win. You cannot escape. Accept the reality of your situation, and surrender to me.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Surrender?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|Heh heh heh... That’s right. If you do, I’ll let you live. I hold your life in the palm of my hand. Do not test my good humor. Now, come over here, bend your knee, and beg for your life. Show me how Renais dogs grovel.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|I think not.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|What?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|You said your name was Valter, didn’t you? Well, I’m sorry, Valter, but I don’t have time to waste playing games with you. So, we’re going to knock you louts about a bit and then make our way out of here.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|Fool... Have you gone mad? Do you truly believe you can fight your way past my wyvern knights?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|Watch and see. I don’t pick fights I can’t win. Kyle, Forde. Are you ready?|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Kyle|My life has been yours since the moment I took my chivalric vows.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Forde|It’s moments like these that keep me by your side, my prince.|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Valter|What idiotic wretches you are... Prepare yourselves to be destroyed utterly!|
FE8|05x-UnbrokenHeart|Ephraim|We break to the east. GO!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Soldier|Your Majesty, I bear bad news. The castle gate has been breached. Emperor Vigarde's forces are within the castle walls.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|I understand.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Soldier|The garrison has fallen. We've lost contact with Prince Ephraim and can expect no aid from his men. Your Majesty, what are we to do?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|...What else can we do? Order your men to lay down their arms.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Father...|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|Eirika. Are you wearing the bracelet I gave you?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Yes, I have it right here.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|Good. Seth.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Yes, Your Majesty?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|Take Eirika and head for Frelia. King Hayden is an honorable man. I trust he will keep you safe.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Understood. And what of Your Majesty?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|Me? I shall remain here. We have long held Grado among our dearest allies, yet now, they attack? I must know why. Am I somehow responsible for this? Have I erred in my leadership? Renais is mine to guide... How could I have failed her so?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Father, you can't stay! You mustn't! If you remain behind, then so shall I!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|Go now, Seth! Ride! Take her to safety!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Father!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Forgive me, Your Highness.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Fado|Ephraim, Eirika... You must survive.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Franz|General Seth!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Franz, ride ahead and bring word of our coming to Frelia. A single rider has better odds of passing unseen by Grado's men. Convey to the throne all that has happened here and petition for reinforcements.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Franz|U-understood!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Princess Eirika, we must— Quickly! Behind me!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Valter|You there, with the girl. Tell me, would that be the wayward princess of Renais? Well, this must be my lucky day. You're a dead man. The wench goes with me.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Never!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Valter|I am Valter, the Moonstone, Grado's finest general! And you're just a corpse who does not know he is dead.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Ahhh... No!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Valter|Such terrible wounds, and still he holds to his duty? How entertaining. Fly away, little man. Fly away. Try to outrun death. More time to savor the hunt... and the kill.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Princess Eirika! This way! I can see no more of Grado's men. If we've made it this far, we've surely earned a moment's rest. Please forgive my grabbing you so...brusquely earlier.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Don't be foolish, Seth. If it weren't for you, I would never have made it out of the castle. You are the reason I'm still alive. You have my gratitude. And whoever that man was, he was clearly after me... It's my fault that you received such a grave wound. Allow me to treat it, I--|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Your Highness, I can't allow an injury like this to be an obstacle. We have more important matters to attend to. We must press on to Frelia. We must fulfill His Majesty's wishes.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|...I wonder how my father fares alone in the castle. Do you think he's safe? And what of my brother on the Grado front? We've heard nothing from him for days.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|King Fado and Prince Ephraim are both valiant and brave men. I doubt even the might of the Grado Empire can hold them in check. More important to me, Your Highness, is that you look to your own safety. How sad the two of them would be if something were to happen to you. We must reach Frelia to ensure the day of your happy reunion.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Yes, of course. You're right. Until I'm reunited with my father and brother, I must not despair. Come, Seth. Let us go.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Once we cross that bridge, we will be in Frelia, near Border Mulan. Let us proceed, Princess Eirika.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|Your training begins with movement. Place the square cursor on Eirika and press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|Press the A Button to select Eirika.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|You can move anywhere within the blue area. Move the cursor to the flashing space beside Seth and press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|You’ll now move next to Seth. Go ahead and press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Your highness, I won’t lie to you. This will not be an easy ride. Please, take this rapier. If something should happen to me, you must continue to Frelia, alone if need be.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|You’ve received a rapier from Seth. All weapons have a durability rating. The rapier’s durability is 40. Once the rapier has been used 40 times, it will break. Pay close attention to how many uses your weapons have remaining.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|O’Neill|You there! Renais Dogs! Where do you think you’re going?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Grado’s men.. Stand back, Princess Eirika.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|It’s all right, Seth. My brother has taught me something of swordplay. I will stand with you.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|Red units are enemy units. After all of Eirika’s party has moved, the enemy units will move. Each side takes turns moving and then fighting until the battle ends.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Princess Eirika!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|I’m fine. His axe was slow, and I was quick. Now it’s my turn!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|On this map you need to defeat O’Neill, the enemy leader, to win. The objective is displayed at the corner of the screen. Your objective changes from map to map, which may change your approach. Check your objective before deciding your strategy. Now, attack the enemy!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|The cursor is now on Eirika. Press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|It’s time to attack the enemy. Place the cursor on Eirika and press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|Select Attack and press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|This is the combat information window. You can see the combatant’s HP and the amount of damage you will inflict. Eirika should do 7 points, and the enemy should do 9. You see the x2 next to Mt, right? This indicates that you will attack twice. Eirika is faster than her opponent, so she can strike twice in one turn. So, with 2 attacks of 7 points each, Eirika will do 14 points of damage. Now press the A Button to attack the enemy.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|I’ll hold the rest of them here. Please, Princess–to Frelia!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|All that's left is their leader...|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|O'Neill|What was that? Do you think you can take me, wretched lordling? Come! It's time you high-and-mighty knights learned to respect a true warrior!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Seth! His wounds must be worse than he let on...|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|O'Neill|Time to die!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|Stop! Face me, if you have the steel!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|Place the cursor on Eirika and press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|The cursor is now on Eirika. Press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|Move next to the enemy and press the A Button.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|The combat information window is open again. Do you see Hit displayed below HP and Mt? Hit is the likelihood that you will land your blow. Eirika’s Hit is 94, so she has a 94 percent chance of hitting the enemy. Crit, short for Critical, also appears in this window. This is the chance an attack will be a lethal strike. Eirika’s Crit is 14, so she has a 14 percent chance of landing a killing blow. Critical attacks do 3 times the damage of a normal attack. Press the A Button to attack the enemy leader.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Tutorial|Eirika gained over 100 experience points and has leveled up. Gaining levels increases unit abilities and makes them stronger.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|O'Neill|You will be the first to die!|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|O'Neill|What? How?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Princess, are you injured?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|What? Oh, no... I'm fine, Seth.|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|But you look so pale...|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|I'm fine... Fine. ...This is war, isn't it? It's not at all like the games I used to play with my brother or Lyon. I never thought—I didn't know it would be this...savage. Are words useless? Is strength all that matters? It's so sad... Why would the Grado Empire do this? To what end would they start a war?|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Seth|Princess...|
FE8|00-TheFallOfRenais|Eirika|...Don't worry, Seth. I won't give in to sorrow. Let's get moving. I'm not broken, and I won't stop until I see Renais restored. I won't stop until I'm reunited with my father and brother.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Vigarde|Frelia’s Sacred Stone has been destroyed. And yet you cannot locate the Stone of Renais. Glen. Valter. Find the children of Renais. Find them and take from them the bracelets that they wear. Glen, take Eirika. Valter, take Ephraim. Find them. Conquer them.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Glen|Yes, Your Majesty...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Valter|Ha ha... Eirika, eh? She’s a ripe little peach. And her brother, Ephraim... He’s better prey than I’d imagined. I can feel my blood rushing at the thought. This might be fun after all.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Vigarde|Caellach. Riev. Shatter the remaining Sacred Stones. Caellach, take Jehanna. Riev, take Rausten. Go. Crush the Sacred Stones they house.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Riev|Heh heh heh... As you will. I’ll begin making arrangements for Rausten’s downfall immediately...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Caellach|Bah! Why am I stuck with Jehanna? Accursed ill luck. I became a mercenary to escape that wretched place, and now I must go back?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Vigarde|Duessel. Go to Frelia. Take the Frelian army and punish Ephraim.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Vigarde|Selena. Remain in the capital. Soon, I will have new orders for you.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Selena|Yes, sire.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Tana|Eirika! Wait!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Tana? What are you doing? You were supposed to remain in the palace. You left so abruptly, without any warning or farewell. You and Ephraim have only just arrived, and already you leave on another quest? Well, I’m your friend, Eirika, and I won’t let you go into danger without me.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Does King Hayden know of this?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Tana|No. He’d just say I forbid you to go on this foolish errand,? like always. But I’m so worried about you.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Thank you, Tana. I appreciate your concern, but King Hayden would–|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Tana|You and Ephraim, my father and my brother... You’re all fighting together, fighting for a noble cause. I cannot be left out. I will not be left out. Please, Eirika.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|...Oh... All right. I never could refuse you anything. Come on. Let’s go, Tana.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Tana|Thank you, Eirika!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Your Highness, we’ve reached Port Kiris. If we can find passage across the North Sea, we will reach Rausten in 10 days.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|It smells of the tides... This is a busy place, isn’t it?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|It’s a trade center. Peoples of all nations pass through here. Do not become so enthralled with the sights and sounds that you forget your mission.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|I won’t. I’m a mercenary by the name of Erina. I’m traveling to Rausten to receive a commission.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Let us look for a ship then, Erina. The docks are this way.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Hm?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Is something amiss?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Seth, that woman over there? Is that...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|Oh, these dainty sugar pastries! They’re delightfully scrumptious! Flavorful without being overwhelming, refined without being banal...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! Right you are, Lady L’Arachel!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|You look familiar...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|Oh! Aren’t you–|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|We’ve met before, haven’t we? You arrived with your companions when we encountered those creatures... Your name is L’Arachel, is it not?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|A wonder and pleasure that we should meet again so soon! It is providence!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Rennac|Bad luck is the only thing the divine has ever provided you!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|Oh, and if you have not yet tried one, these pastries are also divine. Would you care for one?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Uh, thank you... No, wait... That’s not why– We’re actually on our way to the Theocracy of Rausten. We’re rather in a rush and need to find passage on a ship...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|Oh, dear. I’m afraid you’ll find none to assist you. No ships are leaving port.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Pardon?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|You see, I find myself heading home once more to my beloved Rausten as well! And actually, I’m quite well known with the powers-that-be here in Port Kiris. So I ordered them to ready the finest passenger vessel for me. But both merchants and passenger ships alike are too frightened to set sail. It seems a giant ghost ship has been sinking every ship it finds... Would that I could confront it, I could stop its foul villainy in a moment. Alas. It’s such a shame.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Yes, yes... Uh... That is troublesome. Still, I must get to Rausten somehow.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|You needn’t worry too much. After all, if the sea is closed to you, simply follow the overland route!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|The overland route? I’ve heard that’s a terribly roundabout path to travel.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|Oh, it is, but don’t you see? The hardships of the road, they are truly blessings! They will toughen you and strengthen your resolve when you need to face great evil. For example, I have been tasked with a great trial in order to better me. I understand my path, O unknowable forces of providence! I, your faithful servant L’Arachel, shall overcome! With faith and divine strength!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Rennac|Now, listen, L’Arachel! You might be thrilled about going the long way, but–|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|L’Arachel|Come now, we’re leaving. Dozla? Rennac? Don’t fall behind!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Dozla|Gwah ha ha! Wait for us, Lady L’Arachel! Come on, Rennac! We run ’til we drop! The first one to collapse from exhaustion is the winner!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Rennac|Help... Why is this happening to me?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|...Uh, Seth? Isn’t Rausten in the other direction? Aren’t they heading toward Frelia?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|...It’s nothing you need concern yourself with, milady. Our only concern now is to decide our next course of action. An overland journey would be very long. However, it seems that may be our only choice at the moment...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|I agree. Whatever shall we do...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Binks|...You’re Eirika, the princess of Renais, ain’t ya?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|What?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Dastard! Away with you!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Binks|No need to get personal! You know, there’s a pretty price on your pretty head. Sorry, but I need that gold.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Man|Wh-what do you want? Gimme a break... Leave us out of this stupid war of yours! We don’t want anything to do with it! Or... are you just another victim, like the rest of us here? Well, regardless... Here. Take this, and go do something about all this fighting, will you?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Rennac|My, oh my... It’s about time they left. I’m finally done getting ordered about without getting paid. Huh? Oh, don’t mind me. Just talking to myself. Here, I want you to hold on to this for me. Don’t tell anyone. Oh, and don’t say a word about seeing me to Lady L’Arachel, all right? Deal?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Soldier|Attention! Carcino’s mercenaries will arrest the princess of Renais shortly. Our duty here is nearly ended, and I expect no further hostilities. If you must fight, however, remember that the whole empire fights with you!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|Um, Commander? What should I do?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Soldier|Who are you?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|Sir! I’m Amelia of Silva, sir! I’m new. I was only assigned to your command today. I wanted to fight for the empire!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Soldier|I don’t need your life story, fool! Recruits are in front! Grab a lance and move!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|Sir, yes sir! This lance... Stab the enemy. I’m not afraid... I’m a citizen of Grado. It’s my duty to fight. And I’ll fight my best!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Franz|Oh, who are you?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|What? What?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Franz|Are you one of the locals? This is a dangerous spot. You should hide. Here, come with me.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|But... But I’m...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Franz|I’m Franz, a Knight of Renais. What’s your name? What are you doing here?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|I-I’m Amelia. I’m... Actually, I’m a Grado soldier. I’m supposed to be fighting you.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Franz|Really? So, uh, you’re my enemy?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|...I guess... Are you... Are you going to make me your prisoner?!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Franz|No! No, I wouldn’t do that. But...this is a problem.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|What should we do?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Franz|First of all, you must listen to me and do as I say. We’ll talk to Princess Eirika later.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|What? NO! My commander told me Eirika’s a cruel and merciless fiend who–|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Franz|Oh, that’s utter nonsense. I’ve never heard the princess utter an unkind word to anyone. I understand why you’re frightened. You think we’re the enemy. But if you’d only trust me... Will you come with me?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|Mm... Well, all right. I’ll trust you, Franz.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Who are you?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|What? What?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Are you from around here? You should find someplace to hide. These men are after me. It’s not safe.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|But... But I’m...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Yes?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|I’m a Grado soldier. I’m here to stop the princess of Renais...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Huh? You’re with Grado?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|And you’re Princess Eirika? But the commander said Eirika’s a cruel and merciless fiend...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|What? No, I’m... ...I don’t know what Grado’s officers have been telling you, but... Our two countries are at war, so I suppose they can say what they want.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|...Mistress Eirika... I, uh, I surrender. I won’t fight you.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Huh?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|I became a soldier because I admired General Duessel’s sense of honor. But the generals have been very opposed to this war from the beginning... And now I see you, and you look so sad about all of this. I don’t know what’s right anymore. I’m just a soldier, but I want to decide for myself. I want to understand the truth myself, to see it with my own eyes.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|...I see. So...does this mean you’re coming with us? I suppose I should ask your name then.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Amelia|Amelia. Amelia of Silva.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Binks|Blast! This ain’t right! These guys are too tough... 5,000 gold ain’t nearly enough for this!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Binks|Th-that stinkin’ Pablo... He...lied to me...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Your Highness, are you well?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Yes, I believe so... Who are these men? They don’t appear to be Grado Imperial troops.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Judging by their crude swordplay, I’d say they’re mercenaries. We can expect more of them in the area, too, I think. Wait here.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Mercenary|W-wait! I give up! I don’t want to fight anymore! We were just doing a job.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Who hired you?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Mercenary|I may be nothing but a hired blade, but I have my honor. I won’t say a word.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|I admire your professionalism. I guess we have no use for you.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Mercenary|No, wait! I’ll talk! Carcino! It was Pablo of the Carcino Council of Elders!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Councilman Pablo?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|That doesn’t make sense! Carcino and Frelia are allies. Why would they target me?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Mercenary|I don’t know... Could be they’ve decided Grado’s going to win. They want to be on the winning side. Some of the others opposed Pablo, but I heard he had ’em all silenced but quick. That’s all I know, I swear it.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|I believe you. Go.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|We were careless. We should have seen this coming. Carcino’s a young and ambitious nation ruled by power-hungry merchants. And Grado grows more powerful with every passing day. So it’s no surprise Carcino’s merchant lords would throw in with Grado now.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Wait! Prince Innes... Prince Innes was to pass through Carcino on his way to Jehanna... If Carcino has betrayed us, then he ran headlong into enemy territory...|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Messenger|Princess Eirika! I bring dire tidings!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|I know you... You were a messenger riding with Prince Innes.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Messenger|Yes, and I have news of him. Prince Innes is in danger! Carcino’s merchant army struck and cut through half our men. The prince is trapped in a siege. He has no means of escape, and–|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|No more! I understand. Return to Frelia and deliver your message!|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Messenger|What of Prince Innes?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Leave him to us. The prince’s troubles should burden you no more. We will see him to safety.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Rennac|...Hey, you. Have Lady L’Arachel and her man, Sir Stubble-chin, gone yet?|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Aren’t you– Yes, they no longer appear to be in the city.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Rennac|Whew... I’m finally free! No more getting bossed around by that witless ninny! Thanks. I owe you one. Take this. Now that I’m free again. I think I’m just gonna wander about for a while.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|...What a strange relationship they have.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Seth|Lady Eirika, I think we ought to be leaving soon.|
FE8|09A-DistantBlade|Eirika|Yes. We must hurry to Prince Innes’s side!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|My brother is somewhere inside that castle...|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Seth|Renvall is surrounded by lakes. The only entrance is the bridge to the main gate, and it’s well guarded. Castle Renvall is a natural stronghold, easy to defend and difficult to assault. We must plan our attack carefully.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|I agree...|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Franz|Princess Eirika! Please allow me to fight beside you. My elder brother, Forde, is in there with Prince Ephraim, Sir Kyle, Sir Orson... Let me help you set them free!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Gilliam|There is nothing to discuss. We will fight.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Moulder|The hour of your reunion is not far off now.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Vanessa|I am yours to command, Your Highness.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Ross|We’re with you all the way! Right, Dad?|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Garcia|Don’t work yourself into a lather, Ross. In the heat of battle, a good warrior remains calm where lesser men do not.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Colm|You need anything stolen, I’m your man. ‘Course, my blade’s no joke either.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Neimi|I’m sure I can help you if you’ll let me... I’ll keep you safe.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Lute|You can’t possibly consider fighting without my genius at your side!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Artur|I have yet to repay you for helping me fight those abominations. Please, let me stand by your side a while longer.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Joshua|This has trouble written all over it. Bet you it’s all a trap... Ah, well... My luck’s gotta turn around sometime, right?|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Natasha|May the sacred light surround us and protect us all.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Seth|Well, Princess, let us prepare for battle.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|...Brother, I’m on my way. Let’s go!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Murray|We’re under attack! Rouse yourselves! General Valter’s adjutant, Lord Tirado, has charged us with defending the castle! Show them the might of Murray’s Brigade! Don’t let anyone near the castle!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Young Man|Tirado’s the new master of Castle Renvall. He’s supposed to be an adjutant to General Valter of Grado. Who knows, though... Rumors say he’s been plotting behind Valter’s back. You should watch where you step.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Old Lady|Prince Ephraim? Well, gracious me... I haven’t heard anything about him. But now that you mention it, there was a big commotion a few days back. I guess the soldiers were chasing somebody, but... Well, I was so tired, I fell asleep and missed the whole thing.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Murray|Our ballistae have failed? How could this be? Grrr... I guess it’s up to me!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Murray|Lord Tirado...|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|My brother is somewhere in this castle... Seth, we must go inside!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Seth|Hold, Lady Eirika. Look, in the shadows–a figure...|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|Ah! An enemy soldier!|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|Princess Eirika And... is that you, Seth?|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Seth|Sir Orson... Why are you here? You should be with Prince Ephraim.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|Are you all right, Orson? If you’re here, my brother must be here as well, right?|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Orson|Yes... Prince Ephraim and I were broth captured by Grado forces and held here as prisoners. I just managed to escape my cell... A chance to escape– It’s what I had prayed for...|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|Orson... are you well? Your face is so pale. Grado’s men, don’t tell me they’ve–|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Orson|No... it’s nothing. But Lord Ephraim... I cannot say whether he’s still unharmed.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|What!? Where is he? Where is my brother?|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Orson|If he lives still, he will be in one of the deeper cells, where I was held. Head down this corridor to the dungeons. Quickly, before reinforcements arrive.|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Eirika|Thank you...|
FE8|07-WatersideRenvall|Seth|.......|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|......|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|What is it, Eirika?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|I was thinking about Lyon. The last time we saw him was a year and a half ago...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|You’re right. It was at Grado Keep. ...Has it really been only a year and a half?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Ephraim! Lyon! Where are you two?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|We’re over here, Eirika. You’d better be quick. Ephraim says he’s tired of waiting.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Oh, please, I’m sure you could wait a few moments longer...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|You’re late. How does it take you so long to prepare for such a simple trip?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|Rest easy, Ephraim. There’s no need to be so curt with your own sister. After all, a king must learn how to treat women with honor and discretion. That’s what Father MacGregor says.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Thank you, Lyon. You, unlike my dear brother, are a true gentleman. I was up far too late thinking about my prayer to the temple flame last night. And I’m afraid I... I overslept...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Your prayer? What are you babbling about?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|Come now, you know that the flame has been burning since the time of darkness ended. You must know the story that the flame will answer the prayers of any pilgrim!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Really? I didn’t know that.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Oh, Ephraim... Father MacGregor is going to scold you for neglecting your studies so.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|...Don’t even joke about that. So tell us, what have you decided to pray for, Eirika?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|I, uh... It’s a secret.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|I should’ve known. You’re so boring.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|Well, how about you, Ephraim?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Me? Let’s see... I guess I’ll pray to become a stronger fighter.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|That’s just like you, Ephraim.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Just like you indeed, Brother.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|... I can never tell if you’re complimenting me or mocking me.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|Praising you, of course! Right, Eirika?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Hee hee... Yes, that’s right.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|And you, Lyon? What will you pray for?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|What? Me? Hm... I suppose all I really want is for all our people to be happy.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|...That’s very, uh... That’s very much like you.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Very much so, Lyon.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|...Now, I’m the one who cannot tell if he’s being praised or...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|You’re being praised, as always, Lyon.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Tell me, why the sudden decision to visit the temple? Did my brother do something again?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Now listen, you...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|Oh no. It’s not what Ephraim’s done. It’s what he hasn’t done. He’s learned nothing at all about the Sacred Stones and the temple flame, so...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Father MacGregor became angry. He said, One destined to become king and rule over a nation... must know the history of his kingdom and must respect the Sacred Stones.?Ever since I came to Grado, my life has been chastisement and castigation. Father MacGregor does not think me to be altogether too...kingly.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|And yet General Duessel has nothing but praise for you, Ephraim. He says you’ve brave and true, that you’ve the making of a great king.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|A great king? I honestly have no idea what that means. Eirika should succeed the throne. I would be happy simply taking my lance and traveling the land as a mercenary.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Ephraim, that is nothing but foolish, irresponsible romanticism! Do you realize how much your words would fill Father’s heart with grief?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Are we speaking of the same man? Our father will likely outlive us all. For now, I’m content just learning the lance from General Duessel. What about you, Lyon? Is there anything you want to do?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|Me? Well, I... I suppose I want to become like my father.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|You were born to be the Emperor of Grado, Lyon. It suits you.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|No, I don’t think so. I’m not– One thing I do know from watching my father is that being emperor is hard. Every day, he answers the complaints of the people, and he almost never sleeps... My father is always so very tired. I hope one day that... I hope that I can help him.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Lyon... You are so honorable. You should learn from him, Brother.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|...Again with your criticism! Tell me, Eirika. What say you to dressing like me and becoming king in my stead? You’re so skinny, I doubt anyone would notice you’re not really a man.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Lyon|Ha ha ha...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Ephraim!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|What do you suppose Lyon is doing now? When Emperor Vigarde ordered the invasion... How do you think Lyon felt?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|He’s always been so gentle, but he worships his father. He’d never question him. But the emperor... He’s clearly not behaving rationally. I just hope he’s not so far gone that he’d hurt his own flesh and blood.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|I just pray for the day when the three of us can be together once again.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|It’ll come. I’ve no doubt...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Tana|Eirika! Ephraim! Welcome! The two of you returning together, it’s like a dream come true. You must know, I’ve prayed every day for your safe return.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|I’m so happy to see you, Tana.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|I’m sorry, Tana. I didn’t want for you to worry.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Tana|Oh, it doesn’t matter now... All that really matters is that we’ve been brought together again. My own brother will soon return from the field. It will be nice to sit down and discuss things again.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Soldier|Princess Tana! Prince Innes has returned from the front!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Tana|Welcome home, dear brother! I’m so happy to see you return safe and sound!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|You didn’t expect less, did you? Do you think Grado’s slugs could touch me? With my bow, I’ll take down every Grado soldier form here to the emperor’s palace!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Well met, Innes.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|...Ephraim.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|It’s good to see you, Prince Innes.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|...They say Renais has fallen. I believe I warned you before. This happened because you provided Grado the opportunity to strike.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Tana|Brother! Mind your tongue! This is no occasion for such harsh words. Ephraim and Eirika have lost their father to this terrible war...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|...... I’m sorry to hear of your father’s death. Hear me, Ephraim. Our most important task is to defeat Grado and end this war.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Tana|Oh, Innes... I’m sorry, Eirika, Ephraim.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|It’s all right. It’s comforting to see that, in all of this, at least he hasn’t changed. Innes has hated me for as long as I can remember.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Tana|My brother looks upon you as a rival, Ephraim. And as you know, he wants to be the best at everything. The best king, the best general, the best fighter, the best man... He won’t allow himself to be beaten at anything.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|Tana, you talk too much.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|...My father would like both of you to sit with him in a war council. Will you come with me to take part in your official audience?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Yes, of course. There’s much that I have to tell him.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|It will be out honor to attend.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|This way.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|It does my heart good to see you all here safely within our castle walls. ...Would that we had more time for pleasantries, but...let us hear your news.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|Very well, I will begin. I’ve directed the body of Frelia’s army south to engage Grado directly. Our troops are proving themselves superior, and the battle progresses favorably.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Hmm... But the riddle still needs answering. Why did Grado begin this war in the first place?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Your Majesty, we may well have found something relating to that... We learned something on our travels, news that weighs heavily upon us.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Ah, yes. Our messenger delivered your report to us a few days ago. Grado is trying to destroy the Sacred Stones... Is that it?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Yes.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|We’ve strengthened the tower’s defenses. Frelia’s stone is safe for the time being. But we remain confused in this. What does Grado hope to gain by destroying the Sacred Stones?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|We don’t know. The legends say the stones protect us all from the power of darkness.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|...I can’t say if it relates, but I have a story about Grado. It’s...been troubling me, and I would like to share it with you all. Myrrh. Come here, please.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Myrrh|Yes?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Who’s this girl?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|On her back... Wings? Ephraim, who is she?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|This is Myrrh. I met here while fighting in Grado territory. Myrrh, would you please tell everyone here the story you told me?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Myrrh|...... ...Please, Ephraim, you tell them.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|She’s a bit shy.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Very well. Myrrh tells me that she belongs to an ancient race of dragon folk. They’re mentioned in a few legends. They’re called the tribe of Manakete.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Manakete?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Yes, their name appears several times in the tale of the Sacred Stones. It says they were neither human nor demon but a separate, aloof race.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Please, Myrrh.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Myrrh|...... We live in the east...in Darkling Woods. One day...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Yes?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Myrrh|We felt something. An ominous energy to the south.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|From the direction of Grado. They felt a...force flowing out of the Grado Empire.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Myrrh|Saleh and I... We went to investigate this energy. But on our way down, we came across a battle and were drawn into the conflict.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Myrrh got lost and was wandering aimlessly in an isolated region near Grado’s border.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Myrrh|I met some wicked folk there. They deceived and enchained me. They stole my dragonstone. They were preparing me for transport. It was in that moment when Ephraim appeared and rescued me.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|......|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|I stumbled across Myrrh by chance when Grado’s men had ambushed us. Everything she told me seemed beyond belief, and yet... And yet, when I saw her wings, what could I do but believe?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Myrrh|This dark wave of energy still flows from the southlands. Its current is strong and runs deep. It has awakened the evil ones. I want to stop it.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Hmmm......|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Soldier|Your Majesty! I bring word!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|What is so urgent you would interrupt a private council?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Soldier|The tower holding the Sacred Stone of Frelia... It’s been destroyed by the Grado Army!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|What? That’s impossible! What of the soldiers on watch? There were supposed to be many...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Soldier|The enemy forces... They were led by Caellach the Tiger Eye and Selena Fluorspar! Our soldiers fell before even half a day had past!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Seth|Selena Fluorspar... Only General Duessel is higher in Emperor Vigarde’s esteem... She’s the one.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|She came personally... So they really do wish to see the Sacred Stones destroyed. Blast...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Caellach|Hah! So this hunk of rock is a Sacred Stone, eh? So much fuss over something as fragile as this. Watch. It crumbles so easily. Do we gain anything by this? Not that I care, but...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Frelia Soldier|Black-hearted...fool... What have...you...done? Without the stone’s...protection... the horrors...will spread...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Caellach|Huh? What’s this? Still breathing, are you? Come. If you’ve any last words, I’ll hear them, fool of Frelia.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Frelia Soldier|You...monster...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Caellach|You waste your last words on insults? And feeble ones, at that... Hardly the right note to enter the eternal on, wouldn’t you say? Well then, die.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Selena|Hold! What are you doing, Caellach?! Our job was to destroy the Sacred Stone.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Caellach|I know that. And I crush it, did I not? But if we don’t clean up these Frelian curs, they might–|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Selena|You do not raise your blade to anyone who is powerless to resist you! The emperor does not desire us to kill without cause! That would be murder!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Caellach|Right, the emperor... Your name’s Selena, ain’t it? Tell me, Selena. What makes that pasty- faced old fool’s word so important?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Selena|Wretch... Do you dare insult His Imperial Majesty!?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Caellach|Hey, hey, I’m joking. Don’t get so worked up. I get it now. You’re a true and loyal soldier. I’m leaving before Frelia sends reinforcements. Coming?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Selena|......|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|How could this happen... How could I have allowed our Sacred Stone to be destroyed? Dark energies from the empire’s capital... Evil monstrosities roaming our lands... Vigarde’s mad invasion... And now this, the destruction of our sacred talisman. And we have no idea of Grado’s goals. We are in the dark times once again. But even so, we cannot sit here, wringing our hands. First, we must warn the nations that house the remaining Sacred Stones. If Vigarde seeks to destroy the Stones, they are all in grave danger. Jehanna and Rausten must be warned. The nations must joined together to fight our common foe.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Do you think they will believe us?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Hm... It is a difficult tale to believe, I must agree.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|I will go, Father.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Innes?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|A direct visit from the Prince of Frelia is not something they can ignore. I will travel to Jehanna, where I will forge an alliance with her queen. If our Sacred Stone has been destroyed, the Frelia could be in greater danger. Father, I cannot let you leave the nation in such a time of crisis. It is imperative that I be the one to go.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|Hmmm...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|And I will head for Rausten.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Eirika? You know I can’t let you put yourself in such danger.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Rest easy, dear brother. I will journey to Rausten by ship across the North Sea. There will be no danger. And I have made a vow. I will fight as you have until the day Renais is liberated.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|...I understand. King Hayden, I will take troops and march on the imperial capital from the west.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|The west?! Are you saying you will begin an assault on Grado from here?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|If we can take Grado Keep, the war will be over. The Sacred Stones will be safe. If we start here and press forward with all our might...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|And once you reach the capital? Vigarde’s generals will be there waiting for you.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|If they oppose us, we will fight.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Hayden|...You’ve got your father’s foolhardy courage, don’t you? ...Very well. I entrust all our hope to you three. Innes, you will go to Jehanna, Eirika to Rausten, And Ephraim to the imperial capital. Funding you will have, but of soldiers, we have few to spare. For each of you, a difficult road awaits.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|If any of us meets defeat, the battle will turn to Grado’s favor. There must be no errors. We must not fail.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Innes|Where I command, there are no mistakes.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|I have no doubts. I’ll succeed, I swear it. Come, it is time to go!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Farewell, Brother. I will return.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Mm... To be honest, I still do not want you to go. I would rather you wait here for my return.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Please, Ephraim... I will be fine. There’s no need for you to worry. Mine is the easiest task, and I’ll be in no danger. I’m far more worried about your mission. Challenging the might of an empire with a handful of men?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|What’s this now? Have you lost your faith in me?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|No, of course not. I know your true strength, Ephraim. No one can defeat you.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Ha ha! Hearing you say that fills me with confidence. I think I know my own limitations. I won’t overextend my reach. I can’t die and leave you on your own, can I?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Ephraim...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Let us both survive to be reunited. Give me your word, Eirika.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|You have it, Brother.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Narrator|Eirika and Ephraim will now part ways. Which of them will you accompany?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Kyle|Princess Eirika!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Forde|Is your departure time near?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Yes. Kyle, Forde, I’m traveling to Rausten. I ask that you two serve my brother well.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Forde|Actually, there’s been a slight change of plans.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Kyle|We’re going with you, Your Highness.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|What? But...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Kyle|Prince Ephraim rides with Frelia’s finest at his back.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Forde|And this was a personal order from the prince himself. He said, I don’t need you loafing around here. Go and keep Eirika safe.?Since when is battling all of Grado loafing about? Honestly!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|You’re right! My brother’s mission is far more dangerous than mine. I will go and speak with him...|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Kyle|Princess Eirika. Prince Ephraim said he’s not concerned for his own safety. These are the words our prince gave us, and we believe he means them.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Forde|That’s the truth of it. There’s no cause for worry, Princess Eirika. We can all attest to the prince’s tenacity. No matter how close death comes, the Pale Horse will not catch him.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|...Kyle, Forde... I understand. Thank you for your service and bravery. You are my brother’s most trusted and most valiant companions. I would be honored to have you ride at my side.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Kyle|The honor is ours. We ride for Renais and for Princess Eirika!|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Forde|Let’s not work ourselves into a frenzy right now. When the time comes, I will be there to handle things.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Eirika|Of course. I’m depending on both of you.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Seth|Prince Ephraim.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Is that you, Seth? I’m almost ready to depart. I’m leaving Eirika in your care.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Seth|Actually, milord... We have the honor of riding with you.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|What? What about Eirika?|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Seth|The princess informs me that she will be accompanied by a Frelian escort. She tells me she does not need a large retinue on such a small ship.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|I understand, but we must be prepared for anything. I will be fine, Seth. Please go and attend Eirika.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Seth|Lord Ephraim, this is Lady Eirika’s wish. She implored us to lend our blades to you on the front lines... She spoke to each of us individually. She knelt before us and beseeched us to go. Her sincerity, her concern... We could not help but be moved by her plea.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Ephraim|Oh, Eirika... Very well. You will all come with me. But steel yourselves. This will not be an easy journey. I want only volunteers who are unafraid of meeting death.|
FE8|08x-ANewJourney|Seth|I’ll let the others know. I must tell you, milord–they are already preparing to depart. They know the risks they are taking, and not a one will be deterred.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Seth has mapped out a route for us. We’ll travel south of Renais and pass through Serafew into Grado territory.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Moulder|Hmm... That would seem a sensible plan. Assuming, of course, that we can avoid any run-ins with Grado soldiers...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Vanessa|Princess Eirika, may I have your leave to scout ahead? From the sky, I’ll have a better chance of spotting any nearby troops.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Moulder|We’re yours to command, Your Highness. Will you give your permission?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Yes, of course. Keep an eye out for enemy bowmen though, Vanessa.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Vanessa|Yes, Your Highness, I shall. I shall prove myself worthy of the honor of your trust.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|She seems very...sincere.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Moulder|Sincere...Yes, quite.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Bone|Hey, boss! We’ve found more villages ripe for the picking.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Bazba|One, two, three... Ha ha ha! I love a good war! With all those soldiers preoccupied, we’re free to pillage as we please! Right, Bone–you’re in charge. Grab everything that’s not nailed down and bring it to the hideout.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Bone|I’m on it.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Dad! Bandits approaching!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Hmmm... I’m getting you out of here, Ross. You stay close to me!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Bone|Let’s start with that village there! Go to it, boys! It’s all yours. Cut down anyone fool enough to get in your way. I’m heading west around the mountains to the other villages.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Unnnng!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Ross? What is it? What’s wrong?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|It’s nothing! It’s just a scratch! You’re a warrior, Dad, and I am your son. I won’t be beaten so easily.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Don’t risk yourself so foolishly... We need to get you some help. Please! Someone help my son!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Vanessa|Ah! This looks serious. I must report back to Princess Eirika at once.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Vanessa|I have bad news. The village to the east is under attack by bandits.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Bandits?!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Moulder|We have arrived at our first dilemma. We must move quickly and attract as little attention as possible, but...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|But I cannot stand by and watch innocents be harmed. Vanessa, how fare the villagers?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Vanessa|I spotted one injured person. He appeared to be just a child.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Father Moulder, can your staff help him?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Moulder|Well, yes, I can heal his injuries with my staff, but... I cannot do it from here. He’s too far away. I must be near him.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Vanessa|Princess, please leave this to me. I shall bring the boy here.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Moulder|All right, Vanessa. It’s up to you.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Vanessa|Very well. I’m off.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Man|Hm? What is it? What’s all the ruckus? What? B-bandits?! Spread the word, everyone! Close the village gates! Thank you for your warning. Please, accept this small token.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Woman|This is terrible...What are we going to do? The Bandits are so close. If we can’t find some way to protect ourselves, the village is doomed.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|Perhaps...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|People, listen to me! You must close the village gates immediately. Hurry, before the bandits arrive!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|Who are you? You aren’t from one of the neighboring towns, are you. And your weapons give you away... You’re no peasant.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|I am Er... My name is Erina. I’m a mercenary.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|A mercenary named Erina, is it? There’s more to you than that, I feel. But don’t worry–it’s none of my affair. I haven’t told you who I am yet, have I? I am Selena, a general in Grado’s army.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Ah!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|Is something wrong?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|No...uh, nothing.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|It looks like these villagers have some bandit troubles. I would like to help, but I have orders... I’m to leave for the capital immediately, and I cannot stay. You’re armed, and you claim to be a mercenary. Will you help them?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Um...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|Is there a problem?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|No! Of course I’ll help them! It’s just...You’re one of Grados’ generals...Why...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|These aren’t soldiers. They’re people. Should they suffer because their leaders fight? I’ve petitioned your aid. Take this as payment.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|......|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Selena|And who are you? You don’t look like one of the local peasantry. As you can see, the villagers have some bandit troubles. I would like to help, but I have orders to follow... I am required to quit this area at once. I would ask you to aid them in this fight. I will pay you for your trouble, of course.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Young Lady|The most wonderful man rescued me. He was dressed like a mercenary, but he had an air of elegance about him... He gave me this elixir. I’m sure it will help you on the battlefield.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Hey, listen! My village is being attacked by bandits. My name’s Ross. Come on! You have to help me wipe those thugs out!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|All right, just... Just take a deep breath and calm down, Ross. Leave the villages to us. We’ll drive off the bandits. Seth, take the boy somewhere safe.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|No! Wait! I’m going to fight, too!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|But...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|My father is out there all alone, fighting those bandits. I’ve got to get back to him as quickly as possible! I’m the son of the great Garcia! As long as I have my axe, no bandit will ever defeat me!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|All right, I can see you’re not going to be swayed... But you must promise that you will stay close to us.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Dad!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Ross?! Boy, what did I tell you!? What are you doing here? Don’t worry about me. Hurry up and get yourself to safety!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Did you really think I could just run away while you fight, Dad? You taught me that fighters fight for what’s important to them! There’s no way I’m leaving! I’m fighting just like you!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Ross... All right, listen to me. We’ll cut our way out of here together!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Bone|Wait a minute! Wh-who are you?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Bone|Urgh...Blast...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|You saved my son. I owe you my thanks.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|It’s not necessary...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|...Hold on a moment... Aren’t you..the great Garcia? You fought for Renais, didn’t you?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|......|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Seth, do you know this man?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|He was a troop commander for Renais until around ten years ago. When I was a recruit, the soldiers used to tell so many tales about him. They called him a daring and fearless fighter for Renais. Master Garcia, you must know the peril our homeland faces right now... Can we impose upon you to lend your strength to Renais once again?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|...I’m sorry. I’m retired now. I’m not a soldier anymore. It’s... a decision I made long ago.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|Master Garcia...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|...When I was a soldier, I lived my life fighting for my country’s honor. I left no time for my family. I spent my life fighting for faceless, uncaring nobles. When my wife fell ill and died, I met the child she had left behind... At that moment, I finally realized what my duty had cost me.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|......|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|I stood at my wife’s grave and promised her I would be a father to our son. I’m done with armies. I’m done with fighting, except to protect my son. I’ve no regrets. I’m the boy’s father.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|......|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|You...you blasted fool! Father, what’s all this nonsense I’m hearing?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Ross!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|If you’re not going, then I will! I’m a fighter! I know I can do this!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Ross, what are you saying? I...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Dad, please! Listen to me! I respect you more than any other man in the world. I know you gave up being a soldier for me. I know that! But how can you throw away such a big part of yourself? You’re a warrior at heart! You can’t give that up and be happy!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|......|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Look at me, Dad! Have you seen me fight? I’m not a child anymore. I’m a warrior, like you. You’re free to worry, but I can survive on my own!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|...Ross.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|You want to challenge me, Father? I’m a fighter! The best in all of Ide! I’m not gonna lose to you! I’m not gonna lose to anyone!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|...You’re right. You’re a good soldier, Ross.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Sir Seth... If these old bones of mine can still serve, I’d like to join you.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Dad...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Garcia|Looks like my boy grew up while I wasn’t looking... He’s tougher than I thought. He doesn’t need my help. I’ve raised him as best I could, but he’s right. I’ve nothing to fear. I should fight. I will fight.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ross|Dad!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Man|Thank you so much for your help. Please, stay the night and rest...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|We would if we could, but we have much to do and far to travel. Your safety is reward enough.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Man|Ah, well... My, that is a splendid bracelet you’re wearing.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Thank you. My father gave this to me.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Man|It’s a wonderful gift. But you should be careful, wearing such a valuable item so openly. Since Renais was invaded, things have become so dangerous around here. There are gold-hungry thieves and bandits everywhere. The most wicked are Bazba’s Bandits. They are...cruel beyond words. If you have something they want, your life is worth less than nothing. Just the other day they assaulted some travelers and...Oh, it was awful.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|I...I can’t believe such things...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Man|Oh, Renais is finished, mark my words. The Grado Empire’s stolen our future. Our only hope against them was that Prince Ephraim would prevail, but... Rumor has it that he’s on the verge of being crushed by Grado’s vast numbers. These are dark days. Travel with care.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|......|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Ephraim...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ephraim|It’s time to start. Are you ready, Eirika?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Yes, Ephraim. Let’s begin.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ephraim|Tell me, though: why do you want me to teach you to fight? I thought you didn’t care for violence...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|I do not like uncivilized behavior. I think one can solve one’s problems without fighting. And yet...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ephraim|And yet what?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|I’ve always relied on you to protect me, Brother. I would rather not be such a burden to you in the future. So, I thought maybe I should learn to protect myself...|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ephraim|I’m your brother. Brothers are supposed to protect their sisters. It’s nothing for you to worry about. It’s no cause for concern.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Yes, but... I am your sister. Sisters are supposed to worry about their brothers. So I would like to learn something of swordplay, if only a little. And maybe, someday, I can protect you in your time of need... So please, Ephraim.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Ephraim|All right, all right. How could I say no? Honestly, once you get an idea into your head, that’s it. I might as well give in. It’s agreed. I’ll teach you, but won’t hold back because you’re my sister. And I want no complaining once we’ve started, Eirika.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Complain? Me? Never!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|......|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Colm|Oops! Beg your pardon.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Hey!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|Princess, are you all right?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Y-yes... Someone bumped into me is all. I was jarred.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|Hm? Your Highness, where is your bracelet?|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|My bracelet? It’s...gone. Where could it be? Did that man–|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|I’ll find him!|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Eirika|Don’t worry about it, Seth. That bracelet was a gift from my father, but Ephraim needs our help. I can’t let sentimentality get in the way of my duty.|
FE8|02-TheProtected|Seth|No, Princess... We must retrieve your bracelet regardless of cost. You cannot lose it. Let’s go. We must hurry.|
