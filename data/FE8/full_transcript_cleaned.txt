the sacred stones that defeated the demon king radiated a constant and dazzling light the sacred stones are the only power against the dark the last hope of humanity it is only natural that evil would seek to destroy the sacred stones  there can be no other force behind this attempt to gain the stones a childhood friend appears before ephraim
how do you intend to use the sacred stones lyon do you really think you can tap into its power
mm  my research isnt complete yet but theres no mistaking the power the sacred stones contain and the stone of grado seems especially responsive to my dark magic i suppose its because it contains both sacred and demonic properties regardless if i can just press my studies a little harder  well i think i might be able to use it to heal my fathers illness if that works theres no telling how many other people i can help as well
do you think this is wise the power contained within the stones is beyond our understanding  my father tells me that the stones posses a power not to be trifled with
uh huh  father macgregor is also against it thats why they still wont give me direct access to the stone of grado for the time being ive made do with the radiant energies surrounding it theyre nothing compared to the raw power of the stone itself but  if i can show father macgregor some real progress perhaps one day 
using the sacred stones to study magic 
ephraim eirika what do you two think using the divine power of the sacred stones in this way  you dont think its a very good idea do you
 its just that i know nothing at all about magic i would that there were some way i could help you but i simply cant but lyon ive seen how hard youve worked to help others i know how much you want the power to make others happy i know these things and because i know you i trust your intentions
ephraim 
if you hope to use the power of the sacred stones for good i trust you can im behind you all the way
iagree with ephraim entirely you spend every night in the library studying cures for your fathers illness the power of the sacred stones is too powerful to be used for personal gain but you lyon  i think youll be fine youre the kindest person i know
thanks both of you hearing those words means a lot to me actually and this hasnt been made public yet but  ive already saved someone using the knowledge ive gleaned so far
you have
uh huh  a while back a fire ravaged serafew and a little girl got trapped in the flames her burns were terrible not even healing staves were able to cure her injuries but just a sliver of the stones power restored her life and healed her wounds we saved the that girls life ephraim oh if you could have seen the tears of joy in her mothers eyes
you really did it huh you are special lyon congratulations
well thanks but theres still so much more to be done i am happy though to be honest i just want to be able to help people i want to put the ancient magics to use for common good  thats how i feel
lyon 
and as my research moves forward ill be able to do much more too we have only the barest understanding of how dark magic operates maybe we can use it not only to heal wounds but also to stop diseases  what if we can read the future predict disasters move mountains
hold on lyon you cant take too much on yourself all at once what good is helping people if you sacrifice yourself to do it
oh  yes of course sorry i got carried away
you have a soft heart lyon i bet you havent taken any real time off at all so this is what were going to do today were going into the city and youre coming with us lyon
what but ephraim youve got a history report due
were taking today off cmon lets go
bu but ephraim

ephraim eirika  thanks so much im lucky to have the two of you as friend

carcino has betrayed frelia and joined forces with grado carcinos troops stop prince innes blocking his way to jehanna with soldiers occupying the road forward and back he is trapped in a hopeless situation eirika rushes to the princes aid
general glen of the grado imperial army also known as the sunstone 
yes 
your orders capture the leader of the rebel army in carcino capture eirika
eirika  do you mean the princess of renais
eirika invaded carcino she massacred the citizens of port kiris then she fled south glen go crush the rebels who brought ruin to carcino
 understood sire
  
what did the emperor say brother
ive been ordered to kill the princess of renais cormag i want you to remain here in the capital ill go alone
if thats what you want brother so be it but you seem troubled  dont tell me youre concerned about fighting the princess of a ruined land
 hm  i never was able to slip anything past you little brother youre right this duty falls heavily on my shoulders more then any other
tell me brother do you know this princess
yes when renais and grado were still close  i met the girl  i met eirika only once we spoke briefly but i felt she was a woman of great kindness i cannot bring myself to believe princess eirika is evil i cannot
 glen the emperor has ordered 
theres the rub cormag thats it exactly his majesty has never spoken a falsehood in all the time ive served him and as a servant of the empire i am duty bound to obey his orders but i can see no reason to think princess eirikas heart is any less gentle now
what are these cowardly mutterings it is because you three generals are weak that we others must work so hard and yet you get the honor of killing the girl how i long to do your duty for you
rrrr valter you treacherous swine 
whats this is this how you speak toward your peer knights of the realm lest youve forgotten i too am a general the same rank as you
you wretch you were cast out from the army for mistreating civilians what lies have you told to receive pardon and reinstatement at the same tome
our beloved emperor felt my skills were needed and his word is law his majesty has earned my sincerest and most undying gratitude and then we have you three duessel selena and you  the three of you have proven to be unreliable time and time again we were brought in to plug the holes dont you see you ought to thank me glen
valter if you dare insult my brother further 
come now cormag and what would you do to me if i did would you fight me here would you show such disloyalty to the emperor
 
peace cormag we are his majestys men we will honor his commands mark my words valter your crimes are neither forgotten nor forgiven
hmph 
prince innes what do you say can you continue
yes of course do you believe this is enough to make me give up i am surprised you mercenaries havent turned and fled though
naw you see geriks mercenaries takes its name from me gerik im the chief here if i quit while our employer still fought on theyd want a new name you follow me so  whats the plan
same as before we remain surrounded theyre not going to allow us simply to walk out of here  i send a messenger off with news of our plight however even on the wings of a pegasus knight frelia is days away we can expect no help from them
so we tighten our belts and survive is that it or would you rather quit this place and rest in comfort
surrender im the prince of frelia i dont know the meaning of the words the fate of the world rides on my shoulders and ill make it to jehanna even if i have to crawl to do it
now that makes me feel better if youre so determined we may all live a little while longer 
hey chief prince
what is it tethys
ive got bad news and then ive got worse news
whats the bad news
weve no more weapons in reserve what youre holding is what weve got once those are gone there wont be much fight left in us
that is bad news  well whats the worse news
theyve begun to move theyre going to attack again looks like theyre sending up the whole lot of em this time
   right you two youre done here discharged fired whatever you can surrender or flee the choice is yours
what
im the one theyre after throw down your weapons and youll walk away alive i dont need you here youll only be in my way who knows you filthy sellswordsll probably sell me out anyway
hold on there thats not true and you know it
peace tethys hey prince what are you going to do
im going to get out of here on my own ill break to the south and escape into the mountains
that aint gonna be easy how you plan on doing that
im not telling you ive no idea when youll decide to betray me go on get out of here id rather do this alone
sounds like youre trying to make sure youre the only one who dies
   fool ive no intention of dying but there can be no false hope of reinforcements riding in to save the day you and i are not the same youre a commoner and im frelias heir we of noble birth do not shirk the duties to which we are born
  
what are you waiting for you may go
well played milord ive always loved the melodrama of martyrdom  theres no way i can abandon you after that fine performance im staying with you to the end
to the  what are you saying you dare ignore the orders of the one whos paying your wages
tethys i want you to go and surrender give my regards to ewan and marisa
dont be ridiculous im not going anywhere now would the two of you kindly stop acting like such men and you youve already fired us you cant order us to leave now
unbelievable  and you people call yourselves mercenaries i thought you fought for money not for duty
yeah thats one of the rules guess were lousy mercenaries eh now lets get thinking we still need a plan to get us all out of here alive youre supposed to be a good tactician so i figure i wont die easily tell us what to do prince well follow your orders
   hm very well ill see what i can do to avoid getting us filled with arrows
ah  say prince if by some miracle aid were to come from what direction would it arrive
 from the north but theres little or no hope of that even if frelia were to send us aid they would not arrive until 
this may be good news  then again it may be more bad news there on that northern mountain path  someones coming
prince innes
princess eirika the prince is surrounded by the mercenary armies of carcino he looks vastly outnumbered i doubt he can hold out much longer
i can see that lets hurry
heh heh  my plan to get rid of klimt has yielded some unexpected fruit the head of frelias prince innes will make a fine gift to grado
lord pablo prince innes and his men have taken refuge in a mountain stronghold do we have your permission to finish them off
yes flush the prince out and cut him down well find klimt later and roast his old bones as well heh heh heh 
lord klimt pablos troops are moving toward the stronghold it looks like theyre planning on chasing down prince innes and his men
pablo you mad reckless imbecile  if prince innes dies here the bond between carcino and frelia is sundered forever carcino will be nothing more than a vassal paying tribute to grado  we must find some way to aid prince innes
wait my lord klimt pablo is after you as well if you reveal yourself here 
ahh  may fortune keep you safe prince innes 
hey youre up youre getting paid a lot more than us common soldiers time you earned your gold
i hear you where do i start killing
th that way the frelian troops dont point that blade in our direction
ill do what i can no promises good day
whew  so thats marisa the crimson flash of geriks mercenaries  shes a beauty but ill keep my distance and keep my head
brother
tana what how did  what are you doing here
i came with eirika wait here brother its my turn to protect you
stop playing the soldier tana you will return to the palace at once
i will not eirika ephraim and you are all risking so much  i cant sit at home and watch i have to do something to help
tana   well talk about this later for now we join forces with eirika
thank you brother
prince innes are you well
eirika  is that you
weve come to aid you you must be exhausted please fall back and rest well take care of these dogs
i cannot allow that i will not run and hide while a woman protects me  we will continue the fight you can join us
if thats how you want it lets go then
 eirika a moment
prince
i would give you my thanks you the princess of renais came to my aid   i am in your debt
reinforcements have arrived gerik
lucky us eh good thing we held out as long as we did
that was your doing thank you
dont let your guard down now prince there are still enemies to fight and itd be such a shame to die now
i agree completely lets go
hey tethys looks like help is on the way
really perhaps faith is a good thing ive never had much before but perhaps good things do happen to good people
good things i like the sound of that what do you suppose might come my way
ha ha  i wonder 
reinforcements have arrived tethys
really perhaps faith is a good thing ive never had much before but perhaps good things do happen to good people
faith had nothing to do with this lets go we must join them
what a strange nobleman
say chief ive got good news and ive got better news
eh whats the good news
within our band of mercenaries  there are two women enamored of you
huh whatre you talking about you a fortune teller now and whats the better news
help has arrived looks like we may survive after all
elder pablo used his fortune to build his own private army now hes using it to wrest control of carcino from the councils hands  please help lord klimt so that he can help us
you know we have no king in the republic of carcino were governed instead by a council of elders its a lot better than any stuffy old monarchy i can tell you that you see anyone can be a leader in carcino if hes old enough of course maybe thats why the countrys in such a mess right now
ive heard that prince innes of frelia is a fantastic tactician grado took renais with no trouble but frelia still has yet to fall they say its because prince innes has spies reporting every move the empire makes at the same time all enemy spies in frelia are exposed and executed swiftly that means that none of frelias secrets are ever reported back to the empire ive never met prince innes but he doesnt sound like a man youd want as an enemy
is that you marisa
chief
what a mess  looks like the guild bungled theyre usually diligent about making sure this sort of thing doesnt happen but here we are two people of the same troop working for opposite sides
what should we do
aye well thats a good question  as a mercenary your loyalty should always lie with the person paying your wages you decide we can cross blade if you want but id rather you retreat ‘course if you betray your employer youll soil your sterling name
cmon chief what would you like me to do
well thats easy id like you to come over and join my side
right done
ho hold on  is that it just like that you know what this will do to your reputation right
uh huh
no one can withstand the might of grado  logic dictates we join now or be subjugated later i made the rational decision the only decision
urrgh  n no i cannot die when there is such wealth to be had  re retreat mercenaries to me
 ive found you eirika seems youre as skilled as reports say this is going to be fun yes yes yes i do so love strong women
shall we attack general valter
no well pass on dessert for now allow them to escape were leaving
prince innes are you well
eirika im sorry for troubling you
no it was no trouble
oh prince innes thank goodness youre unharmed
who are you
oh where are my manners i am a member of carcinos council of elders my name is klimt
a council member
so youre one of the traitors who ordered 
p please please i have no intention of opposing you or quarreling with you i too have been marked for death by pablo 
what is this all about
its a shameful tale  carcino is a nation divided as you know carcino has no king but is ruled by a council but now the council has broken apart into factions mired in discord 
factions  youre saying that the whole of carcino has not betrayed frelia
correct the moderate factions prefer to preserve our alliance with frelia pablos faction wishes to endear us to grado to surrender us to their armies once pablo realized he couldnt ply us with brides he began to have us assassinated those of us who remain have taken refuge underground we oppose him where we can if you hadnt shown up im not certain i would still be breathing 
i do recall enemy troops combing this area when i arrived  they were searching for you is that it
pablo has usurped rule of the council we had no choice but to hide not all of carcinos council has gone over to grados side though  you must believe me the whole of carcino does not believe as pablo does
 i see
lord klimt  i understand the hardships youve endured i am pleased to hear all of carcino is not our foe
i will depart at once for frelia to explain our circumstance to the king i think it is best if you return to frelia as well pablo has considerable wealth and he commands a vast mercenary force im sure hell send more of them this way as soon as he is able
prince innes tethys and i are staying with you is that gonna work
yes i would appreciate the help starting now youve got a new contract though the pays double if the two of you hadnt stayed with me back there i would not have survived gerik tethys  thank you you have my gratitude
tell me something prince did you get er hit on the head during that last skirmish
 thats unkind my neck is not so stiff that i cannot show gratitude i would ask for your continued support in the days ahead
we both ask for your help
weve got a deal lets keep each other alive
ah there you are sister
ewan how is it  what are you doing here i told you to wait in the inn and behave yourself didnt i
yeah but you always run off and disappear its not fair i want to have adventures too
you are such an imp  i am not out here running about having fun you know
i know thats why i came to see you i can help my teacher finally got around to teaching me some magic check this out
h hey knock it off you shouldnt be using magic here
well i just thought maybe i could help you work is all i can protect you now sis come on take me with you i dont wanna stay in that inn anymore
oh all right ill go speak and speak to the chief and princess eirika dont wander off while im gone
yahoo
princess eirika prince innes i think we should follow the advice weve been given and return to frelia continuing on through carcino like this is too great a risk to your safety
the peril is self evident however i have to reach jehanna and the only way is through carcino if i dont hurry nations will fall one after another to grados hunger
innes is right and the road to rausten leads me through both carcino and jehanna however pressing on will only invite more mercenary attacks
hey ive got an answer i know a way that leads over the mountains straight to jehanna want me to guide you
 and who might you be
ewan shush you know better than to interrupt people when theyre talking im so sorry please let me take my brother out of the way come on ewan lets go
no no wait please do you really know a route through the mountains
thats what i said at the top of that mountain theres a village named caer pelyn thats where my teacher lives im sure hell lead you through if you ask him nicely
what is your teachers name
my teacher his name is saleh
saleh  ive heard that name on the lips of frelias spy network lately hes a powerful wielder of magic who has been fighting bandits and monsters the spies mentioned something about a caer pelyn if i remember
what do you think
hm if my spies are accurate this saleh is someone we can trust
very well ewan will you take us to meet your teacher
are you sure you can do this ewan
not a problem all right everyone see if you can keep up

with her bracelet recovered eirika sets out with renewed determination passing through the ancient forest zaha brings them close to grados border as they near the town of serafew eirikas fears are assuaged by the lack of troops but never before seen terrors crawl in the shadows of the trees
were approaching serafew at the border of renais and grado once we cross well be in grado  renvall wont be much farther
that is assuming we can cross the border without mishap  oh look over there
those strange figures  what what are they are they human ive never seen anything like it what could they be
what have we done to deserve the trials before us what is happening to us how could such abominations walk out lands while the sacred stones protect us
  
lute please its dangerous outside the walls stay here in the village
those are revenants arent they they were the vanguard of the demon king in the days of darkness the tome of nazania describes them in chapter 2 section 7 paragraph 8
you know of them
duh im a prodigy i can recall almost everything i see or hear according to the book revenants attack using razor sharp claws sounds painful wouldnt you say
yes er well  be that as it may i must go aid those travelers outside you should stay here within the safety of the village
very well i dont mind staying here in fact it seems that smarter choice
magic is far more powerful than any monsters claws the thickest hide and the strongest armor are useless against magics power yes i supposed i could have studied swords but only magic is worthy of me even if this village were to be assaulted by monsters i could defend it perfectly
travelers you must listen to me the ancient forest of zaha is dangerous head south and pass through this place before the fiends surround you
who are you
my name is artur the temple has assigned me the task of cleansing the forest of these things there are so many of the fiends though i wonder if i stand much chance alone so if you would please flee now while you have the chance
fiends youre not talking about the same fiends that served the ancient demon king that cant be right  theyre nothing but legends and fairy tales 
yes i felt the same say when i heard and yet here they are this place is filled with them i wonder how far theyre spread  surely theyre not in renais alone
butwhy are they here how
beware your highness something approaches
please allow me to deal with this evil shade may the blessed light drive you from this land
we ought to help he cant fight them all alone do you have orders
one of my companions is in that village to the south if you can get there swiftly i implore you to watch over her safety
do you see that old snag to the south of here bet it would make a handy bridge if you could knock it over take a weapon to it and give it a few good whacks that should do it here take this and give it a try it ought to do the trick
oh my those travelers are being besieged by the agents of evil
ha ha ha right you are lady larachel
i cannot allow this to happen come we must charge down these cliffs and rush to their aid
we charge down these cliffs and the only thing well be rushing to is death how about we find us a nice gentle path down hm
ah yes well let us hurry nonetheless i simply cannot abide those wicked beasts running amok
lute help has arrived
  
lute
your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction it seems youre not a revenant
well i should hope not i wanted you to know help has arrived please be patient a bit longer 
no no i insist on joining you in combat ive been reading up on these revenants they are quite simply no match for me i am superior after all
  
hm
your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction it seems youre not a revenant ive decided to join you in battle now my name is lute im a mage of superior wisdom and rare ability ive been reading up on these revenants they are quite simply no match for me i am superior after all
weve killed all the monsters still wed best burn the bones to ash to be sure they dont return
i still cant believe what weve been fighting here  id thought those fiends nothing more than myth and legend
those revenants are said to be the least of the dark creatures and yet the weakest of them could outmatch any normal man we cannot take this enemy lightly
oh yes there are much worse then those revenants and the entombed  lets see theres the bonewalkers mauthe doogs gargoyles baels  why ill bet you just about any creature of lore could be walking again yes were in for some trouble even my fabulous power may not be enough
o divine light show me  is this a sign of dark days to come
by all thats holy what is happening
princess eirika perhaps it would be wise to return to frelia and regroup pressing forward seems foolish in light of recent events we cannot face both grados forces and more of those terrible things
seth i follow your point and nothing would please me more then running for safety but what of my brother he and his men are still trapped in the same situation we are i know full well that i may be leading us into even greater danger but  please try to understand
i do my princess and i vow to see you through this safely
aha foul creatures beware i larachel bestow upon you the honor at banishment at my blessed hands
  
oh where are the monsters
well we just finished 
ah glad tidings indeed the heavens must be rejoicing i am a tad disappointed however after all i did rush all the way here to show you the splendor of my might
gwah ha ha its a real shame innit lady larachel
whats shameful is the way you drag us around the countryside
pardon me but who are you
me since you ask please allow me to introduce myself it is i the true light and glory of the sacred realm of rausten 
stop lady larachel you mustnt continue you cannot reveal your true identity here
oh yes youre right oh i get so careless sometimes now i must ride off in anonymity oh how beautifully romantic
uh  right
fare thee well strangers perhaps our paths will cross again come dozla rennac we ride
gwah ha ha lets go rennac
all right all right
 what was that about

an ominous wave of dark creatures washes over the continent  eirikas journey to find her brother ephraim grows ever more perilous still she presses on despite the danger her will is strong the town of serafew located on the border of renais and grado the people of both countries have long used the town as a meeting place it stands as testimony to the friendship the two nations have shared these many years now however serafew is teeming with grado troops
well well theres an arena in this town perfect my pockets feeling a bit light say is that a cleric it is and a gorgeous one at that
something amiss sister you look flustered
ahhh p pardon me
no pardon me i never meant to startle you may i offer my apologies 
no its not necessary  it was my fault excuse me i must be going  good day to you
 and there she goes not my lucky day  she was quite the beauty too ah such is life i think ive time still to visit the arena though
captain saar of the serafew border guard how fare you i bring orders from his majesty rumor has it that princess eirika of renais is making her way to grado you are to find her and to place her in custody immediately
yes sir
one more thing  a traitor to the empire has fled castle grado weve received reports she is hiding somewhere here in serafew i dont care if you have to tear this town apart find the turncoat
yes sir general glen if she resists do we have permission to execute her
 yes permission granted
understood grados will be done the grado empire will repay the debt of betrayal with blood
 his majesty relies upon you captain be sure his trust is not misplaced that is all
yes sir
such loyalty to the crown if only i could hold such conviction in the righteousness of our emperor
something troubling you brother
no pay no mind to me come cormag lets go from here we ride northeast back to the fort
very well
its been so long since i last visited serafew my brother and i used to pass through here en route to grado i remember the harmony in which the people of both countries lived no walls divided our borders no soldiers stood guard in high towers the border town  it was to me a symbol of the trust between grado and renais
 and now it is firmly under the thumb of grados emperor
the peace i remember in this city  it seems like something from another time it seems lost now  forever
 the city doesnt seem to be very heavily patrolled they must feel its not worth guarding with castle renais under their control we must try to not draw attention to ourselves the west gate is undermanned 
pardon me may i ask you a question
what is it
im looking for someone have you seen a young girl with indigo hair
indigo hair no sorry
hmmm  thank you sorry to intrude
there was something very odd about that man wouldnt you say
he did seem unusual he didnt strike me as a grado spy but 
catch her dont let her escape that way she went that way
whats that
its coming from over there
lets see what the commotion is
traitor natasha surrender peacefully come quietly and you may have the chance to explain yourself before his majesty
wait please you must listen to me
take her
no you must believe me the emperor is not himself you must be able to see that
impugn the emperor at your peril weve been ordered to execute you if you offer any resistance but your words condemn you
that cleric is a traitor to the throne of grado what madness is this
ah 
are you all right
who are you
im from renais why are these grado men after you
youre from renais oh i have something i must tell you its about grado 
wait grado soldiers are coming this way well have to talk later now we must fight
so much for my dreams of making my fortune here  first the girl now the gold it really isnt my lucky day
you there mercenary what are you doing here at the arena get back to the staging area now
cmon why dont we both hit the arena itll be good training if youre going to risk your life anyway you may as well try to earn some gold
im reporting you to the captain youll be lucky if he just docks your pay dont forget you can be replaced in an eyeblink you filthy sellsword
dont worry little man i wont forget works work but i dont like fighting women  now then whats the rest of the day got in store for me  tails huh thats nothing but bad luck and more bad luck 
they may not want to hear what i have to say but  i must speak with one of the grado soldiers oh if only one of them will listen to my words  please grant me strength
look at this nows our chance cmon lads lets join the fights and steal our way through this pathetic town
oh hello did you come to see me dance im sorry but i just finished a few moments ago oh by the way would you be interested in one of these items a wealthy patron left me a small ransom in gifts after watching my performance you can sell one for gold if youd like or use them to improve your skills i simply cannot carry all of this by myself so please take this one wealth is useless if you cant use it to bring happiness to others right thanks for dropping my perhaps well meet again someday
life in serafews been harder since the grado occupation force took over here serafews got renais citizens as well as grado but its been hardest on us theyve singled out families from renais for the most awful atrocities please traveler take this sword its an armorslayer itll cut through even the strongest armor take it and strike down that blackheart saar
you youre that man i met  are you here to capture me youve been hired to silence me havent you 
yeah grados paying the bill they want you dead you know but dont feel bad its not personal
wait please  it doesnt matter what happens to me but you must hear my words the emperor of grado is changed he is not the man he once was the other nations must be warned before he extinguishes all light from out lands
hey no offense but im just a mercenary i dont care about grado or its emperor everything you say may be true or it may be lies i dont care either way
but thats 
even so killing a beautiful lady like you would leave a bad taste in my mouth tell me do you like to gamble
what
gamblings what i live for even when i lose i never want to stop lets have us a little wager if you win ill believe you heads or tails you call it
you cant  this is no time for games 
would you rather i get on with the job i was hired for
   um heads  no tails
all right so im heads and youre tails here we go      
   which which is it
what do you know its tails you win figures i havent won anything all day well lady luck has spoken guess im on your side now
are you serious
yeah sure i might cheat but i never worm out of a bet its a rule of mine
oh thank heaven thank you blessed light for your protection
i got nothing against heaven but im right here if you want someone to thank  no well  get behind me then ive got to take care of these fools
in my youth i was a knight of some renown ill have you know ive even crossed blades with one of grados most famous generals i have ah but im an old man now  im starting to worry  what if i die without passing on my techniques so i decided to write down what ive learned in a book i have it here you seem like a strong warrior id be honored if you would accept it
hope everyone well back home in silva just a bit more and ill be in the empire lets see ive got vulneraries antitoxins  oh and i cant let myself forget torches for when it gets dark yep im all set now i just need to get to the capital ill be the finest soldier the grado armys ever seen i swear it
hm whats this 
enemy of the empire deaths too good for you
emperor vigarde  glory to his majesty 
that was a tight spot
yes yes it was  thank you so much i dont know how to repay 
youre from grado arent you
yes  my name is natasha i was a servant of the people at grados imperial temple
then why the trouble with the soldiers would you tell us your story
of course  a few days past my mentor was arrested without warning they executed him they said he as a traitor  but those were false accusations the emperor had him killed a holy man to keep him silent
keep him silent
yes my mentor told me with his final breath the emperor plans to destroy the sacred stones
the sacred stones destroy them
as you must know the sacred stones drove back the power of evil long ago even now each of our nations is home to one of these legendary treasures theres one in my homeland grado and one in your renais 
yes the sacred stone of renais is still housed in our royal temple
the emperor plans to destroy the five stones one by one 
why would he do such a thing legend says the sacred stones are even now all that keep evil at bay
i cannot begin to guess his motives  you must know our emperor was a gentle man but one day he changed utterly before my mentor died he said the keepers of the sacred stones must be warned i tried to slip across the border but the soldiers spotted me 
is that what happened  what do you think seth
i think we can trust no one from grado not in these times not without proof however if what she says is true we cannot ignore the danger we face destroying the sacred stones  we cannot allow that to happen
i agree if only we knew if there were some reason for the emperors actions i must tell you her story chills me to the bone i pray it is false 
a moment please are you perchance  princess eirika
i am
oh  thank goodness youre safe i cant tell you how happy i am and please accept my gratitude for driving off that captain saar that saar treated all the citizens of renais with such contempt and brutality 
not here not in this city my brother and i spent such happy times here with lyon 
i beg your pardon but it will not be long before grado sends more troops please you must go quickly
im so sorry theres nothing i can do for you now please forgive me
do not be troubled princess eirika  we will survive and wait for the day of liberation to come there will be a day when you prince ephraim and all of renais rise up  until that day of glory comes we will wait unbowed and filled with hope

the group sets off in search of grados elusive imperial prince lyon innes has ordered frelian troops to aid in the hunt the troops return with news that lyon has moved north the groups search for lyon leads them to mt neleras deep within darkling woods the scorching heat and sulphur stench render the area unfit for human habitation  endless numbers of gorgon eggs stud the forbidding landscape
larachel  may i ask your advice
what is it eirika theres no need to be so formal
its about lyon  my brother was right lyons been possessed by the demon king he  hes no longer the lyon i once knew but i cant help feeling  there must be some way to bring him back
  
please help me larachel i want to save him rausten is the spiritual heart of magvel they keep the ancient lore youre their princess you must know something about the demons of legend is there anything that can save lyon
im so sorry eirika to the best of my knowledge there is no way to aid him
that cant be there must be something any clue no matter how slight 
our oldest legends tell us just this  only one person has ever been able to shake off the demon kings domination raustens founder saint latona the sure hearted shattered his fetters if one possesses a strength of will beyond that of normal men  only then can one throw off the shackles of the demon king but you saw it for yourself eirika with your own two eyes your friend lyons body has already been claimed by the demon king once its gone that far theres nothing that can be done when the demon king takes over someone he devours his spirit their very soul even if his hold on lyons body could be released that body would have no soul there is no power in rausten  not even the sacred stone  that can perform so great a miracle as to restore a shattered soul
but  lyon 
eirika  i understand how you feel but the prince is gone the lyon you knew no longer exists its more important now that you care for yourself if we pursue the demon king were likely to suffer for it i want you to return to rausten palace and rest yourself
thank you larachel however i must stay with the company i have to believe theres something i can do to help him lyon was always so kind he wanted nothing more than to help people its too terrible to picture him imprisoned by the demon king imprisoned  with no hope of salvation
this way the enemy went into the recesses of this valley
brother do you smell something
smell
yes an unpleasant odor like sulphur its emanating from this valley
are those  eggs
gorgon eggs  there are so many 
brother the eggs theyve started to hatch
no  hes led us into a trap watch out everyone steer clear of those eggs
e ephraim i must ask that you slow down if you travel so swiftly we cannot keep up
im riding ahead i cant waste any more time i must catch the demon king as quickly as possible
and when you find him tell me what then
    larachel rausten is the spiritual heart of magvel they keep the ancient lore youre their princess you must know something about the demons of legend i do not need consolation or peace of mind i need facts lyon as he is now  can he be saved
im sorry  to the best of my knowledge theres nothing to be done
  
your friend lyons body has already been claimed by the demon king once its gone that far theres nothing that can be done when the demon king takes over someone he devours his spirit his very soul even if his hold on lyons body could be released that body would have no soul there is no power in rausten not even the sacred stone  that can perform so great a miracle as to restore a shattered soul
is that so  i understand lets go larachel
w wait a moment hmph were you listening to me at all im sorry but the prince 
 i heard you theres no hope of saving lyon and if i cannot save him  i will bring him peace with my own hands
   but  can you do it even if you get the chance can you bring yourself to kill him it would be best if you and your sister left this to the rest of us
no im going to do it lyon is my friend the demon king stole him from me i will be the one to kill him
if your minds made up theres not much i can do is there lets go then
im sorry larachel
theres no need for you to apologize your words alone have won my forgiveness
  
wait
hold eirika dont go anywhere alone
lyons back there i wont abandon him
lyon lyoooon
ei  eirika 
lyon where are you
im  here
lyon  hold on ill save you
forgive me  eirika  its over  for me  the demon king has devoured my soul  im mad  and im going  to die 
lyon  what should i do how can i help you tell me ill do anything but you have to tell me
 the sacred stone  give me  the stone 
what
my body  is being ravaged by the demon king if it continues unchecked nothing can save me but if i had the power of a sacred stone  i could save  my soul 
lyon 
please  eirika  i dont want to die yet  i want to live  with you  if i had the sacred stone  i could  heal myself  please 
could the sacred stone really do that could it heal you
yes  please  eirika 
i  trust you lyon i have a stone right here
   ah  its true  a sacred stone  ha ha   heh heh heh  an abominable sacred stone  here in my grasp
what lyon no  youre  
ha ha  heh heh heh how disappointing for you this body is mine now nothing remains of your dear boys soul
you only pretended to be lyon  you deceived me return him return lyon now
im afraid theres no hope of that you see ive devoured him bite by bite slowly how i savored it nothing remains but this suit of flesh i wear there is nothing to heal not even the power of a sacred stone can craft something from nothing he cannot be saved
that  cant 
ha ha  bwah ha ha ha i love how humans look when theyre drowning in despair now is the time to be done with this stone
eirika
oh  caught up have you hmm ive changed my mind ill leave the girl alive take her there are memories of you in this flesh i wear and i hunger to see your face bear more suffering and pain
  
eirika wake up do you know who i am
brother  lyon lyons 
eirika  i know dont speak
i  i  lyon is  hes really 
lets go back larachel will be worried eirika  you can weep now as much as you need weep for me as well 
 it appears the enemy fled over this cliff
i see no way we can pursue him now 
so he got away is that it
theres no cause to be discouraged beyond these mountains lie the heart of darkling woods before we enter we must head north to rausten after all we still need the sacred stone of rausten as long as even one stone remains all hope is not lost come on we cannot give in to despair when victory draws so near
  
hold demon king
hmph  you again
 ive one thing to ask before i slay you where is lyon now when i kill you  will lyon return
heh heh  how little you understand lyon is no longer part of your world he cannot be restored i have devoured every last delicious scrap of his small soul
you monster
why does this upset you what does it matter what happens to that weakling now he was a sickly cretin whose trivial dreams were nothing but hopeless 
shut up he was my friend well always be friends i made a promise to him you stole lyons soul and corrupted his dreams ill crush the life out of you
gwaa ah  what my body 
dont resist soon you will be unable to move at all 
so you had the stone of renais with you after all if youll just give me a moment to destroy it 
stop urgh
and thats the end of your sacred stone  now then prince ephraim are you prepared
curse you  do it finish me with my dying breath ill cut you to ribbons
  
what are you waiting for are you frightened
 tell me prince ephraim of renais why do you fight on do you think you accomplish your sad desire can you restore your homeland from the grave overthrow evil or protect your sister
you wont kill me ill do all these things fiend  all these things and more for my friend lyon  i will avenge his soul i wont let his gentle image be defiled 
   i guess its true  you havent changed ephraim
huh whats  what did you say
  
whats going on youre the demon king  youre the ancient evil  you told me youd devoured lyons soul that nothing remained so why did you  how do you know about me its not  could it be you 
  
is that you lyon
uh huh  thats right its me lyon prince of grado im not the demon king sorry ephraim that whole thing about the demon king eating my soul and me dying that was all a lie
wha  why why would you say such a thing
listen ephraim ive always loved you ive always hated you ive always looked up to you i wanted to be just like you then one day i realized  someone like me could never become someone like you you and eirika are overpowering you blinded me with your radiance how could i live in your shadows and not seethe with jealousy
lyon 
before i ever touched the dark stone  i had a vision a vision of the future of magvel i saw myself standing with two roads stretched out before me one led to the demon king devouring both my body and soul the other showed me the power to fight the demon kings dominion and i well  gaa urgh
lyon
then i acquired the dark stone the demon king began to eat my soul and corrupt my flesh i almost vanished beneath the demon kings mantle the i remembered you  my mind blazed into wakefulness all at once my mind shouted out i will not be devoured just as i was about to lose myself to the demon king i was able to drive him back the demon kings desires are simple foul but uncomplicated he wants nothing but the destruction conquest and subjugation of man these shallow desires are nothing to the dreams of the human heart and of the two roads i had seen i chose the latter
 
but i didnt want to appear before you here in the role of lyon lyon the piteous victim  the demon king the fiendish villain  it was all an act high drama for you all to suit this grand occasion thats right ephraim im the demon king  the demon king is me
you lie  it cant be its not possible lyon was  my friend was kind and caring  he was a good person  but you  you are not that person
ephraim 
you  youre the demon king lyon is gone and you are a liar youre trying to trick me youre trying to confuse me im right arent i tell me im right lyon tell me
im sorry ephraim ephraim listen to me ten days from now  when the moon is swallowed by shadow  in darkling woods i will perform a ceremony  through this ceremony i will gain immense power power not change not only grado but the entire world
change the world
but after that  i cannot save myself ill become the demon king of old and try to destroy all of mankind ephraim if you want to stop this you must come to darkling woods i want you to come i need you to stop me you must promise
 lyon  i 
brother are you  you look ill
 is that you eirika dont worry its nothing
b but youre so pale what happened
 eirika
y yes
lyon is  lyons my friend forever and always
brother  lets get out of here larachel and the others are worried
 it appears the enemy fled over this cliff
i see no way we can pursue him now 
so he got away is that it
/***EOF***/
the stone of frelia has already been taken care of  how is it the stone of renais continues to elude us glen valter find the children of renais find them and take from them the bracelets that they wear glen take eirika valter take ephraim find them conquer them
yes your majesty 
ha ha  eirika eh shes a ripe little peach and her brother ephraim  hes better prey than id imagined i can feel my blood rushing at the thought this might be fun after all
caellach riev shatter the remaining sacred stones caellach take jehanna riev take rausten go crush the sacred stones they house
heh heh heh  as you will ill begin making arrangements for raustens downfall immediately 
bah why am i stuck with jehanna accursed ill luck i became a mercenary to escape that wretched place and now i must go back
duessel go to frelia punish the frelian army and their commander ephraim
begging your pardon your majesty  now that youve conquered renais what are your plans for her citizens the country is in ruins thieves and bandits swagger about as if  
leave them 
but sire 
sir duessel the emperor has spoken please 
  
selena remain here in the capital we shall have new orders for you shortly
understood
please your majesty grant me the privilege of a single question
    you vex us
your majesty you know that i will gladly lay down my life for an honorable cause but these orders  and all of our recent actions  they are not just if i saw any way in which this invasion protected grado i would hold my tongue but now renais is left ungoverned to drown in chaos and we gain nothing why do you wage this war what is it you hope to achieve youve sent our men to fight and die for nothing this isnt war  its murder
 duessel this decision is ours to make you have no voice in these matters
punish me if you must your majesty but i implore you please rethink this if this continues grado will  
duessel go to frelia crush the frelian army and he who leads them prince ephraim
your majesty
have you gone deaf duessel go to frelia crush the frelian army and he who leads them prince ephraim
   yes your majesty
  
commander gheb we captured a pegasus knight snooping about outside
let me go stop it that hurts
ooooh  you didnt tell me she was such a treat for the eyes heh heh  this is a prize worth catching
i i came for ephraim if you do anything to me he will not be merciful
heh heh  i like her throw her in a cell ill spend the evening giving her a thorough interrogation heh heh heh 
you b beast
that is fort rigwald it has stood unconquered for generations its defenses are legendary it is the jewel of grados fortifications and its walls have never been breached
and if we dont capture it any attack on the capital will be pointless tell me what you see seth do we have the power to take it
its a daunting task the enemy has the advantage of both terrain and numbers
but what about in morale
do you suspect the soldiers may be unwilling to fight
anythings possible this war is a sudden thing but grado and renais had long been friendly before these hostilities our nations were allies  no closer even than that this is the emperors war but the hearts of the people are not so swift to change for example general duessel one of the imperial three they call obsidian  he was the one who taught me what i know about fighting with the lance duessels sympathies are sure to remain with renais  and with our cause he is loyal to grado but he has no love of war im sure he will speak with me
  
and more than that prince lyon has been my friend for years he can be timid at times and perhaps was unable to oppose his father in this but im sure he detests this fighting and shares my opinions
prince ephraim 
there must be some grado soldiers within the castle who do not want to fight if we can rush the fort and seize the throne room i believe they will surrender
 optimism here may be deadly still its a far better plan than challenging the main army face to face
eirika is on her way to rausten to help end this conflict we cannot afford to wait here for much longer we must take this fort and then press on to the capital itself lets go
attack were under attack  looks to be frelian troops their commander is  prince ephraim of renais
renais this whole thing stinks my younger sister and her husband were living in renais  what is the emperor thinking starting this war i think  
 hey
ah
yeah i heard you talking about not fighting are you losing your nerve the punishment for treason is harsh youll burn at the stake
b but   its not just me even general duessel is opposed to this war
duessel youd side with that washed up coward and who is your commanding officer is it duessel come on out with it
y you are sir gheb
thats right so that should make it clear whose orders you follow eh you got that dolts if you do then shut up and get in formation no one cares whether you minnows live or die anyway got it
w wait a moment thats a horrible thing to say
and who are you supposed to be your name out with it
i im amelia  i was assigned to this fort today i am a soldier of grado i am not a slave
whats this now youre a girl youve got a lot of nerve talking like that to your commander recruit looks like im going to have to teach you about the chain of command
ah 
commander gheb enemy troops approaching
grrr stinking interruptions  form up you useless worms dont let those dogs near the throne grado cannot afford to lose a brilliant tactician of my stature no one will blink if any of you worthless toads dies but if i die   you should be happy to fight kill and die in my service
i became a soldier to honor the emperor general duessel and the people of grado but this this is wrong
thats the lot of a soldier were pawns in the games of kings and emperors we fight as ordered and we die as ordered thats it cmon time to go
oh what a fool ive been  i came all this way to help ephraim and i end up getting captured again that general gheb had the creepiest eyes and that laugh oh hurry ephraim  please hurry and rescue me
you youre a girl
ah dont make fun of me im a soldier of grado prepare yourself frelian dog
w wait a minute
oof 
are are you all right its not surprising you fell over from that stance can you get up
sh shut up
did you hurt your knee i know how it feels i did it often enough as a recruit myself to be honest i still do it more than i should
  
im franz im a knight of renais whats your name
im amelia
amelia do you think i could ask you to surrender this may be odd but i really have no desire to fight you
  
i get the feeling you dont want to fight either am i right
i  b but  ive heard prince ephraim takes female prisoners and uses them as palace slaves if i surrender will i be forced to work in the palace too
n no dont be silly prince ephraim would never do such a thing i think 
you think
no he wouldnt of course not you have my word of honor
 well you seem sincere ill trust you franz
youre a grado soldier but youre just a child
i am not a child im a soldier of grado and i will defeat every soldier of frelia i meet
is that so guess im ready then
um 
 is that the stance youre going to use youll drop your lance that way im prince ephraim of renais why dont you surrender and come with me
wha what are you going to do to me
calm down as long as you dont try to stab me i wont do a thing to harm you
you lie youre a liar everyone knows about prince ephraim of renais hes a beast who attacks any woman he sees 
  right this has gone far enough i am not going to hurt you if youre scared throw down your weapon and run away but if youre willing to listen id like to ask for your help you must realize this whole war is madness right something is wrong in grado
   i im 
tana what are you doing here
i came here in hopes of helping you in some way but while i was looking for you i got captured by grado troops
is that so well im glad to see youre unharmed tana you should head back to castle frelia immediately king hayden must be worried about you
no ephraim i came all this way so i could help you
and yet here i am helping you
ah well  yes that may be true but   but ive been so worried about you ephraim
i see oh please dont look at me with those teary eyes if youre really determined to help then youre welcome to come with us but you must promise me not to try anything reckless
ephraim  thank you i knew that you would understand how i feel
wh what was that you piece of trash what do you think youre doing
y you wench  youre that recruit arent you do you think you can betray me and get away with it
your threats no longer hold any power over me i i am not your pawn
prince ephraim the rest of the enemy troops have been routed
bring me one of the prisoners i have a question i need answered
  
im going to ask you a question if youve no wish to answer remain silent if you wish this conflict to end quickly however you will cooperate
    what do you want
why has grado invaded renais
 i cant say this war began on the emperors orders soldiers like me havent the foggiest idea what hes after
then tell me this where is general duessel
in the capital the generals been opposed to this war from the start hes been pleading with the emperor for days now but the emperor ignores him they say some are questioning the generals loyalty hes putting his standing  and his life   in danger by being so vocal
is that so  well it appears general duessel remains the same true man i knew before what about prince lyon wheres he been through all of this why didnt he do anything to temper his fathers aggression
   according to rumors  emperor vigarde was convinced to start this war by none other than the prince himself
what did you say thats ridiculous i know prince lyon well no one hates fighting more than he does he would never do anything to trigger all this bloodshed
prince ephraim please calm down
 im sorry
we leave the prisoners and the fort to the frelian troops seth i intend for us to press on toward the capital at some point i expect well find either duessel or lyon im sure we can convince them to join us in stopping emperor vigarde
understood but i have misgivings my prince general duessel and prince lyon are both men of grado if we are forced into conflict with them 
it wont happen duessel was my teacher and i know he is a man of character and ive known lyon since we were children he eirika and i are old friends
  
i understand your concerns if worse comes to worst and steel is drawn i will not hesitate ill fight and kill anyone who thinks to oppose me are you satisfied seth
yes  i apologize for my rudeness your father is gone and that means you are king of renais there is no other i just ask that you not throw yourself into needless danger
i hear you the decisions i make affect more than my own life once this war is finished i will rebuild renais with eirika that is my mission
myrrh
what is it
you must return to frelia i cannot take you any farther on this journey
what no i want to stay with you 
no myrrh im continuing on to the grado capital its going to be very dangerous i cant protect you  not as well as id like to anyway
everything comes from that direction i can feel my lost dragonstone  and thats not all the dark energy still flows unchecked  i cannot go home while it stains the air 
but 
please ephraim
 very well ah i simply cannot refuse you anything your eyes remind me too much of eirika you must not stray from my side do you understand
yes i will not stray 
selena your orders
i am ready your majesty in your service i am prepared to do  
duessel has left for bethroen take a battalion and follow him
understood when i arrive i will place my troops at his disposal
no  you will not you will strike duessel down
wha 
duessel is a traitor he has abandoned his country and sided with renais the punishment for treason is death
b but  general duessel a traitor thats just not possible there must be a mistake 
  
no  i did not mean that you are mistaken your majesty but but 
selena you have your orders you will execute duessel
    your majesty will you allow me to ask you a question
  
when your majesty saw fit to make me a general you shared with me some words of wisdom i remember the moment quite clearly you told me the role of an imperial general is that of the shield not the blade we are here to protect our citizens you said  not to threaten our neighbors i have never forgotten your words your majesty i have held them to my breast they govern my every action as general your majesty that sentiment is still alive and  
go
   i humbly acknowledge your orders your majesty  i am the empires servant i am your majestys vassal i am general selena the fluorspar of the grado empire

no  its all right were all suffering  were still completely surrounded by grados armies  we may all die at any moment  i cant lose focus now has anything changed
unfortunately no on every front our forces meet with defeat upon defeat raustens knights are scattered and worn and the enemy is closing in around them and this accursed sand  most of the units cant get proper footing and are being slowed down mounted units are having the worst time as their movement is severely limited princess eirika  i ask that you leave for safety well use flying units and magic users to hold the foe here
no i will not retreat if i give up now  my brother would not forgive me im the princess of renais i will fight either to victory or to death brother i 
theres jehanna hall  its nothing but a ruin now blast i dont know whats happened but  id better get to eirika and the others as soon as possible
ive discovered which of grados generals lead the forces surrounding the hall valter the moonstone and caellach the tiger eye two of the strongest of the empires generals with near peerless forces above all else we must rescue princess eirika and yet  if you fall prince ephraim were all finished and this accursed sand  most of the units cant get proper footing and are being slowed down mounted units are having the worst time as their movement is severely limited some of us can move better than others though  a combination of magic wielders and sky riders should give us some advantage whatever we do we must move cautiously
i understand this is just like the battle for renvall we either rescue eirika or defeat all the enemy troops if we accomplish either goal victory is ours lets move
valter  you should stop playing around if you dont finish off eirikas forces swiftly  her brothers left the capital he should be arriving here shortly you dont want to be fighting her still when he arrives trust me we are equals here in grados army would you like me to assist
all you need to do is vanish you disgusting old man eirika is mine i wont let you have her she is so strong so beautiful  shes the prey ive dreamed of
heh heh heh  your fangs are still sharp eh good very good ah valter  youre a beast youre bound to no country you care nothing for friend or foe kill a man claim a woman  you live for nothing more you wretched beast thats your strength thats what makes you stronger than any many alive a beast acts without remorse mans morality cannot win its natures way  the stage is all yours valter do not fail to get the girls bracelet our master demands it 
the time is nigh eirika  come to me
how goes it caellach
ah prince lyon thank you your highness for gracing me with your royal er 
you can stop theres no need for you to put on airs you were made general for your military prowess not your flowery speech
and an honor it is you know prince lyon youve got a lot of nerve youre really worked over your dear friend the princess of renais are you satisfied
is there some reason you ask
no not really i just wanted to see how youd react thats all
she  eirika has always been a very important person in my life both she and her brother have been friends of mine for a long time tell me caellach do you have any friends to speak of
huh yeah i got one an old mercenary i fought with went by the name of joshua he was a fool and a scoundrel but now that hes gone i miss the lad i dont know where hes at or what hes doing but 
do you miss that life do you ever want to be a mercenary again to see him
nope the time we worked together was fun and all but  no i dont want to end up another no name mercenary lying dead in a ditch id rather serve the grado empire and make a name for myself im going to see how far my axe will take me and then one day 
one day youll kill me and be emperor in my stead is that it
uh  thats 
its all right think whatever you like if it helps you do your duty as long as you do what i assign you to do im happy but for now im going you know what you need to do
yep leave it to me i am general caellach the tiger eye of the grado imperial army after all once my prey is within my reach i never let it escape too bad for the princess but theyve no chance of winning none at all
that building beyond the dunes is jehanna hall i expect thats where well find eirika and her companions duessel knoll its time we rescued eirika ill need all your strength
of course your highness ive pledged my service and my axe you shall have both
princess eirika  shes a friend of prince lyons isnt she ill do what i can to help you i feel like that is what prince lyon would want
the enemys numbers are great but we do not need to face them alone we must move quickly to join forces with eirika and her company im sure seth and innes will be there waiting for us lets move
prince innes  and saleh im sorry im absolutely powerless here 
eirika you have nothing to apologize for were not defeated yet jehanna hall has fallen that much is true but if we can hold out until ephraim arrives we still have a chance of victory
and reports place lady myrrh at prince ephraims side it is my duty to protect her i will not die without having fulfilled my obligation to her
youre right  i made a promise too i told ephraim i would live to see him again we just have to pull together all of us we just have to hold out a little longer if we pool our strength now i vow that we will all live to see our friends again
according to this ancient document   there was a huge battle here long long ago every day im out here digging up ancient weapons and artifacts out of the sand there are still more to be found of that you can be sure its even said a long dead sage left a copy of metiss tome out here  oh but i wont give that to anyone if i find it not a chance
all the highest generals in grados army receive titles named after gemstones the emperor currently has six gemstones fighting in his service caellach the tiger eye commands the forces fighting here the moonstone valter is taking part in this battle as well glen also known as the sunstone died in the mountains of carcino selena fluorspar was killed in western grado duessel whom they call obsidian is missing in action  the blood beryl whose real name is riev has also gone missing hm how do i know all this i know i may look young and naive but this is my job im here to pass this information along to help you out and its good information too so dont waste it
jehanna hall has fallen i wonder whats become of queen ismaire you there  take this and do some good with it
eirika
brother is that really you youre not some phantom are you
no its really me hold enemies approach
 ephraim even when we were children you were always there to protect me

its not necessary besides theres still a war to be won we cant rest easy till every last grado soldiers been defeated

is that so  well if you all hadnt shown up im sure wed be dead now youve saved us ewan thank you i am in your debt
do you mean that as a reward will you teach me some more powerful magic
 i suppose i should at that but all in good time ewan
yahoo
youre a stepping stone  and im moving up dont take it personally
bla blast  a bit more and a crown  would have been mine 
ive no use for these bloodless minnows  give me prey that will sate my bloodlust  i hunger
urggh  gaaaah
brother
eirika
oh ephraim  ive missed you so
and ive missed you i cant tell you how happy i am to see you safe oh i almost forgot i have something to give you
what are these
these are called sacred twins we took these relics from grado the dark tome gleipnir and the black axe garm  i doubt either of us can use them but  why not see if one osf your companions can use them they might have better luck
theyre from grado does this mean grado keep has fallen
yes i conquered the capital and defeated emperor vigarde but still 
eirika may i make a suggestion weve been able to join forces here so  how about if we all get together and trade information there are people on both sides waiting after all
brother
youve done well eirika
thanks to you ephraim ah  wait a moment ive something to give you
these are 
these are the sacred twin relics of jehanna the ice sword audhulma and the wind blade excalibur
jehannas sacred twins but it seems like we were too late  jehanna hall has fallen
yes and queen ismaire died resisting grado
now that we have at last been reunited once again perhaps this would be a good time to share information im sure we all are most anxious to learn of what has happened
i see unfamiliar faces among you here so allow me to introduce myself i am ephraim eirikas brother and crown prince of renais
im princess larachel of rausten the pleasure is mine of course
ill begin by telling you of how weve fared in our mission we seized the grado capital and defeated her emperor vigarde grados capital guard have to a man surrendered and laid down their arms pockets of resistance remain but the war itself is over
is that so
however something remains that still bothers me a grado man named knoll told me about something called a dark stonetheir mages had uncovered lore that led them to craft a powerful magic stone this dark stone may have been the catalyst of grados transformation it seems to be the source of that black wave of energy myrrh described vigarde died some time ago but the power of the stone played him like a puppet the war and everything that passed since was planned by the dark stones master
well who is it
 i still cant believe it but ill tell you nonetheless according to knoll the man behind this is lyon the imperial prince he said lyons got the dark stone
figures its prince lyon 
no that doesnt make any sense ephraim and i know lyon better than that weve been friends for years lyons not the sort of person who could start a war like this
but eirika 
i saw lyon recently ephraim you might know this but after i abandoned the sea route to rausten i traveled overland with prince innes to jehanna we ran into trouble with grados forces and i chanced upon lyon he didnt share the details of his situation but he intimated that he was on our side despite all appearances he was on our side so lyon 
eirika i also met lyon
did you really
yes but he was like a completely different person to be honest he didnt seem to be completely human
ephraim  what are you saying
ill tell you what i saw i found lyon inside grado keep this is what he told me he said he was behind this war he said hed befriended us solely so that one day he could invade renais  he told me he killed our father
that  that cant 
i know i cant believe it either i refuse to believe it how could he have planned all this since he was a child  i simply cant fathom it ive heard lyon changed when he acquired the dark stone ive no interest in magic but  there was something uncanny about him it seemed almost as though he were being controlled by something himself
  
the two of you might find this hard to accept but  the state of prince lyons heart matters little he has the dark stone that rock is the cause of all thats happened the prince must be stopped
not yet there is something that needs doing first
larachel
prince ephraim i do believe you felt it as well the dark stone held by prince lyon  it exudes a malefic miasma  we might be able to handle prince lyon alone but that stone is beyond our ken
then what do you suggest
the sacred stones
the sacred stones
weve all heard the legend of the five sacred stones they alone possessed the power to seal the demon king away forever so of course to dispel demonic magic we must use the sacred stones
you expect us to pin the outcome of this war on some fool legend
 not just the legend we also have hope according to lyon he has already seen to the destruction of grados frelias and jehannas stones
hm that explains something  grado forces attacked me intent on destroying the stone of renais if that could be the reason they chose to invade renais  the power of the sacred stones may be greater than wed ever known
yes exactly if we acquire a sacred stone well be able to oppose the dark stones might
but three of the stones have been shattered and our options are few do you suppose that during the invasion of renais 
no i dont think so the stone of renais is hidden by the power of eirikas and my bracelets
grado has made many attempts to take our bracelets every one has failed and so the stone may still be safe
we have to confirm that of course weve defeated grado and we must turn our eyes to our homeland its time to return to renais
lady myrrh
saleh 
im grateful to see you well the people of caer pelyn will be overjoyed that youre safe
i must apologize to you saleh you were there to protect me from the very start of my journey when we were attacked i was separated from you and  im so sorry to have worried you
lady myrrh as long as you are safe we have nothing to be worried about it will be my honor to serve you until your mission is complete
thank you saleh

the capital of renais after the twins absence seeing their home ruined by war brings them terrible grief orson a former knight of renais has been assigned to guard castle renais however he switched allegiances betraying his oaths of loyalty to his homeland eirika marks her homecoming by vowing to see renais healed
brother 
what has happened to our home what has happened to castle renais how did it come to be so ruined so desolated
spies report that the castle is being held by the traitor orson
orson  in retrospect i realize hes been acting odd for a while now he seemed so  dispirited
his wife passed away some six months back the loss may have been too much for his mind to bear his love and devotion for his wife were well known among the knights
  
now he sits alone in the kings former bedchambers he makes no effort to govern no one is allowed to enter the chambers and he takes no meals
what could he possibly be doing
i do not know the spies had no insight into his behavior he does nothing to deal with the dark creatures and bandits roaming the land reports say all of renais is engulfed in chaos region after region is revolting and orsons reign is already crumbling left alone it may very well collapse under the weight of its own neglect
we cannot allow the situation to reach that point were going home eirika were going to the castle

yes and im very grateful to you i came by today to offer you a piece of advice nothing more ephraim is coming orson hes on his way here to steal the happiness you two share
prince ephraim
thats right orson and hes angry i dont think hell forgive you for betraying renais youve done so much to free your wife from the grave its a shame shell die with you
no that cant happen  
thats all i have to say to you what you do now is up to you
 i wont let you come between us monica and i will live here happily together forever 
monica 
orson  why would you betray us
 princess eirika if anyone could understand my feelings it might be you for the one i love  i betrayed everything my country my lord and master  everything 
prince ephraim  you never did know when to quit renais is already lost its too late 
orson  you will move from that place that is my fathers seat it is his throne  youve no right to sit there
seth  so youve come have you
sir orson
youre an impressive knight seth you would sacrifice your life for king and country not even a moments pause its a pitiful unrewarding life through and through
it is my charge it is my hope sir orson  prepare yourself
prince ephraim princess eirika the castle has been secured and 
what is it
 this way this is the room orson was holed up in
 darling 
you youre orsons 
  
darling darling darling darling darling darling 
 what this is horrible 
  oh
this same magic was used to control emperor vigarde shes already dead and her corpse was used to 
who who could 
you neednt look any longer eirika lets go outside
darling darling darling 
 you cant say this thing is truly alive anymore ill 
no  ill do it  the two of them spent every day in here did they orson was mad but i think he was happy 
weve finally made it back yet 
mmm  we can repair the castle and what was stolen we can do without but the wounds and suffering inflicted upon the people of renais 
its too late to undo their pain once i become king i must set our country right i doubt the people will give me a warm reception though i did abandon them all i can do is try to win back their trust no matter how long it takes 
princess eirika prince ephraim you should look outside
outside
prince ephraim princess eirika the king has returned our king glory to renais long live king ephraim
  
 theyre not cheering for you they cheer because orsons misrule is at an end they cheer the possibility of a better tomorrow not the deeds we did today but how will the hearts of the people move tomorrow and the next day that is for you to decide
i will not let their hopes and dreams be shattered again i will be king like my father before me i will dedicate myself to their happiness
and i will do all i can to help ephraim
prince ephraim princess eirika before renais fell king fado entrusted me with this message raise the twinsbracelets in the hall of kings the seal will be broken the resting place of the sacred stone will be revealed br
i understand
so were supposed to raise our bracelets over our heads right
lets try it eirika
im ready ephraim
this is the stone of renais 
yes this is one of the five stones that defeated the demon king
if lyon had acquired our bracelets the stone would have been destroyed by now together we protected the only power that can help us stop lyons insanity
yes its the only hope left to us hope for you and me and the last true hope for peace 
lets get back eirika
 huh brother look our bracelets theyre 
what is this are they reacting to the light of the stone eirikas lunar brace and ephraims solar brace glow in response to the sacred stone with the power of the bracelets the twins can now change classes
i cant believe the bracelets contain so much power 
i wonder if father anticipated all of this long ago when i was growing up i never thought about becoming king i only wanted to be a good soldier a good warrior the best on the battlefield father never understood what i wanted but  i never understood him either
  
it was the same when grado invaded renais i should have stayed home to defend the kingdom  instead i raced off to fight for personal glory
brother  i dont think you know how well father understood your feelings when i last saw him he was concerned for nothing but our safety 
eirika is correct king fado asked after your exploits every day he always told me what a fine king you would one day make
father 
now prince ephraim princess eirika please follow me the sacred twins of renais should be near the stones reliquary
ah here we go this lance can only be one of the sacred twins of renais please prince ephraim take this sacred relic and feel its weight
so this is one of our sacred twin relics is it ive never seen them look theres a name inscribed here siegmund the flame lance
and this blade is sister to the lance the other sacred twin of legend princess eirika if you would
of course theres a name carved here as well sieglinde the thunder blade 
these are the ancient weapons of our ancestors the weapons of heroes they were enshrined generations ago to be used only by the king  and only in times of dire need such an awful power they possess and yet we need them to restore peace ive seen enough of the horrors of war but i cant turn my back on it if we merely turn our eyes away we surrender our world to atrocity and so i must fight ill do whatever i must do to bring back the peace we once knew
these are the ancient weapons of our forefathers  the weapons of heroes they were enshrined generations ago to be used only by the king  i dont know if this is a burden im capable of bearing  but i do know that this is no time to curse my fate i will fight for my father for my country and for my people
what is happening have you found the sacred stone
yes here it is 
wow it truly is spectacular this goes some way to brighten the dark shadows that loom over us
our countries sacred stones have been shattered by grados men the stone of renais is our last remaining weapon
no its not you have forgotten the stone of my beloved rausten remember there were five sacred stones for our five nations the stones of grado frelia and jehanna are gone but hope is not we have the stone of renais after all and that of rausten is safe our road is clear my friends i must guide you to rausten
youre right larachel were counting on you to lead the way
of course and you will all be welcome to stay in the palace and eirika you shall be my guest in my own private quarters let us be on our way
what is happening have you found the sacred stone

ephraim leads the group to zaalbul marsh in search of the missing myrrh they learn from soldiers and villagers that myrrh had been captured by general selena one of grados commanders she was last seen heading east to regain their companion the group will now be forced to fight ephraim steels his heart to the reality that he must face selena
so this is a dragonstone  the description was accurate it looks like an ordinary gemstone if only his majesty hadnt ordered me to bring this to the capital immediately  ive heard reports that prince ephraim and a frelian army have landed nearby if i didnt have those blasted restrictive orders i could  
 return it 
what
the stone  please return it to me
you  youre  
return the stone to me  please ill do anything
why do you want the stone who are you youre not from grado thats for sure
without the stone i  please give it back to me
answer my questions
my name is myrrh i come from darkling woods i was betrayed and my stone was taken from me i was imprisoned caged to be transported somewhere prince ephraim came to my rescue ive been traveling in his care ever since
youre with ephraim i cant let you leave maybe i should take you back to the capital with me
wait  youre from grado tell me has anyone around you  have you noticed any changes in the people around you recently
changes what do you mean by that
anyone near you  has anyone been transformed either in spirit or demeanor does anyone act in such a way as to appear a different person altogether
  how could you know 
the darkness is to blame ive come here to stop it
 you will tell me more if i find you are lying i will punish you do you understand
yes are you ready i will tell you everything i know
    i see myrrh i think i understand everything youve told me
good
but i cannot believe it how can i allow myself to believe it if its true then  then his majesty is already  
dame selena  whats that
it is a fluorspar  his majesty presented it to me when i was promoted to general this gemstone is proof of my commission its one of grados treasures  i received it years ago but i remember that day like it was yesterday his majesty smiled so kindly his voice was filled with dignity and affection 
dame selena you love your emperor dont you
what are you  
i can see it dame selena i can see how much you treasure 
  his majesty is most compassionate you see im a commoner i was raised in a desolate impoverished village my family couldnt afford our taxes no one could we were desperate some of us considered horrible things to make enough money to survive winter then supplies began to arrive we were told they came from the emperor himself he sent them to us a poor frontier town who couldnt even afford to pay taxes
  
neighboring kingdoms must have thought the emperor mad i can only guess but his majesty did not care about his standing among kings he cared for his people he saved us
  
that spring i went to the capital and became a soldier then a knight i wanted to dedicate my life to the emperor who had saved it i felt i understood his dream i felt i shared his vision 
dame selena 
myrrh this wave of dark energy you spoke of  can its evil really change a person that completely
yes  all trace of this person would be consumed destroyed
how can the process be reversed
 im sorry that is impossible
 i see
dame selena enemy troops are heading this way we await your orders
understood tell the men we meet them head on
myrrh i release you return to prince ephraims side
dame selena 
i apologize but i cannot return your dragonstone to you i vowed never again to fail in my duty to his majesty if you want the dragonstone back tell ephraim he must defeat me
but thats  
go now this place will soon run red all troops to arms for the glory of grado
prince ephraim the grado troops are lining up to the fore their commander is a grado general  its selena fluorspar
selena  ive heard she wields the power of the thunderstorm that she uses its might to attack from afar without mercy
prince ephraim i urge you to exercise caution when faced with such magic

  general selena possessed a curious stone myrrh is this the dragonstone you lost
yes it is but im saddened by its return my dragonstone is here and yet  my heart is heavy with remorse 
myrrh 
ephraim can you tell me why this had to happen dame selena was a good person she was filled with joy when she spoke of the emperor why did dame selena have to die why did we have to take up arms against her
im sorry  if i could have convinced her to lay down her arms i would have it was simply not possible i had no choice she had to die i know you dont approve but you must know i have my reasons
my apologies  ephraim i  i am not seeking to blame you its just that i grieve for her
  
i ventured out of the forest chasing after that dark energy i thought perhaps that i could negate its evil force is your cause so different from selenas how many good people must die alongside the wicked
myrrh 
what can we do to end this without any more good people dying
i dont have any answer for you but i will continue on toward the capital and perhaps i will find one there i will learn the truth behind this madness

 very well im heading there now if you need to go to caer pelyn youre free to follow me
you dont mind
we have little interest in the outside world but we do not refuse travelers i should warn you the road is not easy and you look very weary you should rest a night before attempting the mountains
we do need rest its true we are all exhausted from our encounter with those creatures we must give our men time to heal or theyll be useless in an emergency
its settled then ill go on ahead and let the elder know were coming see even when theres no fighting to be done im still useful
no wait  hes gone i wonder if hell be all right
idiotic boy i understand his need to be helpful but 
ewan knows this land well you neednt worry about him well depart at sunrise i suggest you all get some rest
princess eirika of renais hold
who you youre general glen of grado we met once in the capital didnt we you were very kind to me however if youre here now i have to assume this means 
yes it does i wish our reunion could come under different circumstances eirika i must tell you i come here on the direct orders of the emperor im to bring to justice the rebel army leader whos been terrorizing carcino its you eirika they say youve been murdering innocents
what wait what do you mean i 
 if you have something to say i would hear it i know all too well that grado has robbed you of your homeland but even so  i do not believe revenge could drive a woman like you to such depths and yet  here you are in carcino with a small army under your command and the emperor tells us that you massacred everyone in port kiris
that  thats a lie i could never 
go on
 this is ridiculous believe what you want could one of the legendary imperial three honestly be as stupid as this
 what do you mean
carcino betrayed frelia and set a pack of mercenary dogs to kill me and you paint eirika a rebel instigator its an absurd farce your emperor commits horrors and you believe eirika is a criminal
 what are you saying
you truly are blind arent you youre one of the imperial three and yet you cant see your emperors plan
thats enough innes theres no need to provoke him general glen weve told you what we know to be true what weve seen firsthand we dont want to fight you  but if you push us we will drive you back to grado with your tail between your legs
 i see you are more observant than you know i am ignorant of the emperors designs general duessel and i both questioned the wisdom of this war and if you really are innocent of the crimes attributed to you  why would his majesty lie to us i must know the answer
so you believe us
the princess eirika i met long ago was kind and merciful in spirit youve faced relentless hardship and yet that selfsame spirit remains true  lets put our fight aside for now i will learn the truth then i will once again perform the duties of my office if you have lied to me today i will hound you to the very grave itself
very well 
glen where do you think youre going
valter 
tsk tsk what am i to make of this those little birds i saw flitting away into the mountains looked vaguely familiar what do you suppose would happen if it were known you let eirika escape
do as you will im returning to the capital i have questions for the emperor clear the path valter
hold on now no reason to rush off is there after all this is where youre going to die see
 what are you babbling about
heh heh  we were a grand trio the imperial three you duessel and me but my place among you was stolen and i was exiled from grado
you slaughtered people who had no intention of fighting the emperors punishment was just and warranted
heh heh heh heh heh  after my fall from glory only desire kept me alive desire for revenge my hatred burned so fierce that i was only barely able to keep my sanity that hatred keeps me warm still today oh how it burns 
  
hear me glen wyvern general of the imperial three i live for battle i crave it i have no need for peace that is why you must die
cur youre mad
a battle between generals  sends the spirit soaring eh come glen entertain me ha ha ha ha ha ha
urrgh 
go the small fish are yours
heh heh  this is merely the beginning endless battle war without end  heh heh  ha hahahahahaha
/***EOF***/
ephraim  it is time i must be going i am still princess of rausten after all there is much to which i must attend renais and rausten are far apart but that distance can be managed somehow if you and i were to be betrothed that is  i wonder if i appear too forward  no how silly of me
ephraim  i must return to darkling woods with my father gone much responsibility falls on my shoulders yet i would ask  may i come and visit you from time to time
we of frelia will do what we can to aid in the restoration of renais if you have need of our assistance you can come to me at any time and another thing  it wasnt such a bad thing fighting on the same side as you thats all the day will come though one day we will see who is the better
where are you going brother weve endured so much to get home and now 
im sorry eirika i must journey to grado i just received word from seth in the south within the empire there has been an enormous landslide
a landslide
yes word is it was so great that whole cities were destroyed they say the damage is so severe the empire itself is in danger 
thats 
thats why i must go to grado the people are saying this is grados divine punishment  but these are the same citizens lyon wanted nothing more than to protect i cannot ignore their plight
yes of course not i will ride with you
no you must remain in renais our country is recovering but we cannot rest easy someone must stay to protect the realm
ephraim  i understand i will take your place until you return i will wait for you in renais brother
i can always depend on you eirika lyon  i will be king the type of king we often spoke of  strong and kind in measure an ideal king the people of renais and grado are under my protection and i wont fail them watch and see 
it is time for me to be on my way my friends as the princess of rausten i still have many duties to perform oh princess eirika  if it please you i would be ever so delighted if you joined my tea club i insist that you come oh say you will wont you
ive much to do here in jehanna ill start with what can be done and keep going from there first i must talk to mother she should know that weve won so that she can rest easily
we of frelia will do what we can to aid in the restoration of renais if you have need of our assistance you have but to ask i seldom trust people who act from purely altruistic motives  but ill grant you that friendships are a worthy exception to my distrust
weve finally made it home havent we
aaah you must be exhausted after the journey shall we rest eirika
that would be nice  but first we must seal this away  this stone banished the demon king with such power  do you suppose we could bring back father and lyon  that everyone who died in this dreadful war could be 
eirika
i know i know such things would be  i cannot wish for such things no matter how it hurts or rather because it hurts we must learn to accept sorrow we must take it into our hearts and tame our grief 
eirika  tell me sister  if lyon were here with us what do you think he would want
what he would want
yes you see i think i know it was the reason for his studies its why he wanted to know about the sacred stones or rather the fire emblem lets take lyons dreams and fulfill them in his stead we can do that cant we without relying on any mystic power
youre right brother we can let us fulfill his dreams as lyon wanted as we all want  so we may live in peace and joy
oh are you  im  my name is lyon uh huh thats me  the son of the emperor youre prince ephraim and princess eirika from renais arent you i heard you were coming and ive been waiting here all day ive always wanted  i dont have any friends my own age  so prince ephraim  princess eirika  what do you say from now on lets be friends 
/***EOF***/
 hh hh 
perhaps we should rest milady master saleh is it much farther
were close its only half a day ahead
i would ask for a moments rest before continuing we are all exhausted we can go no farther today
no seth ill be fine we must not be delayed by my weakness
whew  hah  i didnt realize wed be climbing so high
whoops
 as i warned you before we set out the footing here can be treacherous
do you people truly live in this place these barren crags seem unfit for human habitation 
material wealth brings strife weve no need of these things in this we are of one mind with the great dragon
the great dragon
ah princess eirika watch out
more monsters  master saleh do these creatures normally inhabit this region
no  those things come from darkling woods its been a long time since theyve wandered this far afield its as the elder says  evil omens take many shapes
it looks like those fiends have noticed us as well we should move eirika
im concerned for ewan as well ill go with you i hope he is safe
hey wa wait a moment we can work this out  you uh arent interested in talking are you aaaaaa 
whered all those freaks come from ive got to get back and warn everyone  but  i do wonder if grandmother is all right
oh sister
ewan are you all right
yeah i tried to fight those monsters and you know what i killed four of em with my magic thats pretty good huh
what am i going to do with you anyway its not safe here come with me ewan
   you you dont believe me  you watch and see ill show you how far ive come
ewan  youre safe
oh teacher its you you probably had to fight a ton of creatures to get here youre the best i hope i can study with you forever
ive told you before  my mission is my life if you wish to learn magic youd be better served by another
no way i wanna be just like you why would i go study somewhere else wait  youve gotta go out on a mission again dont you take me with you ive practiced a lot i can already use all the magic you taught me
   well you seem quite adamant all right you may accompany me i think being with me might be safer than remaining on your own
yahoo
ah hello
ewan how wonderful so youre safe are you
yep i took care of a whole mess of those things more of ‘em might show up at any time so ill just follow you to the village thats all right isnt it
i guess so  its probably safer than leaving you here by yourself lets stick together ewan
wahoo
you were one of the people with my teacher werent you you think i can fight at your side i can use the magic my teacher taught me well what do you say
i cant believe monsters have appeared here in the realm of the great dragon what is this world coming to this staff you help to protect you against the beasts please travel safely
saleh is that you saleh tell me is the great dragon well
im sorry elder i searched to the west but i found nothing
is that so  hm whos that with you
i am innes prince of frelia the circumstances of our journey have led us here we would like to pass through
please
hmmm  we of caer pelyn have turned away from the world outside the great dragon alone holds all our honor and esteem in this place princes and pauper are equals do you have a problem with that
 no i understand
hm  well then be welcomed as guests in our homes i see some of you are injured you should use this rock moss we have little beyond what we need but we will prepare food and bedding you can rest as long as you like
weve no wish to trouble you wed just as soon pass straight through
dont let your pride drive you to foolishness that girl there looks like shes ready to collapse at any moment shes ill from the height of the mountain saleh prepare some tea for the lass
thank you elder 
call me grandmother child that is what the villages call me
uh  grandmother may i ask you a question this great dragon 
ah the inquisitiveness of youth come lass listen to my words the great dragon is a blessing one that watches over all mankind why in days long past when the demon king appeared 
demon king are you speaking of the legend of the sacred stones the hero grado used the power of the five sacred stones to defeat and seal away 
no no thats not right at all ah how quickly did mankind forget its debt to the great dragon to hear the story now one would think humans alone brought about victory that is a gross mistelling of the tale only through the great dragons strength could the demon king be sealed away
the great dragon and the demon king 
mankind may have forgotten its debt but the great dragon never forgets it watches over the bones of the demon king in darkling woods it keeps the demon kings dark brood from swarming the world of men the great dragons vigilance alone has kept us safe from their blind rage
is that so im  im sorry i never knew 
hmph you dont need to know everything but you should remember that
yet grandmother we encountered those creatures on the way here and they have begun to appear in the land we live in as well what does this mean
ah  you have seen the effects of the omen that has appeared in the south there is an energy there that has fouled the air and darkened the sky the great dragon left darkling woods and went south to investigate we of the village wished to protect the great dragon so i sent my grandson saleh as long as well but they became embroiled in battle and the great dragon disappeared since that time theres been no sign of the great dragon either here or abroad we grew worried and directed saleh to look for any trace of the great dragon i am worried that the source of that foul energy may be responsible
a foul energy  from the south myrrh said something similar to this too is the great dragon you speak of one of the manakete
manakete how dare you speak so of the great dragon
i im sorry
but if youve seen the noble myrrh perhaps i can proceed more quickly you see our great dragon took the form of mistress myrrh in her travels and you tell me that you have seen the great dragon yourself lass
yes myrrh was with my brother
what where is this brother of yours
he leads a force of men against grado myrrh rides beside him
saleh this is urgent you must leave for grado at once and rescue the great dragon
understood i will 
oh where are you off to if youre going to grado the swiftest route takes you through jehanna it would be to your advantage to join us in our journey for a time its far safer then being on your own
you have a point  mistress eirika protecting the great dragon is my duty please allow me to travel with you on the road ahead
we are in your debt matron
not at all all of our guidance comes from the great dragon saleh
yes i know the road to jehanna lies here
grandmother thank you so much for everything
i know youll help the great dragon but please look after saleh as well hes not very personable but hes the only grandchild i have

myrrh returns safely to ephraims side a noble warrior to the end selena fought with great honor never once using myrrh as a hostage ephraim renews his vow to pierce the veil of mystery surrounding the grado empire selena is added to the list of innocents who grado must account for the center of the grado empire emperor vigarde should have been here but 
the grado capital  it looks like it hasnt changed at all since the last time i was here eirika and i came here once long ago with our father duessel taught me the lance and i studied history with lyon i never imagined id come back here armed for battle
 and so the hero grado and his companions used the five sacred stones to seal away the evil of the demon king and his wicked soul was locked within the stone of grado the stone of grado came to be known as the fire emblem to this day its kept safe and honored as a national treasure of the empire  i think thats about it for more on grados life read founding emperor grado its comprehensive
 its so thick  and the letters are so small
but you have to read it you dont want father mcgregor to discipline you again
 im no good with books the problem is they dont move i get bored silly i understand so much better when you explain it to me lyon
yes but its kind of weird to be helping you all the time its just that i admire you ephraim i want to be strong like you  brave and handsome  ive got an idea why dont you teach me to wield a lance ephraim i cant let my defeat to eirika go unchallenged i look foolish
its a deal we practice tomorrow though if you want to beat eirika you have to take this seriously
just go easy on me all right
ephraim  aaaah
another tremor  they happen a lot dont they are you all right myrrh
yes i was startled ephraim this place  did it always shake like this
yeah grados been prone to earthquakes for a long time tiny tremors like that happen all the time dont worry
really um ephraim
what is it
i can feel it  from inside the castle i can feel the darkness i feel a broad pool of darkness deep within its walls
perhaps its coming from the throne room thats where emperor vigarde the man who started this is lets go
father 
  
father  have we been foolish when you died i couldnt accept the loss  i  if only id been stronger  urgh
your majesty enemy soldiers are headed this way oh prince  
 hi whats wrong why such an unusual expression on your face id rather you didnt look upon me as though i were some horrid beast
i i beg your pardon 
did you say we were under attack i want all of you to strike the foe bring your weapons to bear on ephraim is that acceptable father
do  do as he says
understood right away your majesty
  command grado emperor vigarde  destroy ephraim 
  
ha ha the spectacular capital of grado the richest city on the continent with my expert eye i judge this card to be an incomparable treasure once this is all done i think ill just scamper off on my own 
you there hold
huh  youre a man sorry pal but im not interested in men
what are you doing here in the castle you seem to be weighed down a bit helping yourself to the treasure
ha ive no idea what youre talking about now wait a minute  you couldnt be  arent you prince ephraim
hm im ephraim but 
i i thought so youre the one they call the beast of renais  ive heard tales of how youve looted and pillaged your way across the land 
what
h hold on calm down you wont get any treasure by killing me if you want these goods itll cost you 10000 gold
10000 gold
yeah  is that too high fine then you get my sword as well ill join your army so thats me and the treasure for only 9980 gold what do you say
you know i have no idea how i got pulled into this conversation 9980 gold eh i havent decided yet 
heres 9980 gold is this sufficient
huh m may i really take it
sorry you set the price yourself didnt you now that ive hired you i intend to get my moneys worth
youarent going to stab me once ive taken your money are you once the fightings all done you wont burn me at the stake or anything
 what rumors are these people spreading about me
aha so this is where youve wandered off to rennac
princess larachel uh oh um 
come with me
wait  hold on now go with you where look im sorry but ive been hired by the grado empire and  hello im talking to you
rennac whatever is the matter i promise to listen to your story later but now we must be going
no im no servant like that kook dozla im a mercenary i escorted you to renais like i was hired to do didnt i you have no right to drag me across creation without any pay whatsoever
is this about wages i believe youve received ample compensation
ample do you even know what that word means youre the princess of rausten i thought working for you would pay well yet your purse strings are knotted tight and ive almost been killed so many 
the joy that comes from doing good is not something that can be purchased there all better lets go
no i said i dont want to riding about with you is   and there she goes oh  by the stones why did i ever take that job in the first place
we must hurry rennac

vigarde why did you invade renais why did you kill my father
  
answer me vigarde  so you really have lost hold of your senses havent you
 
your majesty am i finished
 
your majesty  its too late isnt it  forgive me
  
what is this  vigardes corpse  it  it disintegrated
it must be some type of dark magic regardless the capital has been captured ill lead a patrol through the castle there may be enemy soldiers remaining
ill go with you lyon may be somewhere within the castle
hello ephraim ive been waiting for you looks like youve beaten my father i thought you might  you really are powerful arent you
lyon is that you lyon you must tell me what has happened here in grado

i  i i  urgh let me tell you something ephraim ive been waiting for this moment for a very very long time
 
i will make the world grados  no my plaything ive been planning this my whole life why else would i befriend you and eirika i needed to learn where and how to attack and destroy renais  thanks to the two of you i learned all i needed to know while you feigned compassion for my weakness and scorned me in your hearts
what lyon  youre wrong we never  
and then my chance arrived i replaced my useless father readied my tools and set my plan in motion i began my destroying renais  and then i murdered your father
you  you lie lyon you could never  
shall i tell you a story would you like to hear of your fathers last moments youll laugh really your fathers such a weakling and yet he tried so hard 
lyon no more insults to my father or i may forget myself
oh are you angry ephraim but not even you can stop me now the stones of frelia and renais are dust and jehannas is soon to follow   which leaves only two more  i will destroy them one at a time  i shall see my dream fulfilled 
what
ephraim you are in my way therefore  ergh   how bothersome i truly do wish to be your opponent but im not yet at full strength lets meet again shall we assuming you live of course ill grant you the honor of dying at my hand like father like son eh
  
reporting in sir weve found a cell in the back there were captives 
who is it
ah
has my execution been moved up on the schedule wait youre not a grado soldier who are you
i am ephraim of renais and who are you
thats an odd question for an executioner my name is knoll until recently i was one of grados top researchers in arcane matters
so why is it you are locked up here
  
you need not answer if you do not wish to tell me what is lyon attempting to do i still have things i intend to ask him
you wish to speak to prince lyon you really dont know anything do you
what do you mean is there something wrong with lyon what do you know
  ill tell you all i know if you would like however i think you will not thank me once you hear it it all began one year ago  that was when the emperor died the emperors health worsened and then he 
hold what are you on about one year ago thats before grados invasion of renais began and i just saw the emperor i killed him with my own hands
allow me to continue in the order in which everything occurred one year ago the emperor died of the illness that had plagued him prince lyon was devastated he fell into an endless despair he felt unworthy to take the throne unable to rule without his father
  
he then began to look for a way to overturn his fathers demise he wanted to resurrect him  
wait resurrect him
yes as you know the stone of grado is possessed of unique powers it was once used to seal away the demon king and it alone held the dark ones soul it burned within with the demon kings rage and we called it the fire emblem prince lyon and a team of mages skilled in ancient lore hoped to harness its energies i remember the joy in prince lyons eyes when he spoke of using it to save lives
lyon 
prince lyon told us he intended to use the fire emblem to restore the emperor his death had been kept from the public but rumors were beginning to fly we knew we had to hurry before the people learned the truth of the emperors death prince lyon dedicated himself to research skipping meals foregoing sleep  and then 
what happened
i wasnt there so i did not witness it firsthand by the time i arrived the deed had already been done the fire emblem had been shattered split in two one was a sacred stone and the other 
prince lyon whats happened prince 
oh hello its you  what was your name again ah yes knoll youre one of my researchers ive glad tidings for you my father is back
the emperor
  
come father  open your eyes
  
your  your majesty this is incredible prince lyon what miracle is this it cannot be what   what is that stone
this this is the dark stone it bears even more power than any sacred stone i extracted and condensed all of the magic bound within the fire emblem the dark stones power is what gave my father back the spark of life
the dark stone 
now that the dark stone is mine i have no need for this empty husk
p prince lyon the sacred stone  what have you done
they are all in the way the sacred stones i mean four more remain and they must all be destroyed the only stone we need now is this dark stone of mine
  
after that  his majesty ordered the invasion of renais as prince lyon asked him to father mcgregor grew concerned with prince lyons health he tried several times to dissuade him from his path prince lyon executed him personally i too was branded a traitor and arrested my execution was scheduled for tomorrow
lyon  where is he now
would that i knew prince lyon frightens me now he is transformed 
hes  lyon is my friend
this way prince ephraim i believe its here 
what is it what is this place
this is the former resting place of the stone of grado the fire emblem weve kept the sacred twins of grado here as well if were still lucky they may still be here
the sacred twins  those are the ancient weapons once wielded by the founders of our nations lets see if i remember my studies  emperor grados were the magic tome gleipnir and garm the black axe
that is correct you know your history well
yeah its something i learned long ago from lyon
  
well lets see if theyre still here shall we
prince ephraim here ive found the sacred twin relics
and here they are  yet i dont understand the sacred stone was destroyed but these were left untouched why
i know not  perhaps  no never mind its an idle thought prince ephraim please take these relics with you
is that all right
yes i want you to have them and maybe  maybe someone else wanted you to have them as well
prince ephraim
youve come at a good time soldier i want you to take a message to frelia actually 
weve received dire news from jehanna its about princess eirika and prince innes  theyre under attack by grado forces led by tiger eye and moonstone
eirika 
caellach tiger eye and valter moonstone  theyre supposed to be the most powerful of grados imperial generals for them to have abandoned the capital and lead the battle into jehanna 
the knights of rausten have ridden to the eastern front to aid frelia but i fear for their survival
we march for jehanna immediately we will rescue eirika
b but even if we leave now we will not make it in time 
we will make it rest easy on that eirika is my sister that one will never lay down her blade and i am eirikas brother there is no way ill let my sister die
/***EOF***/
this way princess eirika prince ephraim is being kept in a cell back here
very well lets go
 sir orson how long ago were you taken prisoner
some two weeks past prince ephraim and i were forced to surrender weve been held captive here in this dungeon since that black day
did you gain any news from your captors during that time
unfortunately no not a word  our daily meal was brought to us by servants from the neighboring village they were instructed not to speak to us and we heard nothing of the war tell me seth how fares renais
 renais has fallen king fado  the king is dead
dead  my king  my apologies princess eirika i have served you poorly 
youre not to blame sir orson we must look to the future not find fault in the past the grado army pursues me in hopes of acquiring my bracelet my brother wears this bracelets twin and he is in danger too
bracelet ah i remember  prince ephraim still wears the bracelet and grado is after them if thats the case princess  perhaps you should entrust the bracelets to someone else
perhaps but 
give them to me or seth let someone you trust guard them if the empire desires you bracelet you are in danger as long as you hold it for your own safety your highness please what say you we must not allow the sacred stone of renais to be taken
everything you say is true and sensible yet 
  sir orson i am sorry for this but please give me your weapons
seth
what are you talking about seth cant you see im unarmed do you think they allow prisoners weapons what kind of injury have you taken that you suggest such foolishness
if i am mistaken then i will give you all due apologies however there are questions i have that i cannot answer too many questions why did no enemy reinforcements come from the castle during our battle outside why would you escape your cell and yet leave prince ephraim in chains how do you know of the tie between the bracelets and the sacred stone
seth there is some misunderstanding here i 
and why  why do you conceal a blade within your doublet
 what
 very well you havent changed a bit seth if only eirika had been alone you however simply will not be deceived
orson what is the 
orson why did you betray renais
my fondest with will be granted  to spend the rest of my days in the embrace of my loving wife once more 
what are you saying
thats enough youve done well orson ill take over now you may return to your beloved wife
who are you
weve never met i am tirado loyal and talented aide to valter general of the grado army
youre that monsters 
and you are general seth of renais yes i thought to catch a little bird in my net and it seems instead ive snared a hawk
where is my brother
ah yes your brother hes not here the coward fled lord valters pursuit  somehow he escaped the castle and escaping under these conditions  tch such stubbornness is quite annoying it was my cunning that led us to turn this unfortunate blunder to our advantage i spread the rumors myself i led the villagers to believe he was our prisoner what better trap with which to catch his sweet devoted sister
my brother escaped
yes but your no doubt emotional reunion will have to wait until the afterlife lets end this shall we first to destroy the bridge and cut off your only avenue of escape  all soldiers to arms kill the princess take her bracelet
princess eirika we have to get away from this place
but how the bridge is gone
blast
oh brother  im so sorry  i 
eirika
prince ephraim i hear sounds from the east corridor sounds like fighting
do you think it could be general seth and princess eirika
we have two goals here men save eirika and vanquish the enemy kyle forde are you ready
yes your highness
as always
lord ephraim we should join forces with princess eirika first we should be able to reach them by way of the eastern corridor
come now kyle that seems like a lot of trouble when we could just crush grado between us
a lot of trouble forde youre as insolent as you are careless if anything were to happen to princess eirika we knights of renais would 
fine fine i see where you stand calm down before you boil over prince ephraim will decide how shall we proceed your highness
we await your command prince ephraim
both of you follow me
eirika are you well
brother is it really  youre alive youre alive
well of course i am after we escaped renvall i thought id strike a blow against the emperor himself when i heard that youd been waylaid by the enemy however i turned back to find you looks like my timing was impeccable
im so sorry the irony is that i was trying to rescue you all i did was interfere with your plans 
what are you talking about you came to help me didnt you your efforts alone are enough to inspire me come on eirika the enemy awaits
all right
prince ephraim
general seth youre safe
princess eirika is safe as well im afraid i have much news to relate to you that will have to wait though for now we must cut our way out of here
yes lets conclude our business here before we talk of other matters come on
yes sire
brother
ha franz howve you been
i should ask you wed heard you were captured by grados men i was worried
worried i ride with prince ephraim little brother death will have a tough time catching anyone who rides with our prince but its not like weve avoided trouble altogether thats for sure hm say have you grown taller on me
i have ive also finished my training im now a sworn knight of renais you just watch im going to be on par with general seth one day
you want to be like the general eh  what about me
oh i  i still want to be like you too brother
general seth
well met kyle i never thought for a moment that you could be bested easily
no sir and i never doubted that i would see you again
kyle about orson 
we heard it all unbelievable isnt it but facts are facts
yes if orson can turn his back on renais  we remaining knights will have to work all the harder to prove ourselves lets go kyle
yes sir
hmm  my men were unable to finish the job were they it falls on me to show you my own special brand of power
very impressive  however  i expect youll wish youd died here on my steel lord valter is not nearly as merciful as i 
brother 
i worried you didnt i eirika and you as well general
not at all were happy youre safe but tell me prince do you know of orsons treachery against you and all of renais
yes though i learned of it all too late after wed been trapped at renvall i still find it difficult to believe that after all his years of service to renais  i am morally responsible for his plight
ephraim 
 ephraim
what is it myrrh
somethings coming  its drawing near dark big and great in number
i understand it looks like we should get out of here
um brother this girl  her hair is indigo  where did 
ah thats a long story for now we must move suffice to say emperor vigarde has enlisted some  otherworldly powers we must warn everyone of the danger
/***EOF***/
jehanna home of dancing white sands this largely barren desert nation is infamous for its mercenary forces in accordance with her husbands dying wish the beautiful ismaire rules jehanna the queen of the white dunes governs jehanna with grace and honor when he was young her son left jehanna his whereabouts remain unknown after passing through caer pelyn eirika arrives in jehanna there she finds the nation embroiled in combat with grados forces

theres no mistake look for yourself ive brought his corpse with me thats him right over there isnt it
no  brother 
not a pretty sight eh youll be hard pressed to ready that for a proper burial but listen cormag theres no reason for you to grieve after all who is better than you to replace your brother in his majestys service picture it general cormag the new and improved sunstone eh
who did this  who is responsible who
glens last orders were to find and subdue eirika ‘tis a pity i was delayed i arrived to witness the final blow myself i watched eirika run her blade right through his chest and then flee
eirika where is she now
hm what would you do if i told you without orders from his majesty 
answer me
 in the eastern mountains of carcino the forests are thick in that region it wont be easy finding her but 
gone already ive sent a gift your way eirika but i trust you can handle it youre my girl after all i need you to be strong for me  heh heh  ha ha ha ha ha
messenger messenger i bring word from frelia
go on what news do you bring
prince innes youre alive and well when the reinforcements rode into carcino you were nowhere to be seen  we thought perhaps the enemy forces had reached you and  its good to see you well milord
im sorry to have troubled you but remember the duty i bear is a harsh master it will not let me die easily
of course prince innes 
yes what word do you bring of frelia speak
yes your highness frelia has invaded carcino and engaged the traitor pablos mercenary army with aid from the elder klimt we are crushing the foe where we find them pablos faction is retreating ever southward toward jehanna 
towards jehanna they must be planning to join with the grado forces there
pardon me but i must know  do you have word of my brother
yes prince ephraim has forced them surrender of grados fortress at rigwald he is now marching onward toward the imperial capital
toward the capital 
that fool  emperor vigarde himself and his imperial guard are in the capital its too strong a force  even for ephraim
no  i believe in my brother i know he fights still the bracelet tells me so
ah eirika is it time to go already
larachel were going to break through the grado lines and join the army of jehanna you should keep to the rear where its safe 
no i will stay with you confronting evil boldly is the sworn duty of any ally of justice and it may be that grados goal is the stone of jehanna  i cannot stand by and let it be destroyed
larachel where did you come by such information
hm that uh well the wind whispered to me in the night
the wind whispered to you
yes thats right  and according to that gentle breeze there are knights riding this way from rausten even as we speak if we can but hold out until they arrive the battle will surely be ours come eirika let us be on our way
w wait a moment larachel who are you
they should be arriving anytime now are you ready aias
mm everythings in place this princess eirika supposedly defeated general glen i wonder  if its true then shes a foe to be reckoned with and no doubt still theres no reason to worry i can best her i know it
youll take her ive no fear we fought as mercenaries together and i know what youre capable of i could search the continent over and not find a man to match your skills
im honored to hear you say that but ive no interest in the titles and trapping of grados imperial army
dont say that youre glad you came with me right you know we were both sick to death of living like desert rats im going to be king one day this war is just the beginning
ah  it starts again
word has it that the knights of rausten are riding from the north theyre mine i can trust this mess to your capable hands cant i aias
you remember what they called me when we were mercenaries dont you i was never once wounded on the field of battle not once  my skill is not garnish and loud like yours but ive never known defeat
yes that is true im depending on you aias
  all units prepare for battle
princess eirika the enemy is arrayed before us weve word that pablos mercenary army is closing in from the rear you must be cautious
all we have to do is hold them off until the knights of rausten arrive if we can do that victory is as good as ours lets get started shall we eirika
indeed
its not over yet victory still hands in the balance they key is defeated the enemy commander but 
very impressive youve pierced the battle formations id perfected  no ones ever done that renaiss tactician has earned my highest regard
rausten knights no  all troops retreat at once
youre eirika arent you
and youre 
you dont know me but you know my brother well enough im cormag im the brother of glen general of the grado army whom you killed
what
this is no longer war and this is not a battlefield this is a duel and i fight to avenge my brother he died in combat and ill not foul his name by murdering you unarmed but i will have vengeance
hold what is the meaning of this glen  are you telling me general glen is dead
do not play me for a fool you will not  your lies do nothing but stain your honor nothing more
youve got it wrong youre making a mistake your brother and i never fought he lowered his lance and left the battlefield to confront your emperor
 my brother you lie where is your proof
ive no proof but  here are the words he spoke to me he told me he believed i possessed a gentle heart when we met before he said i had not lost that quality 
  i see  those are indeed my brothers words but then who who benefits from   ah  valter
what is it
 princess eirika of renais i would be your ally
what
i dont care why youre fighting ive no interest in your goals i want nothing but revenge and i will have it if i can kill valter with these two hands what care i if grado brands me a traitor
elder pablo theres fighting ahead
grr ive misread the situation i cant believe ive been forced out of carcino its those accursed frelia knights riding down on us from the north if things dont change quickly ill be forced to appeal to grado for aid we must prove ourselves worthy allies of grado we must have them in out debt first ill use my magic to bury those enemies in the distance
grrr  ive got more money then youve ever seen what say you join me and take a seat of power at my side
argh  it cant be i  you cant have my gold  its all mine 
rausten knights that means caellachs  curses  all troops retreat at once
forward the lances show them the might of rausten
the knights of rausten just as larachel said  reinforcements have arrived in jehanna
what id like to know is what took them so long however it seems that all has worked out in the end
princess knights of rausten 2nd battalion reporting for duty
well done you may lift your eyes
princess larachel youre a 
what oh you mean  dont be silly this is nothing please dont concern yourself
i do believe milady that your disguise has been penetrated
oh  i suppose theres naught to be done about it now very well eirika youve found me out the beauteous wanderer whos been your boon companion is none other then  the jewel of the theocracy of rausten princess larachel herself i was acting under divine order to strike down evil in this land
  is that so but why did you 
the truth is  the princess was enflamed by the words of the court troubadour saaga  she forced us to allow her to journey forth anonymously on a quest for justice
i i see 
princess this is from king mansel
whats this war funds oh what a grand uncle hes just so thoughtful princess eirika of renais rausten will not yield to grado together let us defeat the empire in the name of righteousness
princess eirika princes innes ive received word from the front the palace of jehanna was attacked by grado forces and has surrendered
what how did that 
and the queen is she safe
that remains unknown
she may yet live we must hurry
the palace has already been occupied by imperial troops the grado army is being led by lyon the imperial prince
lyon
what it is eirika
its nothing   lyon 
hey aias
caellach 
that was something awful i never expected to see you get beaten so roundly
yes it was a complete failure the rausten knights arrived far more quickly then id anticipated but it doesnt matter does it whether i won or lost you were planning on abandoning me from the start werent you
 yeah sorry im not going to let things end for me here i want to rise  to climb higher and higher i will not be chained to my past i will not be chained to you i truly apologize but you die here good bye my friend

and i am ephraim prince of renais i come with eirika to warn you of the danger our world faces
it began when 
 hmm i see that is a tough tale to swallow all at once  however i have heard of the fell creatures in darkling woods larachel you will need the stone of rausten if we have any hope of victory
that is so uncle i would like permission to open the temple seal
hmm  theres no need to rush yourself so larachel youre home again in this blessed haven you should rest
how can i relax until i know that our sacred stone is safe at the least id like to ensure that the temple seal is intact oh 
is something amiss
i think well take a night to rest after all everyone is so exhausted my dear friend eirika especially has had a very trying time of late
  
eirika
ah 
dont look so sad it wreaks such havoc on your beauty
larachel i  what should i do lyon was one of my dearest friends  i feel so helpless theres nothing i can do to help him 
your friend is gone eirika all that remains is the demon king masquerading as lyon for the good of all humanity he must be defeated ah  if only it truly were that easy though
 
eirika  i never knew prince lyon i cannot pretend to understand the sadness you must feel however i do know this  if the lyon you hold so dear were here with you today  what do you think he would want you to do
i cant    
theres no need to rush eirika take your time and think it through you need to find your own answer now then its about time we found ourselves something to eat its hard to be optimistic on an empty stomach
yes ill be right there thank you larachel

what are you talking about tana theres nothing wrong with me im always like this
thats not true ive never seen you look so sad as you do right now if youre depressed im sure my brother would worry  and i well i 
  tana youre the princess of frelia perhaps its unwise of you to be so friendly to eirika and me after all alliances aside our two countries needs may differ who knows what the future holds those ties could snap in an instant 
no dont say that
and why not
you and eirika are both my friends we come from different countries its true but but  no matter what happens the friendship i feel for you will never change
  im sorry tana i wasnt thinking straight please dont cry
ephraim 
youre right though no matter what happens the bond between us will never disappear and its because lyon is my friend that i have to put an end to this thank you tana
  
that long face doesnt suit you at all has something happened
larachel  no this is how i always am
lying to the daughter of a holy man is a grave sin dont you know if you would like to talk i would like to listen 
  im sorry i cant talk about it im not even planning on telling eirika what happened
youre so stubborn arent you do you plan on shouldering the entire burden yourself
im sorry
if thats all youre going to say then theres naught i can do have you already decided on your course of action
  mm hm im prepared
 then theres no need for me to say anything more is there you and i are so alike  you want nothing but to help others you refuse to show weakness and you want to accomplish everything yourself however you must know that there are times when you must share the burden
thats true  and i feel better for having spoken with you thank you larachel
heh heh heh  guard duty at this time of night such a diligent soldier
huh who goes there
where are you looking im over here

a attack
heh heh heh  humans will never conquer darkness the guardian of light rausten will drown in a never ending night come my pretties its time to go the day of raustens destruction has at long last arrived
your holiness theres been an attack we think its grados men fleeing from frelias forces however theyve breached the palace defenses at multiple points
what
the imperial guard is at a terrible disadvantage of numbers right now its less a battle than a slaughter im not sure they will be able to hold out until the knights of rausten arrive
how has this happened our sacred capital invaded i must 
uncle please you must keep yourself safe we can take care of this is everyone ready to go

eirika suppresses her feelings of unease and continues to search for her brother passing through serafew the group crosses into the grado empire from here forward there is no doubt that they are walking through hostile territory in hopes of avoiding unnecessary trouble eirika and company head for a sparsely populated region of grado however it is too late their movements are already being tracked
so tell me  you have ascertained eirikas whereabouts have you not
i have i sent some of our men to follow the princess as she fled serafew they tell me eirika and her friends will be coming this way shortly our ambush is ready and waiting theres no way they can escape like rats in a sack as they say heh heh heh 
very good  wont that wretched valter be delighted now about this princess eirika  i hear shes quite a handful they say her paladin withstood valters lance  tell me novala are you certain you can handle this assignment

heh heh heh  pray it goes as you say very well do what you must i must return to the capital
will you not stay and see how eirika looks in captivity
unlike two other layabouts i know i do not have such time to waste i have much to do for out master a mountain of tasks awaits me my time is far too precious to waste on the likes of that royal whelp trifles such at these are best left in the hands of servants such as you
y yes of course  then travel well
hmph  freakish old man you should have watched you might have learned something i will capture the princess and i will replace you at our masters side you will stew in regret and i will enjoy every moment

youre not going to acquiesce are you very well bring me the child
h help me 
ah
look familiar shes a citizen of your precious renais now give me the bracelet do it or the child dies
no please  you win but i must have your word the child will suffer no harm
princess wait that bracelet 
its not worth a childs life forgive me seth
yes there can be no mistaking it next your weapons take them off and hand them over
no surrendering our weapons would be tantamount to suicide you demand too much of us
i see years of peace and idleness have not dulled the wits of all renaiss knights well then my hostage has no more use to me does she ah such a waste wait a moment  ive just had a delicious idea have you heard of the giant spiders prowling about this region theyd appreciate a nice hot meal wouldnt you agree
you cant 
nooo
ha ha this will be a delight to watch these fools will curse the day they were born to renais
why why would you  how can you do such a thing
this is war there are no rules here in war you can do anything anything you curs of renais have lost your idiotic ravings mean nothing 
enough hold your tongue
wha what
i  we the people of renais have long honored our allegiance with the grado empire and you invaded without warning you ravaged our land you killed my father  even then i told myself i must not hate grado or her people if i gave in to my hate the bond between our lands would be lost forever i refused to hate instead i lived for the day our nations would know peace again but  if this is grados true face  if you could extinguish renais without pity without remorse  if this is the case then there is no room in my heart for forgiveness
impudent girl do you expect your words to save your countrymen they will not your beloved people will all die as will you
ha ha ha if you must curse someone curse your dear princess
help someone
cry scream hahahahaha

wa  waaaaaaa i was so scared  so very very scared
thank you you saved us both if you would like please take this  and thank you again
your late father king fado  he ordered to keep me silent until the proper time arrived however with all that has happened with emperor vigardes actions  i feel it imperative that i tell you everything princess eirika are you ready to hear the secret of the bracelet you wear
i am 
as you know princess  renais houses one of the legendary sacred stones
of course its in the temple its supposed to be a ward against evil
yes the true stone is but the stone in the temple is nothing but a forgery the real sacred stone of renais lies beneath the royal castle guarding it is a powerful seal an infinitely complex lock of sorts
what is this true
yes king fado confided in me himself the sacred stoned banished evil long ago and possess power beyond our ken the ancient kings of renais felt it prudent to seal ours away they feared its power could be misused they thought to remove the temptation the keys to break the seal were hidden too  forged into bracelets   the very ones that you and your brother prince ephraim wear
our bracelets how could father keep this a secret from me for so long
they must know nothing of the bracelets tell them only if some great peril strikesthese were king fados exact orders prince ephraim knows nothing of the braceletssecret either the king told me this out of fear that something might happen to him so that when the time came the two of you would learn the truth
the bracelets have such meaning 
yes and we are the only living souls who know the secret of the stone of renais at least thats what i was given to believe and yet 
yet the grado army has made it clear that they want me only for my bracelet
yes quite clear at that  i dont know how but emperor vigarde must have learned the secret somehow and now his troops pursue the bracelet and we are no closer to knowing his motives
he would use the bracelets to unlock the sacred stone and destroy it in secret 
perhaps
which means that my brother  and his bracelet 
if hes been captured they may have the bracelet already and he may be 
ephraim 
princess we must take novalas words to be true we must hurry to prince ephraim the enemy soldiers who fled the battle will have reported our location by now if the prince is being held prisoner at renvall  i fear they might execute him once they learn of our approach
youre right weve no time to waste we must hurry to renvall lets go rescue my brother

according to legend the sacred stones have sealed evil away from the world four of the five stones have been destroyed leaving only the last stone intact the last stone must be protected to stave off the demon kings restoration eirikaephraim and company challenge the demons of darkling woods according to legend the original possessors of the sacred stones defeated the demon king in darkling woods his foul blood seeped into the land corrupting every seed and every root the once pristine forest was transformed by the flood of disease and venom legend says the demon kings corpse lies there still not dead but dreaming dreaming of when the last stone is crushed and he will rise from his bed of rocks and worms and return to the surface within darkling woods hideous fiends roam in increasing numbers as if responding to some unheard call 
 the time grows near
 hold
huh
what are you doing here human you should return to your own kind this is no place for you to tread this is darknesss domain  this is desecrated land
thats why ive come i have the power of the demon king i will save us all
you  evil grips your heart  no  youve given your heart to evil
  
what a tragedy  human flesh cannot contain the demon it cannot control him you think yourself safe but already your control slips i see the madness eating at you i see the beginning of the end
youre wrong this  ah urg  i do this of my own will  i will save grados people
  
i had a vision i saw my life traveling two roads down one the demon king conquers both my body and soul down the other i master the demon king and with that power urg  with that power i avert disaster i gave the people a better future  i resist the demon kings attempts to wrest away my will  i saw this and i made my decision i walk the second road
you fool  the demon king has blinded you to his true wish how can you not see it hes had you since the moment you first held the dark stone he has been hiding within you luring you deeper into the shadows of his heart he commands you and remakes you to suit his dark design
 youre wrong 
you think yourself unchanged you think yourself the master i see only more evidence that the demon king commands you now can you not sense  
its not true i  i will save everyone
think back remember are you truly the man you used to be would you justify war and murder to bring about peace and justice remember who you were and tell me if you are still yourself
  all of this matters not i know the demon king has claimed me it is not important  not if i can save the world my own soul is irrelevant
 it is as i feared you will not give up this madness i am morva the dragonkin who guards the entrance to these woods i do not have the ability to save you all i can do is destroy the demon that coils around your heart to prevent the further damnation of your soul  i can only grant you eternal sleep
i cannot sleep i have not yet  there is no taboo i will not break no sacrifice i will not make  i 
 you are beyond reason therefore i too must do what i was born to do as it was in that ancient battle  you will die here demon king
  
this awful darkness 
i know  i can feel it too
this is darkling woods  it was here the heroes met the demon king and with the sacred stones defeated him ive heard the lingering energies of that battle are the source of the monsters but i never imagined it would be as bad as this 
its worse than before  its grown so much stronger simply standing here is a struggle  but we dont need to worry my father is here hell take care of everything
your father
over there on the other wise of that swamp is the black temple of the demon king my father stands guard near it this is where my father and i have lived for as long as i can remember
i see so this forest is like a home to you
uh huh  my foster father leads the dragon tribe in the last great war both of my true parents were killed morva took me in and raised me as though i were his own child
so thats how you came to live here 
my father holds back the monsters that are born in darkling woods hes so strong and so very gentle one day i hope to be like him    oh

one of the dragonkin hm ah ive seen your face before lizard yes during that accursed battle so long ago when those wretched men bound me in their fetters they fought with an ally from the dragonkin at their side  i believe his name was morva
the protection of the blessed stones is lost the dark is rising malevolence given will and form now walks these lands unopposed ancient king of shadows  they appear to be waiting for you
very perceptive and now i am here i must tell them their wait is over i must tell them i have been reborn begone dragon i am changed i can no longer be stopped by the likes of you
i live and breathe to protect mankind i cannot abandon them to you now as it once did so long ago these woods will witness your defeat

 myrrh left this place long ago to test the limits of your influence could she have 
could she have what pray continue
you will answer me your reply will determine 
ha ha ha ha ha  such information has no use to you now you have dared to challenge me you have no time for joy or sorrow no best to focus now on this the moment of your death i would hate for you to miss it
this awful darkness 
i know  i can feel it too
this is darkling woods  it was here the heroes met the demon king and with the sacred stones defeated him ive heard the lingering energies of that battle are the source of the monsters but i never imagined it would be as bad as this 
its worse than before  its grown so much stronger simply standing here is a struggle  but we dont need to worry my father is here hell take care of everything

you saw your father then we must speak with him  
no  he told me he couldnt see you he said it wasnt a good idea for him to meet so many people as the tribal chieftain he feels he should maintain his distance
is that so  thats too bad
but he offered me words of encouragement and praised my efforts thus far he told me in his kindly voice to come home to him safely i will do my best to honor his faith in me
he sounds like a good father
he is  mistress eirika  ill do all i can for my father  and for all of you as well i will help you and we will defeat the demon king
are you sure you want to go with us myrrh you had so wanted to be with your father

myrrh where are you

here you are myrrh we were worried  myrrh are you crying
n no  its nothing the poison in these woods is thick it burns my eyes
what a minute  that dragon  could he have been 
o of course not  theres nothing wrong after everything you all have suffered this is  i cant  this is nothing 
myrrh 
ephraim 
im so sorry you kept silent this whole time so as not to trouble us
  e everythings fine ephraim  im fine see im ready to to 
myrrh let yourself cry these are dark times theres no reason to hide your sorrow
ephraim  i i   aaah  sniff  father  father 
 father hold on please father
lyon  this is  the end for me from now on  you 
dont say that father
you must concern yourself  with grado  the people  our people must be saved  lyon  tell me again what will happen to grado
i have seen it many times now as have the court mages its the same every time father its always the same sometime in the coming years the southern continent will collapse countless people will die instantly those who dont will likely starve
  
none but the mages and i know of the vision as you ordered but  if we dont do something all of those people will die please tell me father what should i do what 
lyon  when i die  you will be emperor  the emperor  must protect his country there is nothing more  that i can do its you  you must protect our people
b but father  i dont have the power  ah r renais  if i ask eirika and ephraim for help im sure they would 
you would ask renais to rescue us from  a natural disaster they would not help us  grados borders would overflow with starving refugees by the thousands renais would close her borders to us its only natural  renais has a duty to protect herself
no that would never 
lyon  you are the one  who must  save our people you must take my place  the citizens of grado  are counting on you 
father no wait i cannot do anything without you father
fa father 
his highness 
i am weak because i am weak  people will die i  the scene change quickly lyon and knoll in the sacred stones realm
prince lyon 
knoll  i  open the seal on the sacred stone of grado
the sacred stone but thats 
youve seen the scrolls you know there is a way to stop the coming disaster if those scrolls are correct the rites they describe can save all of grado but it will require a staggering amount of dark energy and a sacrifice as well the human body cannot contain the powers these rites demand  and yet  of the five sacred stones grados alone possesses a greater power  it is the very prison housing the soul of the ancient demon king if we could harness its power well  if we can do that we can avert disaster and save countless lives
but you forget 
i forget nothing i know i am too weak because of me all of grado will be destroyed i need  i need the sacred stone i must become stronger i will become stronger
everything is in readiness the stones have been destroyed the demon kings power swells the black temple possesses all the demonic power i will need the rites can begin all that remains is for me to sacrifice my life  the disaster will be averted my people will be saved

prince ephraim weve docked in taizel theres no sign of enemy troops at this time
understood lets move quickly and prepare to go ashore weve a straight road to the capital from here but well be fighting for every step
yes and the fighting will only grow fiercer as we near the capital if i may my lord id like to make a suggestion
this is the town isnt it ewan
yep thanks a lot teacher this is where marisa is supposed to be i have to tell her whats going on or shell end up working for free
what happened i heard there was some mistake but 
yeah the mercenary guild got marisa mixed up with someone else i dont know where she was supposed to go but they sent her here instead i figured id better let her know about the mix up right so what are you going to do now
im heading back to the village ive looked near and far but i havent been able to locate the lord dragon i must report my findings
oh i see 
ill be going now remember what i told you ewan 
i know i know dont be reckless with magic
well id better get going and find marisa that looks like a good place to start asking around
ephraim  from the east 
 that wont do seth i cannot approve of sending reservists to the front lines
but the grado army outnumbers our own by a tremendous amount we have talented soldiers but that counts for nothing against those numbers currently we have some ready reservists in the rear protecting our supply convoy what good is defending our convoy if it comes at the cost of losing the front we must abandon our rear guard and strengthen the van or weve already lost
this is enemy territory we cannot surrender the convoy
but prince ephraim 
seth i know you only want to improve the odds of our success and i know you only make these suggestions in part to protect me from harm however i have no intention of changing my mind in this i   myrrh
oh pardon me  i i  its nothing
myrrh 
prince ephraim its a trap the citys crawling with grado men were under attack
prince ephraim
all troops prepare to fight to arms
soldiers of grado you call yourselves warriors youre pathetic fort rigwald you lost it your general duessel a traitor where is the honor of the grado imperial army it wallows in filth and mud is this the ending you envisioned is this how you would be remembered will you let the bards sing of how you fell to the renegade ephraim i think not now get up and fight kill them all and bring me ephraims head
heh heh heh  caellach interesting what are you doing here you were ordered to loose your dogs of war on jehanna were you not
keep silent you decrepit fool i told you jehannas under control my plan is in full effect all we need do now is wait you see jehanna is an overripe fruit its being devoured by worms from within we can pluck it anytime we wish
heh heh heh  oh how your plans seem to have gone awry even now eirika makes her way toward jehanna your perfect fruit has turned to rot while you did nothing its time you will return to the capital with me
what are you truly serious you old goat glen  no its that black hearted valter  whats he playing at now
theres no call for that sort of talk that one has his uses after all you can leave the defeat of ephraim to your subordinates oh yes and you can use the troops i brought with me as well it will no doubt be an interesting battle heh heh heh  lets go now caellach you wouldnt want to hurt a certain someones feelings would you
bah what else can i do
more of those fiends whats going on their movements  its  its as though those creatures are cooperating with grados army 
ah  i wonder if that dancer will ever come this way again i dont know why but her dances really pepped me up even after a hard days work i felt as fresh as if id just woken up it sure would be nice if she would dance for me again someday
er hello my names ewan im training to be a sage i need to find a woman by the name of marisa i dont know where shes done if youll help me find her ill gladly travel with you im a useful guy to know in a pinch i can use the magic ive learned so far so what do you say do we have a deal
there you are marisa
ewan what are you doing here
marisa the mercenary guild sent you here didnt they they assigned you to fight under commander gerik right
thats right but the chiefs not here
i know it was all a mistake your commanders over there working on another job he wants you to join him
really he said that
yep
im on my way
hey wait wait take me with you this groups headed east too lets stick with them for now
very well
the enemy troops have been defeated were taking care of the wounded now
understood well rest in this city until were prepared to advance replenish supplies and rest the troops remind every soldier that anyone who breaks the citys laws will be severely punished anything else
we should prepare defenses along the east in case of assault the capitals not far and fresh troops could be here at any time
good point all right set up three rotating watches then  
 pardon me ephraim 
myrrhs gone are you sure
yes shes been missing since this morning there are no signs of a struggle i feel she left of her own accord
where did she go didnt anyone see her
one of the guards reports having seen a young lady heading east he said she seemed unsteady on her feet it may have been her
prepare to move out we head east
prince ephraim 
im not just acting on emotion seth the capital lies to the east as well
 
seth you will obey your commander and sovereign do you hear me listen i know what you said is true i am king in all but title now i know i must place my duty as commander above my life as a man and once i am crowned i most certainly will do exactly that however i am not ready to divorce myself from my compassion just yet i will find the balance somehow the means to save my country and her people that is the king i wish to become and so that is the man i must be i need your help in this seth
 i understand prince ephraim if that is your decision then i will do my best to assist you
im counting on it please be safe myrrh

seth look 
i see it it seems like grados army has already reached frelia princess this place is perilous we should bypass mulan altogether and head straight to the castle
but we cant just ignore this  you were there when renais was invaded  you saw what i saw you saw how the people suffered at the hands of grados soldiers homes were destroyed possessions stolen women kidnapped  anyone who resisted was executed without question without hesitation
 
please seth i cant allow that to happen here i dont want to see any more people harmed by grados atrocities
all right princess i understand perhaps we can retake mulan but princess you must act with caution your people need you too

franz you and i must work together to protect princess eirika i want you to ride with us
sir with honor sir
the rumors are true arent they the grado armys taken over the castle it looks like theyve seized the castle gate too smart work the gate provides defense and heals wounds to boot they must be fierce warriors to have taken the gate watch yourself
that knight encamped at the castle was wearing the finest armor ive seen it looked like it could turn aside almost any blade you swing at it i know my armor though i wager a good rapier or armorslayer could get through it
bah what a worthless lot of curs ive been assigned
this this cant be  i 
ive found them stragglers from renais dont let them get away
princess tana
sir gilliam  im sorry i never meant to cause you such trouble
it was no trouble i live to serve princess

i wish i knew
you havent heard from him oh i hope hes not been harmed  come we must go to castle frelia my lord father may know something
thank you tana
oh tana  im grateful to see that youre safe and home again youve no idea how i worried when i heard you were under attack at border mulan you are not to leave again without my permission do you understand

king hayden i am please to see you again even in these sad times
ah eirika it does my heart good to see you safe
thank you i was able to escape the castle before renais fell but im not sure if my father 
yes i  have received word of your father
your highness please tell me if my father well
 my friend king fado did not survive the fall of renais castle
 no it cannot be 
  
rest assured grado will be punished for its cowardly act this is frelias promise eirika please stay here and rest i cannot imagine how exhausted you must be
  
king hayden you know of prince ephraims disappearance do you not
yes we hear the prince and his men hound grado at every turn its said that hes led his forces into the empire itself reports suggest hes crossed the border and now fights in renvall
my brother  he fights on even now
yes my pegasus knights bought this information at a great price even though renais has fallen he charges into the enemys heart he is truly fados son  what a valiant youth i wish i knew whether he remains unharmed but i do not
king hayden i thank you for your offer but i cannot stay i intend to ride to my brothers side with reinforcements
i cannot allow it i know how you feel but this plan is suicide i would be betraying fados memory if i allowed any harm to befall you stay here rest and mourn leave this war to the warriors
i know you mean well your majesty however i have lost my father and my twin brother is in peril my brother he is a part of me  i cannot rest here in peace while he risks his life
no renais has no more army grados forces decimated it i wish frelia could provide you with support with soldiers but  my son innes is on his way to meet the empires forces we cannot spare a single brigade your own retinue of knights cannot possibly face grado alone are you so determined to go
yes  with apologies
 as resolute as your father eh what am i to do in the face of such foolhardy determination vanessa
here your highness
moulder
you called my king
gilliam
yes sire
you are to accompany princess eirika of renais into grado territory i expect each of you to provide aid and support for her brother
hmm quite a grave responsibility youve given us
no matter the obstacles we will perform our duty
our lives are yours
these are some of my most trusted and stalwart vassals they will no doubt prove themselves quite valuable on your journey remember you are venturing behind enemy lines you will need supplies i will have a supply convoy readied to carry your weapons and provisions it will remain at your side no matter how far afield you venture
king hayden i  thank you
no save your thanks for your return  with your brother prince ephraim
yes your highness
eirika you dont really intend to go through with this do you i cant guess how you must feel but its just too dangerous what would happen if you were captured by grados men
thank you for your concern tana but i have no choice dont you see tana i have to go
eirika  oh why is this happening whats gone wrong with the world
tana 
why would grado invade emperor vigarde is a man of peace his people adore him and you and ephraim are friends with prince lyon are you not what could be behind this madness why is this happening 
i have no answers for you tana i dont want to believe it but the reality is that we are at war if i do nothing i may lose my brother as well as my father this is why i have to fight its the only answer i have

eirika and company pursue the thief who stole her bracelet their chase leads them into the mountains where bazbas bandits pillage at will eirika cannot ignore her countrymens pleas for help she leads her group in search of the bandits stronghold
the local villagers tell me that bazbas bandits keep their lair nearby a few of them saw a lad matching the description of our bracelet thief it seems a fair guess that the youth is one of these bandits
bandits here in renais our homeland i had no idea  burning out villages stealing from out people with no fear of reprisal
it wasnt always like this the knights used to protect the citizenry  however with renais in ruins and her army tattered law and order are hard to find it doesnt look like the grado army is interested in maintaining order here if nothing changes renais will continue this sad plunge into savagery
  
uh hello

why do you ask
p p please you have to help colm you have to i told him it was too dangerous but he wouldnt listen to me

general duessel
selena have you been back long tell me how fares the campaign in renais
signs of chaos abound brigands ride without fear and the peasants cries fill the air
hmm  if grados troops do not enforce public order the situation will only worsen and still his majesty has given us no orders perhaps just this once i should take the lead 
what could his majesty be thinking breaking our long held alliance with renais invading without warning  hes never been this way before he abhors violence
  
and have you noticed the recent promotions who are they are going to certainly not to the soldiers who have grados best interests at heart i feel this invasion is the prelude to a much larger war i feel as though his majesty is no longer the man we knew him to be
glen it doesnt matter what any of us might think of our orders we are his servants and we will not question his majestys intentions
i know that selena and yet 
thats enough both of you his majesty summons us lets hope we can learn a little during our audience
 i appreciate your work in fulfilling your previous orders you are the hammers that drive the nails of the empires will  you will continue to operate  without hesitation  wherever i send you
by your command
in your majestys name
yes sire 
 however i know this  you my imperial three lack the strength to conquer the remaining nations alone in the invasion of renais certain soldiers performed beyond expectation i have chosen them to join you as new generals in the empires service  come
 the performance of these men surpassed even your own with the addition of these three  the empire will have six generals strong enough to conquer this land do you understand
heh heh heh  i am riev given the name blood beryl by his majesty i know i am a newcomer but i pray for your favor
 understood

/***EOF***/
thanks to the arrival of reinforcements from princess larachel of rausten eirika and her allies successfully repel the grado invaders still jehanna hall remains under siege on the edge of ruin en route eirika learns that the hall has indeed been captured by grado to rescue queen ismaire and recover jehannas sacred stone eirika leads an assault on the royal hall
 i yield the point is yours eirika youre swift arent you compared to you im  ive been bested at fencing by a woman pitiful crown prince am i not
thats not true 
oh no eirika it is the people need a strong ruler they dont want a weakling like me they want the strength you and ephraim share my body is frail i prefer to spend my time locked away in the castle reading  i think my father would be better served if someone else took my place im sure all of our retainers feel the same 
youre wrong lyon an emperor without compassion will never hold the peoples love and one day your compassion will surely save us all i believe that
eirika  thank you yes i i will do my best even though i lack your strength there must be some good i can do
there is
by the way eirika  if it please you would you accept this
princess eirika is there something wrong
n no its nothing
jehanna hall has been completely occupied by grado soldiers im sorry to report that queen ismaire is already 
and the one giving orders to the troops in the palace is crown prince lyon
what is there to give us pause should we not storm the palace and retake it by strength of arms
frelias spy network reports that prince lyon is an initiate of dark magic if this is true even approaching him will be a serious challenge id heard the prince dislikes violence however it could all have been a ruse
  
still if we dont retake the palace weve no hope of defeating grado we must rescue the queen no matter the cost 
i understand lets go
queen ismaire  please do not resist i have no desire to see you harmed
carlyle  why have you betrayed us after all these years of loyal service as jehannas most decorated commander  without you i could not have ruled these long years since my husbands passing it was through your unwavering support alone that i still sit upon the throne you are the cornerstone of jehanna you have held my trust more than any man so tell me why why have you betrayed us why have you betrayed me
your highness no  my queen  ismaire  it is your own fault you are too lovely my queen
carlyle 
the first time i met you twenty years ago now  i saw you in the garden of this very palace  and i was bewitched your pale beauty far surpassed that of any flower i was in the grips of an unforgivable desire you were the wife of my king to whom id sworn life and loyalty i told myself a grand lie that day i told myself i could be happy simply serving you as your most loyal knight
  
after years of duty years of service years of of silence  i became aware once more of the feelings id buried deep within myself how could i leave this world without expressing my true desires could anything be more desolate more devoid of meaning that is when i made my decision i would follow my heart and claim your hand as my own
carlyle  you forget yourself you ruin our country and kill our countrymen did you think i would be pleased did you think i would love you for this
i need no country i care nothing for my countrymen i can see nothing but you if you would only be mine 
carlyle 
to arms mercenaries were under attack you there ready your weapons
what no no no that was never part of the deal the only fight im here for is with the locks of the treasure chamber
hah  dont get so excited i doubt you mercenaries will see any action at all once we soldiersve finished
yeah great you go do that whew  with all these soldiers around i shouldnt have to lift a finger ill just sit here and wait for them to win they day then i collect my pay no more being ordered around by that selfish princess and her moronic bodyguard this is the life lady luck loves me but something doesnt feel right 
hey carlyle impressive work youve done here my compliments
 i gave you everything i promised i opened the hall to your forces
yes the palace is mine my palace  oh how i do like the sound of that
do whatever you want with the royal treasury the only treasure i wish to leave here with is the queen of my heart
oh yeah about your queen theres been a change of plans
ah
dont move carlyle you twitch and the queen dies
blackheart what is the meaning of this
calm down youll get her back as soon as im done with her jehannas sacred stone is around here somewhere ive got to find it and destroy it i need this woman to guide me to its hiding place
do not lay a hand on my queen
dont get so incensed im not going to harm her im not like that freak valter im kind to women but if you make a wrong move youll lose your prize understood
yes 
there are some annoying pests outside who think to win back the hall i want you to take care of them lose and the queen will never be yours
   if my queen comes to any harm in your care 
yes of course i know all about the might of your sword arm as long as the sacred stone is destroyed youll get all you ask for
  
greetings prince lets get going
caellach  you will put an end to this destroying the sacred stones is  ugh ack

and another sacred stone has been destroyed grado frelia and now jehanna  only two stones remain
uuh ahh 
ah  what should i do c caellach  you must help her
leave her let her last breath be a harsh and ragged rasp shes not long for this world why if you really wanted to help her youd deliver the final blow yourself
n no i couldnt
 what a joke i have a little work to wrap up in the hall before we leave you should hit the road pretty soon too prince
  
i wonder where queen ismaire is
i heard she was in the throne room but theres no sight of her and theres no sacred stone either
we must search quickly
ah 
lyon
eirika 
wait lyon dont run away my brother and i have been so worried about you  we know more then anyone the gentleness of your spirit your father is deranged isnt he thats why grado invaded renais right tell me lyon  please  tell me what has happened
im sorry eirika ive wanted to see you and ephraim for so long now  i wanted to see you so that i could apologize the invasion of renais  i couldnt stop it im sorry but i still cannot talk to you not yet 
you  you have a reason dont you
mm  i cant talk about it now but  i promise i will tell you everything someday
i see  i believe you lyon i must tell you im a little relieved i was afraid youd changed as much as your poor father has im so glad
me too eirika  no you have changed youre even more beautiful than you were before
l lyon 
im sorry i have to go but please remember this this war started because i was too weak to stop it but  ill always be your friend
lyon 
eirika what are you doing it seems queen ismaire has been found this way
y yes coming
queen ismaire  is she 
were too late her injuries are  she will not last much longer
 jo joshua   joshua 
queen ismaire
oh joshua  where is that boy 
queen ismaire 
please forgive me joshua  i was a foolish mother  i was so intent on being queen that i spared no time to be your mother but i loved you nonetheless  please understand 
  i know mother
joshua 
joshua  it really is you  joshua my son 
im sorry mother i should never have left you ive no excuse  i wanted to see the world as a man not as a prince i wanted to be worthy i planned on returning to your side afterward  i was so foolish if id been here i could have 
no its fine youre here now  listen to me joshua the stone of jehanna has  been destroyed the one who tempted carlyle is responsible 
what who was it
 carried a dark stone  it is the origin of all this  it should not exist  joshua you must  our country our people 
i understand mother
thank you joshua  i have something  something i must give you 
this is 
its one of the sacred twin relics unique to house jehanna  he who would rule our land must possess it  ive watched over it since your father passed away i kept it safe and waited for this day to come 
mother  i have it now i understand its meaning 
joshua  my dear sweet child 
mother 
its been more than ten years id grown tied of the formality of palace life so i just left i wrote a farewell and left the palace taking nothing with me i felt i could never understand the people while i stayed sequestered in a castle i abandoned my identity and roamed the continent working where i could i wanted only to be worthy of becoming king i knew one day i would return gods i was so foolish i was such a child i see it now was i simply rebelling against my mother punishing her for tending to her duties
  
i was a fool yes but i learned much over these ten years i have learned about the hearts of our people how they need to be governed i have learned how our country needs to change and to grow i have learned much but ive lost much more mother 
prince joshua 
i made a promise i want to continue what she began i will help defeat grado i will defend jehanna and her allies  i know it doesnt sound like me but 
on behalf of frelia i came to jehanna with a letter to the throne i give it to you prince joshua of jehanna  let us fight together
renais frelia rausten and jehanna four nations united
yes i suppose thats true and my brother is with us as well and if it were possible  lyon  i wish you could be here with us too
fire fires have broken out all through the hall
what
the curtains were soaked in oil with torches set about the hall its a trap someone did this during all the fighting you must flee quickly before the flames engulf us all
princess eirika we must evacuate 
i know joshua we must go now
no  mother  forgive me 
is everyone well did anyone get left behind
we all made it its so smoky that its hard to tell but were here what a cowardly act setting fire to the palace hall but weve escaped without injury the enemys trap has failed
 no it hasnt assemble the troops now the enemy is coming
what did you say
this is the reason for the fire to drive us from the palace theyll be attacking soon no other plan makes sense
how is it that you know that
princess eirika ive just received word that grado reinforcements are headed this way there are two armies led by generals valter and caellach
no
two armies  theyre willing to send so many here and leave the capital defenseless
why does everyone seem so distraught it matters not who stands in our path we shall smite them all with the power of righteousness
princess eirika  its going to be very difficult for us to continue one of grados generals alone is more than a match for us compound that with the exhaustion of our troops and im not sure we can 
bah  with jehanna hall in flames weve no place to hole up and dig in for a siege we have to retreat we have to win ourselves time for form a plan grado sent two generals  what could be happening in their capital and what of ephraim is he still alive
 brother 
/***EOF***/
what a pleasant surprise its master valter
whats the situation tirado you have captured ephraim havent you
no prince ephraim still fights in the lands north of renvall
and why is that what has happened to all those mercenaries you hired
theyve proven to be less then adequate ephraims clever his band strikes quickly and then vanishes into the woods we more than double his numbers and yet he uses the terrain wisely to fight us he has no army just a small force of knights loyal to renais prince ephraims reputation as a superb strategist would seem to be well earned
hmm  how interesting the lads beginning to whet my appetite tirado bring him to me as quickly as you can will you
as you command just grant me an army and ill bring him down swiftly
what sort of plan do you have
master i am your loyal adjutant and you are my general for you my lord i have many plans ready and waiting
really well then let me hear them
very well first you and i will leave this fort and head north then we will find prince ephraim in his leafy playpen
but hes not easily found is he
do not worry at prince ephraims side is  a friend shall we say when the time is right our friend will move on our behalf 
forde how are we on supplies and equipment
its not looking good our weapons are in bad shape and were running low on food we can probably restock at a nearby village but 
no thats not an option were in enemy territory i will not involve innocents if i can avoid it
yeah i knew youd say that i mean its because of stuff like that that weve stuck with you so far but eventually we do need to face reality what are we going to do
word of mouth has it that the invasion of renais has progressed quite far ive heard that the capital has fallen
hm so soon  still my father is in the capital and he wont surrender easily forde kyle our mission here is to harry the troops to distract their eye hopefully well be able to give my father and eirika time to escape kyle have you heard anything from orson i sent him ahead to scout
no word yet and its about time he returned 
reporting in prince ephraim i can confirm grado presence at several points around our camp also a large battalion of soldiers has been dispatched from renvall we shouldnt tarry here any longer than necessary 
i see
seems as though weve certainly caught grados eye this time should we retreat back to the capital prince ephraim
no we press onward were going to capture renvall
wh what
so this is renvall is it all right lets go
um are you sure youre quite sane prince ephraim weve an entire army after us and you want to charge their stronghold
forde watch your tongue this is our prince youre addressing
kyle please its all right weve heard nothing from home so what harm could a little reckless besieging cause
prince ephraim 
dont worry i havent lost all sense of self preservation renvall holds an important place in grados national defense if we can get the upper hand and take control of it then grado will waste many valuable soldiers trying to take it back i hope our attack proves useful to my father and eirika
i understand what youre saying but  can we do it with our current strength
every soldier in this area is trying to find us the enemy has us vastly outnumbered attacking the castle is a ridiculous idea if the enemy thinks the same  then we may have our opening
you have a point im sure renvall wont expect us to attack with these numbers either way we cant run forever and were running out of supplies whatve we got to lose shall we get ready to go
yes if we dont move quickly we may never get another chance trust me i dont pick fights i cannot win
yes sir
an attack by ephraims troops to arms prince ephraims circled around and brought the fight to us if we capture the prince here we can line our pockets with gold do you understand well be rich
orson
yes 
your wounds still havent healed from that last battle have they dont push yourself if were defeated you must return to frelia understood
understood 
lets go kyle forde
do you truly think you can take us with those numbers imbecile youll learn the error of your ways
l lord tirado it cant be  were we merely pawns
weve secured the entire castle you were brilliant prince ephraim what a plan what a battle
i estimate at least half of the enemy troops are in the field we took the castle but we dont have the manpower to hold it in a siege theres no point in lingering here lets continue on to grado keep
prince ephraim things have taken a turn for the worse i took a look around the castle perimeter  were surrounded
what
grados sent reinforcements so quickly 
what should we do
   we must escape
so youve captured renvall have you and with such a small force impressive youve earned your reputation i must say i quite admire your work i take it youre the leader of this pack the misguided prince ephraim
i am
im general valter the moonstone of grados imperial army catching up to you has caused me no small amount of trouble weve reduced your wretched home of renais to ruin and yet  you and your little band of bravos continue to be a thorn in our side but that all ends here
well see you claim youve taken the capital of renais  tell me how did you know i would attack renvall
ha ha  patience youll have your answer soon enough now be good lads and drop your weapons will you
prince ephraim let us attack
  
listen to me ephraim youre a smart man you know its futile to fight me you cannot win you cannot escape accept the reality of your situation and surrender to me
surrender
heh heh heh  thats right if you do ill let you live i hold your life in the palm of my hand do not test my good humor now come over here bend your knee and beg for your life show me how renais dogs grovel
i think not
what
you said your name was valter didnt you well im sorry valter but i dont have time to waste playing games with you so were going to knock you louts about a bit and then make our way out of here
fool  have you gone mad do you truly believe you can fight your way past my wyvern knights
watch and see i dont pick fights i cant win kyle forde are you ready
my life has been yours since the moment i took my chivalric vows
its moments like these that keep me by your side my prince
what idiotic wretches you are  prepare yourselves to be destroyed utterly
we break to the east go

in an age long past  evil flooded over the land creatures awash in the dark tide ran wild pushing mankind to the brink of annihilation in its despair mankind appealed to the heavens and from a blinding light came hope
these five glorious treasures held the power to dispel evil the hero grado and his warriors used the sacred stones to combat evils darkness they defeated the demon king and sealed his soul away within the stones with the darkness imprisoned peace returned to magvel but this peace would not last 
the continent of magvel for some 800 years a quiet peace reigned in the absence of the terrible darkness the sacred stones have been passed from generation to generation nations have been built around their power and their legacy the kingdom of renais ruled by fado the peerless warrior king the kingdom of frelia ruled by hayden the venerable sage king the kingdom of jehanna ruled by ismaire queen of the white dunes the theocracy of rausten ruled by mansel the divine emperor the grado empire ruled by vigarde the stalwart silent emperor
these five countries house the power of the sacred stones they are joined by the emerging mercantile republic of carcino in these times of peace tales of past conflict have drifted into legend and memories of the ancient dark arts have all but evaporated
it is now the year 803  in an instant the whole of magvel is threatened by an unexpected atrocity the grado empire the largest of the sacred stone nations has invaded the kingdom of renais under orders from emperor vigarde
a longtime ally of grado renais is caught off guard unable to mount any resistance grados forces move quickly seizing one territory after another compounding king fados worries his son prince ephraim has gone missing grados momentum carries its armies to the gates of castle renais itself renais will fall  it is inevitable
your majesty i bear bad news the castle gate has been breached emperor vigardes forces are within the castle walls

eirika chooses to travel by sea to the theocracy of rausten her search for a ship leads her to port kiris in carcino carcino is a young nation ruled by a council of merchants and it is an ally of frelia carcino council leader klimt a staunch opponent of grados imperialistic actions has pledged carcinos support to frelia in this conflict prince innes also intends to pass through carcino on his way to jehanna eirika believes there is nothing to fear in carcino but she is wrong
frelias sacred stone has been destroyed and yet you cannot locate the stone of renais glen valter find the children of renais find them and take from them the bracelets that they wear glen take eirika valter take ephraim find them conquer them
yes your majesty 
ha ha  eirika eh shes a ripe little peach and her brother ephraim  hes better prey than id imagined i can feel my blood rushing at the thought this might be fun after all
caellach riev shatter the remaining sacred stones caellach take jehanna riev take rausten go crush the sacred stones they house
heh heh heh  as you will ill begin making arrangements for raustens downfall immediately 
bah why am i stuck with jehanna accursed ill luck i became a mercenary to escape that wretched place and now i must go back
duessel go to frelia take the frelian army and punish ephraim
selena remain in the capital soon i will have new orders for you

eirika wait
tana what are you doing you were supposed to remain in the palace you left so abruptly without any warning or farewell you and ephraim have only just arrived and already you leave on another quest well im your friend eirika and i wont let you go into danger without me
does king hayden know of this
no hed just say i forbid you to go on this foolish errand like always but im so worried about you
thank you tana i appreciate your concern but king hayden would 
you and ephraim my father and my brother  youre all fighting together fighting for a noble cause i cannot be left out i will not be left out please eirika
 oh  all right i never could refuse you anything come on lets go tana
thank you eirika
your highness weve reached port kiris if we can find passage across the north sea we will reach rausten in 10 days
it smells of the tides  this is a busy place isnt it
its a trade center peoples of all nations pass through here do not become so enthralled with the sights and sounds that you forget your mission
i wont im a mercenary by the name of erina im traveling to rausten to receive a commission
let us look for a ship then erina the docks are this way
hm
is something amiss
seth that woman over there is that 
oh these dainty sugar pastries theyre delightfully scrumptious flavorful without being overwhelming refined without being banal 
gwah ha ha right you are lady larachel
you look familiar 
oh arent you 
weve met before havent we you arrived with your companions when we encountered those creatures  your name is larachel is it not
a wonder and pleasure that we should meet again so soon it is providence
bad luck is the only thing the divine has ever provided you
oh and if you have not yet tried one these pastries are also divine would you care for one
uh thank you  no wait  thats not why  were actually on our way to the theocracy of rausten were rather in a rush and need to find passage on a ship 
oh dear im afraid youll find none to assist you no ships are leaving port
pardon
you see i find myself heading home once more to my beloved rausten as well and actually im quite well known with the powers that be here in port kiris so i ordered them to ready the finest passenger vessel for me but both merchants and passenger ships alike are too frightened to set sail it seems a giant ghost ship has been sinking every ship it finds  would that i could confront it i could stop its foul villainy in a moment alas its such a shame
yes yes  uh  that is troublesome still i must get to rausten somehow
you neednt worry too much after all if the sea is closed to you simply follow the overland route
the overland route ive heard thats a terribly roundabout path to travel
oh it is but dont you see the hardships of the road they are truly blessings they will toughen you and strengthen your resolve when you need to face great evil for example i have been tasked with a great trial in order to better me i understand my path o unknowable forces of providence i your faithful servant larachel shall overcome with faith and divine strength
now listen larachel you might be thrilled about going the long way but 
come now were leaving dozla rennac dont fall behind
gwah ha ha wait for us lady larachel come on rennac we run til we drop the first one to collapse from exhaustion is the winner
help  why is this happening to me
 uh seth isnt rausten in the other direction arent they heading toward frelia
 its nothing you need concern yourself with milady our only concern now is to decide our next course of action an overland journey would be very long however it seems that may be our only choice at the moment 
i agree whatever shall we do 
 youre eirika the princess of renais aint ya
what
dastard away with you
no need to get personal you know theres a pretty price on your pretty head sorry but i need that gold
wh what do you want gimme a break  leave us out of this stupid war of yours we dont want anything to do with it or  are you just another victim like the rest of us here well regardless  here take this and go do something about all this fighting will you
my oh my  its about time they left im finally done getting ordered about without getting paid huh oh dont mind me just talking to myself here i want you to hold on to this for me dont tell anyone oh and dont say a word about seeing me to lady larachel all right deal
attention carcinos mercenaries will arrest the princess of renais shortly our duty here is nearly ended and i expect no further hostilities if you must fight however remember that the whole empire fights with you
um commander what should i do
who are you
sir im amelia of silva sir im new i was only assigned to your command today i wanted to fight for the empire
i dont need your life story fool recruits are in front grab a lance and move
sir yes sir this lance  stab the enemy im not afraid  im a citizen of grado its my duty to fight and ill fight my best
oh who are you
what what
are you one of the locals this is a dangerous spot you should hide here come with me
but  but im 
im franz a knight of renais whats your name what are you doing here
i im amelia im  actually im a grado soldier im supposed to be fighting you
really so uh youre my enemy
 i guess  are you  are you going to make me your prisoner
no no i wouldnt do that but this is a problem
what should we do
first of all you must listen to me and do as i say well talk to princess eirika later
what no my commander told me eirikas a cruel and merciless fiend who 
oh thats utter nonsense ive never heard the princess utter an unkind word to anyone i understand why youre frightened you think were the enemy but if youd only trust me  will you come with me
mm  well all right ill trust you franz
who are you
what what
are you from around here you should find someplace to hide these men are after me its not safe
but  but im 
yes
im a grado soldier im here to stop the princess of renais 
huh youre with grado
and youre princess eirika but the commander said eirikas a cruel and merciless fiend 
what no im   i dont know what grados officers have been telling you but  our two countries are at war so i suppose they can say what they want
 mistress eirika  i uh i surrender i wont fight you
huh
i became a soldier because i admired general duessels sense of honor but the generals have been very opposed to this war from the beginning  and now i see you and you look so sad about all of this i dont know whats right anymore im just a soldier but i want to decide for myself i want to understand the truth myself to see it with my own eyes
 i see so does this mean youre coming with us i suppose i should ask your name then
amelia amelia of silva
blast this aint right these guys are too tough  5000 gold aint nearly enough for this
th that stinkin pablo  he lied to me 
your highness are you well
yes i believe so  who are these men they dont appear to be grado imperial troops
judging by their crude swordplay id say theyre mercenaries we can expect more of them in the area too i think wait here
w wait i give up i dont want to fight anymore we were just doing a job
who hired you
i may be nothing but a hired blade but i have my honor i wont say a word
i admire your professionalism i guess we have no use for you
no wait ill talk carcino it was pablo of the carcino council of elders
councilman pablo
that doesnt make sense carcino and frelia are allies why would they target me
i dont know  could be theyve decided grados going to win they want to be on the winning side some of the others opposed pablo but i heard he had em all silenced but quick thats all i know i swear it
i believe you go
we were careless we should have seen this coming carcinos a young and ambitious nation ruled by power hungry merchants and grado grows more powerful with every passing day so its no surprise carcinos merchant lords would throw in with grado now
wait prince innes  prince innes was to pass through carcino on his way to jehanna  if carcino has betrayed us then he ran headlong into enemy territory 
princess eirika i bring dire tidings
i know you  you were a messenger riding with prince innes
yes and i have news of him prince innes is in danger carcinos merchant army struck and cut through half our men the prince is trapped in a siege he has no means of escape and 
no more i understand return to frelia and deliver your message
what of prince innes
leave him to us the princes troubles should burden you no more we will see him to safety
 hey you have lady larachel and her man sir stubble chin gone yet

whew  im finally free no more getting bossed around by that witless ninny thanks i owe you one take this now that im free again i think im just gonna wander about for a while
 what a strange relationship they have
lady eirika i think we ought to be leaving soon
yes we must hurry to prince inness side
/***EOF***/
a former lance instructor to ephraim grados general duessel often came to renais as an emissary of his empire despite their stations the two men share similar dispositions and a warm relationship why has grado started this war what is the miasma of evil emanating from the country ephraim believes that duessel can answer these questions it is this belief that propels ephraim forward into grado territory
please wait prince ephraim i have a message from frelia theres been an uprising in carcino pablo is leading a force of renegade grado supporters in rebellion
in carcino  any word of eirika is my sister safe”
the last word we received had princess eirika heading to assist prince innes weve not heard from her since”
 blast i sent eirika to rausten thinking it would be the safest mission if i could id pull out of here now and go look for her but ”
prince ephraim
 i know i know i mustnt let my emotions dictate my actions if carcino has allied itself with grado then defeating grado is out best bet we proceed as planned tell them that
understood
be careful eirika
 what was that an earthquake i think its passed
prince ephraim”
im fine theres nothing to worry about i was surprised thats all youre not shaken in the slightest are you
actually it surprised me as well ive heard that tremors such as those were commonplace in grado apparently they are usually weak and cause little if any damage
now that you mention it i remember a while back when i was first in grado eirika and i were startled by a tremor just like that one lyon said he had grown used to them and he just laughed
  
we dont have any time to tend to injuries just now we must press forward we must see to the capital
i do not understand  why this course of action what is the emperor thinking 
general duessel
 is that you selena are you to be assisting me in this duty
yes  frelias army will be coming soon from the north were just waiting for the order to engage them
hm  prince ephraim leads the enemy forces doesnt he
that is correct prince ephraim of renais
bah 
renais is our enemy general please give the order to attack
no order all units to hold do not initiate the attack i want to speak with ephraim first
   so its true you plan to betray the empire and ally yourself with the enemy
what
general duessel you stand accused of treason of the highest order lay down your weapons and follow my commands if you fail to do so if you resist in any way i will execute you on the spot
this is nonsense who is behind this madness
these are his majestys orders the emperor has anticipated your treachery prepare yourself
impossible  his majesty
cormag you and i will bring that traitor down go around that fort to the southeast and drive into them from the sea
were fighting general duessel but hes one of the cornerstones of the empire how could  hes been like a father to you and to my brother do you truly mean to kill him
   if that is what my emperor commands then yes without hesitation cormag if you are a true knight of grado you will do the same
  
prince ephraim the imperial grado army is before us
i know but somethings odd theyre chasing someone down is that a deserter wait thats  duessel
prince ephraim your orders
we rescue duessel ride
whats this theyve only just begun what a disappointment i so wanted to witness the comedy of two generals hacking away at each other
valter  what do you want
ah selena youre to return to the capital immediately duessel is no longer your concern his majesty has declared you untrustworthy ive been sent here to relieve you of command
what
youve proven yourself incapable of dealing with a single old man  i tell you having to clean up your mess makes things difficult for me selena now then beran
yes sir
im leaving i cant leave poor eirika sad and lonely in carcino youre in command here for the duration of this conflict
ill take care of things
what do you think youre doing i am here at his majestys bidding and 
did you not hear me his majestys bidding has changed you selena are not to be trusted these are his majestys words you share the same sentiments as duessel you could turn traitor just as he has you should feel honored he could have ordered me to kill you where you stand
th thats absurd his majesty he  he knows i am trustworthy
then return to the capital and sort it out go and ask your beloved master whether i speak the truth
i 
what are you going to do selena
i will return to the capital i know better than to trust your word i will speak with the emperor myself
heh heh  stupid woman if grado wins too easily therell be no more bloodshed we must do what we can to extend the fun  i believe its time for me to return to my darling eirika it wouldnt do for glen to arrive before me would it take care of things here before i return to you understood
of course
tell me brother what should i do
do you know what im going to be when i get older im going to be a splendid knight just like general selena they call general selena the fluorspar you know shes really beautiful and really really strong
a strange man passed through here sometime back he said something about looking for a girl with indigo hair  i asked if she was his girl but he said she wasnt i hope hes found her by now
this area of the ocean is often blanketed in a thick fog i toiled under it myself for many hard years when i was still sailing we always made sure we had torches and the like ready  oh yes  and theres this this torch staff shines just as bright as any normal torch of course if nobody you know can use it its just so much extra baggage will you take it oh go ahead im planning on resting my old bones here for good my sailing days are done
 no good
what
   this
huh
i found it i cant use it yet good bye
uh 
commander cormag
i know what i must do im a sworn knight of grado and i have a duty to fulfill lets start by putting an end to that frelian army move out
duessel
is that you prince ephraim
why were those grado men after you whats going on wait we can talk later lets get you to safety first come with us duessel
  
duessel
i am general duessel the obsidian of the imperial three  this name and my service to his majesty have been my lifes blood as of this moment it is all gone ive no reason to continue 
duessel  enough of this rubbish you are my mentor i will not let you die
 prince ephraim
i know about the emperors madness how will your death serve grado who will it help what of your country its people its future
  
you will live duessel as a traitor  in disgrace  i know that for a man such as you this is more agonizing than death but you will live nonetheless you will live for something more important
   i understand this old fools life is yours
wait please stop fighting im sure we can reach an agreement if we just talk
you are 
my name is tana youre from grado arent you why are you fighting against general duessel
thats none of your 
do you hate him
 do i hate him this isnt some petty schoolyard squabble girl im a soldier of the empire and i have my orders ive been sent to punish a traitor and thats what i aim to do
are you telling me that general duessels a traitor dont you know him do you think thats really true
what i think isnt at question faith does not dictate my actions i have my orders
ephraim trusts your general duessel hes given him the benefit of the doubt have you chosen not to believe the reasons for his actions
get out of my way ill waste no more time with this duel of words
wait please  protect general duessel it would be tragic if he died before his motives became clear
  move please if you wont get out of the way ill have to move you by force
very well if you must but in exchange im asking you to believe general duessel
    youre an odd bird to think id lose a fight not to a mans sword but to a womans words 
what
you will i will protect general duessel but i plan on sorting this whole mess out with the general himself
do you mean that
i dont know if this is the right thing to do or not but i think this is what my brother would have done
is that you cormag
sir duessel  you have abandoned your country and your lord i must take your life
i know im ready now i have no duty anymore but you cormag youre a soldier of the empire follow your orders and fulfill your mission im ready
  
cormag
to be honesty im confused must you truly die is your crime really deserving of death i know my brother could have settled this but  ive come here to stop you and yet i find that i cannot
  
you see i couldnt believe you would ever truly turn traitor and now i stand here looking at you duessel of the imperial three and you do not have the eyes of a traitor
  
no i cannot turn my lance on you the empires faithful son general duessel  until this matter is sorted you travel under my protection
cormag  forgive me 
prince ephraim of renais  the obsidian duessel  two incredible trophies who could ask for more
grrr  theyre held on for too long if this continues general valter will have me   prepare a ship we must flee quickly
b but general valter  hell be so angry 
were doomed either way general valter will never forgive our failure here  and if we stay well be devoured like those other fools  our best bet is to give up and escape with our lives
commander beran wait
prince ephraim the remaining enemy troops have fled
i see and what of duessel is he unharmed
yes this way
prince ephraim  youve grown to be quite the impressive commander i remember what a stubborn young lad you were when i taught you
any skill i have i owe to you duessel im curious why are you being pursued by your own troops
  
speak to me duessel i want to put an end to this war im sure you feel the same way
    as you know the emperor was once a man of compassion he loathed war and he worked to build peace across all nations then one day that all changed
   but why why did he change what happened
i wish i knew but if youre looking for a likely cause i have one this all seems to have begun when prince lyon and the mages created a strange gemstone they referred to as the dark stone
the dark stone
thats what the clerics and the prince called it at any rate now im just a soldier i dont know anything about these magic things but they said the dark stone is more powerful even than the sacred stones
and the sacred stones had the power to defeat the demon king if the dark stone is stronger than they are 
 ephraim
what is it myrrh
the wave of evil i felt surging from the capital  it hungers  it consumes it envelops and transforms this power can tarnish the purest of souls with its corruption
are you saying this dark stone is responsible for the change in vigarde the timing fits doesnt it the stone is created and then  duessel where is the dark stone now
its in the capital with prince lyon hes been carrying it with him ever since the day it was created
understood duessel im going to the capital i must talk to lyon maybe we can restore the emperor together
 im going with you
but well be fighting grados army your own men
i appreciate your concern but ive already been branded a traitor prince ephraim if you mean to save my lord the emperor  if you hope to restore him to his former self  then i will pledge my loyalty to you until your cause is won
general duessel
men i owe each of you an apology youve served me well and i have betrayed you
you speak nonsense general we are your men no matter what happens if you must leave grado to fight with frelias men then our place is at your side your road is our road
my brave men  sniff  bah im getting old im a sentimental old fool
we ask to be allowed to join the frelian army prince ephraim has many soldiers he doesnt need us with him please send us older soldiers off to fight with frelia and may the gods of war smile upon you general duessel
prince ephraim we must now take to the seas the frelian army is readying a ship for us now we have some time to rest until its ready to set sail
right well take a break then tell the men the road ahead is bound or be a rough one
well hello there tell me are you all waiting to board a ship
er yes we are 
i recommend that you abandon your plans my friends the locals are too frightened to set sail upon these seas
is there a storm coming in
no no storm demons some sort of phantom ship commands these seas now
a phantom ship
yes but you neednt worry for long my friends i plan on purging the seas of that pesky ghost ship
oh no  here we go again
gwah ha ha well said princess larachel
i larachel am destined to become the protector of the seas fare thee well strangers come dozla we must find a ship
gwah ha ha sounds fun come on rennac
honestly larachel do you even think before you set these plans oh please  someone end my misery
 what was all that about
prince ephraim our ship has arrived let us prepare to board  something troubling you
no  its nothing all right here we go
/***EOF***/
rumors say that ephraim has been defeated and taken prisoner now eirika must find a way to rescue her brother from beneath enemy eyes eirikas company rushes towards castle renvall where ephraim is being held surrounded by lakes renvall is a natural fortress all but unassailable a lone bridge held by the enemy is its only entrance eirika has only one choice eirika decides to confront grados soldiers head on 
my brother is somewhere inside that castle 
renvall is surrounded by lakes the only entrance is the bridge to the main gate and its well guarded castle renvall is a natural stronghold easy to defend and difficult to assault we must plan our attack carefully
i agree 
princess eirika please allow me to fight beside you my elder brother forde is in there with prince ephraim sir kyle sir orson  let me help you set them free
there is nothing to discuss we will fight
the hour of your reunion is not far off now
i am yours to command your highness
were with you all the way right dad
dont work yourself into a lather ross in the heat of battle a good warrior remains calm where lesser men do not
you need anything stolen im your man ‘course my blades no joke either
im sure i can help you if youll let me  ill keep you safe
you cant possibly consider fighting without my genius at your side
i have yet to repay you for helping me fight those abominations please let me stand by your side a while longer
this has trouble written all over it bet you its all a trap  ah well  my lucks gotta turn around sometime right
may the sacred light surround us and protect us all
well princess let us prepare for battle
 brother im on my way lets go
were under attack rouse yourselves general valters adjutant lord tirado has charged us with defending the castle show them the might of murrays brigade dont let anyone near the castle
tirados the new master of castle renvall hes supposed to be an adjutant to general valter of grado who knows though  rumors say hes been plotting behind valters back you should watch where you step
prince ephraim well gracious me  i havent heard anything about him but now that you mention it there was a big commotion a few days back i guess the soldiers were chasing somebody but  well i was so tired i fell asleep and missed the whole thing
our ballistae have failed how could this be grrr  i guess its up to me
lord tirado 
my brother is somewhere in this castle  seth we must go inside
hold lady eirika look in the shadows a figure 
ah an enemy soldier
princess eirika and  is that you seth
sir orson  why are you here you should be with prince ephraim
are you all right orson if youre here my brother must be here as well right
yes  prince ephraim and i were broth captured by grado forces and held here as prisoners i just managed to escape my cell  a chance to escape  its what i had prayed for 
orson  are you well your face is so pale grados men dont tell me theyve 
no  its nothing but lord ephraim  i cannot say whether hes still unharmed
what where is he where is my brother
if he lives still he will be in one of the deeper cells where i was held head down this corridor to the dungeons quickly before reinforcements arrive
thank you 
  
/***EOF***/
when tomorrow comes  you have to go home dont you 
yes  thank you for everything lyon ill never forget the time i spent here
do you think well see each other again 
yes of course my brother and you and me we are friends after all arent we 
eirika  yep youre right i hope your study of the sacred stones is fruitful i know youll use the wisdom you glean to make your people happy
thank you eirika you know youre the only reason i was able to save that girl there were times when i wanted to give up to admit failure but you were always there you were always encouraging me to succeed thats what kept me going i just thought of you
lyon 
eirika  i ive always  im sorry  forget what i was saying i could never be like ephraim 
lyon what do you 
i guess this is it eirika hope to see you again someday im going to focus on my work and do my best until that day my research will progress and my discoveries will benefit us all one day i will be a prince worthy of you and i will see you again
dont make that face well see each other again all three of us  you me and eirika
yeah  i know but when we get older when we each take the reigns of our nations we probably wont meet again  not like this i mean not as friends
whats that got to do with anything kings are humans too emperors need not be friendless you know
i suppose youre right you have a knack for cutting to the heart of things but becoming a king or an emperor is not something you can take lightly i really dont think well be the same people we are right now  what if renais or grado went to war what if we were forced to fight
dont be ridiculous that would never happen
if  if it did  wed still be friends wouldnt we
even if that happens yes were friends forever nothing can change that youll see
hm  all right ephraim then i will see you again
lyon
  eirika 
lyon  it is you isnt it lyon 
yes  but im  im almost completely gone before im lost entirely i want to apologize im sorry eirika this is all my fault i was too weak 
youre not to blame lyon it was the demon king he was controlling you 
no thats not true eirika when the demon king reached into me from inside the dark stone when he whispered he would see all my dreams and desires made true i i did not reject him in the shadows of my heart he saw jealousy vanity it was my weakness that put these emotions there allowed them to thrive
everyone has weaknesses lyon youre not the only one i do im sure my brother does dont hate yourself for having these feelings please
thank you eirika you were always so kind the demon king will claim my flesh as a vessel for his resurrection before that can happen i want you to kill me im sorry eirika im already 
 
oh please are you done turning your failings into some sad epic of personal tragedy  its time we started then i have a ritual to complete and some nuisances to kill
shut your mouth i wont allow you to desecrate lyons body any further you will not return to this world i will stop you myself if i must
ah is that so  and do you honestly think yourself capable wench  you once prayed for this fools salvation can you bring yourself to kill him 
i can and i will i made a promise to lyon and i intend to honor it
lyon
you came after all ephraim im glad
lyon is this  is this my fault am i responsible for how much youve changed i havent seen you for two years now  have youhated me that entire time
no ephraim i was never dishonest i liked you both i still do but i was envious of you too thats why i desired this you may not believe me when i tell you this but  even now after all this i still consider you a friend
lyon  you know that i do too i spoke the truth to you  i truly thought that we would always be friends thats why i  i have to stop you
of course i know  you are ephraim after all you could do no less my friend well come then ephraim try and stop me i will defeat you and then i will save the people of grado no one  no one will stand in my way
come and face your death im waiting you miserable fool your corpse will make a perfect offering in my resurrection
i am the demon king  i know nothing of human frailty i am supreme 
where  where did i go wrong 
i guess that proves it youre too strong ephraim  ive always  admired 
lyon
you know ephraim  i always wanted to be you i wanted to be strong and handsome  with eirika always at my side  thats what i wanted to be i had  i had nothing 
dont be ridiculous lyon who was it that taught me history who covered for me when i stumbled didnt you see how i looked up to you i admired your compassion your wisdom your thoughtfulness 
oh yeah  that seems so long ago  i did keep you out of trouble didnt i thanks for remembering see youre thoughtful too 
lyon  wait dont close your eyes im going to save you ill find a way i 
no dont  thanks anyway it was all my fault  dont look so sad cmon ephraim smile like you used to 
 lyon 
what this 
brother lyons body its 
 the time has come   my resurrection is at hand 
heh heh heh heh heh  well done lyon the sacrifice of your flesh and the sum of your efforts  they were all for naught grados disaster cannot be averted my resurrection is at hand all this time you imagined yourself in possession of your own free will but it was i who planted the seed from which your ambitions grew my deceit made you my puppet and oh how you danced at the end of my strings you could never have been saved its a shame isnt it lyon and now i  i am reborn
demon king you are responsible for all the misery weve seen lyon  my friend  youre the one 
brother  this power  its different
i know this power is greater than anything weve ever faced  but none of that matters ive learned so much  my lance is stronger than ever that thing the deceived and murdered my friend  no matter what happens im going to destroy it
larachel its time to use it prepare the last sacred stone we have to use its power on that beast like in the legends
you must listen to me ephraim the stories are true the stone does hold the power to stop the demon king however the source of its power is human will the desire for peace within our hearts
in our hearts 
yes thats right we need not pray for the sacred stone to aid us now no we need only focus ourselves and concentrate on a better future
i understand everyone listen to me this is the final battle if we can defeat this thing its over we face the king of demons the monster that once ruled all magvel hes more powerful than any one of us here but we have something that beast will never have we have community friendship love  we have all the virtues of humanity that is our weapon that is our strength
 
lyon

there
we did it the demon kings soul has been bound once more but eirika its not over yet the demon kings soul rages against its prison we must return it to its proper place and quickly but first we must defeat the demon kings soulless body
that thing 
uh huh the real battles just beginning our ancestors paid dearly for their victory a mountain of corpses its written the demon king was surrounded by the dead before he finally fell
were all prepared to do what must be done
i have no desire to make any more heartbreaking sacrifices i promised we would all return safely and return safely we shall
did we do it
yes we did it the demon kings soul has been bound once more but ephraim its not over yet the demon kings soul rages against its prison we must return it to its proper place and quickly but first we must defeat the demon kings soulless body
that thing
uh huh  the real battles just beginning our ancestors paid dearly for their victory a mountain of corpses  its written the demon king was surrounded by the dead before he finally fell
we are all prepared to do what must be done
no  ill do it i have no intention of seeing anyone else die
thats it its over isnt it 
yes evil has been imprisoned locked away the legends of old have been mirrored in our actions today
no weve done far more than the legends ever told weve destroyed the demon kings body he can never come back
thats right and we have you all to thank for it
and another thing  in that ancient battle it took the might of the five heroes to do what we did we did not have their extraordinary power to draw upon
no we didnt we conquered darkness and restored peace to the land thanks to you it was because you never gave in you never stopped fighting none of you not once thank you 
this means weve accomplished our mission i must relay the good news to king hayden at once
yes im sure father will be most pleased brother this means peace will be restored doesnt it  shall i fly back to frelia and let him know 
theres no need to rush im sure he knows after all we were together and that ensured our victory
of course prince innes

exactly
well that took some doing but we finally finished the job
we certainly earned our pay  please tell me were going to enjoy it

well be beside you through it all
all right lets go home lets go back to the people who are waiting for us 
/***EOF***/
  
what is it eirika
i was thinking about lyon the last time we saw him was a year and a half ago 
youre right it was at grado keep  has it really been only a year and a half
ephraim lyon where are you two
were over here eirika youd better be quick ephraim says hes tired of waiting
oh please im sure you could wait a few moments longer 
youre late how does it take you so long to prepare for such a simple trip
rest easy ephraim theres no need to be so curt with your own sister after all a king must learn how to treat women with honor and discretion thats what father macgregor says
thank you lyon you unlike my dear brother are a true gentleman i was up far too late thinking about my prayer to the temple flame last night and im afraid i  i overslept 
your prayer what are you babbling about
come now you know that the flame has been burning since the time of darkness ended you must know the story that the flame will answer the prayers of any pilgrim
really i didnt know that
oh ephraim  father macgregor is going to scold you for neglecting your studies so
 dont even joke about that so tell us what have you decided to pray for eirika
i uh  its a secret
i shouldve known youre so boring
well how about you ephraim
me lets see  i guess ill pray to become a stronger fighter
thats just like you ephraim
just like you indeed brother
  i can never tell if youre complimenting me or mocking me
praising you of course right eirika
hee hee  yes thats right
and you lyon what will you pray for
what me hm  i suppose all i really want is for all our people to be happy
 thats very uh  thats very much like you
very much so lyon
 now im the one who cannot tell if hes being praised or 
youre being praised as always lyon
tell me why the sudden decision to visit the temple did my brother do something again
now listen you 
oh no its not what ephraims done its what he hasnt done hes learned nothing at all about the sacred stones and the temple flame so 
father macgregor became angry he said one destined to become king and rule over a nation  must know the history of his kingdom and must respect the sacred stonesever since i came to grado my life has been chastisement and castigation father macgregor does not think me to be altogether too kingly
and yet general duessel has nothing but praise for you ephraim he says youve brave and true that youve the making of a great king
a great king i honestly have no idea what that means eirika should succeed the throne i would be happy simply taking my lance and traveling the land as a mercenary
ephraim that is nothing but foolish irresponsible romanticism do you realize how much your words would fill fathers heart with grief
are we speaking of the same man our father will likely outlive us all for now im content just learning the lance from general duessel what about you lyon is there anything you want to do
me well i  i suppose i want to become like my father
you were born to be the emperor of grado lyon it suits you
no i dont think so im not  one thing i do know from watching my father is that being emperor is hard every day he answers the complaints of the people and he almost never sleeps  my father is always so very tired i hope one day that  i hope that i can help him
lyon  you are so honorable you should learn from him brother
 again with your criticism tell me eirika what say you to dressing like me and becoming king in my stead youre so skinny i doubt anyone would notice youre not really a man
ha ha ha 
ephraim
what do you suppose lyon is doing now when emperor vigarde ordered the invasion  how do you think lyon felt
hes always been so gentle but he worships his father hed never question him but the emperor  hes clearly not behaving rationally i just hope hes not so far gone that hed hurt his own flesh and blood
i just pray for the day when the three of us can be together once again
itll come ive no doubt 
eirika ephraim welcome the two of you returning together its like a dream come true you must know ive prayed every day for your safe return
im so happy to see you tana
im sorry tana i didnt want for you to worry
oh it doesnt matter now  all that really matters is that weve been brought together again my own brother will soon return from the field it will be nice to sit down and discuss things again
princess tana prince innes has returned from the front
welcome home dear brother im so happy to see you return safe and sound
you didnt expect less did you do you think grados slugs could touch me with my bow ill take down every grado soldier form here to the emperors palace
well met innes
 ephraim
its good to see you prince innes
 they say renais has fallen i believe i warned you before this happened because you provided grado the opportunity to strike
brother mind your tongue this is no occasion for such harsh words ephraim and eirika have lost their father to this terrible war 
   im sorry to hear of your fathers death hear me ephraim our most important task is to defeat grado and end this war
oh innes  im sorry eirika ephraim
its all right its comforting to see that in all of this at least he hasnt changed innes has hated me for as long as i can remember
my brother looks upon you as a rival ephraim and as you know he wants to be the best at everything the best king the best general the best fighter the best man  he wont allow himself to be beaten at anything
tana you talk too much
 my father would like both of you to sit with him in a war council will you come with me to take part in your official audience
yes of course theres much that i have to tell him
it will be out honor to attend
this way
it does my heart good to see you all here safely within our castle walls  would that we had more time for pleasantries but let us hear your news
very well i will begin ive directed the body of frelias army south to engage grado directly our troops are proving themselves superior and the battle progresses favorably
hmm  but the riddle still needs answering why did grado begin this war in the first place
your majesty we may well have found something relating to that  we learned something on our travels news that weighs heavily upon us
ah yes our messenger delivered your report to us a few days ago grado is trying to destroy the sacred stones  is that it
yes
weve strengthened the towers defenses frelias stone is safe for the time being but we remain confused in this what does grado hope to gain by destroying the sacred stones
we dont know the legends say the stones protect us all from the power of darkness
 i cant say if it relates but i have a story about grado its been troubling me and i would like to share it with you all myrrh come here please
yes
whos this girl
on her back  wings ephraim who is she
this is myrrh i met here while fighting in grado territory myrrh would you please tell everyone here the story you told me
    please ephraim you tell them
shes a bit shy
very well myrrh tells me that she belongs to an ancient race of dragon folk theyre mentioned in a few legends theyre called the tribe of manakete
manakete
yes their name appears several times in the tale of the sacred stones it says they were neither human nor demon but a separate aloof race
please myrrh
   we live in the east in darkling woods one day 
yes
we felt something an ominous energy to the south
from the direction of grado they felt a force flowing out of the grado empire
saleh and i  we went to investigate this energy but on our way down we came across a battle and were drawn into the conflict
myrrh got lost and was wandering aimlessly in an isolated region near grados border
i met some wicked folk there they deceived and enchained me they stole my dragonstone they were preparing me for transport it was in that moment when ephraim appeared and rescued me
  
i stumbled across myrrh by chance when grados men had ambushed us everything she told me seemed beyond belief and yet  and yet when i saw her wings what could i do but believe
this dark wave of energy still flows from the southlands its current is strong and runs deep it has awakened the evil ones i want to stop it
hmmm  
your majesty i bring word
what is so urgent you would interrupt a private council
the tower holding the sacred stone of frelia  its been destroyed by the grado army
what thats impossible what of the soldiers on watch there were supposed to be many 
the enemy forces  they were led by caellach the tiger eye and selena fluorspar our soldiers fell before even half a day had past
selena fluorspar  only general duessel is higher in emperor vigardes esteem  shes the one
she came personally  so they really do wish to see the sacred stones destroyed blast 
hah so this hunk of rock is a sacred stone eh so much fuss over something as fragile as this watch it crumbles so easily do we gain anything by this not that i care but 
black hearted fool  what have you done without the stones protection  the horrors will spread 
huh whats this still breathing are you come if youve any last words ill hear them fool of frelia
you monster 
you waste your last words on insults and feeble ones at that  hardly the right note to enter the eternal on wouldnt you say well then die
hold what are you doing caellach our job was to destroy the sacred stone
i know that and i crush it did i not but if we dont clean up these frelian curs they might 
you do not raise your blade to anyone who is powerless to resist you the emperor does not desire us to kill without cause that would be murder
right the emperor  your names selena aint it tell me selena what makes that pasty  faced old fools word so important
wretch  do you dare insult his imperial majesty
hey hey im joking dont get so worked up i get it now youre a true and loyal soldier im leaving before frelia sends reinforcements coming
  
how could this happen  how could i have allowed our sacred stone to be destroyed dark energies from the empires capital  evil monstrosities roaming our lands  vigardes mad invasion  and now this the destruction of our sacred talisman and we have no idea of grados goals we are in the dark times once again but even so we cannot sit here wringing our hands first we must warn the nations that house the remaining sacred stones if vigarde seeks to destroy the stones they are all in grave danger jehanna and rausten must be warned the nations must joined together to fight our common foe
do you think they will believe us
hm  it is a difficult tale to believe i must agree
i will go father
innes
a direct visit from the prince of frelia is not something they can ignore i will travel to jehanna where i will forge an alliance with her queen if our sacred stone has been destroyed the frelia could be in greater danger father i cannot let you leave the nation in such a time of crisis it is imperative that i be the one to go
hmmm 
and i will head for rausten
eirika you know i cant let you put yourself in such danger
rest easy dear brother i will journey to rausten by ship across the north sea there will be no danger and i have made a vow i will fight as you have until the day renais is liberated
 i understand king hayden i will take troops and march on the imperial capital from the west
the west are you saying you will begin an assault on grado from here
if we can take grado keep the war will be over the sacred stones will be safe if we start here and press forward with all our might 
and once you reach the capital vigardes generals will be there waiting for you
if they oppose us we will fight
 youve got your fathers foolhardy courage dont you  very well i entrust all our hope to you three innes you will go to jehanna eirika to rausten and ephraim to the imperial capital funding you will have but of soldiers we have few to spare for each of you a difficult road awaits
if any of us meets defeat the battle will turn to grados favor there must be no errors we must not fail
where i command there are no mistakes
i have no doubts ill succeed i swear it come it is time to go
farewell brother i will return
mm  to be honest i still do not want you to go i would rather you wait here for my return
please ephraim  i will be fine theres no need for you to worry mine is the easiest task and ill be in no danger im far more worried about your mission challenging the might of an empire with a handful of men
whats this now have you lost your faith in me
no of course not i know your true strength ephraim no one can defeat you
ha ha hearing you say that fills me with confidence i think i know my own limitations i wont overextend my reach i cant die and leave you on your own can i
ephraim 
let us both survive to be reunited give me your word eirika
you have it brother
eirika and ephraim will now part ways which of them will you accompany
princess eirika
is your departure time near
yes kyle forde im traveling to rausten i ask that you two serve my brother well
actually theres been a slight change of plans
were going with you your highness
what but 
prince ephraim rides with frelias finest at his back
and this was a personal order from the prince himself he said i dont need you loafing around here go and keep eirika safesince when is battling all of grado loafing about honestly
youre right my brothers mission is far more dangerous than mine i will go and speak with him 
princess eirika prince ephraim said hes not concerned for his own safety these are the words our prince gave us and we believe he means them
thats the truth of it theres no cause for worry princess eirika we can all attest to the princes tenacity no matter how close death comes the pale horse will not catch him
 kyle forde  i understand thank you for your service and bravery you are my brothers most trusted and most valiant companions i would be honored to have you ride at my side
the honor is ours we ride for renais and for princess eirika
lets not work ourselves into a frenzy right now when the time comes i will be there to handle things
of course im depending on both of you
prince ephraim
is that you seth im almost ready to depart im leaving eirika in your care
actually milord  we have the honor of riding with you
what what about eirika
the princess informs me that she will be accompanied by a frelian escort she tells me she does not need a large retinue on such a small ship
i understand but we must be prepared for anything i will be fine seth please go and attend eirika
lord ephraim this is lady eirikas wish she implored us to lend our blades to you on the front lines  she spoke to each of us individually she knelt before us and beseeched us to go her sincerity her concern  we could not help but be moved by her plea
oh eirika  very well you will all come with me but steel yourselves this will not be an easy journey i want only volunteers who are unafraid of meeting death
ill let the others know i must tell you milord they are already preparing to depart they know the risks they are taking and not a one will be deterred
/***EOF***/
king hayden apologizes for being unable to spare soldiers however he does provide eirika with a small but trusted party of vassals eirika is grateful for the kings aid chasing rumors of her brother she sets out for grado the groups first stop is the remote village of ide which was until very recently a part of renais here eirika sees the devastation of renais with her own eyes
seth has mapped out a route for us well travel south of renais and pass through serafew into grado territory
hmm  that would seem a sensible plan assuming of course that we can avoid any run ins with grado soldiers 
princess eirika may i have your leave to scout ahead from the sky ill have a better chance of spotting any nearby troops
were yours to command your highness will you give your permission
yes of course keep an eye out for enemy bowmen though vanessa
yes your highness i shall i shall prove myself worthy of the honor of your trust
she seems very sincere

and who are you you dont look like one of the local peasantry as you can see the villagers have some bandit troubles i would like to help but i have orders to follow  i am required to quit this area at once i would ask you to aid them in this fight i will pay you for your trouble of course
the most wonderful man rescued me he was dressed like a mercenary but he had an air of elegance about him  he gave me this elixir im sure it will help you on the battlefield

 im sorry im retired now im not a soldier anymore its  a decision i made long ago
master garcia 
 when i was a soldier i lived my life fighting for my countrys honor i left no time for my family i spent my life fighting for faceless uncaring nobles when my wife fell ill and died i met the child she had left behind  at that moment i finally realized what my duty had cost me
  
i stood at my wifes grave and promised her i would be a father to our son im done with armies im done with fighting except to protect my son ive no regrets im the boys father
  
you you blasted fool father whats all this nonsense im hearing
ross
if youre not going then i will im a fighter i know i can do this
ross what are you saying i 
dad please listen to me i respect you more than any other man in the world i know you gave up being a soldier for me i know that but how can you throw away such a big part of yourself youre a warrior at heart you cant give that up and be happy
  
look at me dad have you seen me fight im not a child anymore im a warrior like you youre free to worry but i can survive on my own
 ross
you want to challenge me father im a fighter the best in all of ide im not gonna lose to you im not gonna lose to anyone
 youre right youre a good soldier ross

dad 
looks like my boy grew up while i wasnt looking  hes tougher than i thought he doesnt need my help ive raised him as best i could but hes right ive nothing to fear i should fight i will fight
dad
thank you so much for your help please stay the night and rest 
we would if we could but we have much to do and far to travel your safety is reward enough
ah well  my that is a splendid bracelet youre wearing
thank you my father gave this to me
its a wonderful gift but you should be careful wearing such a valuable item so openly since renais was invaded things have become so dangerous around here there are gold hungry thieves and bandits everywhere the most wicked are bazbas bandits they are cruel beyond words if you have something they want your life is worth less than nothing just the other day they assaulted some travelers and oh it was awful
i i cant believe such things 
oh renais is finished mark my words the grado empires stolen our future our only hope against them was that prince ephraim would prevail but  rumor has it that hes on the verge of being crushed by grados vast numbers these are dark days travel with care
  
ephraim 
its time to start are you ready eirika
yes ephraim lets begin
tell me though why do you want me to teach you to fight i thought you didnt care for violence 
i do not like uncivilized behavior i think one can solve ones problems without fighting and yet 
and yet what
ive always relied on you to protect me brother i would rather not be such a burden to you in the future so i thought maybe i should learn to protect myself 
im your brother brothers are supposed to protect their sisters its nothing for you to worry about its no cause for concern
yes but  i am your sister sisters are supposed to worry about their brothers so i would like to learn something of swordplay if only a little and maybe someday i can protect you in your time of need  so please ephraim
all right all right how could i say no honestly once you get an idea into your head thats it i might as well give in its agreed ill teach you but wont hold back because youre my sister and i want no complaining once weve started eirika
complain me never
  
oops beg your pardon
hey
princess are you all right
y yes  someone bumped into me is all i was jarred
hm your highness where is your bracelet
my bracelet its gone where could it be did that man 
ill find him
dont worry about it seth that bracelet was a gift from my father but ephraim needs our help i cant let sentimentality get in the way of my duty
no princess  we must retrieve your bracelet regardless of cost you cannot lose it lets go we must hurry
