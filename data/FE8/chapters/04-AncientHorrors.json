Passing through the ancient forest Za\u2019ha brings them close to Grado\u2019s border. As they near the town of Serafew, Eirika\u2019s fears are assuaged by the lack of troops. But never-before-seen terrors crawl in the shadows of the trees."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Seth", "line": "We\u2019re approaching Serafew, at the border of Renais and Grado. Once we cross, we\u2019ll be in Grado... Renvall won\u2019t be much farther."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "That is, assuming we can cross the border without mishap... Oh! Look! Over there!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Those strange figures... What...What are they? Are they...human? I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. What could they be?"}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "What have we done to deserve the trials before us? What is happening to us? How could such abominations walk out lands while the Sacred Stones protect us?"}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Lute, please, it\u2019s dangerous outside the walls. Stay here in the village."}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "Those are revenants, aren\u2019t they? They were the vanguard of the Demon King in the days of darkness. The Tome of Nazania describes them in chapter 2, section 7, paragraph 8."}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "You know of them?"}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "Duh! I\u2019m a prodigy. I can recall almost everything I see or hear. According to the book, revenants attack using razor-sharp claws. Sounds painful, wouldn\u2019t you say?"}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Yes, er, well... Be that as it may, I must go aid those travelers outside. You should stay here within the safety of the village."}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "Very well. I don\u2019t mind staying here. In fact, it seems that smarter choice."}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "Magic is far more powerful than any monster\u2019s claws. The thickest hide and the strongest armor are useless against magic\u2019s power. Yes, I supposed I could have studied swords, but only magic is worthy of me. Even if this village were to be assaulted by monsters, I could defend it perfectly."}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Travelers, you must listen to me! The ancient forest of Za\u2019ha is dangerous. Head south and pass through this place before the fiends surround you!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "My name is Artur. The temple has assigned me the task of cleansing the forest of these...things. There are so many of the fiends, though. I wonder if I stand much chance alone. So if you would, please flee now while you have the chance."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Fiends? You\u2019re not talking about the same fiends that served the ancient Demon King? That can\u2019t be right... They\u2019re nothing but legends and fairy tales..."}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Yes, I felt the same say when I heard. And yet here they are. This place is filled with them. I wonder how far they\u2019re spread... Surely they\u2019re not in Renais alone."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "But..why are they here? How?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Beware, Your Highness! Something approaches!"}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Please allow me to deal with this. Evil shade! May the blessed light drive you from this land!"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "We ought to help. He can\u2019t fight them all alone. Do you have orders?"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Oh, my! Those travelers are being besieged by the agents of evil!"}, {"speaker": "Dozla", "line": "Ha ha ha! Right you are, Lady L\u2019Arachel!"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "I cannot allow this to happen! Come! We must charge down these cliffs and rush to their aid!"}, {"speaker": "Rennac", "line": "We charge down these cliffs, and the only thing we\u2019ll be rushing to is death. How about we find us a nice, gentle path down, hm?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Ah...Yes, well...Let us hurry nonetheless. I simply cannot abide those wicked beasts running amok!"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Man", "line": "Do you see that old snag to the south of here? Bet it would make a handy bridge if you could knock it over. Take a weapon to it and give it a few good whacks. That should do it. Here, take this and give it a try. It ought to do the trick."}], "recruit-visit": [{"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Lute, help has arrived."}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Lute?"}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "Your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction. It seems you\u2019re not a revenant."}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "Well, I should hope not! I wanted you to know help has arrived. Please be patient a bit longer..."}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "No, no. I insist on joining you in combat. I\u2019ve been reading up on these revenants. They are, quite simply, no match for me. I am superior after all."}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Hm?"}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "Your flesh shows no sign of putrefaction. It seems you\u2019re not a revenant. I\u2019ve decided to join you in battle now. My name is Lute. I\u2019m a mage of superior wisdom and rare ability. I\u2019ve been reading up on these revenants. They are, quite simply, no match for me. I am superior after all."}], "end": [{"speaker": "Seth", "line": "We\u2019ve killed all the monsters. Still, we\u2019d best burn the bones to ash to be sure they don\u2019t return."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I still can\u2019t believe what we\u2019ve been fighting here... I\u2019d thought those fiends nothing more than myth and legend."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Those revenants are said to be the least of the dark creatures. And yet, the weakest of them could outmatch any normal man. We cannot take this enemy lightly."}, {"speaker": "Lute", "line": "Oh, yes. There are much worse then those revenants and the entombed... Let\u2019s see, there\u2019s the bonewalkers, mauthe doogs, gargoyles, baels... Why, I\u2019ll bet you just about any creature of lore could be walking again. Yes, we\u2019re in for some trouble. Even my fabulous power may not be enough."}, {"speaker": "Artur", "line": "O divine light, show me... Is this a sign of dark days to come?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "By all that\u2019s holy, what is happening?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Princess Eirika, perhaps it would be wise to return to Frelia and regroup. Pressing forward seems foolish in light of recent events. We cannot face both Grado\u2019s forces and more of those terrible things."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Seth, I follow your point, and nothing would please me more then running for safety. But what of my brother? He and his men are still trapped in the same situation we are. I know full well that I may be leading us into even greater danger, but... Please try to understand."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "I do, my princess, and I vow to see you through this safely."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Aha! Foul creatures, beware! I, L\u2019Arachel, bestow upon you the honor at banishment at my blessed hands!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Oh...Where are the monsters?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Well, we just finished..."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Ah, glad tidings indeed! The heavens must be rejoicing! I am.. a tad disappointed however. After all, I did rush all the way here to show you the splendor of my might."}, {"speaker": "Dozla", "line": "Gwah ha ha! It\u2019s a real shame, innit, Lady L\u2019Arachel?!"}, {"speaker": "Rennac", "line": "What\u2019s shameful is the way you drag us around the countryside."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Pardon me, but...who are you?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Me? Since you ask, please allow me to introduce myself. It is I, the true light and glory of the sacred realm of Rausten..."}, {"speaker": "Dozla", "line": "Stop! Lady L\u2019Arachel, you mustn\u2019t continue! You cannot reveal your true identity here!"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Oh, yes, you\u2019re right. Oh, I get so careless sometimes! Now, I must ride off in anonymity. Oh, how beautifully romantic!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Uh... Right."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Fare thee well, strangers. Perhaps our paths will cross again. Come, Dozla! Rennac! We ride!"}, {"speaker": "Dozla", "line": "Gwah ha ha! Let\u2019s go, Rennac!"}, {"speaker": "Rennac", "line": "All right, all right."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "...What was that about?"}]}
