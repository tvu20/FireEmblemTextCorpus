It\u2019s good to see you safe!"}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "Of course I\u2019m safe, Uncle. Evil can never defeat the forces of righteousness!"}, {"speaker": "Mansel", "line": "Ha! You\u2019re exactly right, my dear! Now tell me, who are our guests?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Pontifex Mansel of Rausten, allow me to introduce myself. I am Eirika, Princess of Renais. I come to you today as an emissary of Frelia."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "And I am Ephraim, Prince of Renais. I come with Eirika to warn you of the danger our world faces."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "It began when..."}, {"speaker": "Mansel", "line": "...Hmm, I see. That is a tough tale to swallow all at once... However, I have heard of the fell creatures in Darkling Woods. L\u2019Arachel. You will need the Stone of Rausten if we have any hope of victory."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "That is so, Uncle. I would like permission to open the temple seal."}, {"speaker": "Mansel", "line": "Hmm... There's no need to rush yourself so, L'Arachel. You\u2019re home again, in this blessed haven. You should rest."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "How can I relax until I know that our Sacred Stone is safe? At the least, I\u2019d like to ensure that the temple seal is intact. Oh..."}, {"speaker": "Mansel", "line": "Is something amiss?"}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "I think we\u2019ll take a night to rest after all. Everyone is so exhausted.

There\u2019s nothing I can do to help him..."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "Your friend is gone, Eirika. All that remains is the Demon King, masquerading as Lyon. For the good of all humanity, he must be defeated. Ah... If only it truly were that easy, though."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "Eirika... I never knew Prince Lyon. I cannot pretend to understand the sadness you must feel. However, I do know this... If the Lyon you hold so dear were here with you today...

Take your time and think it through. You need to find your own answer. Now then, it\u2019s about time we found ourselves something to eat.

There's nothing wrong with me. I'm always like this."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "That's not true. I've never seen you look so sad as you do right now. If you're depressed, I'm sure my brother would worry... And I...well, I..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "......Tana. You're the princess of Frelia. Perhaps it's unwise of you to be so friendly to Eirika and me. After all, alliances aside, our two countries' needs may differ. Who knows what the future holds?

Don't say that!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "And why not?"}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "You and Eirika are both my friends. We come from different countries, it's true, but...but...

Please don't cry."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Ephraim..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "You're right, though. No matter what happens, the bond between us will never disappear.

Do you plan on shouldering the entire burden yourself?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I'm sorry."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "If that's all you're going to say, then there's naught I can do. Have you already decided on your course of action?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "......Mm-hm. I'm prepared."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "...Then there's no need for me to say anything more, is there? You and I are so alike... You want nothing but to help others. You refuse to show weakness, and you want to accomplish everything yourself. However, you must know that there are times when you must share the burden."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "That's true... And I feel better for having spoken with you. Thank you, L'Arachel."}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Heh heh heh... Guard duty? At this time of night? Such a diligent soldier."}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Huh?!

The guardian of light, Rausten, will drown in a never-ending night. Come, my pretties. It\u2019s time to go. The day of Rausten\u2019s destruction has at long last arrived!"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Your Holiness! There\u2019s been an attack!

Tonight, we claim not only Pontifex Mansel\u2019s sad life, but also Rausten\u2019s Sacred Stone! Heh heh heh... You cretin, Mansel... I will have my revenge. You should never have excommunicated me. The Demon King will be your new master!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Lyon... You were so selfless. Your generosity seemed to flow from a bottomless well. I\u2019m so sorry, Lyon.

Did you find your answer?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yes. Thank you, L\u2019Arachel. Your words guided me."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "My-my words? It was nothing...

I\u2019d glad to see that your spirits are up."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Ah, Tana. And I have you to thank for it."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "It was nothing.

Is this allowed?"}, {"speaker": "Mansel", "line": "I know the law, L'Arachel.
