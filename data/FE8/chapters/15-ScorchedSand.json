We\u2019re still completely surrounded by Grado\u2019s armies... We may all die at any moment... I can\u2019t lose focus now. Has anything changed?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Unfortunately, no.

Most of the units can\u2019t get proper footing and are being slowed down. Mounted units are having the worst time, as their movement is severely limited. Princess Eirika... I ask that you leave for safety. We\u2019ll use flying units and magic users to hold the foe here."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "No. I will not retreat. If I give up now...

If you fall, Prince Ephraim, we\u2019re all finished. And this accursed sand... Most of the units can\u2019t get proper footing and are being slowed down.

A combination of magic wielders and sky riders should give us some advantage. Whatever we do, we must move cautiously."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I understand.

Do you ever want to be a mercenary again, to see him?"}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "Nope. The time we worked together was fun and all, but... No. I don\u2019t want to end up another no-name mercenary lying dead in a ditch. I\u2019d rather serve the Grado Empire and make a name for myself. I\u2019m going to see how far my axe will take me. And then, one day..."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "One day, you\u2019ll kill me and be emperor in my stead. Is that it?"}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "Uh... That\u2019s..."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "It\u2019s all right. Think whatever you like if it helps you do your duty. As long as you do what I assign you to do, I\u2019m happy.

Selena Fluorspar was killed in western Grado. Duessel, whom they call Obsidian, is missing in action... The Blood Beryl, whose real name is Riev, has also gone missing. Hm? How do I know all this?

Pockets of resistance remain, but the war itself is over."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Is that so?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "However, something remains that still bothers me. A Grado man named Knoll told me about something called a Dark Stone.?Their mages had uncovered lore that led them to craft a powerful magic stone. This Dark Stone may have been the catalyst of Grado\u2019s transformation. It seems to be the source of that black wave of energy Myrrh described. Vigarde died some time ago, but the power of the stone played him like a puppet.

Who is it?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...I still can\u2019t believe it, but I\u2019ll tell you nonetheless. According to Knoll, the man behind this is Lyon, the imperial prince.

Ephraim, you might know this, but after I abandoned the sea route to Rausten, I traveled overland with Prince Innes to Jehanna. We ran into trouble with Grado\u2019s forces, and I chanced upon Lyon. He didn\u2019t share the details of his situation, but he intimated that he was on our side. Despite all appearances, he was on our side. So Lyon..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Eirika, I also met Lyon."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Did you really?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Yes.

What are you saying?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I\u2019ll tell you what I saw. I found Lyon inside Grado Keep. This is what he told me: He said he was behind this war. He said he\u2019d befriended us solely so that, one day, he could invade Renais... He told me he killed our father."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "That... That can\u2019t..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I know. I can\u2019t believe it either. I refuse to believe it. How could he have planned all this since he was a child... I simply can\u2019t fathom it. I\u2019ve heard Lyon changed when he acquired the Dark Stone. I\u2019ve no interest in magic, but... There was something uncanny about him. It seemed almost as though he were being controlled by something himself."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "The two of you might find this hard to accept, but... The state of Prince Lyon\u2019s heart matters little. He has the Dark Stone. That rock is the cause of all that\u2019s happened.

There is something that needs doing first."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "L\u2019Arachel?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Prince Ephraim, I do believe you felt it as well. The Dark Stone held by Prince Lyon... It exudes a malefic miasma... We might be able to handle Prince Lyon alone, but that stone is beyond our ken."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Then what do you suggest?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "The Sacred Stones."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "The Sacred Stones?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "We\u2019ve all heard the legend of the five Sacred Stones.

We also have hope. According to Lyon, he has already seen to the destruction of Grado\u2019s, Frelia\u2019s, and Jehanna\u2019s stones."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Hm. That explains something... Grado forces attacked me, intent on destroying the Stone of Renais. If that could be the reason they chose to invade Renais... The power of the Sacred Stones may be greater than we\u2019d ever known."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Yes, exactly!

Do you suppose that, during the invasion of Renais..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "No, I don\u2019t think so. The Stone of Renais is hidden by the power of Eirika\u2019s and my bracelets."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Grado has made many attempts to take our bracelets. Every one has failed, and so the stone may still be safe."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "We have to confirm that, of course. We\u2019ve defeated Grado, and we must turn our eyes to our homeland.
