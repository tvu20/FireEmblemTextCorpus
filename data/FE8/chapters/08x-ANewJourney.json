I\u2019ve no doubt..."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Eirika! Ephraim! Welcome! The two of you returning together, it\u2019s like a dream come true. You must know, I\u2019ve prayed every day for your safe return."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I\u2019m so happy to see you, Tana."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I\u2019m sorry, Tana. I didn\u2019t want for you to worry."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter now... All that really matters is that we\u2019ve been brought together again. My own brother will soon return from the field. It will be nice to sit down and discuss things again."}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Princess Tana! Prince Innes has returned from the front!"}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Welcome home, dear brother! I\u2019m so happy to see you return safe and sound!"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "You didn\u2019t expect less, did you? Do you think Grado\u2019s slugs could touch me? With my bow, I\u2019ll take down every Grado soldier form here to the emperor\u2019s palace!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Well met, Innes."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "...Ephraim."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "It\u2019s good to see you, Prince Innes."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "...They say Renais has fallen. I believe I warned you before. This happened because you provided Grado the opportunity to strike."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Brother! Mind your tongue! This is no occasion for such harsh words. Ephraim and Eirika have lost their father to this terrible war..."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "...... I\u2019m sorry to hear of your father\u2019s death. Hear me, Ephraim. Our most important task is to defeat Grado and end this war."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Oh, Innes... I\u2019m sorry, Eirika, Ephraim."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s comforting to see that, in all of this, at least he hasn\u2019t changed. Innes has hated me for as long as I can remember."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "My brother looks upon you as a rival, Ephraim. And as you know, he wants to be the best at everything.

Will you come with me to take part in your official audience?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Yes, of course. There\u2019s much that I have to tell him."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "It will be out honor to attend."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "This way."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "It does my heart good to see you all here safely within our castle walls. ...Would that we had more time for pleasantries, but...let us hear your news."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Very well, I will begin. I\u2019ve directed the body of Frelia\u2019s army south to engage Grado directly. Our troops are proving themselves superior, and the battle progresses favorably."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Hmm... But the riddle still needs answering. Why did Grado begin this war in the first place?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Your Majesty, we may well have found something relating to that... We learned something on our travels, news that weighs heavily upon us."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Ah, yes. Our messenger delivered your report to us a few days ago. Grado is trying to destroy the Sacred Stones... Is that it?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "We\u2019ve strengthened the tower\u2019s defenses. Frelia\u2019s stone is safe for the time being. But we remain confused in this. What does Grado hope to gain by destroying the Sacred Stones?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "We don\u2019t know. The legends say the stones protect us all from the power of darkness."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...I can\u2019t say if it relates, but I have a story about Grado. It\u2019s...been troubling me, and I would like to share it with you all. Myrrh. Come here, please."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "Yes?"}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Who\u2019s this girl?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "On her back... Wings? Ephraim, who is she?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "This is Myrrh. I met here while fighting in Grado territory. Myrrh, would you please tell everyone here the story you told me?"}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "...... ...Please, Ephraim, you tell them."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "She\u2019s a bit shy."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Very well. Myrrh tells me that she belongs to an ancient race of dragon folk. They\u2019re mentioned in a few legends. They\u2019re called the tribe of Manakete."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Manakete?"}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Yes, their name appears several times in the tale of the Sacred Stones. It says they were neither human nor demon but a separate, aloof race."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Please, Myrrh."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "...... We live in the east...in Darkling Woods. One day..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yes?"}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "We felt something. An ominous energy to the south."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "From the direction of Grado. They felt a...force flowing out of the Grado Empire."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "Saleh and I... We went to investigate this energy. But on our way down, we came across a battle and were drawn into the conflict."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Myrrh got lost and was wandering aimlessly in an isolated region near Grado\u2019s border."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "I met some wicked folk there. They deceived and enchained me. They stole my dragonstone. They were preparing me for transport. It was in that moment when Ephraim appeared and rescued me."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I stumbled across Myrrh by chance when Grado\u2019s men had ambushed us. Everything she told me seemed beyond belief, and yet... And yet, when I saw her wings, what could I do but believe?"}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "This dark wave of energy still flows from the southlands. Its current is strong and runs deep. It has awakened the evil ones. I want to stop it."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Hmmm......"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Your Majesty! I bring word!"}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "What is so urgent you would interrupt a private council?"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "The tower holding the Sacred Stone of Frelia... It\u2019s been destroyed by the Grado Army!"}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "What? That\u2019s impossible! What of the soldiers on watch? There were supposed to be many..."}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "The enemy forces... They were led by Caellach the Tiger Eye and Selena Fluorspar! Our soldiers fell before even half a day had past!"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Selena Fluorspar... Only General Duessel is higher in Emperor Vigarde\u2019s esteem... She\u2019s the one."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "She came personally... So they really do wish to see the Sacred Stones destroyed. Blast..."}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "Hah! So this hunk of rock is a Sacred Stone, eh? So much fuss over something as fragile as this. Watch. It crumbles so easily. Do we gain anything by this? Not that I care, but..."}, {"speaker": "Frelia Soldier", "line": "Black-hearted...fool... What have...you...done? Without the stone\u2019s...protection... the horrors...will spread..."}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "Huh? What\u2019s this? Still breathing, are you? Come. If you\u2019ve any last words, I\u2019ll hear them, fool of Frelia."}, {"speaker": "Frelia Soldier", "line": "You...monster..."}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "You waste your last words on insults? And feeble ones, at that... Hardly the right note to enter the eternal on, wouldn\u2019t you say? Well then, die."}, {"speaker": "Selena", "line": "Hold! What are you doing, Caellach?! Our job was to destroy the Sacred Stone."}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "I know that. And I crush it, did I not? But if we don\u2019t clean up these Frelian curs, they might\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Selena", "line": "You do not raise your blade to anyone who is powerless to resist you! The emperor does not desire us to kill without cause! That would be murder!"}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "Right, the emperor... Your name\u2019s Selena, ain\u2019t it? Tell me, Selena. What makes that pasty- faced old fool\u2019s word so important?"}, {"speaker": "Selena", "line": "Wretch... Do you dare insult His Imperial Majesty!?"}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "Hey, hey, I\u2019m joking. Don\u2019t get so worked up. I get it now. You\u2019re a true and loyal soldier. I\u2019m leaving before Frelia sends reinforcements. Coming?"}, {"speaker": "Selena", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "How could this happen... How could I have allowed our Sacred Stone to be destroyed? Dark energies from the empire\u2019s capital... Evil monstrosities roaming our lands... Vigarde\u2019s mad invasion... And now this, the destruction of our sacred talisman. And we have no idea of Grado\u2019s goals. We are in the dark times once again. But even so, we cannot sit here, wringing our hands. First, we must warn the nations that house the remaining Sacred Stones. If Vigarde seeks to destroy the Stones, they are all in grave danger. Jehanna and Rausten must be warned. The nations must joined together to fight our common foe."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Do you think they will believe us?"}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Hm... It is a difficult tale to believe, I must agree."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "I will go, Father."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Innes?"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "A direct visit from the Prince of Frelia is not something they can ignore. I will travel to Jehanna, where I will forge an alliance with her queen. If our Sacred Stone has been destroyed, the Frelia could be in greater danger. Father, I cannot let you leave the nation in such a time of crisis. It is imperative that I be the one to go."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Hmmm..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "And I will head for Rausten."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Eirika? You know I can\u2019t let you put yourself in such danger."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Rest easy, dear brother. I will journey to Rausten by ship across the North Sea. There will be no danger. And I have made a vow. I will fight as you have until the day Renais is liberated."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...I understand. King Hayden, I will take troops and march on the imperial capital from the west."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "The west?! Are you saying you will begin an assault on Grado from here?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "If we can take Grado Keep, the war will be over. The Sacred Stones will be safe. If we start here and press forward with all our might..."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "And once you reach the capital? Vigarde\u2019s generals will be there waiting for you."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "If they oppose us, we will fight."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "...You\u2019ve got your father\u2019s foolhardy courage, don\u2019t you? ...Very well. I entrust all our hope to you three. Innes, you will go to Jehanna, Eirika to Rausten, And Ephraim to the imperial capital. Funding you will have, but of soldiers, we have few to spare. For each of you, a difficult road awaits."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "If any of us meets defeat, the battle will turn to Grado\u2019s favor. There must be no errors. We must not fail."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Where I command, there are no mistakes."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I have no doubts. I\u2019ll succeed, I swear it. Come, it is time to go!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Farewell, Brother. I will return."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Mm... To be honest, I still do not want you to go. I would rather you wait here for my return."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Please, Ephraim... I will be fine. There\u2019s no need for you to worry. Mine is the easiest task, and I\u2019ll be in no danger. I\u2019m far more worried about your mission. Challenging the might of an empire with a handful of men?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "What\u2019s this now? Have you lost your faith in me?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "No, of course not. I know your true strength, Ephraim. No one can defeat you."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Ha ha! Hearing you say that fills me with confidence. I think I know my own limitations. I won\u2019t overextend my reach. I can\u2019t die and leave you on your own, can I?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Ephraim..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Let us both survive to be reunited. Give me your word, Eirika."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "You have it, Brother."}, {"speaker": "Narrator", "line": "Eirika and Ephraim will now part ways. Which of them will you accompany?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Princess Eirika!"}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Is your departure time near?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yes. Kyle, Forde, I\u2019m traveling to Rausten. I ask that you two serve my brother well."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Actually, there\u2019s been a slight change of plans."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "We\u2019re going with you, Your Highness."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "What? But..."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Prince Ephraim rides with Frelia\u2019s finest at his back."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "And this was a personal order from the prince himself. He said, I don\u2019t need you loafing around here. Go and keep Eirika safe.?Since when is battling all of Grado loafing about? Honestly!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "You\u2019re right! My brother\u2019s mission is far more dangerous than mine. I will go and speak with him..."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Princess Eirika. Prince Ephraim said he\u2019s not concerned for his own safety. These are the words our prince gave us, and we believe he means them."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "That\u2019s the truth of it. There\u2019s no cause for worry, Princess Eirika. We can all attest to the prince\u2019s tenacity. No matter how close death comes, the Pale Horse will not catch him."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "...Kyle, Forde... I understand. Thank you for your service and bravery. You are my brother\u2019s most trusted and most valiant companions. I would be honored to have you ride at my side."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "The honor is ours. We ride for Renais and for Princess Eirika!"}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Let\u2019s not work ourselves into a frenzy right now. When the time comes, I will be there to handle things."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Of course. I\u2019m depending on both of you."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Prince Ephraim."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Is that you, Seth? I\u2019m almost ready to depart. I\u2019m leaving Eirika in your care."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Actually, milord... We have the honor of riding with you."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "What? What about Eirika?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "The princess informs me that she will be accompanied by a Frelian escort. She tells me she does not need a large retinue on such a small ship."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I understand, but we must be prepared for anything. I will be fine, Seth. Please go and attend Eirika."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Lord Ephraim, this is Lady Eirika\u2019s wish. She implored us to lend our blades to you on the front lines... She spoke to each of us individually. She knelt before us and beseeched us to go. Her sincerity, her concern... We could not help but be moved by her plea."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Oh, Eirika... Very well. You will all come with me. But steel yourselves. This will not be an easy journey. I want only volunteers who are unafraid of meeting death."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "I\u2019ll let the others know. I must tell you, milord\u2013they are already preparing to depart. They know the risks they are taking, and not a one will be deterred."}], "flashback": [{"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Ephraim! Lyon! Where are you two?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "We\u2019re over here, Eirika. You\u2019d better be quick. Ephraim says he\u2019s tired of waiting."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Oh, please, I\u2019m sure you could wait a few moments longer..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "You\u2019re late. How does it take you so long to prepare for such a simple trip?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Rest easy, Ephraim. There\u2019s no need to be so curt with your own sister. After all, a king must learn how to treat women with honor and discretion. That\u2019s what Father MacGregor says."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Thank you, Lyon. You, unlike my dear brother, are a true gentleman. I was up far too late thinking about my prayer to the temple flame last night. And I\u2019m afraid I... I overslept..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Your prayer? What are you babbling about?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Come now, you know that the flame has been burning since the time of darkness ended. You must know the story that the flame will answer the prayers of any pilgrim!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Really? I didn\u2019t know that."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Oh, Ephraim... Father MacGregor is going to scold you for neglecting your studies so."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...Don\u2019t even joke about that. So tell us, what have you decided to pray for, Eirika?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I, uh... It\u2019s a secret."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I should\u2019ve known. You\u2019re so boring."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Well, how about you, Ephraim?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Me? Let\u2019s see... I guess I\u2019ll pray to become a stronger fighter."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "That\u2019s just like you, Ephraim."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Just like you indeed, Brother."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "... I can never tell if you\u2019re complimenting me or mocking me."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Praising you, of course! Right, Eirika?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Hee hee... Yes, that\u2019s right."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "And you, Lyon? What will you pray for?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "What? Me? Hm... I suppose all I really want is for all our people to be happy."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...That\u2019s very, uh... That\u2019s very much like you."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Very much so, Lyon."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "...Now, I\u2019m the one who cannot tell if he\u2019s being praised or..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "You\u2019re being praised, as always, Lyon."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Tell me, why the sudden decision to visit the temple? Did my brother do something again?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Now listen, you..."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Oh no. It\u2019s not what Ephraim\u2019s done. It\u2019s what he hasn\u2019t done. He\u2019s learned nothing at all about the Sacred Stones and the temple flame, so..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Father MacGregor became angry. He said, One destined to become king and rule over a nation... must know the history of his kingdom and must respect the Sacred Stones.?Ever since I came to Grado, my life has been chastisement and castigation. Father MacGregor does not think me to be altogether too...kingly."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "And yet General Duessel has nothing but praise for you, Ephraim. He says you\u2019ve brave and true, that you\u2019ve the making of a great king."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "A great king? I honestly have no idea what that means. Eirika should succeed the throne. I would be happy simply taking my lance and traveling the land as a mercenary."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Ephraim, that is nothing but foolish, irresponsible romanticism! Do you realize how much your words would fill Father\u2019s heart with grief?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Are we speaking of the same man? Our father will likely outlive us all. For now, I\u2019m content just learning the lance from General Duessel. What about you, Lyon? Is there anything you want to do?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Me? Well, I... I suppose I want to become like my father."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "You were born to be the Emperor of Grado, Lyon. It suits you."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "No, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not\u2013 One thing I do know from watching my father is that being emperor is hard. Every day, he answers the complaints of the people, and he almost never sleeps... My father is always so very tired. I hope one day that... I hope that I can help him."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Lyon... You are so honorable. You should learn from him, Brother."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...Again with your criticism! Tell me, Eirika. What say you to dressing like me and becoming king in my stead? You\u2019re so skinny, I doubt anyone would notice you\u2019re not really a man."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Ha ha ha..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Ephraim!"}]}
