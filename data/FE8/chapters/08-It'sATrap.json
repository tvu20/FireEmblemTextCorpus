Prince Ephraim is being kept in a cell back here."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Very well, let\u2019s go."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "...Sir Orson. How long ago were you taken prisoner?"}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Some two weeks past. Prince Ephraim and I were forced to surrender. We\u2019ve been held captive here in this dungeon since that black day."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Did you gain any news from your captors during that time?"}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Unfortunately, no. Not a word... Our daily meal was brought to us by servants from the neighboring village. They were instructed not to speak to us, and we heard nothing of the war. Tell me, Seth. How fares Renais?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "...Renais has fallen. King Fado... The king is dead."}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Dead... My King... My apologies, Princess Eirika. I have served you poorly...."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "You\u2019re not to blame, Sir Orson. We must look to the future, not find fault in the past. The Grado army pursues me in hopes of acquiring my bracelet. My brother wears this bracelet\u2019s twin, and he is in danger, too."}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Bracelet? Ah, I remember... Prince Ephraim still wears the bracelet. And Grado is after them? If that\u2019s the case, Princess... Perhaps you should entrust the bracelets to someone else."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Perhaps, but..."}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Give them to me or Seth. Let someone you trust guard them. If the empire desires you bracelet, you are in danger as long as you hold it. For your own safety, Your Highness, please. What say you? We must not allow the Sacred Stone of Renais to be taken."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Everything you say is true and sensible, yet..."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "... Sir Orson. I am sorry for this, but please give me your weapons."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Seth?"}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "What are you talking about, Seth? Can\u2019t you see I\u2019m unarmed? Do you think they allow prisoners weapons? What kind of injury have you taken that you suggest such foolishness?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "If I am mistaken, then I will give you all due apologies. However, there are questions I have that I cannot answer. Too many questions. Why did no enemy reinforcements come from the castle during our battle outside? Why would you escape your cell and yet leave Prince Ephraim in chains? How do you know of the tie between the bracelets and the Sacred Stone?"}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Seth, there is some misunderstanding here. I..."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "And why... Why do you conceal a blade within your doublet?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "...What?"}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "...Very well. You haven\u2019t changed a bit, Seth. If only Eirika had been alone. You, however, simply will not be deceived."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Orson! What is the\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Orson. Why did you betray Renais?"}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "My fondest with will be granted... To spend the rest of my days in the embrace of my loving wife once more..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "What are you saying?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "That\u2019s enough. You\u2019ve done well, Orson. I\u2019ll take over now. You may return to your beloved wife."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "We\u2019ve never met. I am Tirado. Loyal and talented aide to Valter, general of the Grado army."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "You\u2019re that monster\u2019s\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "And you are General Seth of Renais, yes? I thought to catch a little bird in my net, and it seems instead I\u2019ve snared a hawk."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Where is my brother?!"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "Ah, yes. Your brother. He\u2019s not here. The coward fled Lord Valter\u2019s pursuit... Somehow, he escaped the castle. And escaping under these conditions... Tch! Such stubbornness is quite annoying. It was my cunning that led us to turn this unfortunate blunder to our advantage. I spread the rumors myself. I led the villagers to believe he was our prisoner. What better trap with which to catch his sweet, devoted sister?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "My brother escaped?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "Yes, but your no-doubt emotional reunion will have to wait until the afterlife. Let\u2019s end this, shall we? First, to destroy the bridge and cut off your only avenue of escape... All soldiers to arms! Kill the princess! Take her bracelet!"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Princess Eirika, we have to get away from this place!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "But how? The bridge is gone!"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Blast!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Oh, Brother... I\u2019m so sorry... I..."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Eirika!"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Prince Ephraim, I hear sounds from the east corridor.

Kyle. Forde. Are you ready?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Yes, Your Highness."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "As always."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Lord Ephraim, we should join forces with Princess Eirika first. We should be able to reach them by way of the eastern corridor."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Come now, Kyle. That seems like a lot of trouble when we could just crush Grado between us."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "A lot of trouble? Forde, you\u2019re as insolent as you are careless! If anything were to happen to Princess Eirika, we Knights of Renais would..."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Fine, fine. I see where you stand. Calm down, before you boil over.
