We\u2019re still completely surrounded by Grado\u2019s armies... We may all die at any moment... I can\u2019t lose focus now. Has anything changed?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Unfortunately, no. On every front, our forces meet with defeat upon defeat. Rausten\u2019s knights are scattered and worn, and the enemy is closing in around them. And this accursed sand... Most of the units can\u2019t get proper footing and are being slowed down. Mounted units are having the worst time, as their movement is severely limited. Princess Eirika... I ask that you leave for safety. We\u2019ll use flying units and magic users to hold the foe here."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "No. I will not retreat. If I give up now... My brother would not forgive me. I\u2019m the princess of Renais. I will fight, either to victory or to death. Brother, I..."}, {"speaker": "Riev", "line": "Valter... You should stop playing around. If you don\u2019t\u2019 finish off Eirika\u2019s forces swiftly... Her brother\u2019s left the capital. He should be arriving here shortly. You don\u2019t want to be fighting her still when he arrives. Trust me. We are equals here in Grado\u2019s army. Would you like me to assist?"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "All you need to do is vanish, you disgusting old man. Eirika is mine. I won\u2019t let you have her. She is so strong, so beautiful...

You\u2019re bound to no country. You care nothing for friend or foe. Kill a man, claim a woman... You live for nothing more, you wretched beast. That\u2019s your strength. That\u2019s what makes you stronger than any many alive. A beast acts without remorse. Man\u2019s morality cannot win. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way... The stage is all yours, Valter. Do not fail to get the girl\u2019s bracelet. Our master demands it..."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "The time is nigh, Eirika...

You shall have both."}, {"speaker": "Knoll", "line": "Princess Eirika... She\u2019s a friend of Prince Lyon\u2019s, isn\u2019t she? I\u2019ll do what I can to help you.

We must move quickly to join forces with Eirika and her company. I\u2019m sure Seth and Innes will be there waiting for us. Let\u2019s move!"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Man", "line": "According to this ancient document... ...There was a huge battle here long, long ago. Every day, I\u2019m out here digging up ancient weapons and artifacts out of the sand. There are still more to be found, of that you can be sure. It\u2019s even said a long-dead sage left a copy of Metis\u2019s Tome out here... Oh! But I won\u2019t give that to anyone if I find it. Not a chance!"}, {"speaker": "Young Man", "line": "All the highest generals in Grado\u2019s army receive titles named after gemstones. The emperor currently has six gemstones fighting in his service. Caellach, the Tiger Eye, commands the forces fighting here. The Moonstone, Valter, is taking part in this battle as well. Glen, also known as the Sunstone, died in the mountains of Carcino. Selena Fluorspar was killed in western Grado. Duessel, whom they call Obsidian, is missing in action... The Blood Beryl, whose real name is Riev, has also gone missing. Hm? How do I know all this? I know I may look young and naive, but this is my job. I\u2019m here to pass this information along to help you out. And it\u2019s good information, too, so don\u2019t waste it."}, {"speaker": "Old Woman", "line": "Jehanna Hall...has fallen. I wonder what\u2019s become of Queen Ismaire. You there...

I have something to give you."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "What are these?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "These are called Sacred Twins. We took these relics from Grado. The dark tome Gleipnir and the black axe Garm... I doubt either of us can use them, but... Why not see if one osf your companions can use them. They might have better luck."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "They\u2019re from Grado? Does this mean Grado Keep has fallen?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Yes. I conquered the capital and defeated Emperor Vigarde. But still..."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Eirika, may I make a suggestion? We\u2019ve been able to join forces here so... How about if we all get together and trade information. There are people on both sides waiting after all."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I see unfamiliar faces among you here, so allow me to introduce myself. I am Ephraim, Eirika\u2019s brother and crown prince of Renais."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "I\u2019m Princess L\u2019Arachel of Rausten. The pleasure is mine, of course."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I\u2019ll begin by telling you of how we\u2019ve fared in our mission. We seized the Grado capital and defeated her emperor, Vigarde. Grado\u2019s capital guard have, to a man, surrendered and laid down their arms. Pockets of resistance remain, but the war itself is over."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Is that so?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "However, something remains that still bothers me. A Grado man named Knoll told me about something called a Dark Stone.?Their mages had uncovered lore that led them to craft a powerful magic stone. This Dark Stone may have been the catalyst of Grado\u2019s transformation. It seems to be the source of that black wave of energy Myrrh described. Vigarde died some time ago, but the power of the stone played him like a puppet. The war and everything that passed since was planned by the Dark Stone\u2019s master."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Well? Who is it?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...I still can\u2019t believe it, but I\u2019ll tell you nonetheless. According to Knoll, the man behind this is Lyon, the imperial prince. He said Lyon\u2019s got the Dark Stone."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Figures it\u2019s Prince Lyon..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "No, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Ephraim and I know Lyon better than that. We\u2019ve been friends for years. Lyon\u2019s not the sort of person who could start a war like this."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "But, Eirika..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I saw Lyon recently. Ephraim, you might know this, but after I abandoned the sea route to Rausten, I traveled overland with Prince Innes to Jehanna. We ran into trouble with Grado\u2019s forces, and I chanced upon Lyon. He didn\u2019t share the details of his situation, but he intimated that he was on our side. Despite all appearances, he was on our side. So Lyon..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Eirika, I also met Lyon."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Did you really?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Yes. But, he was like a completely different person. To be honest, he didn\u2019t seem to be completely...human."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Ephraim... What are you saying?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I\u2019ll tell you what I saw. I found Lyon inside Grado Keep. This is what he told me: He said he was behind this war. He said he\u2019d befriended us solely so that, one day, he could invade Renais... He told me he killed our father."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "That... That can\u2019t..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I know. I can\u2019t believe it either. I refuse to believe it. How could he have planned all this since he was a child... I simply can\u2019t fathom it. I\u2019ve heard Lyon changed when he acquired the Dark Stone. I\u2019ve no interest in magic, but... There was something uncanny about him. It seemed almost as though he were being controlled by something himself."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "The two of you might find this hard to accept, but... The state of Prince Lyon\u2019s heart matters little. He has the Dark Stone. That rock is the cause of all that\u2019s happened. The prince must be stopped."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Not yet. There is something that needs doing first."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "L\u2019Arachel?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Prince Ephraim, I do believe you felt it as well. The Dark Stone held by Prince Lyon... It exudes a malefic miasma... We might be able to handle Prince Lyon alone, but that stone is beyond our ken."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Then what do you suggest?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "The Sacred Stones."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "The Sacred Stones?"}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "We\u2019ve all heard the legend of the five Sacred Stones. They alone possessed the power to seal the Demon King away forever. So, of course, to dispel demonic magic, we must use the Sacred Stones!"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "You expect us to pin the outcome of this war on some fool legend?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...Not just the legend. We also have hope. According to Lyon, he has already seen to the destruction of Grado\u2019s, Frelia\u2019s, and Jehanna\u2019s stones."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Hm. That explains something... Grado forces attacked me, intent on destroying the Stone of Renais. If that could be the reason they chose to invade Renais... The power of the Sacred Stones may be greater than we\u2019d ever known."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Yes, exactly! If we acquire a Sacred Stone, we\u2019ll be able to oppose the Dark Stone\u2019s might!"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "But three of the stones have been shattered, and our options are few. Do you suppose that, during the invasion of Renais..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "No, I don\u2019t think so. The Stone of Renais is hidden by the power of Eirika\u2019s and my bracelets."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Grado has made many attempts to take our bracelets. Every one has failed, and so the stone may still be safe."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "We have to confirm that, of course. We\u2019ve defeated Grado, and we must turn our eyes to our homeland. It\u2019s time to return to Renais."}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "Lady Myrrh."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "Saleh..."}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "I\u2019m grateful to see you well. The people of Caer Pelyn will be overjoyed that you\u2019re safe."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "I must apologize to you, Saleh. You were there to protect me from the very start of my journey. When we were attacked, I was separated from you, and... I\u2019m so sorry to have worried you."}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "Lady Myrrh. As long as you are safe, we have nothing to be worried about. It will be my honor to serve you until your mission is complete."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "Thank you, Saleh."}]}
