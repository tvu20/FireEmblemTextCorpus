Master Saleh, is it much farther?"}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "We\u2019re close. It\u2019s only half a day ahead."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "I would ask for a moment\u2019s rest before continuing. We are all exhausted. We can go no farther today."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "No, Seth. I\u2019ll be fine. We must not be delayed by my weakness."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Whew... Hah... I didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d be climbing so high."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Whoops!"}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "...As I warned you before we set out, the footing here can be treacherous."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Do you people truly live in this place? These barren crags seem unfit for human habitation..."}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "Material wealth brings strife. We\u2019ve no need of these things. In this, we are of one mind with the Great Dragon."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "The Great Dragon?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Ah! Princess Eirika, watch out!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "More monsters... Master Saleh, do these creatures normally inhabit this region?"}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "No... Those things come from Darkling Woods. It\u2019s been a long time since they\u2019ve wandered this far afield. It\u2019s as the elder says... Evil omens take many shapes."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "It looks like those fiends have noticed us as well. We should move, Eirika."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "I\u2019m concerned for Ewan as well. I\u2019ll go with you. I hope he is safe."}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Hey! Wa-wait a moment. We can work this out... You, uh, aren\u2019t interested in talking, are you? Aaaaaa..."}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Where\u2019d all those freaks come from? I\u2019ve got to get back and warn everyone... But... I do wonder if Grandmother is all right."}], "recruit-visit": [{"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Oh, Sister!"}, {"speaker": "Tethys", "line": "Ewan! Are you all right?"}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Yeah. I tried to fight those monsters. And you know what? I killed four of \u2019em! With my magic! That\u2019s pretty good, huh?"}, {"speaker": "Tethys", "line": "What am I going to do with you? Anyway, it\u2019s not safe here. Come with me, Ewan."}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "...... You-you don\u2019t believe me... You watch and see. I\u2019ll show you how far I\u2019ve come!"}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "Ewan... You\u2019re safe."}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Oh, Teacher! It\u2019s you! You probably had to fight a ton of creatures to get here! You\u2019re the best! I hope I can study with you forever."}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "I\u2019ve told you before... My mission is my life. If you wish to learn magic, you\u2019d be better served by another."}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "No way. I wanna be just like you. Why would I go study somewhere else? Wait... You\u2019ve gotta go out on a mission again, don\u2019t you! Take me with you! I\u2019ve practiced a lot. I can already use all the magic you taught me!"}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "...... Well, you seem quite adamant. All right. You may accompany me. I think being with me might be safer than remaining on your own."}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Yahoo!"}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Ah, hello!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Ewan! How wonderful. So you\u2019re safe, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Yep. I took care of a whole mess of those things. More of \u2018em might show up at any time, so I\u2019ll just follow you to the village. That\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I guess so... It\u2019s probably safer than leaving you here by yourself. Let\u2019s stick together, Ewan."}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "Wahoo!"}, {"speaker": "Ewan", "line": "You were one of the people with my teacher, weren\u2019t you? You think I can fight at your side? I can use the magic my teacher taught me. Well, what do you say?"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Woman", "line": "I can\u2019t believe monsters have appeared here in the realm of the Great Dragon. What is this world coming to? This staff you help to protect you against the beasts. Please travel safely."}], "end": [{"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Saleh? Is that you, Saleh? Tell me, is the Great Dragon well?"}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "I\u2019m sorry, Elder. I searched to the west, but I found nothing."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Is that so... Hm? Who\u2019s that with you?"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "I am Innes, prince of Frelia. The circumstances of our journey have led us here. We would like to pass through."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Please."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Hmmm... We of Caer Pelyn have turned away from the world outside. The Great Dragon alone holds all our honor and esteem. In this place, princes and pauper are equals. Do you have a problem with that?"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "...No. I understand."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Hm... Well then, be welcomed as guests in our homes. I see some of you are injured. You should use this rock moss. We have little beyond what we need, but we will prepare food and bedding. You can rest as long as you like."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "We\u2019ve no wish to trouble you. We\u2019d just as soon pass straight through."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Don\u2019t let your pride drive you to foolishness. That girl there looks like she\u2019s ready to collapse at any moment. She\u2019s ill from the height of the mountain. Saleh, prepare some tea for the lass."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Thank you, Elder..."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Call me Grandmother, child. That is what the villages call me."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Uh... Grandmother, may I ask you a question? This Great Dragon..."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Ah, the inquisitiveness of youth. Come, lass, listen to my words. The Great Dragon is...a blessing, one that watches over all mankind. Why, in days long past, when the Demon King appeared..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Demon King? Are you speaking of the legend of the Sacred Stones? The hero Grado used the power of the five Sacred Stones to defeat and seal away\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "No, no, that\u2019s not right at all. Ah, how quickly did mankind forget its debt to the Great Dragon. To hear the story now, one would think humans alone brought about victory. That is a gross mistelling of the tale. Only through the Great Dragon\u2019s strength could the Demon King be sealed away!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "The Great Dragon and the Demon King..."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Mankind may have forgotten its debt, but the Great Dragon never forgets. It watches over the bones of the Demon King in Darkling Woods. It keeps the Demon King\u2019s dark brood from swarming the world of men. The Great Dragon\u2019s vigilance alone has kept us safe from their blind rage."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Is that so? I\u2019m... I\u2019m sorry, I never knew..."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Hmph. You don\u2019t need to know everything, but you should remember that."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yet, Grandmother, we encountered those creatures on the way here. And they have begun to appear in the land we live in as well. What does this mean?"}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Ah... You have seen the effects of the omen that has appeared in the south. There is an energy there that has fouled the air and darkened the sky. The Great Dragon left Darkling Woods and went south to investigate. We of the village wished to protect the Great Dragon, so I sent my grandson, Saleh, as long as well. But they became embroiled in battle, and the Great Dragon disappeared. Since that time, there\u2019s been no sign of the Great Dragon either here or abroad. We grew worried and directed Saleh to look for any trace of the Great Dragon. I am worried that the source of that foul energy may be responsible."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "A foul energy... From the south? Myrrh said something similar to this, too. Is the Great Dragon you speak of...one of the Manakete?"}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Manakete?!? How dare you speak so of the Great Dragon!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I-I\u2019m sorry."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "But if you\u2019ve seen the noble Myrrh, perhaps I can proceed more quickly. You see, our Great Dragon took the form of Mistress Myrrh in her travels. And you tell me that you have seen the Great Dragon yourself, lass?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yes. Myrrh was with my brother."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "What?! Where is this brother of yours!?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "He leads a force of men against Grado. Myrrh rides beside him."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Saleh, this is urgent! You must leave for Grado at once and rescue the Great Dragon!"}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "Understood. I will..."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Oh, where are you off to? If you\u2019re going to Grado, the swiftest route takes you through Jehanna. It would be to your advantage to join us in our journey for a time. It\u2019s far safer then being on your own."}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "You have a point... Mistress Eirika, protecting the Great Dragon is my duty. Please allow me to travel with you on the road ahead."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "We are in your debt, Matron."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "Not at all. All of our guidance comes from the Great Dragon. Saleh."}, {"speaker": "Saleh", "line": "Yes, I know. The road to Jehanna lies here."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Grandmother, thank you so much for everything."}, {"speaker": "Grandmother", "line": "I know you\u2019ll help the Great Dragon, but please look after Saleh as well. He\u2019s not very personable, but he\u2019s the only grandchild I have."}]}
