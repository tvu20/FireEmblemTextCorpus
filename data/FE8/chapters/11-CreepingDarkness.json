Eirika, I must tell you, I come here on the direct orders of the emperor. I\u2019m to bring to justice the rebel army leader who\u2019s been terrorizing Carcino. It\u2019s you, Eirika. They say you\u2019ve been murdering innocents."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "What? Wait! What do you mean? I..."}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "...If you have something to say, I would hear it. I know all too well that Grado has robbed you of your homeland, but even so... I do not believe revenge could drive a woman like you to such depths. And yet... here you are in Carcino with a small army under your command. And the emperor tells us that you massacred everyone in Port Kiris."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "That... That\u2019s a lie! I could never..."}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "Go on."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "...This is ridiculous. Believe what you want. Could one of the legendary Imperial Three honestly be as stupid as this?"}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "...What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Carcino betrayed Frelia and set a pack of mercenary dogs to kill me. And you paint Eirika a rebel instigator? It\u2019s an absurd farce. Your emperor commits horrors, and you believe Eirika is a criminal?"}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "...What are you saying?"}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "You truly are blind, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re one of the Imperial Three, and yet you can\u2019t see your emperor\u2019s plan?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "That\u2019s enough, Innes. There\u2019s no need to provoke him. General Glen, we\u2019ve told you what we know to be true, what we\u2019ve seen firsthand. We don\u2019t want to fight you... But if you push us, we will drive you back to Grado with your tail between your legs."}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "...I see. You...are more observant than you know. I am ignorant of the emperor\u2019s designs. General Duessel and I both questioned the wisdom of this war. And if you really are innocent of the crimes attributed to you... Why would His Majesty lie to us? I must know the answer."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "So, you...believe us?"}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "The Princess Eirika I met long ago was kind and merciful in spirit. You\u2019ve faced relentless hardship, and yet that selfsame spirit remains true. ...Let\u2019s put our fight aside for now. I will learn the truth. Then I will once again perform the duties of my office. If you have lied to me today, I will hound you to the very grave itself."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Very well..."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Glen. Where do you think you\u2019re going?"}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "Valter..."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Tsk, tsk. What am I to make of this? Those little birds I saw flitting away into the mountains looked vaguely familiar. What do you suppose would happen if it were known you let Eirika escape?"}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "Do as you will. I\u2019m returning to the capital. I have questions for the emperor. Clear the path, Valter."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Hold on now. No reason to rush off, is there? After all, this is where you\u2019re going to die. See?"}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "...What are you babbling about?"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Heh heh... We were a grand trio\u2013the Imperial Three: You, Duessel, and me. But my place among you was stolen, and I was exiled from Grado."}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "You slaughtered people who had no intention of fighting. The emperor\u2019s punishment was just and warranted."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Heh heh...heh heh heh... After my fall from glory, only desire kept me alive. Desire for revenge. My hatred burned so fierce that I was only barely able to keep my sanity. That hatred keeps me warm still today. Oh, how it burns..."}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Hear me, Glen, wyvern general of the Imperial Three. I live for battle. I crave it. I have no need for peace. That is why you must die."}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "Cur! You\u2019re mad!"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "A battle between generals... Sends the spirit soaring, eh? Come, Glen! Entertain me! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"}, {"speaker": "Glen", "line": "Urrgh..."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Go. The small fish are yours."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Heh heh... This is merely the beginning. Endless battle, war without end... Heh heh... ha hahahahahaha!"}]}
