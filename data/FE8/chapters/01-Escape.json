You must return to Castle Frelia."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "I can\u2019t! Not yet. We haven\u2019t found Eirika and her companions yet. Eirika is my friend, and she needs my help. I won\u2019t abandon her. Oh, I know!

They\u2019re tenacious, but they have no hope of stopping our advance."}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "What are your orders, sir?"}, {"speaker": "Breguet", "line": "Ha! Orders? You just stand here and watch. I\u2019ll crush them myself!"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "As you command, sir."}, {"speaker": "Breguet", "line": "Ha! That\u2019s what happens when you face my lance!"}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "St-stop right there! Call off your forces and turn back, or you\u2019ll have me to deal with!"}, {"speaker": "Breguet", "line": "Is that so? And who might you be?"}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Who\u2013? I am Tana, Princess of Frelia. I will not permit you to abuse my country any longer."}, {"speaker": "Breguet", "line": "Frelia\u2019s royal brat, huh? How convenient..."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Leave this castle immediately. If you harm me, my father and brother will chase you to the earth\u2019s end."}, {"speaker": "Breguet", "line": "Yes, I\u2019ve heard of how King Hayden dotes on his precious little daughter. Let\u2019s see how true that is. You\u2019ll make us a fine hostage, my dear. Seize the girl and lock her up!"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Right away, sir!"}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "No! Let me go!"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Seth, look..."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "I see it. It seems like Grado\u2019s army has already reached Frelia. Princess, this place is perilous. We should bypass Mulan altogether and head straight to the castle."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "But we can\u2019t just ignore this... You were there when Renais was invaded... You saw what I saw. You saw how the people suffered at the hands of Grado\u2019s soldiers. Homes were destroyed, possessions stolen, women kidnapped... Anyone who resisted was executed without question, without hesitation."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Please, Seth. I can\u2019t allow that to happen here. I don\u2019t want to see any more people harmed by Grado\u2019s atrocities."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "All right, Princess. I understand. Perhaps we can retake Mulan. But, Princess, you must act with caution. Your people need you, too."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Of course, Seth. Come on!

Watch yourself."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "That knight encamped at the castle was wearing the finest armor I\u2019ve seen. It looked like it could turn aside almost any blade you swing at it.

I\u2019m grateful to see that you\u2019re safe and home again! You\u2019ve no idea how I worried when I heard you were under attack at Border Mulan. You are not to leave again without my permission.

He fights on? Even now?"}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "Yes. My pegasus knights bought this information at a great price. Even though Renais has fallen, he charges into the enemy\u2019s heart. He is truly Fado\u2019s son... What a valiant youth. I wish I knew whether he remains unharmed, but I do not."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "King Hayden, I thank you for your offer, but I cannot stay. I intend to ride to my brother\u2019s side with reinforcements."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "I cannot allow it. I know how you feel, but this plan is suicide. I would be betraying Fado\u2019s memory if I allowed any harm to befall you. Stay here. Rest and mourn.

My brother, he is a part of me... I cannot rest here in peace while he risks his life."}, {"speaker": "Hayden", "line": "No. Renais has no more army. Grado\u2019s forces decimated it. I wish Frelia could provide you with support, with soldiers, but... My son, Innes, is on his way to meet the empire\u2019s forces. We cannot spare a single brigade.

But I have no choice. Don\u2019t you see, Tana? I have to go."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Eirika... Oh, why is this happening? What\u2019s gone wrong with the world?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Tana..."}, {"speaker": "Tana", "line": "Why would Grado invade? Emperor Vigarde is a man of peace. His people adore him. And you and Ephraim are friends with Prince Lyon, are you not? What could be behind this madness? Why is this happening..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I have no answers for you, Tana. I don\u2019t want to believe it, but the reality is that we are at war. If I do nothing, I may lose my brother as well as my father. This is why I have to fight. It\u2019s the only answer I have."}]}
