You\u2019ll be hard pressed to ready that for a proper burial. But listen, Cormag. There\u2019s no reason for you to grieve.

Who!?"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Glen\u2019s last orders were to find and subdue Eirika. \u2018Tis a pity I was delayed. I arrived to witness the final blow myself.

Speak!"}, {"speaker": "Messenger", "line": "Yes, Your Highness! Frelia has invaded Carcino and engaged the traitor Pablo\u2019s mercenary army.

They must be planning to join with the Grado forces there."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Pardon me, but I must know... Do you have word of my brother?"}, {"speaker": "Messenger", "line": "Yes.

He is now marching onward toward the imperial capital."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Toward the capital..."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "That fool... Emperor Vigarde himself and his imperial guard are in the capital. It\u2019s too strong a force... Even for Ephraim."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "No... I believe in my brother.

Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "They should be arriving anytime now. Are you ready, Aias?"}, {"speaker": "Aias", "line": "Mm. Everything\u2019s in place. This Princess Eirika supposedly defeated General Glen. I wonder... If it\u2019s true, then she\u2019s a foe to be reckoned with, and no doubt. Still, there\u2019s no reason to worry. I can best her. I know it."}, {"speaker": "Caellach", "line": "You\u2019ll take her, I\u2019ve no fear. We fought as mercenaries together, and I know what you\u2019re capable of.
