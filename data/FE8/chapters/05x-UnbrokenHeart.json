It\u2019s Master Valter."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "What\u2019s the situation, Tirado? You have captured Ephraim, haven\u2019t you?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "No. Prince Ephraim still fights in the lands north of Renvall."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "And why is that? What has happened to all those mercenaries you hired?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "They\u2019ve proven to be less then adequate. Ephraim\u2019s clever. His band strikes quickly and then vanishes into the woods. We more than double his numbers, and yet he uses the terrain wisely to fight us. He has no army\u2013just a small force of knights loyal to Renais. Prince Ephraim\u2019s reputation as a superb strategist would seem to be well earned."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Hmm... How interesting. The lad\u2019s beginning to whet my appetite. Tirado...Bring him to me as quickly as you can, will you?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "As you command. Just grant me an army, and I\u2019ll bring him down swiftly."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "What sort of plan do you have?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "Master, I am your loyal adjutant, and you are my general. For you, my lord, I have many plans ready and waiting."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Really? Well then, let me hear them."}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "Very well. First, you and I will leave this fort and head north. Then, we will find Prince Ephraim in his leafy playpen."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "But he\u2019s not easily found, is he?"}, {"speaker": "Tirado", "line": "Do not worry. At Prince Ephraim\u2019s side is... a friend, shall we say. When the time is right, our friend will move on our behalf..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Forde, how are we on supplies and equipment?"}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "It\u2019s not looking good. Our weapons are in bad shape, and we\u2019re running low on food. We can probably restock at a nearby village, but\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "No, that\u2019s not an option. We\u2019re in enemy territory. I will not involve innocents if I can avoid it."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Yeah, I knew you\u2019d say that. I mean, it\u2019s because of stuff like that that we\u2019ve stuck with you so far. But eventually, we do need to face reality. What are we going to do?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Word of mouth has it that the invasion of Renais has progressed quite far. I\u2019ve heard that the capital has fallen."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Hm...So soon... Still, my father is in the capital, and he won\u2019t surrender easily. Forde, Kyle. Our mission here is to harry the troops, to distract their eye. Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to give my father and Eirika time to escape. Kyle, have you heard anything from Orson? I sent him ahead to scout."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "No word yet, and it\u2019s about time he returned..."}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Reporting in, Prince Ephraim. I can confirm Grado presence at several points around our camp. Also, a large battalion of soldiers has been dispatched from Renvall. We shouldn\u2019t tarry here any longer than necessary..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I see."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Seems as though we\u2019ve certainly caught Grado\u2019s eye this time. Should we retreat back to the capital, Prince Ephraim?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "No. We press onward. We\u2019re going to capture Renvall."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Wh-what?!?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "So this is Renvall, is it? All right, let\u2019s go."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Um...Are you...sure you\u2019re quite sane, Prince Ephraim? We\u2019ve an entire army after us, and you want to charge their stronghold?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Forde! Watch your tongue! This is our prince you\u2019re addressing!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Kyle, please, it\u2019s all right. We\u2019ve heard nothing from home, So what harm could a little reckless besieging cause?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Prince Ephraim..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Don\u2019t worry. I haven\u2019t lost all sense of self-preservation. Renvall holds an important place in Grado\u2019s national defense. If we can get the upper hand and take control of it, then Grado will waste many valuable soldiers trying to take it back I hope our attack proves useful to my father and Eirika."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "I understand what you\u2019re saying, but... can we do it with our current strength?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Every soldier in this area is trying to find us. The enemy has us vastly outnumbered. Attacking the castle is a ridiculous idea. If the enemy thinks the same... then we may have our opening."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "You have a point. I\u2019m sure Renvall won\u2019t expect us to attack with these numbers. Either way, we can\u2019t run forever. And we\u2019re running out of supplies. What\u2019ve we got to lose? Shall we get ready to go?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Yes. If we don\u2019t move quickly, we may never get another chance. Trust me. I don\u2019t pick fights I cannot win."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Yes, sir!"}, {"speaker": "Zonta", "line": "An attack? By Ephraim\u2019s troops? To arms! Prince Ephraim\u2019s circled around and brought the fight to us! If we capture the prince here, we can line our pockets with gold! Do you understand? We\u2019ll be rich!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Orson."}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Yes..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Your wounds still haven\u2019t healed from that last battle, have they? Don\u2019t push yourself. If we\u2019re defeated, you must return to Frelia. Understood?"}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Understood..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Let\u2019s go! Kyle! Forde!"}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Zonta", "line": "Do you truly think you can take us with those numbers? Imbecile! You\u2019ll learn the error of your ways."}, {"speaker": "Zonta", "line": "L-lord Tirado...It can\u2019t be... Were we...merely pawns?"}], "end": [{"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "We\u2019ve secured the entire castle. You were brilliant, Prince Ephraim! What a plan! What a battle!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I estimate at least half of the enemy troops are in the field. We took the castle, but we don\u2019t have the manpower to hold it in a siege. There\u2019s no point in lingering here. Let\u2019s continue on to Grado Keep."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "Prince Ephraim, things have taken a turn for the worse. I took a look around the castle perimeter... We\u2019re surrounded."}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Grado\u2019s sent reinforcements? So quickly...?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "What should we do?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...... We must escape!"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "So, you\u2019ve captured Renvall, have you? And with such a small force! Impressive! You\u2019ve earned your reputation. I must say, I quite admire your work. I take it you\u2019re the leader of this pack\u2013the misguided Prince Ephraim."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I am."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "I\u2019m General Valter, the Moonstone of Grado\u2019s Imperial Army. Catching up to you has caused me no small amount of trouble. We\u2019ve reduced your wretched home of Renais to ruin, and yet... you and your little band of bravos continue to be a thorn in our side. But that all ends here."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "We\u2019ll see...You claim you\u2019ve taken the capital of Renais... Tell me, how did you know I would attack Renvall?"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Ha ha... Patience. You\u2019ll have your answer soon enough. Now, be good lads, and drop your weapons, will you?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "Prince Ephraim, let us attack!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Listen to me, Ephraim. You\u2019re a smart man. You know it\u2019s futile to fight me. You cannot win. You cannot escape. Accept the reality of your situation, and surrender to me."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Surrender?"}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Heh heh heh... That\u2019s right. If you do, I\u2019ll let you live. I hold your life in the palm of my hand. Do not test my good humor. Now, come over here, bend your knee, and beg for your life. Show me how Renais dogs grovel."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I think not."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "You said your name was Valter, didn\u2019t you? Well, I\u2019m sorry, Valter, but I don\u2019t have time to waste playing games with you. So, we\u2019re going to knock you louts about a bit and then make our way out of here."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "Fool... Have you gone mad? Do you truly believe you can fight your way past my wyvern knights?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Watch and see. I don\u2019t pick fights I can\u2019t win. Kyle, Forde. Are you ready?"}, {"speaker": "Kyle", "line": "My life has been yours since the moment I took my chivalric vows."}, {"speaker": "Forde", "line": "It\u2019s moments like these that keep me by your side, my prince."}, {"speaker": "Valter", "line": "What idiotic wretches you are... Prepare yourselves to be destroyed utterly!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "We break to the east. GO!"}]}
