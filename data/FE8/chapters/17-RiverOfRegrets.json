Do you really think you can tap into its power?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Mm... My research isn't complete yet, but there's no mistaking the power the Sacred Stones contain. And the Stone of Grado seems especially responsive to my dark magic. I suppose it's because it contains both sacred and demonic properties. Regardless, if I can just press my studies a little harder... Well, I think I might be able to use it to heal my father's illness. If that works there's no telling how many other people I can help as well."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Do you think this is wise? The power contained within the stones is beyond our understanding... My father tells me that the stones posses a power not to be trifled with."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Uh-huh... Father MacGregor is also against it. That's why they still won't give me direct access to the Stone of Grado. For the time being, I've made do with the radiant energies surrounding it. They're nothing compared to the raw power of the stone itself, but... If I can show Father MacGregor some real progress, perhaps one day..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Using the Sacred Stones to study magic..."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Ephraim, Eirika, what do you two think? Using the divine power of the Sacred Stones in this way... You don't think it's a very good idea, do you?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "...It's just that I know nothing at all about magic. I would that there were some way I could help you, but I simply can't. But, Lyon, I've seen how hard you've worked to help others. I know how much you want the power to make others happy. I know these things, and because I know you, I trust your intentions."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Ephraim..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "If you hope to use the power of the Sacred Stones for good, I trust you can. I'm behind you all the way."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I'agree with Ephraim entirely. You spend every night in the library, studying cures for your father's illness. The power of the Sacred Stones is too powerful to be used for personal gain. But you, Lyon... I think you'll be fine. You're the kindest person I know."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Thanks, both of you. Hearing those words means a lot to me. Actually\u2014and this hasn't been made public yet\u2014but...

A while back, a fire ravaged Serafew, and a little girl got trapped in the flames. Her burns were terrible: not even healing staves were able to cure her injuries. But just a sliver of the stone's power restored her life and healed her wounds. We saved the that girl's life, Ephraim! Oh, if you could have seen the tears of joy in her mother's eyes!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "You really did it, huh? You are special, Lyon. Congratulations!"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Well.. thanks. But there's still so much more to be done. I am happy, though. To be honest, I just want to be able to help people. I want to put the ancient magics to use for common good... That's how I feel."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Lyon..."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "And as my research moves forward, I'll be able to do much more, too. We have only the barest understanding of how dark magic operates. Maybe we can use it not only to heal wounds, but also to stop diseases... What if we can read the future, predict disasters, move mountains!?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Hold on, Lyon. You can't take too much on yourself all at once. What good is helping people, if you sacrifice yourself to do it?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Oh... Yes, of course. Sorry. I got carried away."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "You have a soft heart, Lyon. I bet you haven't taken any real time off at all. So this is what we're going to do.
