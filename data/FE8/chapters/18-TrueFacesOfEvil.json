Endless numbers of gorgon eggs stud the forbidding landscape."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "L'Arachel... May I ask your advice?"}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "What is it, Eirika? There's no need to be so formal."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "It's about Lyon... My brother was right. Lyon's been possessed by the Demon King. He... He's no longer the Lyon I once knew. But I can't help feeling... there must be some way to bring him back."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Please help me, L'Arachel. I want to save him. Rausten is the spiritual heart of Magvel. They keep the ancient lore. You're their princess. You must know something about the demons of legend. Is there anything that can save Lyon?"}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "I'm so sorry, Eirika. To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to aid him."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "That can't be! There must be something! Any clue, no matter how slight..."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "Our oldest legends tell us just this... Only one person has ever been able to shake off the Demon King's domination. Rausten's founder, Saint Latona the sure-hearted, shattered his fetters. If one possesses a strength of will beyond that of normal men... Only then can one throw off the shackles of the Demon King. But you saw it for yourself, Eirika, with your own two eyes. Your friend Lyon's body has already been claimed by the Demon King. Once it's gone that far, there's nothing that can be done. When the Demon King takes over someone, he devours his spirit, their very soul. Even if his hold on Lyon's body could be released, that body would have no soul. There is no power in Rausten... not even the Sacred Stone... that can perform so great a miracle as to restore a shattered soul."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "But... Lyon..."}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "Eirika... I understand how you feel, but the prince is gone. The Lyon you knew no longer exists. It's more important now that you care for yourself. If we pursue the Demon King, we're likely to suffer for it. I want you to return to Rausten Palace and rest yourself."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Thank you, L'Arachel. However, I must stay with the company. I have to believe there's something I can do to help him. Lyon was always so kind. He wanted nothing more than to help people. It's too terrible to picture him imprisoned by the Demon King. Imprisoned... with no hope of salvation."}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "This way! The enemy went into the recesses of this valley."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Brother. Do you smell something?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Smell?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yes.

There are so many..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Brother! The eggs! They've started to hatch!"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "No... He's led us into a trap! Watch out! Everyone, steer clear of those eggs!"}, {"speaker": "L'Arachel", "line": "E-Ephraim. I must ask that you slow down! If you travel so swiftly, we cannot keep up."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I'm riding ahead. I can't waste any more time.

Rausten is the spiritual heart of Magvel. They keep the ancient lore. You're their princess. You must know something about the demons of legend. I do not need consolation or peace of mind.

Return Lyon now!"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "I'm afraid there's no hope of that. You see, I've devoured him. Bite by bite, slowly. How I savored it. Nothing remains but this suit of flesh I wear.

Could it be...you..."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Is that you...Lyon?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Uh-huh... That\u2019s right. It\u2019s me, Lyon, Prince of Grado. I\u2019m not the Demon King. Sorry, Ephraim. That whole thing about the Demon King eating my soul and me dying?

I\u2019ve always hated you. I\u2019ve always looked up to you. I wanted to be just like you. Then one day I realized... Someone like me could never become someone like you. You and Eirika are...overpowering. You blinded me with your radiance. How could I live in your shadows and not seethe with jealousy?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Lyon..."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Before I ever touched the Dark Stone... I had a vision. A vision of the future of Magvel. I saw myself standing with two roads stretched out before me. One led to the Demon King, devouring both my body and soul.

And I, well.. ...Gaa...urgh."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Lyon!"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "Then I acquired the Dark Stone. The Demon King began to eat my soul and corrupt my flesh. I almost vanished beneath the Demon King\u2019s mantle. The I remembered you... My mind blazed into wakefulness. All at once, my mind shouted out, I will not be devoured! Just as I was about to lose myself to the Demon King. I was able to drive him back. The Demon King\u2019s desires are simple\u2013foul, but uncomplicated. He wants nothing but the destruction, conquest, and subjugation of man. These shallow desires are nothing to the dreams of the human heart. And of the two roads I had seen, I chose the latter."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "....."}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "But I didn\u2019t want to appear before you here in the role of Lyon.

The Demon King is me."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "You lie... It can\u2019t be. It\u2019s not possible. Lyon was... My friend was kind and caring... He was a good person... But you...

Ephraim, listen to me. Ten days from now... When the moon is swallowed by shadow... In Darkling Woods, I will perform a ceremony... Through this ceremony, I will gain immense power. Power not change not only Grado, but the entire world."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Change...the world?"}, {"speaker": "Lyon", "line": "But after that... I cannot save myself.
