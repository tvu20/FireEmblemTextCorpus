So desolated?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Spies report that the castle is being held by the traitor Orson."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Orson... In retrospect, I realize he\u2019s been acting odd for a while now. He seemed so... dispirited."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "His wife passed away some six months back. The loss may have been too much for his mind to bear. His love and devotion for his wife were well known among the knights."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Now, he sits alone in the king\u2019s former bedchambers. He makes no effort to govern. No one is allowed to enter the chambers, and he takes no meals."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "What could he possibly be doing?"}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "I do not know. The spies had no insight into his behavior. He does nothing to deal with the dark creatures and bandits roaming the land. Reports say all of Renais is engulfed in chaos. Region after region is revolting, and Orson\u2019s reign is already crumbling. Left alone, it may very well collapse under the weight of its own neglect."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "We cannot allow the situation to reach that point. We\u2019re going home, Eirika. We\u2019re going to the castle."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I hear you, Ephraim."}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "Um, Ephraim?"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "What is it, Myrrh?"}, {"speaker": "Myrrh", "line": "I-I will fight with you.

I simply want to help."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "All right. I understand. But you must make me a promise. You are never to stray from our sides.

What do you think he\u2019s doing back there? I\u2019ve heard lots of bizarre rumors from the master of the mess hall. ...Do you think he needs help? Could he be dangerous?"}, {"speaker": "Guard", "line": "I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m here for the money. As long as I get paid, I\u2019m happy.

I did as you asked. I betrayed Renais. My promise has been kept."}, {"speaker": "Riev", "line": "Heh heh heh?How long are you going to continue this nonsense? Eirika and Ephraim have joined forces. Even now, their united forces march toward the capital, toward you."}, {"speaker": "Orson", "line": "Eirika?"}, {"speaker": "Riev", "line": "You can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll forgive you for your treachery, can you? I expect the sin of your betrayal has shattered you entire family\u2019s name.

That can\u2019t happen\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Riev", "line": "Heh heh heh! Oh, but it can, and it will. Unless you do something to stop it. You understand what is required, don\u2019t you?

We can repair the castle, and what was stolen, we can do without.

Our bracelets, they\u2019re..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "What is this? Are they reacting to the light of the stone? Eirika\u2019s Lunar Brace and Ephraim\u2019s Solar Brace glow in response to the Sacred Stone. With the power of the bracelets, the twins can now change classes."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "I can\u2019t believe the bracelets contain so much power..."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "I wonder if Father anticipated all of this long ago. When I was growing up, I never thought about becoming king. I only wanted to be a good soldier, a good warrior. The best on the battlefield. Father never understood what I wanted, but... I never understood him, either."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "It was the same when Grado invaded Renais. I should have stayed home to defend the kingdom... Instead, I raced off to fight for personal glory."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Brother... I don\u2019t think you know how well Father understood your feelings. When I last saw him, he was concerned for nothing but our safety..."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Eirika is correct. King Fado asked after your exploits every day. He always told me what a fine king you would one day make."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "Father..."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Now Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika. Please follow me. The Sacred Twins of Renais should be near the stone\u2019s reliquary."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "Ah, here we go. This lance can only be one of the Sacred Twins of Renais. Please, Prince Ephraim, take this sacred relic and feel its weight."}, {"speaker": "Ephraim", "line": "So this is one of our Sacred Twin relics, is it? I\u2019ve never seen them. Look, there\u2019s a name inscribed here. Siegmund, the Flame Lance."}, {"speaker": "Seth", "line": "And this blade is sister to the lance, the other Sacred Twin of legend. Princess Eirika, if you would?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Of course. There\u2019s a name carved here as well. Sieglinde, the Thunder Blade..."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "These are the ancient weapons of our ancestors\u2013the weapons of heroes. They were enshrined generations ago, to be used only by the king... and only in times of dire need. Such an awful power they possess, and yet we need them to restore peace. I\u2019ve seen enough of the horrors of war, but I can\u2019t turn my back on it. If we merely turn our eyes away, we surrender our world to atrocity. And so, I must fight. I\u2019ll do whatever I must do to bring back the peace we once knew."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "What is happening? Have you found the Sacred Stone?"}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "Yes. Here it is..."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Wow! It truly is spectacular. This goes some way to brighten the dark shadows that loom over us."}, {"speaker": "Innes", "line": "Our countries? Sacred Stones have been shattered by Grado\u2019s men. The Stone of Renais is our last remaining weapon."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "No, it\u2019s not. You have forgotten the stone of my beloved Rausten. Remember, there were five Sacred Stones for our five nations. The Stones of Grado, Frelia, and Jehanna are gone, but hope is not. We have the Stone of Renais, after all, and that of Rausten is safe. Our road is clear, my friends. I must guide you to Rausten."}, {"speaker": "Eirika", "line": "You\u2019re right. L\u2019Arachel, we\u2019re counting on you to lead the way."}, {"speaker": "L\u2019Arachel", "line": "Of course. And you will all be welcome to stay in the palace. And, Eirika, you shall be my guest in my own private quarters! Let us be on our way."}]}
