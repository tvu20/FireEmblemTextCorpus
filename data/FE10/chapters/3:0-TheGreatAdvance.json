You sure you want to take our side?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The Laguz Alliance is in the right, Ranulf. The senate is actively ignoring you, and worse, they're murdering your messengers.

We were very fortunate during the Mad King's War, but it was a close call. Can we count on being lucky again? Already, we're talking about a war between Begnion, the largest nation on Tellius, and three laguz countries. That's half the known world, and it's not over yet. Have they all forgotten about the possibility of the dark god's rebirth?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Hello, all. Sorry to interrupt. Lady Titania, Soren, you're both very perceptive. I'd expect nothing less from the deputy commander and the strategist of the Greil Mercenaries. You don't have to worry, though. The whole situation is under control."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "The medallion is under the protection of the Serenes royal family.

Ages ago, the heron leader Lehran sealed the dark god within the medallion.

We'll be relying heavily on the power of the Greil Mercenaries. I'm counting on you all."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Understood.

I\u2019m not going to repeat the same mistake I made with Dad! I don\u2019t want you to die while I\u2026 while I\u2019m somewhere else. It was horrible\u2026 It ate me up from the inside.

When we\u2019re out on the battlefield, stay where I can see you. It\u2019ll put my mind at ease."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "I promise, Ike."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Ah! Ike, beorc hero! How are you?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Pretty good."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Giffca and Ranulf told me about you.

Do you think I should make more?"}, {"speaker": "Lethe", "line": "Us beasts have a healthy appetite, of course. On top of that, we have General Skrimir and Ike. \u2026Yeah.

He couldn\u2019t possibly eat as much as someone from the beast tribe. Well, maybe he would. Actually\u2026 He most definitely would."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Yeah. Especially the ribs and steaks."}, {"speaker": "Lethe", "line": "Mordecai. How about we go hunt for more game?"}, {"speaker": "Mordecai", "line": "Right!"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "There probably aren\u2019t enough herbs to flavor everything.
