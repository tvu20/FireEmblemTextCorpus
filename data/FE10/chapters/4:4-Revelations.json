Shortly after that light turned everyone to stone, I had a really strange dream. I don't remember it very well, but it was like there was a voice in my head, whispering encouragement. When I woke up, I knew what I had to do. I knew that everyone who hadn't been petrified was heading to the Tower of Guidance, and from there we'd all be saved."}, {"speaker": "Muarim", "line": "I had the same dream.

I guess it's a lot like the dream you described."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "We laguz are pretty intuitive. I feel it in my blood that Yune is the goddess of our ancestors."}, {"speaker": "Tormod", "line": "All right. That makes it a little easier to come to grips with."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are you feeling any better?"}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Yes, much. Sorry if I worried you. That was quite a shock."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No problem... Can we talk about it? I'd like to know about you and that man..."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Yes, Hetzel... It was some time ago now, a little while before the Serenes Massacre..."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "I was alone outside of the forest. There, I was found and captured by beorc slave traders. The slavers sold me at auction, and the winner was Lord Hetzel. I didn't know until later, but the bidding for me among the senators was extremely competitive. Lord Hetzel actually spent much of his fortune on my purchase."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "After he took me home, I fell deathly ill, mostly just from desperation. Lord Hetzel was deeply moved by my plight... He brought me to a temple and spent many days nursing me back to health. I have no doubt that he saved my life, but my wings never fully recovered. I haven't been able to fly since. Lord Hetzel felt terrible... Do you know what he told me? He said, \"Once you fully recover, you can return to the forest.\" Members of the heron clan, we can look inside people's hearts. I knew the truth of what Lord Hetzel said... He was being absolutely honest. I knew I could trust him from that moment on."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Then... The Serenes Massacre. I didn't need to be told. I would have felt the suffering of that many of my brethren from anywhere in the world. Lord Hetzel never said anything, but I knew that the senators had murdered the apostle and blamed my clan. Because of the monstrous ambition of a handful of evil men, my entire race was burned to ash."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Rafiel..."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Late that night, I returned to the temple. Something happened to me there... Some sort of force took hold of me... The next thing I knew... I was lying in the sand. If Queen Nailah hadn't come, I would have died right there. I didn't even realize how far I was from my dear home."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So Duke Hetzel is both your savior and your enemy."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Hetzel was not directly involved, nor did he give orders to those who were. Something about him still troubles me, though... Whenever I think of him, I feel chaos boiling up from his heart. ...I sense it in myself, as well. I have the same feelings welling up in me. I suppose that's why I can accept it in him."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Your people, the remaining heron tribe... They've also changed. King Tibarn has said many times that Reyson and Leanne are far from typical herons."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Yes, I was surprised when we met again. They're both so strong...and vitality seems to shine forth from within them."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It makes you wonder if chaos is really all bad, doesn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "I am starting to think that what the world needs is a balance between order and chaos. What do you think?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I don't know.

I don\u2019t mean to leave you out of the conversation."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No, that\u2019s fine. I would have been confused either way. I didn\u2019t know you could speak the ancient language."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "It\u2019s Hatari\u2019s common language. I would never have known about the Tellius language if I hadn\u2019t met Rafiel."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The Tellius language?"}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "You don\u2019t know? The language we are using right now is called the Tellius language. You call it modern speech, I suppose."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Oh, I see."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "Long ago, beorc created the Old Tongue. The ancient speech is what we laguz call it. The language was too difficult for the laguz to master. So the language of Tellius was created in its place."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh. I\u2019ve never heard that before. The only people I\u2019m aware of who know the ancient speech are the heron laguz. I think Nasir of Goldoa said he could read it. Among beorc, only mages know how to use it, and that\u2019s only for spells."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "Well, the laguz who live a long time, such as dragons and herons, have all the time in the world to learn it. Beorc probably left the ancient speech behind in favor of a newer and improved language, with the exception of spells."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That makes sense, I suppose. Mordecai once told me that speech lets you avoid fighting when it\u2019s not a good idea. He said that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to know many languages."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "Did he, now? Volug, did you hear that? You can learn the language of Tellius with Mordecai."}, {"speaker": "Volug", "line": "...I will... I...will try."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "He understands what you\u2019re saying, for the most part. It\u2019s the speaking that\u2019s the hard part for him."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You don\u2019t need to feel obligated. I mean, it isn\u2019t like I can understand ancient speech."}, {"speaker": "Volug", "line": "(Here, I want you to have this.) Um, here... Take."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Oh, I understand. Thanks."}, {"speaker": "Volug", "line": "(It\u2019s about time!)"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I think I understood that.

As long as you have the desire to learn, words will soon follow."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I see. I\u2019ll try to learn a little ancient speech from now on, too.
