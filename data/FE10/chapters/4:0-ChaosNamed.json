Pleased to meet you!"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Yune?! What did you do to Micaiah?!"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Micaiah is here with me now. She knows that you'll never save the petrified ones without me. So, she let me use her body to talk to you."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "All right. Let me ask you this, Yune. If you don't have a body of your own, what the heck are you?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "I've been asleep inside the medallion for a long, long time. Longer than any of you can imagine. But the galdr woke me up."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Lehran's Medallion? Are you the dark god who was sealed inside it?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Hmmm...\"dark god.\" \"Dark god\"... No, I'm pretty sure I'm not one of those. I am neither holy nor base, neither angel nor devil. I am...freedom. Chaos. Transformation. Future. Mystery. I am Yune."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I don't care what you're called. Was it you who turned everyone into stone?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "No, that wasn't me. I haven't done much of anything. I just woke up, so I don't have that kind of power just yet. That was Ashera's doing. It was her judgment upon this world."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Nonsense! Holy Ashera would never harm us! She protects us at all times and guides us toward the right path."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "You've got it all wrong, little meatling. Ashera is neither kind nor loving to the beings of this world. Neither is she holy nor base, angel nor devil. She is...restriction. Order. Stability. Past. Certainty. Restraint. She is Ashera."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I don't understand... Why would the goddess Ashera try to destroy us? If anyone's going to kill us all, shouldn't it be you, the dark god who was sealed inside the medallion?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "You called me a dark god again! How would you like it if I called you a dark bag of organs? I don't want to talk to you anymore!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Instead...I'll talk to...you. Yes! You're the one I'll talk to!"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Me?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Ashera has always hated me, but I like her. You've got some of her in you. So, I'll talk to you."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Oh, OK... So... You're Yune?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "That's right. I'm Yune. Ashera is order. I am chaos. We are sisters, but opposite in all things. We're linked to one another, though. When I sleep, Ashera sleeps. When I wake, Ashera wakes."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Oh, then you're...a...a goddess? I-I'm so sorry! Please forgive my insolence! I've been talking down to you like you're a little kid!"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "No, no, it's fine. Talk to me however you like. You don't have to stand on ceremony with me."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Well... All right. If you insist... So, you were sealed inside the medallion, but now you're inside Micaiah?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "That's right."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "...And the goddess Ashera was the one who turned all the beorc and laguz into stone. Oh! Are you here to tell us how to save them? Wait, I get it! You were the one who spoke to me! You said, \"Wake me with the galdr of release, not with the spirit of war.\""}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Yes, I did! I'm so glad you understood! You're so very clever! Of course, I was hoping, by sending you that message, I would stop all of this from happening."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "We're running out of time, so I'll explain quickly. Long, long ago, your ancestors made a promise to Ashera. They promised they would start no wars among all the nations for at least one thousand years. If this promise was broken, then Ashera would destroy the world and try again with a new one. Despite this promise, you bone-cages kept fighting each other. Eventually, war and conflict spread throughout the world. When Ashera woke up, she cast down her judgment upon those who failed to keep her promise."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I still don't understand. Why would it make a difference whether you were woken up by the galdr or by the spirit of chaos? How were you planning to stop Ashera from passing down her judgment?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "I'm not talking to you!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Oh, by all that's-- Would you stop acting like a child?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Please forgive my brother, Yune. We want to save the people who were turned to stone. We need you to tell us how. It did matter that we woke you with the galdr of release, right?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "First of all, you should understand that, because of our link, waking me is the same as waking Ashera. Now, if Ashera had been awakened by the spirit of chaos, none of us would be standing here right now. By the terms of the promise, she was just supposed to destroy the world. No hesitation, no discussion. But if she was awakened by the galdr of release, she was supposed to consult with me first. She wasn't supposed to pass down her judgment until she heard from me. Ashera went ahead and turned everyone into stone without asking me. That's so unfair! I'll show her, though. I'll turn them all back somehow! The problem is that I can't do this by myself. I need your help. Will you help me?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Of course we'll help! It's strange, but I trust you, Yune. And we all want to save the people who got turned to stone!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yes. We'll do whatever it takes."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "That's right! We will allow nothing to stand in our way! We will fight!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "It's all so confusing... But we must do everything in our power to save the people."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "...To be honest, I've spent my life teaching that the goddess Ashera watches over and protects us. This is all a little hard to accept."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "You don't have to believe me. You could just let her destroy the world..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "No, I will do whatever it takes to save the people who were turned to stone. I will join the others in helping you."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "So what you're saying is that we all have to play nice and work together? Just forget about all that's happened?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Sothe, open your eyes and look around. There aren't that many people left to fix this mess. If you don't help, we can't do it. Besides, I would think saving the world is something we could all agree on."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "You're right, Commander. All of this is the result of our war. I guess there's not much reason for flag-waving on either side. First thing we have to do is...unpetrify everyone. And, well... I, uh... I'm actually kind of relived. At least I don't have to worry about fighting you anymore."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I wasn't looking forward to that matchup, either."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "It's settled, then! How should we begin? I know! Let's divide the army into three teams. I'm pretty sure that Ashera is going to notice what we're up to..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Dividing us up is smart. It reduces the risk of everyone getting killed at once."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "We have to hurry. I can feel Ashera's power building."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It's all over if we get turned to stone, too. All right, everyone, it's up to us!"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "What's your name?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I'm Ike."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "All right, Ike. You won't call me a dark god ever again, will you?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Not if you don't like it. Can I call you Yune?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "I would like that. I guess I forgive you, then. Oh, I know! As a sign of my forgiveness, I'll make sure that you can get to your destination safely. I can't do it for everyone because it's a bit exhausting for me, but... Hold still and close your eyes."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I'm ready."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "How do you feel?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...Strong. Like I can take on anyone."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Wow, you're very confident for a being that can die! Let's see... You go with this team."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "I'm going with you. I'm not leaving your--Micaiah's--side."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "...Fine. Micaiah says that's what she wants, too."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Let me talk to her!"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Not right now. You'll have plenty of time to talk on the road, all right?  Hey, you're with this team over here."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "...Damn it."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Each team will take a different route, but your destination is the same. It's the Tower of Guidance that stands in the middle of the land you named Begnion. Go there at once. ...I hope to see you all there. I'll be waiting."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Waiting? Aren't you coming with us?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "I'll see you at the tower."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "A bird?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Yune! Then she must be--"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Micaiah!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "...Oh. Hello, Sothe."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "You're back! I was so worried."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey, if that bird was Yune...where did she go?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "I don't know where, exactly, but she said she must go look for...something."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Leaving us by ourselves? What's she thinking?"}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "At least we know what we have to do. Let's move out for the tower."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "May I have a moment before we leave? Prince Kurth has requested that I pass these out to the herons."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Those are sending stones, right?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "Correct. Fortunately for us, each heron has been assigned to a different team."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "King Tibarn, would you give this one to Prince Reyson?"}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "That's ideal. We can each communicate with the other teams using the stones. Good idea."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "Queen Nailah, please give this one to Prince Rafiel."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "I will."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "And the last one is for Princess Leanne."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "She's on my team. I'll give it to her."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "All right, we're ready to go. See you at the tower!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yeah, see you at the tower... Hopefully."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Ike!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Since we're on different teams, I need to tell you something before we go. Something important. It's General Zelgius. Next time you see him, Ike, use caution. He's your enemy."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "He's the one. He's the Black Knight."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What?!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Zelgius is the Black Knight. I became certain of it when we crossed the river."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It can't be..."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I wasn't going to tell you until I had hard proof, but it looks like we're out of time. Sorry I didn't tell you before."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "General Zelgius is the one who killed my father?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I doubt that Zelgius has been turned to stone.

That'll be our big chance."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Right. We must break the blood pact. No matter what it takes. Of course, our first goal is to save everyone from the goddess's judgment.
