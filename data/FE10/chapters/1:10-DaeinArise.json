My parents live there! They're far too old and frail to defend themselves!"}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "My wife and kids are there, too! It's that heartless murderer, Jarod... He just wants us to suffer to the bitter end."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Prince Pelleas! We have to do something. We must liberate Nevassa and save the people form this brutal attack!"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Is there no end to your lunacy?! The apostle's envoy is nearly here! Why be rash when victory is so close!"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "People are dying, and Nevassa has already suffered more than enough. Do you really expect us not to lift a finger to help?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "If you will not help, we will go by ourselves. Again."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Wait! Where are you going?! You can't take the laguz and rush off on some harebrained mission again!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Can't I?"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Of course not, you idiot girl. You've already been far too impulsive, acting without the prince's consent. And do you think I do not see what has happened? Your name has been raised to lavish heights among the Daein people--your name, and yours alone! Why, even our own soldiers heap their praise on you like sugar on berries, sparing not a thought for their prince!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Oh..."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Hah! The prince! He's a sham, a travesty, a clod of mud no amount of polishing could shine. The real jewel--whose radiance attracts the people like moths to flame--is you, Priestess. And so I shall steal you and extinguish Daein's light of hope!!"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "And then, even once their rightful king is crowned, the people will still await the approval of their precious Priestess of Dawn. Why, if we are not careful, some calculating wretches might decide they would rather see a priestess on the throne instead of a king! And once again, this country will be torn apart, all because of your glory-hounding disregard for our prince's command!"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Please, Izuka..."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Come to think of it...perhaps our \"Priestess\" here has been planning this all along! Pretending to help the prince...when in truth she seeks to wear the crown herself!"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Stop your tongue, worm, or my knife will stop it for you. The only one who seems too hungry for power here is you--"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "That's enough!!"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Izuka, Micaiah does not deserve any such attack on her character. She is pure and noble, and I... I am inadequate."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Have her actions poisoned your mind too, my prince?!"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Since we met, Micaiah has led every battle, even joining the soldiers on the battlefield. Not so with me. I...cannot defend my people. How could our people not rally around her? They see her fighting, throwing her lot in with their own. They respect her. That said, things cannot remain as they are. Izuka is right to worry about my standing. I need to earn my people's respect. Therefore... Therefore, I must take action."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Um... Soldiers of the Liberation Army! Heed my-- No, no... Hear my words! I am Pelleas, true prince of Daein."}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "Yes, we know who you are, milord! We ought to by now!"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "And so, uh... So... ..."}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "...Is he...all right?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": " Prince..."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Sir Knight?"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "...And so... ...And so, beloved friends and comrades dear. With thanks to you, our capital lies close! And if we do not act, if we turn back, the war still ends with us the victors proud, and Daein's rule still falls back to our hands. And if we choose to fight and free this town, we may enrage the empire once again. Thus Daein's fortune turns to sorrow swift. But while I speak, Nevassa's hardship grows! Our brothers suffer, our sisters die, and... I shall not... I... I cannot ignore this tragedy. No man can, and certainly no prince... I cannot look away when my people suffer. And so I ask... I ask you all. Please, will you join me?!"}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "Long live the prince!"}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "Long live Prince Pelleas!"}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "Long live Daein! It's time to save our country!"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Ah..."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Very well, my prince. We are at your service."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "My army is arrayed and waiting. Be well. And...no overly heroic risks, please."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Company, at attention! Our objective is to save the town and take the keep! Now, move out!"}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "The rebels are on the move!"}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Mm. And a good thing too. What is more honorable than a death fraught with purpose?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "I wonder where Jarod is?"}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Listen up, all of you. This is our last chance to die as we've lived. As proud soldiers of the empire. If we survive this fight, imprisonment and a hushed-up execution await us. If we run from this fight, dishonor and pursuit will dog our miserable days. So I say, let's give those Daein curs a fight to remember, and let the glory of our deaths light our way! We've lived as proud soldiers of the empire! Let us die as proud soldiers of the empire! Now GO!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "That shout...that's Jarod!
