How did it go?"}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "It was no use. No one would even listen to me. It makes my heart heavy. The nobles are too busy competing with one another for rewards and status to realize the danger to their lands. Begnion: Rewards? Are they crazy? The sub-humans are at their doors, and all they care about is some reward?!"}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "They only listen to each other.

So, what do you like?"}, {"speaker": "Ilyana", "line": "Something delicious. I don\u2019t particularly care what it is. I just want loads of it."}, {"speaker": "Heather", "line": "Um, all right. I guess that means you eat pretty much anything? I\u2019ll go find somoe dupe who thinks I\u2019m cute, and I\u2019ll con him into cooking something! You stay put!"}, {"speaker": "Ilyana", "line": "How interesting\u2026 Heather\u2026 Her name is Heather. I\u2019ll have to remember her name. She likes to feed me."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You still eating everything in sight?"}, {"speaker": "Ilyana", "line": "Ah\u2026 Hello, Ike. I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Glad to see you remember me."}, {"speaker": "Ilyana", "line": "Of course. I remember all of the mercenaries. Well, most of you, anyway. Oscar prepares such delicious meals. I remember that well enough.

My hero, standing right in front of me. Somebody pinch me."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey, if you don\u2019t let go of my hand, I can\u2019t pay you for anything."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "No! My darling\u2026 Let us not spoil our time together with talk of money! Speak sweetly to me, handsome."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Listen, lady. This is a shop, and I\u2019m a customer. What\u2019s so sweet about that?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Oh, such cold words\u2026 My hero plays hard to get! You\u2019re only making me more interested."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Will you let go of my hand? Please?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Then tell me I\u2019m beautiful!

For free!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Nothing in life is free, Ike. Suppose you said what she asked you to say, hmm? What then? You\u2019d hear it all over the camp. In nearby villages. Eventually, the entire country would be saying it! \"Ike, hero of the Mad King\u2019s War, is in love with Aimee the shopgirl.\" Rumors can quickly spin out of control."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Come off it. You\u2019re exaggerating."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Ooh, don\u2019t be so sure. With my network of merchants, I\u2019ll spread the word to the four corners of Tellius! Within half a year, everyone will know! Then you will be mine forever, Ike! You\u2019ll have no choice at all!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Man, you go right for the neck, don\u2019t you? All right, Soren. She\u2019s all yours."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Yes, sir. What I do now, I do for the good of the company."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "No, Ike! Don\u2019t go!

A true delight for the eyes."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Ooo\u2026 Now you\u2019re talking, you little lady-killer!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I know you won\u2019t discount the goods to nothing, since it\u2019s coming from me. So\u2026 How about you cut your prices down by three-quarters?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Ooh\u2026 Decisions, decisions."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "You\u2019re a diamond, and other beorc only glass beads, Miss Aimee. I\u2019ll buy more than enough to justify the discount."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Half price, maybe."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "A touch less than three-quarters, then. What do you say, rose of Tellius? O goddess of desire?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "All right, you win! Just this time, mind you. Take this."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Ah, a Silver Card. I can buy everything for half price at all of the shops?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "That\u2019s right. Remember what I said, though. It\u2019s a limited-time deal. I\u2019ll have to take it away soon. Oh, and while you own this card, you won\u2019t be able to sell your weapons as raw material. Got that?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Understood, Miss Aimee.

They retreated pretty quickly."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Their soldiers were well equipped and well trained, but their commanders were terrible."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "That's lucky for us, I suppose. Things seem to be working out pretty well so far.

It's the Central Army!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "What?!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Tibarn failed in stalling them... Does that mean he's...dead?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Doubtful. I don't think there was even a battle. The Central Army has arrived too quickly."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Grrrr... We only know one thing for sure. The enemy now has the advantage."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "There are still enemies to the north. This is quickly turning into our worst-case scenario."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Skrimir, we must retreat.

We must retreat. This is the Central Army we're talking about!"}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Ah, finally! Finally, we get to fight the Begnion Central Army! I have been waiting for this!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I can see you won't change your mind, Skrimir. All right, if it has to come to this..."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Are you joking? You can't beat me, Ranulf. You know that."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I can't let you or our men die in vain. It's my job to keep you from doing anything that stupid. If I have to knock you out to keep you out of this battle, then that's what I'll do."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Fine. Try."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Ike! Stop them!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No. They need to do this."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Do not worry about him. I might have broken some bones, but he will heal quickly."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "My soldiers! We are leaving! Head back to base camp!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "General Skrimir..."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "We will return and regroup. It pains me, but we must. Damn it, Ranulf... He...got my leg."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "But you're still willing to carry him?"}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "If he doesn't rest and heal, all his little chores fall on me. I can't have that."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Reporting, sir! The Laguz Alliance is retreating!"}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "So, the enemy does not persist with the situation turns against them. I'm impressed. They're flexible and adapt quickly to a changing environment."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Shall we pursue them?"}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "No, first we will join our allies to the north. I hear they've taken heavy losses."}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "General Zelgius. It's an honor to meet you."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "General Levail of Duke Gaddos's northern force, is it? Are you in command here?"}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "No, not I. Rather... The northern force lacks any order. We do not have a central commander to direct us in battle."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "So, each force was fighting the enemy on its own?"}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "Quite so. Taking orders from others is beneath the nobles, I suppose."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "How pitiful."}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "A sad state of affairs, yes. But now that you are here, General, the situation will be rectified."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "Yes, one can hope."}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "...So, are the rumors true?"}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "I've heard that power in Begnion has been split between the apostle and the senators."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "True, they do not agree on how to deal with the Laguz Alliance. However..."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "As long as there are enemies who threaten the empire, we shall fight. That is our duty, is it not?"}, {"speaker": "Levail", "line": "...Indeed."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "Then do not trouble your mind with politics. Let the nobles worry about their games. We should focus on this war."}], "narration": ["The apostle Sanaki, empress of the Begnion Empire, does not wish war with the laguz and searches feverishly for a peaceful resolution. However, many imperial senators see the war not only as a means to expand their own influence but also as a convenient opportunity to exterminate the laguz once and for all. These ambitious senators meet with Vice-Minister Lekain and vigorously advocate a full-scale war.", "Having seen their homeland invaded, Begnion citizens desiring peace are now few and far between. Against the apostle's wishes, Begnion's army is now fully committed to the war with the laguz.", "Zelgius easily escapes the talons of the bird tribes meant to delay him and the Central Army. He arrives at the Sestohl Plains to reinforce his weakened allies.", "The laguz forces are surprised by the sudden appearance of this new enemy and seek counsel from Ranulf of Gallia. Ranulf orders a retreat with all speed, thus avoiding a full-on engagement with the Central Army.", "General Zelgius chooses not to pursue the fleeing Gallian army. Instead, he orders his army to hold position on the eastern banks of the Ribahn. Divided by the river, the two armies are deadlocked, able to do little more than glare at one another in hatred."]}
