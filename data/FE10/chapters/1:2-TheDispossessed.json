Let's steer clear of towns for now, unless we want more trouble."}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "Don't tell me... This means another night sleeping on the cold ground with nothing but bugs to keep us warm!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Oh, Edward, it's not that bad!  The forest is so beautiful and serene. I'd almost rather be out here. Right, Yune?"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": " Um...excuse me. Are you people heading to town by any chance? Our abbot is ill. He needs medicine, but Begnion soldiers are hoarding our provisions in the manor house."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "The Dawn Brigade, at your service! I'm sure we can help you and your abbot."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Sothe, do you know the layout of the manor?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "I was here years ago. As I remember, there's a large armory tucked deep inside the building.

Good luck!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Zaitan", "line": "Intruders, you say?! What with a full battalion stationed here? The gall! And the intrigue!

Now, I just have to figure out how to get everybody safely up here."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Hey, you! How did you get in here?!"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "We are the Dawn Brigade. We go where we please. We're here to reclaim what you've stolen from the people of Daein."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Sir! There are burglars on the loose!
