But wait...it gets better. She also issued an imperial edict to the occupation forces telling them to cease all military action immediately!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Does that mean the fighting is over? That we've won?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Indeed. It's hard to believe it's over. It almost seems too easy."}, {"speaker": "Tormod", "line": "And best of all, Duke Persis is leading the inspection team! We'll be home free the moment they arrive. Our worries are over."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Duke Persis...Lord Sephiran? So Apostle Sanaki's dispatching one of the empire's greatest men to handle this."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "What kind of man is he?"}, {"speaker": "Tormod", "line": "He is amazing...the best person ever! He's incredibly influential and high up, but he never stood on ceremony with us. Well, go on, you guys! Don't just stand there. You have to spread the news!"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "We have to spread the news? Aren't you going with us?"}, {"speaker": "Tormod", "line": "Umm...nah. It's mostly your doing.

The apostle, in her mercy, will hear your testimony. Do not abuse her magnanimous spirit...and lose your small advantage."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Hah! What a magnificently ruthless maneuver. I didn't know Numida had it in him. Disowning the entire occupation army...and framing me for their actions. Brilliant."}, {"speaker": "Alder", "line": "So then...the game is over. Might we at least drag Duke Numida down with us?"}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Not a chance. We are proof that Duke Numida--and therefore the entire senate--is corrupt. No doubt they'll work together to silence us. Besides, there's more tantalizing prey than those tottering relics. If I'm to fall, so too should the one who upended our plans and drove us to this dead end... That girl."}, {"speaker": "Alder", "line": "Oh... I like that.

You may begin, my prince."}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "Am I dreaming? Everything looks so delicious! What should I eat first...?"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Everyone, you've done a fine job. Once the inspection team arrives, Daein will be free once again! In anticipation of our emancipation, I invite you to eat and drink to your hearts' content."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "...Whew... Yune! What is it? You didn't need to slip away from the banquet, too."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Silly you! You're kind of a mysterious bird, you know that? How is it you can fly around even at night?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Oh, Yune...for some reason...I feel so tired lately. ...But it won't be long... I'll go back home to Nevassa...and then...save Daein..."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "So, you escaped the idiot's ball to be alone? How trusting of you, Silver-Haired Maiden... No--I'm sorry--\"Priestess of Dawn.\" If you really can work miracles, you'd best work one up for yourself now."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Hm? What? Oh! Begnion soldiers!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "General Jarod?! Why are you here?"}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "I'm doomed, thanks to you.

As long as the prince survives, the people will fight."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Hah! The prince! He's a sham, a travesty, a clod of mud no amount of polishing could shine.

Maybe you haven't heard...he died in the war. But let's put your claim to the test, if only to indulge my own amusement."}, {"speaker": "Black Knight", "line": "Then have at me...and learn your folly."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "In due time.

So how can he be here now...alive?"}, {"speaker": "Black Knight", "line": "You are correct, Sothe. Ike did defeat me in that battle, in a fashion. But as you can see, I managed to escape."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "What do you want?"}, {"speaker": "Black Knight", "line": "For Daein to raise its banner as a kingdom once again.

And that means...he's still alive, isn't he?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Yes. There was another soldier who sacrificed his life protecting Jarod. I presume Jarod's burying him now. Oh! Oh, no..."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "What is it?!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "I see a dark cloud... It's dimming the light of hope...

However, Micaiah suspects that Jarod has one last move to make. Deprived of his chance to capture Micaiah, Jarod abandons all notions of retreat or negotiation. Instead, he makes plans for revenge. He murders an emissary from his homeland of Begnion and reclaims control of Daein Keep.", "From within the keep, he launches a savage barrage of catapult fire, all but destroying the castle town. The momentary peace that arrived with the Begnion emissary shatters along with Nevassa's walls, and the people of the city see their kin and their capital crushed under a rain of stone. This treachery proves too much for them, and their grief explodes into rage.", "Micaiah and company have pitched camp on a nearby hillside.

To be honest, it\u2019s probably more about his napping. Give him a few minutes of free time, and he\u2019s sure to close his eyes and drift away. The war would certainly disrupt his sleep schedule."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "What an... interesting fellow.
