We\u2019ve been fighting really hard for quite a while now, haven\u2019t we?"}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "Yeah, I guess so. The war of emancipation, the war against the Laguz Alliance, and now against the apostle\u2019s army. One after another, just like that."}, {"speaker": "Leonardo", "line": "The world can\u2019t always be like this. These wars seem so pointless. All I want is to be able to live in Daein, peacefully and in freedom."}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "Yeah. The military is a pretty strange place. Hey, I have an idea! Once this battle is over, I\u2019ll quit the army and go home."}, {"speaker": "Leonardo", "line": "What about Micaiah and the others? Are you going to abandon them?"}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "What? No way! I\u2019ll just have to talk them into leaving with me! And if that catches on, all the soldiers will leave, and then there can\u2019t be a war. And then Daein will have peace again!"}, {"speaker": "Leonardo", "line": "You know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple. But your plan sounds good to me, Edward."}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "See? You know it\u2019s smart! First, you and I will leave. Together, we can tackle any obstacle!"}, {"speaker": "Leonardo", "line": "We\u2019ll have to survive the next battle, first. This should help. Here. Look what I got you."}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "Oh! This sword is amazing! Where did you get this!?"}, {"speaker": "Leonardo", "line": "I\u2019ve been saving up. Micaiah chipped in, too."}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "You got this for me?"}, {"speaker": "Leonardo", "line": "Yeah. Since you\u2019re always fighting so recklessly, I thought this sword would be a good match for you."}, {"speaker": "Edward", "line": "Thanks, Leonardo! You\u2019re the best friend I could have!"}, {"speaker": "Leonardo", "line": "I know. We\u2019re each other\u2019s best friend and family."}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "Hey, Laura! You dropped a staff over there."}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "Oh! Ah. Thank you, Aran."}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "You\u2019ve been carrying a lot of things lately."}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "Yes, I suppose so. Many people are injured. I wanted to help heal as many of them as I can."}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "That\u2019s admirable. Is there anything I can do to help?"}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "Yes, of course!"}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "First, hand me all of your things. I\u2019ll carry them for you."}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "That would be great. Here you go. Say..."}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "Hmm?"}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "That staff you picked up earlier... It doesn\u2019t belong to me."}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "Really? It was right at your feet, so I\u2019d assumed that it was yours."}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "I\u2019ve never seen a staff like this. I wonder what effect it has?"}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "Hey, be careful. It might be dangerous or something. Let\u2019s throw it away."}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "Well, maybe if I shake it like this... And then... Whoa!"}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "Wuh!"}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "What did you say, Aran?"}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "Zzz... Zzz..."}, {"speaker": "Laura", "line": "Oh, Aran. You\u2019re such a clown. How do you fall asleep on your feet? I guess you must be really tired. Why don\u2019t I just leave you be? Let me just take my things back."}, {"speaker": "Aran", "line": "Zzz... Zzz... Zzz..."}]}
