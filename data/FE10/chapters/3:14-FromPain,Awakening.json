My husband looked on in triumph as the royal family began to wither. The power of the curse killed every royal in line for the throne. It was brilliant. With no one to block his way to the throne, Ashnard executed his master stroke. He killed his father and took the crown from his head."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "King Ashnard killed his own father? The king of Daein?! And what about the others? A thousand people died for his insane plot!"}, {"speaker": "Almedha", "line": "There\u2019s no point in dwelling on old wounds. Besides, the peasants didn\u2019t matter. They had no vision.

How is that possible?"}, {"speaker": "Almedha", "line": "In order to break the curse of the blood pact, two conditions must be met.

Ashnard once told me he'd considered killing the man who created his father's blood pact instead! I didn't know why until now... This means that we could kill the senator who signed the pact instead of Pelleas!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "It's possible, but very difficult. We'll need not only to hunt down the senator, but find the document, with no idea where to start.

I've just received a very disturbing message from Prince Kurthnaga."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Don't tell me... No luck, right?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "It is far worse than that.

Oh, this is just perfect!"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "He has a good reason to side with them, but... I'm afraid I cannot tell you why."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Wonderful! So we still have to fight Daein, and they've added one of the supposedly neutral dragons of Goldoa to their army?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "I'm sorry, Ike. I will try to reason with Prince Kurth again. It was the prince's wish to come here... King Dheginsea knows nothing of this visit. Be that as it may, for a prince of the dragon tribe to stand on a battlefield... It is unacceptable. I must talk him out of it."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I'm sorry, Ena. I know you're doing your best to... Wait, are you talking to him with that stone?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "Yes. We dragons have the power to sense the presence of our allies. If that ally is someone we care for very much, then we can communicate telepathically. With the sending stone, we can use this telepathy across extreme distances."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "I just hope he listens to me. We can't afford to fuel the flames of the Fire Emblem."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It's almost dawn. Do what you can to convince the prince to stay out of this.

I shall fight for Daein on your behalf."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Thank you both. It means a lot to me. But are you sure? After all, this seems like a hopeless battle."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "It's too soon for you to give up hope. You have the dragon prince of Goldoa on your side. That counts for something."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Kurth is the prince of Goldoa? So, he is a laguz..."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "Not just a laguz. He is a black dragon. The black dragons are the strongest of all the laguz tribes. We have a chance."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "If Queen Almedha's brother is a black dragon...that means the queen herself must also be a laguz!"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Seems like a complicated mess to me. Just the same, he is a powerful ally."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "You're right. If we can stand our ground, there will be hope for another day.
