Its gate is already sealed, and it looks like they intend to keep it that way. This won't go as easily as our battle in Felirae."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Yaawwwwn... Beorc are all the same. We will run them down, just as before."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Skrimir, please... Listen. Just this once."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What do you think, Soren?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "The Felirae survivors will have warned Mugill of our advance. That's so obvious, even you must have anticipated it. You don't have a plan?"}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Do not mock me, beorc boy. Why should I bother with plans? No soldier would cower behind stone walls after being challenged to a battle! We will issue a challenge, and they will meet it. We have no need for plans!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Do you realize how completely absurd you sound? The enemy did not build the fortress so they could stand outside of it. They will not come out of their own accord."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "But-- Those beorc cowards! They will hide from us?! What do we do? I do not know how to fight cowards!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Don't you get it? That's what we're trying to decide! Think, Skrimir. Just try."}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "No! That's your job, Ranulf! You're my second in command. Think of a way for me to use my strength! Anything else is a waste of time. I'll be training outside. Tell me when you have a \"plan.\""}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Wait, Skrimir!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "...This is ridiculous. I'm amazed that someone was desperate enough to make that fool a general."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I'm tempted to agree with you on that. But there's a reason he's here."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Never in its history has Gallia invaded another country. We don't have any experience or tactics to fall back on for this. On top of that, our general... well, you've seen it yourself. Skrimir... He doesn't pay attention to details, nor does he strategize. Sadly, it's not just Skrimir. Most laguz are the same. They're arrogant and stubborn. It doesn't even occur to them that they won't be able to power through the beorc forever."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Why isn't Caineghis leading the army?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "It's not an option. We aren't mobile like the bird tribes. Once we leave our lands, it isn't easy for us to get back. We can't take our king away from his domain."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Well, what about Giffca, then? There have to be other capable generals in Gallia."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Yeah, you'd think General Giffca would lead, but... Giffca has other duties to attend to, so really, that just leaves Skrimir."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I understand. Laguz choose their leaders based on strength. If Skrimir is to be the next king, this war is the best opportunity for him to learn about strategy."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Exactly. Since that's the case, we need all the help we can get. Please, lend us your wisdom. Without your help, this war's outcome is certain."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You can count on us, Ranulf."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "We've told you already. We're here to help."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Soren, say something!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Well, well. Looks like your strategist isn't fond of laguz yet."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I'm sorry, Ranulf. he's gotten better, but..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Soren, Ranulf helped us out. On top of that, he's our client. It's our turn to return the favor, and our job to do it right. Got that?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "...Fine. But it'll cost you more."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Thanks, all of you. We appreciate the help."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Give me some time to myself. I'll come up with a plan to get us through this mess."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Great. We're counting on you, Soren."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I know. I'll do what I can."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Tch! These sub-humans don't know how much trouble they're causing! We can't go anywhere!"}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Tell me about it.

You need permission to leave your homes!"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "What? Well, that's weird. We were told to hand out food to all the watchmen."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Wh-what?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Well, I guess this isn't the place. Should we head back? We don't want the food to spoil..."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "W-wait! Don't go! You don't have to head back. That food is for us. We're sure of it!"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Oh, wonderful! Would you call everyone, then? I'll pass out the food and drinks."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Looks like the watchmen are all asleep. Great job, everyone."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "The first step is done. Next, we clear out the remaining guards and open the main gate."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Ranulf and his troops are waiting outside for us.

Have you ever actually seen it happen?"}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Hmph. I doubt that any laguz would eat such a bigoted beorc, even if you asked for it. You make me sick."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "Are you...Boyd?"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Huh?"}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "It's you!

Thank you so much."}], "narration": ["The tactics used by the Gallian army prove effective, and like Felirae before it, Mugill falls to claw and steel. Before Begnion can react, the laguz overwhelm the remaining border defenses and cross into the Telgam region. With both defense keeps overrun, Telgam falls like ripe fruit at the feet of the Laguz Alliance. Inspired by their success, the alliance takes advantage of this momentum to strike toward the very heart of the Begnion Empire.", "Dukes Gaddos and Seliora are horrified by the speed of the laguz alliance. Banding together with the landowning nobles of the northern territories, they mass their armies in Seliora to oppose the Gallian assault. Using the Ribahn River, a tributary of the might Miscale, as a defensive front, the Begnion forces make their camps along its western bank in the Sestohl plains."], "conversation": [{"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "No, no, no!
