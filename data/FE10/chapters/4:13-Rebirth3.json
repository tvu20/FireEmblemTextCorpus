I don't sense any enemies nearby. I know! Would you all like me to tell you a story as we climb?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What kind of story?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "One from long ago, long before the grandparents of anyone here were born."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "In the very beginning of this world...there was only water, until one day a girl appeared. The girl was very clever, and she forged the first land...then she made trees and flowers, and then she created beings."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "The story of the grand creation? Heard it. Wake me when it's over."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The girl was you, right, Yune? Or are you talking about Ashera?"}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "Both, really...and neither, actually. At first, the girl was excited by her new world, and she thought of little else. Then she started feeling lonely. Everyone, every being she'd created, was different from her. Not a single person that could truly understand her. All alone, she grew sadder and sadder, crying for thousands of years. Then some creatures began to grow and change, becoming more clever and sophisticated. They tried to comfort the girl and eventually grew closer to her... That was the birth of the Zunanma. They were your ancestors...beorc, laguz, everyone."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "In Begnion, we are taught that the Zunanma were human\u2014Uhm, I mean...beorc ancestors... ...It makes me wonder what else in my country has been warped beyond recognition."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "It's possible that the truth was simply misunderstood. Like the way everyone calls me a dark god..."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "But let me continue... The Zunanma worshipped the girl as their own goddess. They said her hair was as striking a color as dawn's first light, so they gave her a name... The Goddess of Dawn. She was a much-loved goddess."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The Goddess of Dawn..."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "The Zunanma continued to evolve and change, giving rise to a variety of races and tribes across the land. Naturally, each of the races thought their own was superior to the others, and conflict arose between them."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "The goddess tried to make peace among her people, but nothing could stop the warring Zunanma. Trying to separate the factions, the goddess gave them different names, laguz and beorc... But this only intensified their conflict."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "And then...the great flood occurred."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "The goddess was only trying to bring an end to the fighting. But her power was so great that all the continents were drowned in the flood, all except Tellius."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are you sure about this story? It's very different from the histories that we've each been taught."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Among beorc nations, we only know a vague fairy tale about the dark god stirring up a great disaster."}, {"speaker": "Kurthnaga", "line": "Neither the laguz nor the beorc have an accurate description by the sound of it.

Just beyond these doors, my father is waiting."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Dheginsea, king of Goldoa... He's supposed to be one of the three who defeated the dark god...Yune."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "He has been blessed by Ashera. Not only that, but it's a powerful, resilient blessing from long ago. He may be nearly impossible to defeat. ...Let's get everyone together. There's no better time than now."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "I was hoping to avoid this until we reached Ashera... Actually, I hoped not to have to do it at all... But she's left me with no choice. I will give you the blessings of Yune, goddess of chaos and freedom. In their natural state, the attacks of mortal creatures have no effect on divine beings."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "When Ashera set out to defeat me, she gathered her strongest warriors and bestowed on them some of her power. This is called the Goddess's Blessing... She empowered the dual swords of the beorc swordswoman, Altina. The laguz warrior, Soan, and Dheginsea, the leader of the dragon tribe, were also blessed."}, {"speaker": "Yune", "line": "I failed then... But this time will be different. I'll use Ashera's own tricks, and I won't be defeated. Everyone... Take some time now to ready yourselves. Beorc, be sure to equip your best weapons.

We should have learned, but the fighting never stopped. Now we must pay for our crimes. We must take responsibility, and accept Ashera's judgment."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "No! You don't understand! It wasn't the war that awoke the goddess! It was my song... The galdr of release freed the goddess!"}, {"speaker": "Dheginsea", "line": "...You can't expect me to believe that.

I know."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Zelgius is the Black Knight? I don\u2019t know what to say... It\u2019s unbelievable!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What was he like in Begnion?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "He was the right-hand man of my most trusted aide, Duke Sephiran of Persis. He was a hero, a perfect general, and the best swordsman in all of Tellius. He was never anything but loyal. But he was serving another country!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hmm. It makes me wonder how Sephiran is doing."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "I doubt he\u2019s been turned to stone. Even though he was captured by Lekain and forcibly removed from his post, he\u2019ll have found a way to persevere. Sigrun always said there\u2019s no other master of the arcane arts who can compare with the duke of Persis."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Makes you wonder, doesn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Ike... Don\u2019t tell me you suspect Sephiran!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Well, look at the facts..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Do not trouble your mind with that thought! He would never betray me."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It\u2019s nice to think so. But if he\u2019s not petrified, he\u2019d have received a message from Yune. So where is he?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "The goddess isn\u2019t perfect. She said so herself! Maybe the message didn\u2019t reach everyone."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...You have to admit that\u2019s a weak excuse. Let\u2019s leave it at that, for now. We need to focus on moving forward."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Please, let\u2019s! Oh, I almost forgot! I have something for you."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Um... Uh... Well, you\u2019re my trusted aide, just like Sephiran. You have to live! So protect yourself with this."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "A mercenary with a contract to act as aide to the empress of Begnion. Who\u2019d have thought? But thank you, Sanaki."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "You\u2019re welcome, Ike. And thank you."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Ike, take a look at this."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey now... Where\u2019d you stumble across it?"}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Inside the tower. I thought of using it myself, but..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yeah, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right for you."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "...Indeed. That\u2019s why I brought it here for you to use."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Thanks. It\u2019s a very rare item. I\u2019m in your debt."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "It\u2019s the least I could do."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Ike, take a look at this."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey now... Where\u2019d you stumble across it?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Lying around inside the tower. It seemed like the sort of thing I should bring to your attention."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That\u2019s very nice of you, but you didn\u2019t have to. Do whatever you want with it."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Really? Do you think I\u2019d be able to use it?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Well, don\u2019t get hasty. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "...I know. I\u2019m just kidding, Ike."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Thanks. It\u2019s a very rare item. I\u2019ll cherish it."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Please do."}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(Micaiah, have you ever seen one of these?)"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Yes, Leanne, I have. That\u2019s a very powerful artifact. Actually, it would be of great help to us, with what\u2019s been happening."}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(I found it inside the tower. Do you think I can use it?)"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Um... I don\u2019t think so, Leanne. But you can try if you like..."}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(...I\u2019m only kidding. Here, you can have it.)"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Oh, for me? Thank you very much. It\u2019s a very precious item. I\u2019ll make good use of it."}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(Please do!)"}]}
