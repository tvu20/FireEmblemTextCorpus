What's the problem?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "We have some stragglers lagging behind."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "You mean Almedha and Pelleas are slowing us down again. We have to reach the Tower of Guidance as soon as possible. We can't have them always hampering our progress."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "But we have no idea when the Disciples of Order might attack. We need to keep everyone together, for safety's sake."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Reyson! We'll rest here. You can land and give your wings a break."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Reyson, I remember when a trip like this would have exhausted you. I'm impressed at how well you're handling it."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Yes, physically I'm quite healthy. But I can't say that I'm really happy about that..."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Why would that be?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "We of the heron clan can feel the energies of others. In times of war, negative energy is dominant, and we sicken. Now that all of the people have been turned to stone, the energy is gone and, physically, I feel much better. It's unsettling to feel healthy and know that the reason is such a sad one."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "It's a terrible irony... We finally have the peace we've been praying for, at the cost of all freedom, everywhere."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Could this truly be the world that Goddess Ashera wants for us?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "No, this is the world she had to give us after we ruined hers."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Ah, welcome back. Any sign of the Disciples of Order?"}, {"speaker": "Janaff", "line": "Unfortunately, no."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "I don't like this. Why are they leaving us alone?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I'm not sure I see the problem, Tibarn. If they're going to let us stroll on through, I won't complain."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Not me. Right or wrong, I would prefer a stand-up fight. Right now, even."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "What are you saying, Tibarn? how could you wish that upon us? I don't understand you."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Right now, the world is calm, peaceful...almost eerily so. It almost feels...comfortable. If this goes on, we might relax, lose our edge. I'm worried that we'll get careless."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Hmm..."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Everyone, let's get one thing perfectly clear here...This isn't a natural peace. It's Ashera's work. Don't forget for an instant that the world isn't supposed to be like this. It should be noisy, vibrant, and chaotic."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "You're right. A peace built on the sacrifice of so many lives is monstrous and unjust. It cannot be allowed to stand."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I didn't mean that I'm losing motivation to save the petrified people. It's just that, before we started talking about it, I was feeling...complacent. Is it just me?"}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "The spirit of order is hanging heavy across the land. When we fight, we get a dose of chaos, which may help us get back in touch with our true selves. If our enemy has also figured that out, it might explain why they're staying away."}, {"speaker": "Almedha", "line": "Pelleas, dear, how are you feeling?"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Mother, I'm fine. Please stop asking after my health."}, {"speaker": "Almedha", "line": "But you're so pale, darling. You were always such a sickly little boy... You should rest a while. We can't have you exhausting yourself."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "No, Mother... If we stop walking now, we would slow the others."}, {"speaker": "Almedha", "line": "Never mind them, sweetheart, they can wait. You should take a nice rest under that tree. Son, remember that you are a scion of both Daein's and Goldoa's royal families! You are more important than any of these peasants! The others can certainly wait for you; don't spare a single thought for them."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "L-let go of me!

They're over there, to the southwest!"}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "How did they get so close without being noticed? Did we have men out of position?"}, {"speaker": "Ulki", "line": "No, I just checked in. Enemy forces just suddenly appeared, with no sign or warning at all."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Guess that's one good thing about fighting a goddess... Things are sure to be exciting. Everyone, get in position!"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "...An entire legion that can appear from nowhere?

Well, you said that King Ashnard had no other wives or children... I just assumed that you had always been by his side."}, {"speaker": "Almedha", "line": "Ha ha... There was always gossip, of course, and I hated it. But I know with absolute certainty... Ashnard had relations with no other woman.

There was a strong mutual attraction between us, eventually resulting in a child... But all I ever was to him was a source of power. Once I became pregnant, I was useless to him. Bereft of my strength, he found my presence nothing more than an irritating distraction. After Pelleas was born, Ashnard became obsessed with the boy... But, once he realized Pelleas had no special powers...
