I want to know who you were yelling at and why you did nothing but yell at them."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "S-sorry, sir.

What have you been doing about this band of fools?"}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Sir. A few days ago we stormed their hideout. We found a girl much like the Silver-Haired Maiden... We ran the dogs from their den, but they were cunning and cautious, and...we lost them."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "I see. I'm beginning to understand."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "How do you mean, sir?"}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "I'm beginning to understand exactly how incompetent you all are!"}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Urk!"}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Make the villagers talk. I want to know who these bandits are and where they're hiding."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "Y-yes, sir! Understood, sir!"}, {"speaker": "Alder", "line": "I don't care who they are. The more kick they have in them, the more fun for us, don't you think, sir?"}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Precisely. Overseeing this dusty old town is wearing thin. A little fresh game is just what I need."}], "narration": ["The northeastern nation of Daein lost a bloody war with neighboring Crimea three years ago. Crimea, however, abdicated its right to rule Daein and passed sovereignty of its former enemy to the powerful Begnion Empire. Daein's future is now subject to the whims of the empire.", "Begnion's occupations forces have gathered all of Daein's men of fighting age and put them to work in labor camps. Their work is brutal and void of purpose, designed to break both body and spirit. The remaining population faces poverty and starvation as the fields lie fallow. A band of young heroes has escaped the Begnion army to form a group called the Dawn Brigade. Fighting for a free Daein, they alone have stood against Begnion's forces. They alone have shouldered the hopes of their nation.", "Among the company is a young girl named Micaiah, who is said to possess mystical powers. The people of Daein have come to know her as the \"Silver- Haired Maiden.\" They have come to think of her as the savior for whom they had been waiting.", "Begnion's forces have tried time and time again to capture and silence the Dawn Brigade. However, Micaiah's ability to sense impending danger has thus far allowed the Dawn Brigade to evade the empire's grasp."]}
