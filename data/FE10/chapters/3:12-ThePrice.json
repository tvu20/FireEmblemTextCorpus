We have no other choice in the matter. As long as I follow the senate's orders, no one will die because of me."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "No, I can't accept that! We have finally wrested our country back from the occupation forces... I'd rather be dead than have to bend to the will of the empire.

Somewhere, I'm sure you'll find...something."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Micaiah, forgive me. I was so overwhelmed that I let myself give in to despair. But you're absolutely right. We can't give up just yet. We have people to save!"}, {"speaker": "Tauroneo", "line": "Unfortunately, we don't have much time. Begnion will not put off triggering the blood pact until after we've found a way to break it."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "We can make time.

We'll do our best to hold them back...whatever it takes."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "It looks as if the apostle's forces are using this road to avoid a head-on confrontation.

If we let her through, her army will cross into Begnion. That will surely anger the senate, and the senate will move to destroy Daein.

We wouldn't stand a chance taking them head-on. They would march right through us. We need to give Pelleas more time, but if we hold back, the senate will know we're up to something.

This rewarp staff is our latest invention. With this staff, one can get to any desired destination instantly. Isn't that just wonderful? Before this lovely little item, we used that ghastly warp powder. It worked well enough, but would completely exhaust whoever used it. What's the use of someone traveling anywhere they wish if they're too exhausted to do anything afterward? It'd take a very strong soldier to withstand the powder's side effects. The rewrap staff solves that problem."}, {"speaker": "Messenger", "line": "Vice-Minister..."}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "Ah, now I've said too much. I just can't help myself. I love innovation so."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "Um... If I may, what is the purpose of your visit?"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "Oh, yes. No time for idle chatter. We have a favor to ask of you, Your Majesty. As you are no doubt aware, the false apostle has raised an army of sub-humans to reclaim her throne. We require the use of the Daein army to wipe out this upstart \"Laguz Alliance.\" Would you be so kind?"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "I... I'm afraid I cannot deploy my army on Begnion's behalf. My country cannot continue to rebuild while fighting a war. Please understand."}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "Ah, so you reject our request? Then I've no choice but to watch you and your people perish slowly."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "What?! You came here to make threats?"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "The terms of our pact are quite clear in this document."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "That's the treaty I signed on the day of my coronation. I don't see how this pertains to--"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "All will be made clear, young Pelleas. Yes, this is the same document. You, my na\u00efve young king, signed it believing it was an oath of reparation from Begnion. Sadly for you, however..."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "What are you telling me?"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "In truth, this wonderful scrap of parchment is a blood pact. Once you sign the paper in blood, you can never break the terms of the pact!"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "A blood pact? But Izuka said he saw no problems with the terms of the treaty... No! Izuka? No, how could he..."}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "That's right. Izuka is one of us. He found the perfect king who would execute the senate's will."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "I can't believe it! I won't!"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "You'd better start believing it. You've at least heard stories of the forbidden \"blood pact,\" haven't you? It's a marvelous tool used by the wise to control the foolish. A ruler agreeing to the pact is bound to it...absolutely. Once sworn, the pact will punish any transgression against its terms with the complete destruction of his country."}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "You...you can't be serious. That's impossible!"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "Calm yourself, young king, and listen. I'll tell you an interesting story. Long ago, a foolhardy king signed a blood pact with the empire to take back his lost kingdom. In exchange for his country, he vowed complete obedience. He soon broke the terms of the pact and began to disobey the empire. Presumably he didn't understand the power of the oath he'd sworn... Would you like to hear what happened after he defied the empire's will?"}, {"speaker": "Pelleas", "line": "...What?"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "It was quite tragic. One man died on the first day. He was only a peasant, so no one really noticed. Two more died on the second day. Three more on the third day. I think you can see where this is going. The wave of mysterious deaths spread across the kingdom like a contagion. After thirty days, the king finally realized that this was the curse of the blood pact, the price of infidelity. He apologized to the empire and pleaded with them to lift the curse. His plea was graciously accepted on the one hundredth day. By then, the king had lost half of his subordinates, as well as his lovely wife and child. That country remained under the control of the senate for a very long time."}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "I hope I've made myself clear. No matter how you struggle, you have no choice but to follow the orders given to you by the empire. No matter how noble your motives, defiance against us will result in the death of your nation. This you must never forget. Ahhh, and one more thing... If you're considering seeking aid from outside of Daein, think again. We have spies and informants in every corner of Tellius. We will know immediately if you tell anyone."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Blast! We're being ambushed!

You have to give the order."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Yes, I know."}, {"speaker": "Daein", "line": "General Maiel has fallen to the claws of the sub-humans!

Regardless of what you believe, the only choice we have is to fight."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Micaiah, are you insane? Look around! Every single person in your army will die! Do you care that little about them?"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Enough! Everyone stand down!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Apostle..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "I've seen enough bloodshed for one day! That's enough!

And Ike...I'm sorry for this."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What is going on with you people..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What's the situation?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "It's awful. The Begnion Central Army and the Crimean Royal Knights have almost been completely obliterated.

Thoughts, everyone?"}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Thoughts?! Daein must answer for this! We attack them immediately!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "We can't.
