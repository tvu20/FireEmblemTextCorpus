That's unexpected, to say the least..."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Why would Daein join the war? I thought all their resources would be tied up in reconstruction."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Yeah, that bothers me too. There's something weird about all of this. Didn't Daein resent Begnion's occupation? Why would they be so quick to help out their former enemy?"}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Why does not matter. We are running out of time. We must deal with this quickly, if we are to get home."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "General Skrimir! Have you recovered from your wounds already?"}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Yes. Do not underestimate the healing power of the beast tribe."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "All right, everyone's here. Let's begin the meeting."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "The immediate threat is the Daein army. They're dug in around the area that we'll have to use to cross the Ribahn. Maybe we can find another spot to cross?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "No, we can't afford it. If we waste any more time, the Central Army will catch up to us. If that happens, we're dead."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Ranulf, tell me your impression of the Daein army. Anything special?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "...Well, there weren't very many of them, but their morale was really up there. Their commander seemed very clever, as well."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "It must be the Maiden of Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": " Who?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "She was the hero of the recent Daein uprising. Micaiah is her name, if I recall correctly. Supposedly she has performed miracles and turned many losing battles into victories. An interesting figure."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Miracles? I'm finding that a bit hard to swallow. Are you sure about that?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Who knows? Personally, I doubt it. All I know is that the Daein army believes in her miracles, which makes her dangerous."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "This Maiden of Dawn is supposed to be the savior of Daein, whose miraculous powers freed their people from tyranny. In other words, her followers are fanatics who see her as a goddess. She will make a formidable enemy."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "If we attack them head-on, the fighting won't stop until one side is decimated. There's got to be a way to avoid that, right?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "What about a decoy force, like we've used in the past?"}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "The decoy only worked because the enemy didn't expect it. I wouldn't count on the same strategy working twice."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Not necessarily. The empire assumes superiority over all other countries. Begnion is only using the Daein army as a pawn to stop us, and likely won't care if it is destroyed in the process. As such, the Daein army is most likely uninformed about our past tactics."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "You might have a point there. I went scouting after the fog cleared, and their forces looked really unprepared to fight us. They had no ballistae, and they hadn't fielded many fire mages. It felt like they didn't know a thing about fighting laguz."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Then we should definitely have a decoy force hit them head-on, while the bulk of the army crosses the river in the meantime."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I'll head up the decoy force, then. The armies of Gallia and Phoenicis can cross the river while we fight."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I'll go with you, Ike. Daein would get suspicious if they didn't see any laguz in the enemy force."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Sounds like a plan to me. Take some of my men as well, if you want. I don't want their talons getting dull."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "The Laguz Alliance may have lost the war of might. But we haven't lost the war to save the lives of our brothers! This fight will be ours!"}, {"speaker": "Skrimir", "line": "Yes! With the fangs and wings of the laguz and the knowledge of the beorc, we will return home!"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Daein cannot stop us now, just as they could not stop us during the Mad King's War. We can do this!"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "The laguz failed to cross the river. This is their last chance to try. This time, they'll attack with beorc as well."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Sothe, you know what that means. If we end up fighting beorc..."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "I know. We'll probably be fighting the Greil Mercenaries. I'm aware. It's not going to be pretty."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Sothe. Tell me more about Commander Ike."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Why? You used to hate it when I said anything about him."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "I want to know more about the man I'll be fighting against. What kind of a person is he?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Well, let's see... He's generous. He doesn't care about petty things. He holds no prejudice against laguz, nor does he care about the opinions of the nobles. He's a master swordsman. He accomplishes everything he sets out to do. He's a true hero."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "I see. He sounds...quite different from King Pelleas."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Micaiah, they don't even compare. King Pelleas lacks any leadership or decision-making skills."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "...That may be, but I believe in King Pelleas. His heart is in the right place. I believe in his virtuous nature and his commitment to being a good king..."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Even though he would set you out on a war that doesn't involve Daein at all? A war of bigotry and hate, fighting on the same side as our real enemies? You're smarter than this, Micaiah."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Sothe, we've been through this. I know we're about to fight Ike and the Greil Mercenaries, but I..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It's time. Shall we?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Sigh... Those two are still here. So much for friendly advice, I guess. Now it's friends against friends... Things are getting crazy around here."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Zihark", "line": "The Greil Mercenaries... They really are here. There's no way we can win this. Sorry, guys. I'm turning back for now. I really suggest you all retreat as well."}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "My friends...
