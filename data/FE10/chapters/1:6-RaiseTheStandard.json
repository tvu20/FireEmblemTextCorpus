And so, to protect Marado from a madman, we did not send men to fight for Daein in the war. I doubt you could ever forgive us..."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "No, quite the opposite.

Together, we can reclaim our country."}, {"speaker": "Fiona", "line": "And now, you ask us to bear part of the burden of restoring our motherland? If you would have my lance, then...

If he finds out what has been going on in Daein under our rule..."}, {"speaker": "Numida", "line": "That would not be good. Sephiran's persistent as a mosquito and quick to judge. Though you and I know I have been nothing but fair and just in my rule here...it's best to avoid an inquiry."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "Which leaves us but one recourse... Crush the rebel faction before it grows larger. Exterminate them. Then the commoners, bereft of all hope, will turn their sheep eyes back to us and beg to rejoin the flock."}, {"speaker": "Numida", "line": "I see. Well, I leave the matter in your hands. What funding you need is yours."}, {"speaker": "Jarod", "line": "I'm glad we agree on this. Well then, pardon me, sir, while I tend to our little lambs on the loose."}], "narration": ["The Liberation Army's sweeping victory seems to signal a turn in the war for Daein. However, General Jarod uses his superior numbers to harry the group and threaten their fragile momentum. Begnion has fortified its army with weapons and supplies bought with funds stolen from Daein. Begnion has also purchased the swords of a vast number of mercenaries from these same stolen funds.", "The Liberation Army does not want for willing fighters of its own. However, most are old men and inexperienced boys whose passion far outstrips their skill. The Liberation Army has no choice: it must bolster its ranks if it is to meet Begnion on equal terms. Its only hope lies locked in Begnion's prison camps, where Daein's former soldiers await their rescue."]}
