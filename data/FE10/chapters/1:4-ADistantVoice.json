We\u2019re also looking for someone in the desert. Would you like to come along?"}, {"speaker": "Meg", "line": "Really? Are you sure?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Of course."}, {"speaker": "Meg", "line": "Oh, thank you! I\u2019ve been so lonely since I left Crimea all on my own."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "You came all the way from Crimea? I\u2019m surprised you made it this far."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "That\u2019s it then. Welcome aboard, Meg. You\u2019re one of us now."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Oh, there you are. Can we have a word with you?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Aimee, Muston. How may I help you?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Relax, honey. I\u2019m here to tell you about our business. You like to shop, don\u2019t you?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Let me guess, you want to sell us weapons and other items. Am I right?"}, {"speaker": "Muston", "line": "That\u2019s right. Our inventory changes depending on where we are and what time it is. But one thing is always the same. We guarantee fair prices! So stop by whenever you can."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Do you carry tomes?"}, {"speaker": "Muston", "line": "Yup. Fire, Thunder, Wind, Light\u2026 we\u2019ve got your basics covered."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "My shop also has lots of staves and medicine. Oh, and I have recently made some\u2026key connections. Now I carry some very rare items. They\u2019re one of a kind, and very valuable. You should come have a look! Rare weapons too. Honestly, you should buy them, before someone else does! At these prices, they\u2019re bound to sell quickly."}, {"speaker": "Muston", "line": "Well, that\u2019s our spiel. Thanks for listening."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Do come by! We\u2019ll be waiting."}, {"speaker": "Jorge", "line": "Well, hello! Don\u2019t mind us. We won\u2019t take but a moment of your time\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Hello, Jorge. Hello, Daniel."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "We just wanted to tell you a little about what we can do for YOU."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "I\u2019ve already told her. Jorge will buy from us any items or weapons that we no longer need. And Daniel--"}, {"speaker": "Jorge", "line": "Hey! Excuse me, we\u2019re here to talk to Micaiah! Not to some stuffy, know-it-all pun--"}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Jorge, don\u2019t be rude! I\u2019m sorry about that, Sothe. Anyway, we just wanted to tell you about some changes we made to out business."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "All right, then. I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut as long as Daniel does the talking."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "So, what do you have, Daniel?"}, {"speaker": "Jorge", "line": "Hey, thanks for asking! I\u2019ve got a guy who\u2019s a master blacksmith. He makes weapons you wouldn\u2019t believe\u2026and they\u2019re not available anywhere else!"}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Hey, thanks a lot, Jorge! I make weapons too\u2026pretty good ones, if I do say so myself! It\u2019s just, you know, customs have been extremely tight lately\u2026raw materials are so hard to come by\u2026 Which reminds me, if you ever have weapons you don\u2019t need, would you sell them to us?"}, {"speaker": "Jorge", "line": "Yes, please. Actually, even better\u2026sell me your weapons, and I\u2019ll give them to Daniel. Then he can smelt them down and use the steel for newer, shinier, pieces!"}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "It costs some money to upgrade weapons, but\u2026 But hey, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s worth the money. Owning a custom-made weapon sets you apart from the common soldier!"}, {"speaker": "Jorge", "line": "Oh, and here\u2019s a one-time-only deal! I won\u2019t even charge you for the materials on your first upgrade! Pretty nice, huh? Now you have no excuse not to come by. Got that, Micaiah?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Umm\u2026yes. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "One last thing. If you ever bring me a coin, I\u2019ll give you a little bonus on whatever I\u2019m making for you. They\u2019re very rare, so be sure to hang on to them. Don\u2019t sell them to some stranger!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "What are you doing out here, Kurth?"}, {"speaker": "Kurth", "line": "Hello, Micaiah. Pay me no mind. I\u2019m just watching the desert. How the wind changes the sandscape\u2026The ebb and flow of the dunes, like giant swells in the ocean. I find it mesmerizing."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Is this your first time in the desert?"}, {"speaker": "Kurth", "line": "Yes. My homeland is ringed with mountains. Everything about Daein looks new and curious to my eyes."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "I see."}, {"speaker": "Kurth", "line": "\u2026You have not asked."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "I\u2019m sorry?"}, {"speaker": "Kurth", "line": "You have not asked me who I am or where I am from. Not just you, Micaiah, but the others as well. No one seeks to know who I am."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "You seem to not want to talk about yourself. Am I right?"}, {"speaker": "Kurth", "line": "Yes\u2026 Quite right."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "That\u2019s why no one asks. People can tell when someone wants privacy. Many of us desire privacy too. Kurth, you are not our enemy. I know that much. You\u2019re kind and gentle. That is all I need to know."}, {"speaker": "Kurth", "line": "Thank you\u2026"}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Pain", "line": "Mwah-ha-ha!

It's coming from over there."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Micaiah, wait!"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "You! Hello! Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "I am Rafiel. A voice guided me here. Was it yours?"}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "No. But I heard a voice that guided me here as well. Someone or something may want us both here."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "You're laguz, aren't you? One of the heron clan, and two of the beast tribe. Right?"}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "That is correct, beorc youth."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Your white wings reveal you're of the heron royal family. Are you related to Prince Reyson by any chance?"}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Reyson? My younger brother? You know of him?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "You could say that. We served in the same company for a while."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "What? You are suggesting that my brother is still alive?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Yes. He is still alive. And as far as I know, your father the king and the princess Leanne are as well. Unless something's happened, all three of them live in the royal palace of Gallia, country of the beast tribe."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "Unbelievable! My father and sweet Leanne... They're still with me! Oh, goddess! I'm...not alone. Not anymore... ...Ah..."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "Rafiel..."}, {"speaker": "Volug", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Hello. And you are?"}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "I am Nailah, Queen of Hatari, and this is Volug, my loyal servant. Our kingdom lies far east of here."}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "There's a country on the other side of the desert?"}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "As I said. We have just traveled from there. Until we met Rafiel, we didn't know there were countries on this side of the desert. After all, no one had ever crossed the Desert of Death and lived to tell of it. Without Rafiel's guidance, we would never have survived the crossing."}, {"speaker": "Rafiel", "line": "My people, the heron clan of Serenes, were blamed for the murder of Begnion's empress. Begnion mobs rose up in rage and massacred them. I had thought the whole of my clan, my entire race, had been wiped out. I wandered the desert in despair. If not for the queen, I would have died. In Hatari, I vowed to dedicate my life to her. And yet every night for these past three years, a voice has called out to me. Day by day, it has grown stronger... Until the voice led me to you all. Your news brings such joy! Father...Reyson...Leanne... My beloved family... My thanks to thee, O goddess... Ah..."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "Rafiel... You talk too much. Control yourself. You, beorc... What's the best route to Gallia?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "For a group of laguz, traveling through the Daein countryside would be suicide. It will take you longer, but we could take you as far as Crimea."}, {"speaker": "Nailah", "line": "We would be grateful. By all means, let's travel together. But why go to Crimea? Why not travel directly to Gallia?"}, {"speaker": "Sothe", "line": "Entering Gallia by yourselves would be nearly impossible. The man you need to get you into Gallia actually resides in Crimea. That man, Ike, is in contact with King Caineghis and his advisors. There's no doubt in my mind that he's the man you need."}, {"speaker": "Micaiah", "line": "Right. Lord Ike, \"hero\" of the Crimean Liberation, leader of the Greil Mercenaries, and father of Sothe's children..."}], "narration": ["The history of Tellius is a history of warfare, or so the troubadours sing. It is a history of unending conflict between the beorc and the laguz, a history penned in blood and scarred by mistrust. The beorc fight with the weapons of man--the sword, the axe, the lance, and the magic arts, while the laguz, able to transform into beast, bird, and dragon, are weapons unto themselves. Both were created equally by the goddess, but neither race has ever accepted the other.", "The heron prince Rafiel, the wolf queen of Hatari, Nailah, and her vassal, Volug. Is the Dawn Brigade's meeting with these three chance...or a sign of things to come? Micaiah can only wonder."]}
