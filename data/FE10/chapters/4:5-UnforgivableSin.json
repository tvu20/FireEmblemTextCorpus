When the Mad King heard of his skill, he had Renning kidnapped and gave him the drug that creates Feral Ones. This drug made Duke Renning even stronger, but shattered his mind. He became Bertram, one of Ashnard's infamous Four Riders. After Her Majesty and company defeated him, I had him taken back to my castle. I hoped to find a cure, but I didn't want to raise false hope, Your Majesty, so I kept the secret. However, his mind continued to deteriorate, and there were no signs of improvement. As a last resort, I hired Volke to investigate a way to cure him."}, {"speaker": "Bastian", "line": "Volke quickly discovered that Duke Renning's transformation was engineered by a man called Izuka. This man had made himself an aide to the new king of Daein and was not difficult to locate. Feeling that Renning was running out of time, we kidnapped Izuka to learn more of the condition."}, {"speaker": "Bastian", "line": "Returning to Fayre Castle, we interrogated Izuka at length and discovered more about his experiments. Perhaps unsurprisingly, beorc are affected differently by the drug than laguz. Izuka then offered to create an antidote in exchange for his freedom."}, {"speaker": "Geoffrey", "line": "Did you agree to it?!"}, {"speaker": "Bastian", "line": "We refused without a second thought.

I thought the galdr of rebirth was too powerful and complex for a single heron to perform."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Usually, that's true. Right now, however, Ashera's awakening has infused the world with order; I've never felt stronger. What's more, Lord Renning's condition seems less severe than a true Feral One. I think I can do this."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Well, you're the expert. Just don't go taking unnecessary risks."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "I won't, Tibarn. You needn't worry so much.

Her power gave strength to Prince Reyson and saved Duke Renning's life."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "It's hard to think of her as the bad guy after seeing a thing like that. Goddess Ashera, huh?
