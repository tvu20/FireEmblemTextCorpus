Your Majesty, this is beyond the pale!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I have not forgotten our war with Daein. Three years is not so long as that. But do not forget... If we allow hatred to rule our hearts, we become prisoners of our past. A lasting peace serves both nations."}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "Bravo, Your Majesty, well spoken indeed. Your words paint a picture of idealism rarely seen here at court. However, and I beg your forgiveness, it is quite apparent your grasp of politics remains childishly na\u00efve."}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "Abandoning rule over Daein, then reconciling with our most hated enemy... This will not do. The people will soon take their discontent to the streets."}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "What's more, why choose Bastian, the count of Fayre, as your envoy? His skills in court are vital to Crimea. To send away such a key figure... Tell me, Your Highness, how exactly do you plan to rule without him?"}, {"speaker": "Lucia", "line": "The count of Fayre himself gladly volunteered as a delegate. Her Majesty's decision was only--"}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "Lady Lucia, still your tongue! You are not Her Majesty. Do not presume to speak for her."}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "Yes, Lady Lucia! Please refrain from speaking if you have not been directly addressed. Your familiarity with the queen does not grant you a seat in the royal assembly. Although you may have been raised as a sister to Her Majesty the queen, kindly remember your place!"}, {"speaker": "Lucia", "line": "...You have my apologies."}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "And you, General Geoffrey. Does your loyalty to Her Majesty stem only from your unchecked emotions? Those with a taste for gossip are talking. I wonder, have you heard what the help is saying about you?"}, {"speaker": "Geoffrey", "line": "What?! I..."}, {"speaker": "Lucia", "line": "Geoffrey!"}, {"speaker": "Geoffrey", "line": "Rrgh!"}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "At any rate, growing discontent has brought the royal family of Crimea to a crossroads of sorts. Your Highness... This is all on you."}, {"speaker": "Aristocrat", "line": "Indeed. Your Majesty... Whatever do you intend to do?"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Queen Elincia!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Marcia! How are you today? And what are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Lucia told me about those no-goodnik nobles and their chest-beating contest, so I thought you could use some cheering up. You weren't in your chambers or the garden, so I guessed you would be out here."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Forgive me. I needed some...time to think. I'm sorry to trouble you."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Not at all! After everything you've done for me, it's the least I could do. It was nice of you to hire me as a Royal Knight, but hiring my sponge-brained, spine-deprived brother might qualify you for sainthood!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Even so, I'm afraid I may also have caused you a great number of hardships."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Huh? Oh! The grief I'm getting from the nobles? It's nothing I can't handle. If you think your country has stuffed-shirt windbags for aristocracy, you should see Begnion's! When I was a Pegasus knight there, they had a new shenanigan every week! After that, the Crimean crybabies are no big deal."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "No, it's my fault, and I'm sorry. I'm so new at all this, even you are affected by my blunders. Sometimes, I think... Maybe I just don't have what it takes to be a queen."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "That's so not true! Queen Elincia, anyone can strut around in a queen hat and say she's a ruler, but you always out your people first! Look, it's not that you're doing a bad job, it's just everyone's on edge lately, with Daein getting a new king and all. People are worried that Daein'll start another war like the one three years ago, and they're taking it out on you. Just don't let those peacock-wearing nobles bug you, and remember that you don't have to go it alone. You've got friends everywhere."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Thank you, Marcia. Your kind words have lifted my spirits."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "That's right... I'm not alone. I must be strong, for the sake of our people.

What the heck is going on over there?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Hmm?"}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "H-hey! How dare you harass us! Begone, insolent fools! Begone, I say!"}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "Fear not, my lady. This senile old bird will gladly trade his life for your protection."}, {"speaker": "Begnion", "line": "They say nothing is as beautiful as the herons of Serenes... Especially a royal princess! You'll fetch a pretty penny from some lord or other... And our pockets are a little light. Whaddya say, Captain?"}, {"speaker": "Zeffren", "line": "Yes, naturally. She should prove to make a fine gift. Seize them...and mind the raven's talons!"}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "This is unbelievable! Stand back, you unrepentant dogs! Nealuchi does not give in easily!"}, {"speaker": "Zeffren", "line": "Men, silence that cawing raven. Who would pay for an old crow like that, anyway? Leave him."}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Stop right there!"}, {"speaker": "Zeffren", "line": "Tch... Company. How droll."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Hey, Begnion dracoknights! Are you lost, or have you just been letting those scaly fleabags do your navigating? What're you doing in Crimea's sky?"}, {"speaker": "Zeffren", "line": "...We've merely strayed a bit in our duties patrolling the border. Do you have a problem with that?"}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "You and your flying snakes are in violation of Crimea's sovereignty! Besides, do you have any idea who you're dealing with here, reptile breath?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Marcia, stop. We cannot afford to start antagonizing the Begnion army. I am the queen of Crimea..."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "But, Your Majesty! We can't just let these wyvern monkeys run rampant--"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "And we're not going to. As long as they don't realize I'm the queen, we should be fine."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Begnion dracoknights... You will only be warned once. Leave this area immediately! I serve the queen of Crimea. Trespassers on Crimean territory will be dealt with. No exceptions."}, {"speaker": "Zeffren", "line": "The queen, she says! The very queen that relied on us, the Begnion Empire, to free her nation. Imperial dracoknights are not frightened by soldiers so weak as Crimean pegasus knights. Listen up! Leave those two alone. It's the Serenes maiden we want. Do not allow her to escape!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "...Looks like we'll not talk any sense into them. I suppose we have no choice. Sir Nealuchi! We're here to help you!"}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "I'll be! It's Her Majesty, Queen Elincia! Fate has smiled upon us! I hate to be a bother, considering it has been so long, but... Your assistance is most appreciated."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Haar", "line": "Yaaawn... Boy, I'm bushed. Hey, partner, you tired? How's a nap sound?

After rescuing Chamberlain Nealuchi and Princess Leanne, she invites them to be her guests at the royal court. While Elincia's show of loyalty to her laguz allies causes an uproar among the nobles at court, they are aware that the heron princess is under the mutual protection of the mighty laguz hawk king and raven king. Because of this, there is no public show of distaste.", "However, dissatisfaction with Elincia's rule now spreads from a single faction to a larger group. Crimea's unity is slowly rotting from within. This discord begins to be felt even in country hamlets like the farming village of Ohma."]}
