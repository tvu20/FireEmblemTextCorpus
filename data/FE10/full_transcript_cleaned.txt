that must be 
 the tower of guidance its so bright i can hardly bear to look at it whats happening in there
lets hurry ike i cant imagine that the glowing is a good omen were running out of time
the city gate is shut i guess well have to force it to get to the tower  
ahh you guys made it
skrimir i didnt realize your group had already arrived
yes weve been here for quite some time ive been itching to go inside and see what the bad guys have waiting for us
skrimir listened to reason however and agreed to wait here with us we know nothing about the numbers or strength of the enemy
it seemed safest to wait here for the rest of you to show up we pitched tents outside the gate
hello micaiah any word from yune
she came back to me a number of times during our trip but nothing for the past few days 
i see  do we know where tibarn and elincias group is
no word yet no ike its a waste for us to just sit around waiting why dont you and i have a look inside
wait whats happening
get ready for an attack people
caineghis what are you doing here
in an occurrence im told is increasingly common we heard a voice in our dreams and followed it here
and lord tibarn i should have guessed your group would beat everyone here
we joined up with king caineghis and mopped up the disciples of order around the capital
the only people left within the city are the ones who have been petrified
good i like air breathers with initiative
yune here to give us our next instructions
yes good guess everyone gather around youll all need to hear this
good job everyone all three teams got here and a little faster than i thought you would while you were traveling i went around recruiting more help including king caineghis here unfortunately it looks like ashera had the same idea by the time i made my way to goldoa there was no one there
wh what do you mean where were they
if youre saying what i think youre saying then we could have a very big problem lots of very big problems
i dont know for sure tibarn there arent a whole lot of dragons altogether but  it looks like every one of them joined ashera
how how could this be
i havent seen them anywhere else on tellius so they must already be inside the tower lets camp for the night before walking into asheras own home
 what can i do for you goddess yune
youre very strange what are you
thats a strange question especially coming from you didnt you create all of us
i didnt create anything not laguz nor beorc but i know what they are because ive watched them change and grow over time you  youre not something ive seen before
im the same as the girl you dwell inside
ohhh  i thought micaiah was the only one she could hear my voice and sing the galdr of release but i learned that others existed theres that boy whos always with ike or the little girl who stays by the queen of crimea
there are several in my village as well they are my comrades we all live under the safe fate and carry the same curse in our blood
when you say these words what do they mean why are you cursed
it means that we carry the blood of both beorc and laguz beorc call us branded and laguz call us parentless
does that mean your parents are beorc and laguz
not always it means that laguz and beorc mixed blood somewhere along the line beorc and laguz rarely associate in that way for them to conceive a child together is an even rarer event whats strange is that the child bears no laguz characteristics its just a normal beorc infant however the laguz blood lies asleep waiting in the childs veins
oh 
one day the laguz blood shows itself marking the childs body with a brand how old is that girl hmm i dont think shes as young as she looks the other curse is that we age differently from beorc it depends on what laguz blood the child has but it always slows how fast we age
micaiah says thats true shes listening to every word you say please continue
the laguz blood gives the branded unnatural powers beorc fear and distrust us because they cant understand those abilities the laguz are even worse they treat us like were phantoms refusing to acknowledge us as if we dont exist
i see 
its easy to hide among beorcs you just cover the brand avoid getting close to anyone and never settle down pretending youre normal the laguz are different they can sense what we are  they have an instinct for it not all laguz know for sure but the sharp ones figure it out instantly others just feel uneasy around us some never figure it out but theyre surrounded by ones who do either way the laguz would never talk to us voluntarily why would you pay attention to someone who doesnt even exist
why that doesnt make any sense how did things get like that
i would like to know that as well its said that a union between laguz and beorc is a crime against the goddess thats what weve always been told
thats silly ive never heard anything of the sort
 heh  heheh  hahahahaha 
why are you laughing
its all been a lie for hundreds of years weve faced persecution abuse and isolation and for what a lie whats not to laugh about huh hahaha 
whats happened this is all wrong  how did history get so distorted was it at a particular place and time i dont understand ive been asleep for too long 
almedha youre safe
kurthnaga 
al whats wrong youre so pale and youve grown so thin 
oh pelleas  my little pelleas  why tell me why
almedha almedha you have to pull yourself together
prince kurth are you there
im busy ena stay where you are
oh
 ena its been a long time i felt your presence nearby but you never came to see me 
lady almedha 
i understand that you dont want to see me im sure you hate me for what ive done my brother rajaion  your betrothed  he died because of me
dont its not important thats all in the past 
 what how can you pretend like nothing happened you cant i know you hate me you have to hate me go ahead blame me for what happened insult me do anything but you have to hate me
 i dont hate you almedha rajaion made his decision he gave his life to save you and his little nephew did you know that he decided to sacrifice himself to protect you i cant blame you for what rajaion decided to do that would mean insulting my beloved for his sacrifice  for his nobility
sniff  sniff  sniff 
prince kurth my grandfather is here to see you the king knows nothing of this visit
nasir is here
prince kurthnaga i am glad to see that you are safe and lady almedha as well it has been a long time we havent seen each other in over ninety years i believe
nasir  you returned to goldoa
yes
nasir i need to know something why has goldoa sided with goddess ashera what is father thinking the laguz and beorc have joined together to save the petrified why hasnt goldoa joined the effort
as you wish lady almedha  are you aware of the fact that everything thats happening is due to your decision to leave goldoa
 what
explain nasir
king dheginsea forbade the dragon tribe to use our transformation for the purpose of war almedha you left because you did not agree with this policy did you not
thats right
shortly after you left goldoa you met ashnard in daein and were united with him however your union begat a chain of tragedies did you know that the red dragon platoon which went in search of you was captured and turned into feral ones by king ashnard
i i had no idea
ashnard needed goldoa to get involved in his war thats why he did everything in his power to provoke king dheginsea most of you have never fought in a war but even more than other laguz the dragon tribe loses control once they taste battle
oh 
near the end of the war we found out that prince rajaion could not be saved i thought the king would surely go on a rampage at the time we had no idea that lady almedha was still alive the king thought hed lost not only dragon soldiers but also his children
 
if the war had ended any later  had ike not killed ashnard  goldoa would have joined the war and we would have started killing we would have destroyed the daein army its coconspirators everyone we would not have stopped until the continent was ashes then the spirit of chaos would have spread across tellius awakening the goddess and destroying the dragon tribe that was the danger we faced in the mad kings war
 
but ashnard was defeated and rajaion regained his sanity thanks to the songs of the heron clan
 sniff bwuah  sniff 
we escaped annihilation once we took prince rajaions body back to goldoa and the king did not shed a tear nor fly into a rage he endured his loss by himself he endured for the sake of his last child and for the sake of his people goldoa remained neutral
father 
but now  all that effort has been wasted the war between the laguz alliance and begnion has spread through daein and crimea and to top it all off goldoa can no longer stay neutral because of what prince kurthnaga has done
youre saying this is my fault  that ive started a war that my father tried to avoid
no kurthnaga this was my fault you fought because of me
this was not prince kurths fault besides the goddess yune was not awakened by chaos sweeping across tellius she was awakened by the galdr of release
by a galdr are you certain
yes that was what sir ike said
thats very strange nevertheless the end result remains the same goddess ashera has rendered her judgment the laguz and beorc must follow her decision
what  nasir
ive come here as a favor to the king prince kurthnaga you have to return to us at once
if we just accept asheras judgment well all be turned to stone thats the end of history as we know it do you expect me to just lie down and accept that how can i what youre asking is insanity i wont do it
and you ena
i feel the same as prince kurth
then i have nothing more to say to you however i hope to avoid fighting my own people if at all possible
nasir 
 what will you do on the battlefield kurth will you face your father as an enemy
 i will do whatever i have to
oh no
yune what is it whats happening
this isnt good 
these soldiers  weve killed them already theyve been reborn in flesh but not spirit
brought back from the dead 
a miracle of the goddess 
a blasphemy you mean how could the goddess of order violate the most fundamental natural law
philosophy later everyone theyre about to attack
are you all right those dead soldiers really got to you didnt they
 we cant win all we do is kill the flesh but she brings the flesh back  we need more time  no there is no more time everyone else will be turned to stone and i will be lonely forever theres nothing more that i can do ive failed  ive failed
yune get a hold of yourself
ouch my ears
wh what was that for you big bully who do you think i am
yune the goddess of chaos  the warmhearted being whose courage and love gives us the will to go on
ike  thank you
as things stand we cant bring everyone into the tower well need support here to hold this position but at the very least how many are we going to need inside
theyll have much stronger forces inside the tower not to mention ashera herself well send in our best 11 oh and well want the two dragons  and one from the heron tribe  and uh the empress plus it wouldnt hurt to have sothe
understood if thats everyone ill gather them together
 and once we get inside you can leave most of the fighting to micaiah
something like this should work
were ready
all right everyones almost ready who would you like to bring from the heron tribe
rafiel  would you join us
of course i am honored
reyson  would you join us
gladly ill give you everything ive got
leanne  would you join us
 i i do best fighting
all right tower of guidance here we come
its so quiet is the goddess here
uh huh shes at the top be careful everyone this tower is asheras home territory shes certain to have her most powerful troops waiting for us up ahead we must proceed with the utmost caution
hm
so you were companion to the very first empress altina i am honored that you have chosen to speak with me
you would trust in the word of a stranger
yes i can see inside you i know you cannot speak lies
is it possible do you share some aspect of my power
i do as did my mother  generation after generation each apostle has been blessed to hear the voice of the goddess we know of impending disasters how crops will fare  all revelations originally intended for you
the children of my union with altina  i had no idea 
please look at this
that mark 
all of the apostles have born this brand it is our greatest secret the senators must never know because of this brand i thought that i had been born of some great sin it plagued me always guilt tore at me every day as i hid my mark from my people deceiving them constantly about my true nature
oh child how can i apologize to you
and yet now that ive met you i understand there is no shame in my heritage none at all i will not live in hiding i will reveal to the world that i am one of the branded they must see there is no shame in who i am
no you mustnt you dont understand the danger you will be placing yourself in
oh but i do the senators will do their utmost to rally the people against me as they did when i freed the laguz from slavery but i will not be deterred if i am to lead this nation i cannot allow it to be corrupted by prejudice and hatred i can put the life the goddess has given me to no greater good than this
 such determination your eyes  they very much resemble altinas
i will stand before my people and proudly proclaim the truth and then i will guide them to a just and honest future this is my promise to you
thank you your strength of will the truth that guides your life  you have shown me the way back to myself i shall return to goldoa and tell my friends of you and your actions i will tell them that laguz and beorc may once again live together in peace i will tell them that there is hope
thank you father of my mothers i strive to be worthy of the gift of live you have granted me
 what was that someones  was it someones memory
what is it
sorry oh i  dont worry it was nothing all right then  our path leads through that door there
 
well well  apostle sanaki what a surprise seeing you here frankly im amazed that you of all people would dare to set foot inside the most holy tower of guidance
lekain  weve been looking for you for a long time you bound daein to your awful pact hounded noble king pelleas and stole countless lives in your appalling war you are beyond redemption
beyond redemption my that does sound awful whatever will you do with me oh and let me remind you the blood pact is still in effect you would do well to remember that i think you know what will happen to the people of daein if you should dare oppose me
enough we fear your threats no longer no more will we bow to your every whim now that weve found you we will exact justice upon you then destroy the blood pact itself ending its power over us
so you figured it out did you heh heh  it matters not this changes nothing do you hear me here is the scroll for which youve been searching so diligently right here in my hands
ah
and yet none of you will ever lay one grimy little finger upon it i have been blessed by the goddess herself her protection will not allow you fleas to even approach me
lekain cease this travesty of virtue at once
what have we here oh yes the apostle excuse me child but i had completely forgotten you were here since youve deigned to grace us with your exalted presence dear apostle let me share a bedtime story with you
the year was 640 begnion era  the empire had been without an apostle for 15 long years the senators were being constantly harassed with complaints from the people there had been nothing like it in history the voices calling for young sanaki to be crowned grew louder every day  you had just turned five years old when the senate welcomed you to the throne as the new apostle ah but my young mistress sanaki what a difficult child you were you threw tantrums you screamed and cried constantly your conduct was hardly befitting an empress of begnion everyone was at a loss  you wouldnt even stop mewling and crying during official proceedings but then along came our youngest senator ever sephiran duke of persis when he took you in his arms you immediately stopped crying you even smiled we had to take advantage of this obvious miracle in an unprecedented move by the senators we elevated sephiran to prime minister keeping him serving as close to you as possible this plan radical as it was proved far more effective than we dared dream a young handsome prime minister and an adorable moppet of an apostle brought the peoples support to incredible new heights apparently the common citizenry is gullible enough to blindly follow any leader who is sufficiently attractive enamored as they were no one ever seemed to care whether or not you could hear the voice of the goddess with the new apostle and prime minister the political landscape became unrecognizable even in the face of overtly unreasonable legislation the two of you would stand on the balcony  a smile and a wave later the people would cheer and go on with their happy lives
 
it was too good to be true however both of you were only meant to be puppets each year you interfered with our government more and more imposing your soft hearted ideals over our sovereign rights were such trivialities as laguz slavery and the daein occupation worth making issues of the pair of you were becoming an increasingly bothersome thorn in our side and then this war against the laguz forces  you went so far as to expose our previous indiscretions and demand reparations for the sub humans this was unforgivable clearly you both had to be removed sephiran would be falsely accused and jailed necessitating his removal from office the apostle would suffer a sudden illness and be excused from official proceedings or so we intended 
and somehow despite the extraordinary plans of great me here you are standing before my very eyes
if sephiran and i hadnt been freed  you were just waiting for your chance to kill us just as you killed my grandmother
out of respect for the imminently deceased ill be completely honest yes you assume correctly your assassination and the plot to once again frame the serenes herons for it was entirely my idea
yes  i thought as much
impressive sanaki when you were first crowned you would have cried your little eyes out youve grown slightly
lekain duke of gaddos before the 37th empress of begnion  prepare to be judged
an amusing game child truly but you must know that there is nothing you can do against me i am the greatest servant of the all knowing almighty ashera i am her chosen champion and you sanaki are a pathetic wretch mewling behind her pack of daein curs asheras judgment is upon you you will not live to be turned to stone  you will die here as flesh and blood
ta ha haaa bathe in my radiance
there can be no forgiveness for my hand in these evil deeds salvation is denied me and my stained soul my torment will be eternal
i dont understand any of you how can you oppose the goddess its only natural that people live to please the gods the weak follow the strong
strong weak  it doesnt matter i fight on the side of my conscience and have yet to regret my battles
wait  i remember you  you were one of the dracoknights that fled to daein defying the senators  you opposed the almighty begnion and the word of the goddess  why why would you defy such power
you could live another lifetime and youd still never understand
hetzel  i had thought that you alone might be above lekains foul conspiracy it saddens me to see you at his side
n no apostle sanaki i  
i didnt ask for excuses you fight alongside lekain thats more proof than ill ever need
 you are right i fight with him i had no choice but please understand that ive always done my best to honor and respect your majesty
then how do you explain my confinement in mainal cathedral
i i didnt do anything it was all lekain i didnt know anything about it and only heard later 
and when you did hear of it why didnt you stop it
i couldnt actually i could have but i didnt say anything it was the same with misaha and the serenes massacre  i 
 didnt say anything in other words you stood by as my grandmother and the serenes people were killed
p please forgive me 
rafiel  rafiel im sorry
 
i did a horrible thing i have lived in the shadow of my regret for many years now please tell me that you can find it in yourself to forgive me please 
i 
rafiel  i was kind to you was i not i didnt treat you like a slave i always watched over you so kindly be kind in return and forgive me rafiel
 im sorry i  i dont have anything to say to you
no rafiel 
so youre hetzel huh rafiel told me about you
thats right  yes  im  im the one who saved his life hes still alive because of me
ancient history doesnt change the fact that youre fighting against him now and if fight him you fight me
it is not too late child to surrender and accept asheras grace you can win favor in her eyes by abandoning her enemies
surrender i wouldnt dare accept the grace of a goddess that turns her worshippers to stone
some things simply cant be helped you and i are alive and we should be thankful for that
i have a feeling that were not going to be able to come to terms on this
l lord lekain help help me
as payment for taking care of rafiel when i couldnt ill make this quick
you look so much like rafiel  is there anything in the world so beautiful as a serenes heron
i was born this way and mere birth is not praiseworthy praise me instead for my strength what i look like is irrelevant so long as i have the power to protect my friends
oh oh my a fair heron maiden i thought they were all gone 
 
w wait dont run away dont just run away
d duke tanas youve betrayed us but why
you could never understand the depth of my commitment to beauty sometimes it simply overwhelms me i cant stop the love welling up inside id do anything to keep the hideous likes of you from my precious birds
senator hetzel do i understand correctly that you oppose apostle sanaki alongside vice minster lekain
th thats absurd vice minster lekain oppose the apostle im just  im just following orders
senator hetzel duke of asmin you are guilty of treason against our empress
no thats a lie i never did anything wrong 
mortals cannot measure up to gods any child knows as much why do you not kneel before her
that would be throwing away my own beliefs to live a life of blind obedience i stopped doing that three years ago and ive never looked back
wait please  i never wanted to fight  im here only because i was ordered
then surrender your weapon
i i cannot do that i would fall into disgrace with vice minister lekain
 
save me my goddess  help 
knight of daein i am lekain of gaddos your ruler king pelleas will  
you can stop it right there daein will never bow down to you again
why is it that authority figures are always so unwilling to let go of their power the world could flip upside down and youd be trying to boss around gravity
you clearly know nothing of me lout to oppose me is to oppose the goddess ashera herself
thats strange  i always thought that role was filled by the apostle but who can keep up these days so youre defending the goddess but will she do the same for you
youre quite tenacious for a heron i thought your entire fragile race had been exterminated 
evil  you are pure evil i hear it in your heart how do you even survive
how pathetic hated by a heron the only sub human so weak as to actually be incapable of violence this must feel just like the massacre to you completely helpless before your inevitable doom
im glad i got to you first see i heard that the serenes massacre was all your doing  that puts you at the very top of the list of the enemies of the bird tribes
that may very well be but i am under the divine protection of the goddess herself a shabby sub human pirate like yourself will find me quite invincible
as much as id love to draw this little chat out i dont think i can keep my talons out of your neck another instant
why  why are you laughing are you enjoying yourself
some of us here are just overflowing with the chaos youre causing with this fight that might be part of it  but to be honest theres a part of me that can hardly believe how much fun tearing your head off will be
no
tah ha ha  how delightfully pathetic poor heron prince teeming with rage but incapable of hurting me tah ha ha ha how absolutely marvellous
your soul  is deeply scarred 
ah interesting youre one of those sub humans from the east that ive been hearing about
and youre one of the fat corrupted pieces of filth that were fighting
how dare you i am duke of gaddos
gaddos wheres that that name means nothing to me how do beorc always get the idea that the place theyre from is the center of everything
silence you loathsome cur ill ensure that your country is left in ruins
eep its you wheres tibarn when you need him 
the lovely heron maiden  if not for the battle raging around us id keep you as a  trophy
duke of tanas  whats gotten into you why are you fighting with these mercenary scum
i am oliver champion of beauty you would harm my precious feathered angels that makes you my enemy unsightly man  prepare yourself
have you finally gone stark mad who exactly do you think youre blathering at
lekain duke of gaddos  dont bother with any of your practiced lies speak with your weapon
dame sigrun  i suppose im not surprised i should have known you would still be on sanakis leash have you asked yourself why she is a mere pretender to the throne youre just a dog to a false apostle
correct me if im wrong lord lekain but sanaki was formally recognized by the senators as the empress where in begnion law is an empress required to also be an apostle this sounds like yet another case of you senators trying to twist the law for your own benefit
bah your legalistic manipulations dont make you right
for too long we have tolerated you bending laws for your own benefit with no foundation whatsoever in justice now its time for you to pay for your sins
impudence you cant beat me  i am the chosen one
hmph  hello tanith how odd to find you alongside these imbeciles not to mention their imposter of a leader
silence your filthy mouth i will not brook such insults
f  fi  filthy how dare you slander the duke of gaddos i will rule the world in place of our goddess ashera sanaki is not a true apostle or an empress shes a mere slip of a girl
there is no begnion law that requires an empress to also be an apostle
whaaat
each apostle has thus far been seated as emperor only because that has been what served the senators best sanaki has ruled successfully without the benefit of divine inspiration for more than half her life she is well loved by her subjects saying that she is not a true apostle will do nothing to alter that fact
dogmatic rhetoric will achieve nothing
very true empress sanaki is my liege and as her knight it is my duty to destroy her enemies
blasphemy striking me is no different than raising your sword to our goddess
speaking of dogmatic rhetoric  duke of gaddos farewell
lord lekain 
hm you  you are from house damiell 
yes i am its been a while but i didnt think youd forget me quite so easily i wasnt sure at the time but marrying you would have been the biggest mistake of my life
ha bold talk from a penniless mercenary you were never worthy of lekain of gaddos head of the senators and chosen by the goddess herself
vi vice minister lekain 
hm ahhh still alive are we i suppose that i can still find a use for you  i know go and attack the enemy general
um 
why are you not obeying fool that look on your face  you think youre going to save your people that is precious you cant possibly believe that one so flawed as yourself has a prayer against me
i do actually
whaaat did i hear you correctly
i said i believe i believe in myself and i believe in my companions even if i falter and fail  my friends will defeat you this belief sustains me i can fight you because i am no longer alone
let us test your theory then die upstart
burn traitor
watch your tongue girl
 
hm who are you how did a shabby little burglar get in here
if thats how you want to see me then so be it but know that thats also how i see you i dont think we even need to exchange names ill just kill you and leave it at that
ah the so called silver haired maiden both dark goddess and daein general  your very existence is vile beyond belief
lekain duke of gaddos  you crushed the people of daein beneath your unjust rule and dragged us into a futile war how do you live with the guilt of your sins
sins do not presume to speak to me of sin child of daein if only you had understood that i am on the side of the angels you might be standing with me here today
your delusions cant change what i see in your twisted soul demon now give me that scroll
impudent brat
tah ha ha  so nice to see you king naesala when you cant oppose me that is your blood pact means that youll have to betray your companions  yet again
not today actually
what did you say
sorry to break it to you lekain but i have recently  been promoted shall we say i now take orders from over your head vice minister from empress sanaki to be exact
wh what whaaaat  
the curse of the blood pact applies if the masters orders arent obeyed but by the law of begnion youre overruled so lekain right here right now  im going to tear you apart as ive been wanting to do for years
urk
tah ha ha laughable mercenaries sanaki could certainly have chosen better allies if only she had sided with me she wouldnt be damned now oh well 
yeah whoever chose you as an ally has had better days too so who is it whos pulling your strings
pulling my strings what are you saying i alone have been chosen to protect her i masterminded the plan to resurrect the goddess and become asheras chosen one it is my right mine alone
really i didnt see you around when the galdr of release was sung to the medallion 
what medallion what nonsense are you talking about
wow  you dont have any idea whats really going on do you mastermind im just wasting my time
you  you urghh i am lekain duke of gaddos the one and only
this  this cant be  i was  i was chosen 
king pelleas this is it lekain was carrying it its  its the blood pact
at long last  we finally found it all that misery daein has suffered over this wretched parchment  but this is the last thing we need now we can free daein of the senates tyranny micaiah savior of daein  would you do the honors and destroy that damned thing
of course 
 whew 
thats it
yes and now no one has to die
thank goodness 
micaiah sothe  you have my deepest gratitude
hey look theres another pact here lekain was carrying two of them whats going on
oh  ill hang on to this
empress sanaki
i promised to return this to its proper owner raven king naesala because of this he was forced to serve under lekain and he had to turn against his allies 
so kilvas too
yes lekains treachery ran deep at least its finally over im happy for everyone
as am i
and yet daein and kilvass newfound freedom is wasted on the statues that call them home we still must confront the goddess
well spoken we cant stop until everyone is truly free come the goddess awaits
lekain  to think that the warped dreams of one treacherous madman could corrupt an entire nation 
apostle are you well
so you still insist on calling me apostle i think were past that ike
so what should i call you miss sanaki
how rude you have no right to address me with such familiarity please call me empress
got it empress
you dont have to say it like that loosen up a bit
oh give me a break 
you creatures are made of some tough meat i dont think that girl even needs to hear the divine word do you
yune youre a bit of a mystery yourself it almost sounds like youre happy to se that people dont necessarily need you
the one constant truth of people ike is that nobody can stop them from changing people sometimes do things that even the highest divinities couldnt imagine that makes me sad but that also makes me very happy thats why i love people so much
there are some changes that goddesses cant even predict or control maybe ashera resented that
i dont know  but i do know that ashera loved people im sure of it 
were almost there tomorrow we head to the tower
do not worry your majesty we will be right beside you
though long tested by the trials of the goddess ashera we shall overcome and our mission will be laid to rest
yes what we do now we do not only for the people of crimea but for all the people of tellius
yes  we shall succeed
you are a courageous queen indeed

thats true  its like a weight has been lifted off my chest why dont we follow them we should enjoy our final night together
of course your majesty
ike i have something to give you

its called urvan if i remember correctly i borrowed it from your fathers grave
why
honestly i have no idea but i felt a sudden urge to visit greils grave on the morning of our journey when i told giffca my idea for a little side trip he said he thought the same thing
i believe we were guided to your fathers grave by a divine message from the goddess
when i saw your fathers axe i was convinced that i had to take it to you i felt thats what your father would have wanted
 maybe he and my mother are looking over us from somewhere else all right its my fathers so its only right that i take it
volke 
over here
looking for you is still like trying to find spilled ink at night
its part of the job anyways  youve grown quite a bit since the last time i saw you
everyone loves telling me that
youre starting to look like greil
that might be true too he is my dad i didnt expect to see you here did someone from this camp hire you
sure did
i see its good to have you on our side under any circumstances why did you call me over
i have to return something to you
what the  whats all this money for
its the 50000 gold you paid me the last time around well minus my pay expenses and that sort of thing of course
even so theres a lot here
well the contract ended sooner than expected i guess
you did a lot for us back then i didnt even get a chance to thank you
it was a job theres no need to thank me
i know but if you hadnt told me the story of my father i would never have known about his past so thanks volke
uh yeah so anyhow  you have your money back see you later
did he really just get embarrassed because i thanked him what a weird guy
/***EOF***/
ahem as general staff officer of daeins liberation army allow me to outline my latest strategy
excuse me but shouldnt prince pelleas be here
theres no need to distract the prince with the wars petty details he wont be coming to any more meetings from now on consider my words the princes own
im not sure thats  
enough idle chatter come have a glance my pretties
our next target shall be umono among all the work camps it is one of the largest
conditions within the prison camp are harsh if we are to save the prisoners every moment matters
one of the largest work camps  can our forces handle that
 suck a trivial concern and one my profound genius has already addressed behold this lake next to the camp that provides fresh water to all there into this lake we shall dump a deadly toxin of my own devising then well sit back as the enemy slowly dies
what are you saying poison is inexcusably vile i will agree to no such plan
wha wha what was that you you how dare you question my plan conceived in a state of exalted meditation
no matter how misguided the enemy may be we must fight with compassion and consideration for the innocent
shes right poison doesnt discriminate prisoners would die too and any nearby villages would be affected and then what would happen people would doubt us question our cause maybe even side against us and it would cast a stain on prince pelleass name dont you think
errrrrgh  fine then do as you like and when you find yourselves utterly defeated you can come crawling back to me
my apologies to both of you when lord izuka gets excited he can lose all sight of reason
i apologize too general tauroneo he stormed out because i  
you neednt apologize you are in the right i would never condone the use of poison however this does mean we must devise another plan if we are to have any hope of victory
yes youre right in that case what do you think of this strategy
sorry to call you here like this forgive me
its quite all right
can i pour you some tea or is there something else you would prefer
im fine thank you what did you want to speak with me about
i know you are angry with me please forgive me
can you tell me why you stopped showing up at our meetings
it was at izukas request
you are the leader of this army you cannot simply leave all the decisions to someone else
 im sorry ill ask izuka before the next meeting i need his permission to attend
why youre the prince why should you need any mans permission much less your own advisors
yes i am the prince but i owe much to izuka he taught me everything i needed to know to become a proper member of the royal family he contacted tauroneo and the other senators from daein for help without his power and influence i would never have mustered an army  or met my own mother
i see you were alone 
pardon
and then izuka reunited you with your mother gave you a place to stay and provided you with a reason to live and you feel you owe him a debt of gratitude for ending your loneliness that is why you try to do as you are told  as izuka wishes
micaiah youre  
im sorry i didnt mean to   that was inappropriate
youre amazing
amazing
you really can read minds im simply amazed you saw right through me
 
sorry i got too excited look at me im sweating
prince pelleas
what is it why are you looking at me like that
that mark 
oh that
what is it
its called the spirits protection the source of all magic in this world is tied to the power of the spirits when you make a pact with such a spirit its power manifests on your body like this
i see
what am i saying you already know all of this of course you have the spirits protection too
what
i saw you washing your hands the other day when i walked up to you to say hello is aw the mark on your right hand
you saw 
i thought of confiding in you right away but my mother called for me i didnt get a chance to tell you until now
do you think this mark is really the spirits protection
oh you didnt enter into the pact yourself
no
i see so it must have been the spirit who wished to make a pact with you
pardon
its a very rare phenomenon among newborns usually it happens to infants who have an exceptional talent for magic you truly are amazing micaiah
i dont know about that 
lets keep this among ourselves  we dont want people to confuse us with the branded
what are the branded
im pretty sure it refers to beorc who have laguz blood in their veins i know its hard to imagine someone with the blood of a sub human running through their veins anyway ive been terribly mistreated by people who thought i was one of the branded
 
micaiah
oh sorry i think i understand more about you now and about the marks we share 
im glad i was able to tell you im surprised you didnt know come talk to me again sometime
certainly
oh i almost forgot here i wanted to give you this
what is it
its this splendid sword i recently acquired it gives its wielder the upper hand in battle keep it or give it to whomever you like
shouldnt you give it to the soldier you deem most worthy
no i wouldnt want the soldiers thinking im giving anyone special treatment it would be inappropriate thats what izuka says anyway so i think you should do it
i understand you must have so much on your mind
indeed i long for the hold days when i was poor but had few worries
prince pelleas 
but ill keep fighting i wont stop until daein is free once more
hear hear
h hello 
oh hello there
h h hello
yes hello now that we have that established what can i do for you
um  uh  i  im meg
yes i know its nice to meet you meg thats a very nice name
and uh  im from crimea
yep im one step ahead of you heard that too youre far away from home now arent you quite an independent girl eh
um and my village  its called ohma
oh youre from ohma now thats something i didnt know
yes
then you must know brom  hold on a second  you look exactly like him are you two related
we sure are im his daughter his youngest daughter
oh ive heard stories he loves to tell stories about his kids he said that you could lift a full grown cow its nice to meet the person ive heard so much about how is brom doing well
yes yes he is he works all the time i do wish he would slow down 
ah yes well its good to hear hes staying busy brom huh wow brings back memories  well if youre his daughter ill do whatever i can do help you you said you were looking for somebody who is this person
well  hes my  hes my fiance
how could any guy leave a girl like you whats this lucky guys name whats he like
well hes standing right in front of me
im sorry im sure i misheard you can you repeat that  slowly
my daddy told us years ago that he was going to marry one of us to a really nice friend of his a mercenary named zihark
whoa hey now i dont uh 
but my older sister got married last year and so i came instead oh its so nice to finally meet my husband
meg look this is kind of crazy 
zihark  im sure i still have a lot to learn  but after meeting you i just know well live happily ever after
meg i need you to listen very closely 
oh dont worry ill work hard every waking moment to become a good wife even during a fight see you later pookums
meg wait wow shes downright pushy she must get that from her old man  and did she just call me pookums
what an enemy attack
yes sir the liberation army has mounted an assault on the gate we require reinforcements
hmph they seek to free their men my elite guard shall stay here with me take the rest to squash these rebels
but sir if your guard remains here well have barely enough men to  
who do you think youre talking to soldier with my guard and me at the ready this camp need fear no attack understood now go you have your orders
looks like tauroneo has them distracted theyve left only a small force here to defend the camp itself
perfect that should make it easier for us to eliminate their defenses seize the camp and free the prisoners
what do you think muarim is that the building sothes in
most likely little one
so are we gonna help them or should we just stand here all day and twiddle our thumbs
what do you think were helping of course keep up muarim come on vika
hey boss wait a second ill be  hes already out of sight how does he do that on those skinny beorc legs
who do you think taught him how to run wed better go after him
sooooo  ooothe
huh what 
eh
have no fear tormod is here im coming to your rescue
tormod you crazy fool 
time for the trusty hero to save the day i see still quite the showman eh tormod
its more like a reunion every moment now if haar were just here 
all right lets go wild
ah eyahhhhhhh sub human its a sub human
calm down just use fire magic for the beasts and wind for the birds thatll do the trick that child hasnt transformed yet nab him before he does
fool transforming aint what i do but i can do this 
he hes a mage fall back dont get too close to him
who in the world are they
people i used to know ill introduce you later but for now lets concentrate on the fight
hey tormod
you what in blazes did you do you scurvy traitor
what are you talking about
you grew too tall
and to think i expected you to make sense i have more important things to tend to
hey its important to me
what id really like to hear about is that issue i asked you to look into  how did it go
i have news to report but theres no time to chat in the thick of a fight ill tell you later
hey drat
ah hello its been a while
little sothe  youve grown up
why does everybody keep saying that
hmm
you know little
oh sorry i guess i have to respect your manly pride now
yes please or something like that
sir sothe will that do
sothe will do just sothe
im afraid i could never speak so familiarly with my little ones good friend so with your permission  sir sothe
no that doesnt  ohhh never mind
muarim do you remember me
indeed i do jill
im glad so why are you in daein
youll have to ask the little one i merely trail around after him
i see i will ask him thank you for helping us today
it is an honor
tormod
if it isnt jill
thanks for fighting beside us its a big help
ah its nothing
how did you happen to 
an enemy excellent leave him to me
there he goes  at least some things never change
hey there tormod youre looking well
so youre here too eh zihark
polished your mage skills over the last few years i see
but of course ill toast anyone who dares oppose me
really well then why dont you take on the rest of the guards while i sit back and take a break
you know what i mean get back here and fight like you mean it zihark
muarim
zihark has it been three years
first crimea now daein never a dull day still its good to fight with you again
you can say that again
ok its good to fight with you again
beorc humor is so odd but you know i feel the same
y you really came to save us thank you oh thank you you have no idea how scared ive been im so glad i didnt give up we knew the maiden of miracles would free us
thank you im saved i couldnt have held on any longer  im going to make a run for it i refuse to die in this pit of despair i choose to live and return to my family
this isnt a dream i can really leave this miserable cage oh thank you thank you youve saved my life
youre the liberation army ive heard about you  ill never forget my debt to you if i survive and make it home i vow to devote the rest of my life to your cause ill fight for daein honor like you do
errrrrgh  blundering through like a bull in a china shop  come closer so i can shatter your ambition like glass i will beat into your very bones just who rules this land
they were worthless trivial  only scum of daein  how how  could that filth have 
we are the daein liberation army we demand you free the hostages  or face the consequences
of all the ridiculous  all of you pigs from daein will be our slaves til you die its your destiny what need have swine for freedom swine are happier being kept and consumed
if thats how you really feel then 
s see here sothe who were those three and where did they come from will they join my liberation army
they are my personal acquaintances from begnion and yeah they can handle themselves in a fight but if any more laguz join us there will be problems weve managed to hide volug and his true nature but with more laguz it will surely get out
any such backlash can be extinguished with proper punishment but laguz  theyre powerful  just what we need by all means invite them to join
theyre good friends im sure theyll agree to help if i ask  but  isnt it the prince  and not you  who should make those decisions
question me not young sothe my words are the princes words you need to understand that isnt that right my prince
ah ah yes thats right you should do as izuka wishes
i see
im glad you see now quickly quickly go talk to your friends and see to it you dont foul up
how did you get here so soon more importantly how did the investigation go
it went great in fact we finished up so quickly that we flew here to back you up in case you needed help
um 
oh sorry i havent introduced myself yet youre micaiah i take it im tormod three years back sothe and i were in the crimean army sorta we fought side by side as mercenaries under ike
of course general ike again
i beg your pardon
nothing dont mind me so anyway what is this investigation sothe requested of you
i began to doubt that the apostle  begnions empress  actually knew what was happening in daein at only thirteen the apostle may be young but shes proud and upstanding shed never let these kinds of things happen to daein so i asked tormod to fill her in on what was really happening here
this is what we learned  the apostle had noticed something shady about daein she was investigating on her own she traced the ones pulling the strings to a certain faction of senators now shes snapping mad but without proof she cant publicly move against them
the apostle is the highest power in daein  even so she and the senate are rarely on good terms with each other
sothe she promised shed help us however she can she said to do whatever is necessary  and that inspired me to find you sooner than later
i see so  i can depend on having you three around for at least a little while
yeah your old pal here is gonna take care of everything just try getting rid of me
i can only try
what do you mean by that ah youre as blockheaded as ever
that sothe  he looks happy for some reason
because hes reunited with my little one
that must be it  oh sothe ever since he was small hes tried to act more grown up than the grown ups  ive taken care of him so long and still ive never seen him smile so easily before
hm  watch what you say comments like that  they reveal that your appearance belies your true age
what are you  
among the laguz there are those who detest and revile half breeds such as yourself they call you parentless and deny you any laguz heritage honor or dignity take due care
oh  oh no 
laguz warriors led by tormod join the escaped prisoners and daeins army grows ever larger its victories at talrega and other locations have strengthened its position the army rides across the land liberating prisoners from begnion encampments the daein ranks swell with the influx of veteran soldiers and the men begin to dream of the day when they may retake the capital
like a fever conflict grips the nation the night will be long before this fever breaks all eyes turn towards daeins capital as the liberation begins what all believe will be a long and bloody march
/***EOF***/
whats going on micaiah
im not sure i sense something theres a presence here that calls out to me
all right micaiah you and i should look into this everyone else check the surroundings
got it everybody be on your guard
amazing  i cant believe these ruins are still standing
they do seem to be very old indeed i wonder who built them 
judging by the size it must have been the laguz
what makes you say that
what do you think it would be like to change into a bird or a dragon as the laguz can being part beast is one thing but being able to transform into that beast with more strength than we could ever imagine  i mean they could build a place like this before breakfast
i suppose thats true  but what surprises me most is not that these could be laguz ruins but you sothe youve changed havent you
me how so
i remember a time when you used to refer to them laguz as sub humans such an ugly word now look at you
well come on beorc are called the children of wisdom  and the laguz the children of strength  for a reason but i know now that just because our two races differ that doesnt mean one is better than the other the age old beorc bias against laguz is based on sheer ignorance when i met ike during the war three years ago and fought beneath him he made me realize this
honestly here i thought you were saying something enlightened and youre just talking about him again
what do you mean again
sothe sometimes every other thing you say is like an ode to ike i know you fought beside him i know you owe him your life and i know you want to be just like him  but to the people of daein hes the man who crushed us three years ago some would even call him our archenemy if we hadnt lost the war to that man daein wouldnt be in the mess its in now you know that
pish i know that everyone knows that
sothe have you noticed 
yes ever since we arrived here
 
what should we do
hmm i cant sense any malice whoever it is doesnt seem to mean us any harm but  yes lets do it
all right on three then one two three
ahh
hey
there now we can see your face
youre a girl
i im sorry
no wait please dont run
 
my name is micaiah dont be afraid
have you gone mad dont tell her your name were on the run remember
its all right shes not after us
 
thie is my brother sothe were from nevassa
oh uhh hi there
and you are
im meg
what are you doing out here on the edge of the desert
im looking for someone someone very important someone close to my heart 
all by yourself
yes
youre meeting someone way out here
im not sure exactly all i know is that this is where he came before he disappeared i thought maybe he went into the desert 
what a coincidence were also looking for someone in the desert would you like to come along
really are you sure
of course
oh thank you ive been so lonely since i left crimea all on my own
you came all the way from crimea im surprised you made it this far
thats it then welcome aboard meg youre one of us now
oh there you are can we have a word with you
aimee muston how may i help you
relax honey im here to tell you about our business you like to shop dont you
let me guess you want to sell us weapons and other items am i right
thats right our inventory changes depending on where we are and what time it is but one thing is always the same we guarantee fair prices so stop by whenever you can
do you carry tomes
yup fire thunder wind light  weve got your basics covered
my shop also has lots of staves and medicine oh and i have recently made some key connections now i carry some very rare items theyre one of a kind and very valuable you should come have a look rare weapons too honestly you should buy them before someone else does at these prices theyre bound to sell quickly
well thats our spiel thanks for listening
do come by well be waiting
well hello dont mind us we wont take but a moment of your time 
hello jorge hello daniel
we just wanted to tell you a little about what we can do for you
ive already told her jorge will buy from us any items or weapons that we no longer need and daniel  
hey excuse me were here to talk to micaiah not to some stuffy know it all pun  
jorge dont be rude im sorry about that sothe anyway we just wanted to tell you about some changes we made to out business
all right then ill keep my mouth shut as long as daniel does the talking
thank you
so what do you have daniel
hey thanks for asking ive got a guy whos a master blacksmith he makes weapons you wouldnt believe and theyre not available anywhere else
hey thanks a lot jorge i make weapons too pretty good ones if i do say so myself its just you know customs have been extremely tight lately raw materials are so hard to come by  which reminds me if you ever have weapons you dont need would you sell them to us
yes please actually even better sell me your weapons and ill give them to daniel then he can smelt them down and use the steel for newer shinier pieces
it costs some money to upgrade weapons but  but hey lets face it its worth the money owning a custom made weapon sets you apart from the common soldier
oh and heres a one time only deal i wont even charge you for the materials on your first upgrade pretty nice huh now you have no excuse not to come by got that micaiah
umm yes thank you
 
one last thing if you ever bring me a coin ill give you a little bonus on whatever im making for you theyre very rare so be sure to hang on to them dont sell them to some stranger
what are you doing out here kurth
hello micaiah pay me no mind im just watching the desert how the wind changes the sandscape the ebb and flow of the dunes like giant swells in the ocean i find it mesmerizing
is this your first time in the desert
yes my homeland is ringed with mountains everything about daein looks new and curious to my eyes
i see
 you have not asked
im sorry
you have not asked me who i am or where i am from not just you micaiah but the others as well no one seeks to know who i am
you seem to not want to talk about yourself am i right
yes  quite right
thats why no one asks people can tell when someone wants privacy many of us desire privacy too kurth you are not our enemy i know that much youre kind and gentle that is all i need to know
thank you 
yune what is it where are you going
incredible sothe  mounds of treasure maybe it was the gold calling you micaiah
grrruah what is this looks like a tasty snack turned up while we were out
mwah ha ha our first prey in a long time leave them to me my fang brothers
not good laguz bandits micaiah give the signal
consider it done
mwah ha ha come here so i can taste you
mwah ha ha   gnk how did this happen
grrruah puny little humans come and fight
grrrua gack what happened to me 
mwah ha ha beorc are good eats
listen up we did not intentionally intrude on your territory
mwah ha ha ill listen while im gnawing on your bones
oooohhhh a beorc mage shiny sparkly magic makes me soooo scared
we do not want your treasures and we mean no ill will step back and we will not harm you
if the fire dont roar like a furnace it dont scare me mwah ha ha im gonna rip your throat out
yune yune where are you you can come out now
you and that bird its a little strange
youre just jealous wait i hear something
i cant hear anything
someones singing its coming from over there
micaiah wait
you hello who are you
i am rafiel a voice guided me here was it yours
no but i heard a voice that guided me here as well someone or something may want us both here
youre laguz arent you one of the heron clan and two of the beast tribe right
that is correct beorc youth
your white wings reveal youre of the heron royal family are you related to prince reyson by any chance
reyson my younger brother you know of him
you could say that we served in the same company for a while
what you are suggesting that my brother is still alive
yes he is still alive and as far as i know your father the king and the princess leanne are as well unless somethings happened all three of them live in the royal palace of gallia country of the beast tribe
unbelievable my father and sweet leanne  theyre still with me oh goddess im not alone not anymore   ah 
rafiel 
 
hello and you are
i am nailah queen of hatari and this is volug my loyal servant our kingdom lies far east of here
theres a country on the other side of the desert
as i said we have just traveled from there until we met rafiel we didnt know there were countries on this side of the desert after all no one had ever crossed the desert of death and lived to tell of it without rafiels guidance we would never have survived the crossing
my people the heron clan of serenes were blamed for the murder of begnions empress begnion mobs rose up in rage and massacred them i had thought the whole of my clan my entire race had been wiped out i wandered the desert in despair if not for the queen i would have died in hatari i vowed to dedicate my life to her and yet every night for these past three years a voice has called out to me day by day it has grown stronger  until the voice led me to you all your news brings such joy father reyson leanne  my beloved family  my thanks to thee o goddess  ah 
rafiel  you talk too much control yourself you beorc  whats the best route to gallia
for a group of laguz traveling through the daein countryside would be suicide it will take you longer but we could take you as far as crimea
we would be grateful by all means lets travel together but why go to crimea why not travel directly to gallia
entering gallia by yourselves would be nearly impossible the man you need to get you into gallia actually resides in crimea that man ike is in contact with king caineghis and his advisors theres no doubt in my mind that hes the man you need
right lord ike hero of the crimean liberation leader of the greil mercenaries and father of sothes children 
the history of tellius is a history of warfare or so the troubadours sing it is a history of unending conflict between the beorc and the laguz a history penned in blood and scarred by mistrust the beorc fight with the weapons of man  the sword the axe the lance and the magic arts while the laguz able to transform into beast bird and dragon are weapons unto themselves both were created equally by the goddess but neither race has ever accepted the other
the heron prince rafiel the wolf queen of hatari nailah and her vassal volug is the dawn brigades meeting with these three chance or a sign of things to come micaiah can only wonder
/***EOF***/
now our next target is mugill its gate is already sealed and it looks like they intend to keep it that way this wont go as easily as our battle in felirae
yaawwwwn  beorc are all the same we will run them down just as before
skrimir please  listen just this once
what do you think soren
the felirae survivors will have warned mugill of our advance thats so obvious even you must have anticipated it you dont have a plan
do not mock me beorc boy why should i bother with plans no soldier would cower behind stone walls after being challenged to a battle we will issue a challenge and they will meet it we have no need for plans
do you realize how completely absurd you sound the enemy did not build the fortress so they could stand outside of it they will not come out of their own accord
but   those beorc cowards they will hide from us what do we do i do not know how to fight cowards
dont you get it thats what were trying to decide think skrimir just try
no thats your job ranulf youre my second in command think of a way for me to use my strength anything else is a waste of time ill be training outside tell me when you have a plan
wait skrimir
 this is ridiculous im amazed that someone was desperate enough to make that fool a general
im tempted to agree with you on that but theres a reason hes here
never in its history has gallia invaded another country we dont have any experience or tactics to fall back on for this on top of that our general  well youve seen it yourself skrimir  he doesnt pay attention to details nor does he strategize sadly its not just skrimir most laguz are the same theyre arrogant and stubborn it doesnt even occur to them that they wont be able to power through the beorc forever
why isnt caineghis leading the army
its not an option we arent mobile like the bird tribes once we leave our lands it isnt easy for us to get back we cant take our king away from his domain
well what about giffca then there have to be other capable generals in gallia
yeah youd think general giffca would lead but  giffca has other duties to attend to so really that just leaves skrimir
i understand laguz choose their leaders based on strength if skrimir is to be the next king this war is the best opportunity for him to learn about strategy
exactly since thats the case we need all the help we can get please lend us your wisdom without your help this wars outcome is certain
you can count on us ranulf
weve told you already were here to help
 
soren say something
well well looks like your strategist isnt fond of laguz yet
im sorry ranulf hes gotten better but 
soren ranulf helped us out on top of that hes our client its our turn to return the favor and our job to do it right got that
 fine but itll cost you more
thanks all of you we appreciate the help
give me some time to myself ill come up with a plan to get us through this mess
great were counting on you soren
i know ill do what i can
tch these sub humans dont know how much trouble theyre causing we cant go anywhere
tell me about it just yesterday we couldve gone out for drinks and had ourselves a merry old time

uhhhh 
how youve grown  you look just like your father
no youve got it all wrong i dont know anyone by that name i um have to go

ahhhh a sub human youre a sub human  p please you can have this please dont eat me
but  im not a laguz
 
you might not believe me but laguz dont eat people i just thought you should know
 im sorry i was just so scared i didnt mean any harm
oh  well its all right as long as you understand now ok
im such a coward i cant believe it

i thought you looked like someone i knew but its just my imagination i better get going good bye
hey wait

the gate is opening
ah finally soldiers of gallia follow me as long as i lead you in battle we will always win crush any who stand in your way

hey over here long time no see commander ike
muston you came
its great to be doing business with the greil mercenaries again and with you too my feline friend
oh you called them out here i thought they just smelled a battle and sensed the profits
well we cant fight naked like you laguz can i also asked muston to call on some other friends to come join up as well youll be seeing an increase in your forces real soon here ranulf
thanks for everything ike youve done so much for us already and now you do all this 
listen when we fought daein gallia came to crimeas aid without any questions now were returning the favor thats all
 all right in any case you guys are a great help thank you so much
the tactics used by the gallian army prove effective and like felirae before it mugill falls to claw and steel before begnion can react the laguz overwhelm the remaining border defenses and cross into the telgam region with both defense keeps overrun telgam falls like ripe fruit at the feet of the laguz alliance inspired by their success the alliance takes advantage of this momentum to strike toward the very heart of the begnion empire
dukes gaddos and seliora are horrified by the speed of the laguz alliance banding together with the landowning nobles of the northern territories they mass their armies in seliora to oppose the gallian assault using the ribahn river a tributary of the might miscale as a defensive front the begnion forces make their camps along its western bank in the sestohl plains
no no no on the battlefield nothing is more important than precision and skill
nah sorry kiddo power is the most important element
you dont know what youre talking about its skill
its power did you practice being this stupid
idiot meathead
what take that back you little brat
stars above dont you two ever stop fighting youre siblings be nice to each other so what is it this time

that settles it the scene is set the arena ready  prepare yourself commander

daein has been reborn word of king pelleass coronation reaches neighboring
crimea within days crimea itself has spent the past three years rebuilding
from the damage it suffered during the mad kings war news that ashnards son
now sits on daeins throne sends waves of unease and worry rippling across the
land
alas this is not the only thing disturbing the people of crimea during this
time there is an ever widening gap emerging between crimeas noble class and
the nations young ruler queen elincia
crimea lost its king during the daein invasion and elincia is still an
inexperienced ruler whats more her very existence was a secret from the
public and so she came unexpectedly to her succession many of crimeas noble
houses raised their voices in protest against her rule elincias desire for a
long lasting peace has driven her to strengthen crimeas ties with the laguz
nation of gallia and to renounce crimeas claim to rule over a defeated daein
her political moderation is seen as a sign of weakness among her critics
ike the young hero who led crimea to victory in the mad kings war was
granted a peerage for his heroism and bravery the elevation of a common
mercenary to the nobility however widened the rift between the aristocracy
and the queen yet further perhaps to avoid becoming mired in these power
struggles ike renounced his peerage and took his leave of the court
yet ikes actions did little to placate the nobility they continue to
criticize the queens every decision and lay squarely at her feet the blame
for all of crimeas woes
so you have acknowledged pelleas as the newly crowned king of daein your majesty this is beyond the pale
i have not forgotten our war with daein three years is not so long as that but do not forget  if we allow hatred to rule our hearts we become prisoners of our past a lasting peace serves both nations
bravo your majesty well spoken indeed your words paint a picture of idealism rarely seen here at court however and i beg your forgiveness it is quite apparent your grasp of politics remains childishly naïve
abandoning rule over daein then reconciling with our most hated enemy  this will not do the people will soon take their discontent to the streets
whats more why choose bastian the count of fayre as your envoy his skills in court are vital to crimea to send away such a key figure  tell me your highness how exactly do you plan to rule without him
the count of fayre himself gladly volunteered as a delegate her majestys decision was only  
lady lucia still your tongue you are not her majesty do not presume to speak for her
yes lady lucia please refrain from speaking if you have not been directly addressed your familiarity with the queen does not grant you a seat in the royal assembly although you may have been raised as a sister to her majesty the queen kindly remember your place
 you have my apologies
and you general geoffrey does your loyalty to her majesty stem only from your unchecked emotions those with a taste for gossip are talking i wonder have you heard what the help is saying about you
what i 
geoffrey
rrgh
at any rate growing discontent has brought the royal family of crimea to a crossroads of sorts your highness  this is all on you
indeed your majesty  whatever do you intend to do
queen elincia
marcia how are you today and what are you doing here
lucia told me about those no goodnik nobles and their chest beating contest so i thought you could use some cheering up you werent in your chambers or the garden so i guessed you would be out here
forgive me i needed some time to think im sorry to trouble you
not at all after everything youve done for me its the least i could do it was nice of you to hire me as a royal knight but hiring my sponge brained spine deprived brother might qualify you for sainthood
even so im afraid i may also have caused you a great number of hardships
huh oh the grief im getting from the nobles its nothing i cant handle if you think your country has stuffed shirt windbags for aristocracy you should see begnions when i was a pegasus knight there they had a new shenanigan every week after that the crimean crybabies are no big deal
no its my fault and im sorry im so new at all this even you are affected by my blunders sometimes i think  maybe i just dont have what it takes to be a queen
thats so not true queen elincia anyone can strut around in a queen hat and say shes a ruler but you always out your people first look its not that youre doing a bad job its just everyones on edge lately with daein getting a new king and all people are worried that daeinll start another war like the one three years ago and theyre taking it out on you just dont let those peacock wearing nobles bug you and remember that you dont have to go it alone youve got friends everywhere
thank you marcia your kind words have lifted my spirits
thats right  im not alone i must be strong for the sake of our people as the protector of our homeland
huh queen elincia  what the heck is going on over there
hmm
h hey how dare you harass us begone insolent fools begone i say
 
fear not my lady this senile old bird will gladly trade his life for your protection
they say nothing is as beautiful as the herons of serenes  especially a royal princess youll fetch a pretty penny from some lord or other  and our pockets are a little light whaddya say captain
yes naturally she should prove to make a fine gift seize them and mind the ravens talons
this is unbelievable stand back you unrepentant dogs nealuchi does not give in easily
men silence that cawing raven who would pay for an old crow like that anyway leave him
stop right there
tch  company how droll
hey begnion dracoknights are you lost or have you just been letting those scaly fleabags do your navigating whatre you doing in crimeas sky
 weve merely strayed a bit in our duties patrolling the border do you have a problem with that
you and your flying snakes are in violation of crimeas sovereignty besides do you have any idea who youre dealing with here reptile breath
marcia stop we cannot afford to start antagonizing the begnion army i am the queen of crimea 
but your majesty we cant just let these wyvern monkeys run rampant  
and were not going to as long as they dont realize im the queen we should be fine
begnion dracoknights  you will only be warned once leave this area immediately i serve the queen of crimea trespassers on crimean territory will be dealt with no exceptions
the queen she says the very queen that relied on us the begnion empire to free her nation imperial dracoknights are not frightened by soldiers so weak as crimean pegasus knights listen up leave those two alone its the serenes maiden we want do not allow her to escape
 looks like well not talk any sense into them i suppose we have no choice sir nealuchi were here to help you
ill be its her majesty queen elincia fate has smiled upon us i hate to be a bother considering it has been so long but  your assistance is most appreciated
yaaawn  boy im bushed hey partner you tired hows a nap sound you want to rest your wings a bit
 huh were running late but im sleepy  what did you call me that wasnt very nice overgrown lizard 
please tell me thats not what i think it is oh this is perfect begnion dracoknights just my stinkin luck
hey  look whos here its haar
 hello marcia i see youre still flying about on that apple eating hairbag
and youre still asleep at the reins of that foul smelling  oh crackers i dont have time for your nonsense open that one good eye of yours and take a look around will you those begnion dracoknights have invaded crimean skies youve got to help us save the laguz theyre trying to kidnap well cmon haar
me why i owe the queen a favor or two but im not one of her soldiers
you  you cad does having fought together in the mad kings war mean nothing to you
well no but  look ive got a delivery to make and this cargos really heavy sorry marcia maybe next time
next time you lizard loving jerk would you really abandon us what kind of man are you
the kind who lives to sleep another day well good luck to you see you around
stop you have to stay and help uhm  ok haar hear me out you were an imperial dracoknight once right its your job to fix this theyre your old comrades  you have to keep them in line
huh youre not making a lick of sense girl
why do i have to make sense if jill were in trouble i bet youd help her please please please cmon haar you have to help us you have to
 is it really all that bad
yes theyre a tough bunch and im all alone  i dont think i can manage to protect queen elincia please say youll help  if only for the safety of the queen 
 oh fine i really dont have time for this  but i guess i can lend a hand
thank you so much i take back all the mean things i was thinking about you earlier
that girls nothing but trouble well if were going to do this lets get it over with up and at em partner
its been a while queen elincia
sir haar you are sir haar of daein correct what are you doing here
thats a question for marcia your majesty i was passing through on a delivery run when she hailed me and pestered me into helping you
what can i say im terribly sorry i know this is none of your affair but 
you know i always thought you were too humble for royalty im surprised your underlings dont run roughshod all over you
i im sorry
hey its no skin off my nose besides anyone whos got the guts to pick a fight with the empires ok in my book
sir haar i  
yeah i got it you cant let these scum know youre actually the queen international relations and all that other political stuff right i tell you what ill keep your secret and treat you like a regular soldier that means im not going to be watching your back though so youre going to have to take care of yourself
i understand thank you
now begone with you the skies and the heron are ours i cant wait to see your corpse smashed across crimeas landscape
well  if it isnt zeffren what brings the dracoknights into crimean skies
haar
why couldnt you just stay on patrol saw a pretty little heron and just had to have her is that it i never could decide if you were more greedy or more corrupt stupid was never in question though
who do you think you are youre a traitor just like shiharam the dracoknights spit on your name
 do they now well heres your chance to try the real thing
you  you crimeans seriously believe you can withstand the might of begnion
crimea takes this sort of encroachment seriously we will not overlook invaders in our domain release your weapons and apologize for your discourtesy  only then will we lower our own
you have quite a mouth on you  i wont be addressed in that tone by anyone its time to end this farce
ugh  aaaaaaaagghh
yeah you run dragonbackers and dont ever come back to crimea
princess leanne its a pleasure to see you again im sorry you had to go through all that are you hurt
 
lady leanne is very grateful for your help with those ruffians and is quite delighted to see you again your majesty frankly i dont think these old bones would have been up to the task of protecting the princess without your help
the most important thing is that youre both safe sir nealuchi but  what brings you here as far as i knew the both of you were residing in gallia 
 
it is imperative that my lady sees general ike as soon as possible we were traveling to the royal palace in melior for that very purpose
thats unfortunate ike left melior more than half a year ago after that rumor has it that he reorganized the greil mercenaries  now no one seems to know where they are
what this is most unexpected what are we supposed to do now
sir ike isnt here but  since youve traveled all this way to crimea would you like to visit the royal court i would be happy to investigate the whereabouts of the greil mercenaries during your stay
well  we dont want to be a bother but it would be very kind of you
to be honest there are matters about which i must speak with sir ike myself and regardless were always delighted to have such splendid guests as yourselves i must tell you however  and i am ashamed to say it  there is unrest among certain circles here in crimea i hope nothing will happen to disturb your visit with us
un unrest you say
yes i trust however my protection will be enough to keep you from harms way
queen elincia encounters and defeats a wing of begnion dracoknights trespassing in crimean skies after rescuing chamberlain nealuchi and princess leanne she invites them to be her guests at the royal court while elincias show of loyalty to her laguz allies causes an uproar among the nobles at court they are aware that the heron princess is under the mutual protection of the mighty laguz hawk king and raven king because of this there is no public show of distaste
however dissatisfaction with elincias rule now spreads from a single faction to a larger group crimeas unity is slowly rotting from within this discord begins to be felt even in country hamlets like the farming village of ohma
/***EOF***/
well i guess this is over wed better be on our way
are you going back to daein
yes everyones waiting for us
we have to start rebuilding all over again hopefully this will be the last time
dont say hopefully make it the last time if anyone can do it you two can
i dont doubt it but thanks for the vote of confidence
thank you ike i wont ever forget you
im sorry
but thats  i dont believe you because see my dear you have the mark wait dont you have a mark
no mother lady almehda is that the reason you thought me to be your son
i 
and that is the reason why izuka chose me out of all the children at that orphanage
stop this is impossible you are my son i am your mother and i say so
lady almedha your only memories of your son were of him as a baby you yourself said so in other words he already had a mark even as a child
yes thats so what of it
this mark  my mark here  is called the spirits protection when i was thirteen i chose to make a pact with the spirits
what
when i learned that you were one of the dragon clan i began to doubt and slowly my doubt turned to certainty im sorry lady almedha im sorry that though it was never my intent i ended up deceiving you im sorry but i am not your son
p pelleas 
but still  i was happy it was fleeting but  i knew the feeling of a mothers love you have my thanks
i  ah sniff 
ah ike your work out there was superb
hey you arent quite over the hill yet yourself you know i always wanted to go one on one with you just once
hah i would have expected youd had your fill of fighting
ive had enough of kill or be killed to last me a lifetime but something simpler some way of testing our respective strengths 
you mean controlled matches with all the little rules they have in a peaceful world we need such things especially we laguz without a fight now and then we go a bit strange in the head
thats the honest truth id rather try to order a river to change course than stop a bunch of rampaging laguz
wait  sister
youre my older sister arent you
what do you mean
it makes sense all the pieces fit the galdr of release  the goddess yunes voice 
its true inside the tower i heard the voices of many hearts and i knew i am descended from lehran and altina misaha the former apostle was my grandmother
yes i thought so in that case my sister please consider staying in begnion with your power and charisma you could do so much good here
no im afraid i cant
wh why not
daein is my home and daein needs me to help it heal and rebuild not begnion
but begnion  
begnion has you empress you will be a just ruler make your country proud to have you
will i never see you again
hardly i think that what our countries need now is a sense of family and friendship i ask that you sign a treaty of alliance with daein and announce that we are equals
i will of course once things settle down in both of our countries that will be the first thing i do sister
thank you empress sanaki  my dear little sister
will you be heading back to gallia first
well stop by gallia then wing straight on to serenes
serenes why there
the empress sanaki has kept her promise serenes will be formally ceded back to us she said we may return immediately
ah i see thats good to hear
sometimes birds change their feathers the hawks the herons even the ravens were thinking well all settle down together
all this time weve sorted ourselves by our ways of thinking and seeing and living if we can respect each others opinions and learn to compromise we can learn to live together without strife
i dont think it will be that easy but it still ought to be simpler than getting beorc and laguz to treat each other decently you set a good example reyson
all the major issues look like theyll be handled soon the only thing we cant agree on is hunting and eating meat
the forest creatures are off limits needless displays of violence as well you know we will not budge on that
tell me  have you ever heard of a vegetarian hawk or a raptor that doesnt scream victoriously at the skies after a kill
meat huh thats a thorny problem 
well your majesty shall we be off
yes let us to crimea to our homeland
you are ike of the greil mercenaries
and youre the dowager queen of daein i heard some of what youve gone through im glad that youre safe
ah indeed
in light of that  can i do anything for you
i think not i think i have seen enough
as you wish well then lady almedha prince kurthnaga take care of yourselves
yes and you as well i know we shall meet again
are you satisfied my sister you wished so strongly to meet with general ike
i only did so because pelleas said  he said that it would be wise if i were to meet with him
did he say why
that child he said it was the last gift he could give me he wouldnt say anything more
a gift by meeting general ike
what about that beorc could possibly be  wait  ah wait wait stop a moment
sister
yes you needed something
you are  what is your name
soren
i i see that that is a fine name
thank you 
youre welcome
is that all
ah yes yes pardon me calling out to you like that  i was confused
dont let it trouble you if youll excuse me
i dont believe it
that boy is the staff officer for the greil mercenaries what made you call out to him like that
i 
sister
because i have lost the power of my birthright i thought  maybe i wouldnt be able to  that i might not be able to recognize my own child but when her own true son stands before her no mother could fail to know oh my son youve lived and grown strong
you cant mean  soren is your son
welcome home
could it be that you were here all this time
alas no i am sorry to say but for several days ive somehow felt as though you would soon return
well im home and im glad to see you again lehran
and i am glad to see you as well goddess ashunera
how long has it been a hundred years five hundred
about twelve hundred years
i see for mortals that is many many lives
yes the peace we once had is on the verge of crumbling again
that is unfortunate the miasma of war is beginning to shroud the world however i shall not again be frightened as one born of the hopes of man i shall protect this world
yes
lehran ive missed your songs would you sing for me now
i i no longer 
well then i will sing and you may sing with me is that all right
 yes
in days long past a young man strode the lands of tellius
he was simple yet true his deeds brave and noble he reunited two races long at war and healed the heart of a goddess long gone mad ask any you meet be they young or old beorc or laguz of a hero named ike and youll receive a warm smile and a tale or two of faith courage and honesty
/***EOF***/
a blood pact a piece of parchment forced you into this hopeless war
how terrible  im sorry for what youve been put through micaiah
the uprising in the empire continues the apostles people await her return as they fight against the senate casualties mount each day  we know how urgently the apostles army needs to reach the empire however if we let their army pass through daein the senate will surely invoke the blood pact and destroy us
but why havent you told the apostles army all this surely an alliance between your army and theirs could overcome the senate
attacking the senate is not an option for us if it were we would have marched against them when this all started if we were to side with ike the senate would use the curse against us the death of the senate will not stop the curse
no matter what happens the end result remains the same the obliteration of daein
what tragedy  is there any hope for daein at all
there is  one person who holds a glimmer of hope for all of us
queen almedha queen almedha  what do you know about the blood pact you know some thing dont you i saw the look on your face  you noticed something even before pelleas told us about the pact if theres something you know that we dont please tell us
heh heh hmph 
l lady almedha
havent  havent you done enough already its done finished nothing matters anymore theres nothing we can do my pelleas  my pelleas is 
almedha get ahold of yourself
kurth
i cant pretend that i know what youre going through but for pelleass sake you must control yourself remember that your son made his final sacrifice in order to protect the people of daein honor his memory now and help us
 sniff  youre right kurth ill try
oh thank you lady almedha now what can you tell us about the blood pact
 in the begnion era year 626 a terrible plague swept through daein killing over a thousand people
i remember the horror of that disease king ashnard took the throne after the plague killed most of the royal family including his fatherthe tragedy is still fresh in my mind
that was no disease it was the curse of a blood pact
what
it was all plotted by my husband in a bid to claim the throne of daein ashnard tricked his father into signing a blood pact with a traveling wise man ashnard convinced the king that he was signing a contract to procure the services of the wise man which was true in a fashion with the pact signed ashnard had the wise man invoke the curse my husband looked on in triumph as the royal family began to wither the power of the curse killed every royal in line for the throne it was brilliant with no one to block his way to the throne ashnard executed his master stroke he killed his father and took the crown from his head
king ashnard killed his own father the king of daein and what about the others a thousand people died for his insane plot
theres no point in dwelling on old wounds besides the peasants didnt matter they had no vision ashnard on the other hand  whats important is what happened after the kings death ashnard wasnt cursed by the blood pact
he wasnt cursed how is that possible
in order to break the curse of the blood pact two conditions must be met the destruction of the document itself and the death of the one bound to it either condition by itself is not enough i watched it happen ashnard killed his father then tore apart the pact and before my eyes the mark of the pact faded from the dead kings arm
the destruction of the document and the death of the one bound 
how could you almedha how could you not tell us you knew all along  
because i was terrified i knew that once you found out the truth you would butcher my dear son to save your doomed country i would have done anything to save my pelleas  thats why i didnt say anything  how could i in the end though it wasnt enough
almedha you are stronger than this you were always the brave one when we were young
huh
i know you grieve but grieving will not bring pelleas back now is the time when you must be strong to put pelleass spirit to rest help carry out his dying wish and ensure the safety of his homeland
but he was  he was everything to me  how can i go on without him
i am still here dear sister you still have family
sister lady almedha is your sister
i received your message my sister and have come to help please almedha allow me to protect daein for you and for pelleas do not lose hope you are not alone anymore and never shall be again
oh kurthnaga thank you im so sorry for everything i put you and father through  im so sorry 
queen almedha queen almedha  what do you know about the blood pact you know something dont you i saw the look on your face  you noticed something even before pelleas told us about the pact if theres something you know that we dont please tell us
i  i know nothing 
mother  please tell the truth
 
mother if you cant help us then theres no hope for daein i guess we were right  we have no choice but to wager my life
pe pelleas wait just wait im going to tell you something  but you mustnt tell the others in the begnion era year 626 a terrible plague swept through daein killing over a thousand people
yes including nearly the entire royal family those who had ruled and those destined to do so  none were spared except ashnard who ascended the throne in the wake of it all ive heard that tragic story for as long as i can remember
that was no disease it was the curse of a blood pact
what
it was all plotted by my husband in a bid to claim the throne of daein ashnard tricked his father into signing a blood pact with a traveling wise man ashnard convinced the king that he was signing a contract to procure the services of the wise man which was true in a fashion with the pact signed ashnard had the wise man invoke the curse my husband looked on in triumph as the royal family began to wither the power of the curse killed every royal in line for the throne it was brilliant with no one to block his way to the throne ashnard executed his master stroke he killed his father and took the crown from his head whats important is that after killing his father ashnard was not cursed himself
he broke the pacts curse
in order to break the curse of the blood pact two conditions must be met the destruction of the document itself and the death of the one bound to it either condition by itself is not enough i watched it happen ashnard killed his father then tore apart the pact and before my eyes the mark of the pact faded from the dead kings arm
the destruction of the document and the death of the one bound 
how could you almedha how could you not tell us you knew all along  
because i was terrified i knew that once you found out the truth you would butcher my dear son to save your doomed country i would rather watch all of daein perish than lose my pelleas 
mother  thank you thank you for telling us it makes my decision much easier i will save daein 
no i wont let you die you are all i have left in this world pelleas if you only knew how much ive sacrificed for you  i never should have said anything i cant bear to lose you again pelleas  please dont die
im sorry mother my mind is made up this has to happen
then i shall die as well i will take my own life if necessary
mother
 kurth
stop please sister you must calm down
sister
oh kurth  dont you understand i cant feel this way any longer
i do understand almedha more than you realize everyone as youve heard there are two conditions to breaking the blood pact the destruction of the physical document and the death of the pact maker however it takes two parties to make a pact
oh i see
yes ashnard once told me hed considered killing the man who created his fathers blood pact instead i didnt know why until now  this means that we could kill the senator who signed the pact instead of pelleas
its possible but very difficult well need not only to hunt down the senator but find the document with no idea where to start daein could be annihilated in the time it would take to look
oh kurth please please save my pelleas i need your help help me protect daein until we get our chance to break the blood pact i no longer have any power of my own youre my only hope now little brother please kurth 
of course my dear sister that is why i came when you called me i shall protect daein for you and for pelleas so please put your mind at ease
oh kurth thank you im so sorry for everything i put you and father through  im so sorry 
sir ike  ive just received a very disturbing message from prince kurthnaga
dont tell me  no luck right
it is far worse than that prince kurthnaga has decided to fight for daein
what why he was supposed to stop them from fighting and now he wants to fight us instead oh this is just perfect
he has a good reason to side with them but  im afraid i cannot tell you why
wonderful so we still have to fight daein and theyve added one of the supposedly neutral dragons of goldoa to their army
im sorry ike i will try to reason with prince kurth again it was the princes wish to come here  king dheginsea knows nothing of this visit be that as it may for a prince of the dragon tribe to stand on a battlefield  it is unacceptable i must talk him out of it
im sorry ena i know youre doing your best to  wait are you talking to him with that stone
yes we dragons have the power to sense the presence of our allies if that ally is someone we care for very much then we can communicate telepathically with the sending stone we can use this telepathy across extreme distances
i just hope he listens to me we cant afford to fuel the flames of the fire emblem
its almost dawn do what you can to convince the prince to stay out of this i wouldve preferred to avoid a fight but once again micaiah isnt giving us much of a choice
i will do my best sir ike
the apostles army has left the castle
all right order all units to stand by until they encounter the enemy forces
everyone there is still hope for daein we are the key to that hope but first we must win this battle
why are you still here you must return to the apostles army before the battle begins
that army has enough troops i think you could use some help on your side
reyson and leanne both fight for the people they love i shall do the same even if that means fighting against them i shall fight for daein on your behalf
thank you both it means a lot to me but are you sure after all this seems like a hopeless battle
its too soon for you to give up hope you have the dragon prince of goldoa on your side that counts for something
kurth is the prince of goldoa so he is a laguz 
not just a laguz he is a black dragon the black dragons are the strongest of all the laguz tribes we have a chance
if queen almedhas brother is a black dragon that means the queen herself must also be a laguz
seems like a complicated mess to me just the same he is a powerful ally
youre right if we can stand our ground there will be hope for another day each day that daein survives is another day well have earned for it
onward my brothers hold nothing back we must end this battle quickly
whoa thats a problem  uh guys it looks like prince rafiel is fighting for the other side what do we do now
it is his choice we cant do anything about it
well his choice or not it makes things a lot more complicated for us
he has sided with our enemies has he lost his mind my dear stupid brother 
prince what are you doing here what about the medallion1 werent you supposed to be  
leanne is watching over it now
either we convince rafiel to come back to our side or we drag his unconscious backside over here got that
yes your majesty
prince kurthnaga 
what will you do now ena are you going over to the other side too
king dheginsea has expressly forbidden us from choosing sides the dragon tribe must not fight i shall attempt to stop the prince
do what you need to do just be careful out there all right
yes sir ike
elincia please stay back if a chance for a peace talk arises i want you to mediate the whole show
i understand please be safe
ok everyone get moving lets get this mess over with
theres no time to dwell on our sorrow
i must not think  the enemy in front of me is the only thing i will focus on
ike im sorry i  i must raise my sword against you
zihark whats going on here why do you sound so desperate this isnt like you at all
ill take my secret to the grave besides you know i dont like to complain at your ready commander
micaiah pull back your troops we dont want to fight you theres got to be a way to stop all this
i cant and there isnt we have to keep fighting until the last of us falls we have no choice
whats happened to you all why get yourselves into such a hopeless war why did you do those horrible things in the valley i know all of this must have a reason please tell me  tell me how my country lost its soul
ive nothing to say to you
i see no words to waste on a deserter like me is that it im sorry i wasted your time
zihark  
no please  just know that i could never draw steel against you good bye micaiah
i  im so sorry zihark i cant get you involved in this too
lady micaiah why do you insist on continuing this fight
jill 
even now daein blood spills on the battlefield you must stop this there must be another way
i cant and there isnt we have to keep fighting until the last of us falls we have no choice
please listen to what im  
apostles dracoknight leave here immediately i warn you only once next time i will attack
lady micaiah please i beg of you lady micaiah
the maiden of dawn  lady micaiah i would speak with you you are not an evil person i already know that
 
that is why i am puzzled why do you continue to fight would you have your country destroyed like this
 
please say something you have the power to end all of this violence say the word i beg you
please go the people of the serenes are not safe from the chaos set loose upon us this place isnt safe for you take rafiel with you and leave the battlefield as soon as you can
thats all you have to say your men die all around you while you stand here giving me orders so be it
whats that whos talking
ungh 
micaiah micaiah are you all right
so  sothe 
can you hear me then lets pull back youre in no condition to fight
 
i can hear it  its very close 
hey whats wrong with you you dont look well 
 what oh um  im fine
are you how much good can you do your men if you can hardly see straight pull your troops back micaiah
 theres no need i will stay here with everyone else and fight to the end
youre very brave micaiah but sometimes bravery isnt enough to win the battle
im sorry but i cant stop now winning is the only way well survive this
they just keep coming at us  we have to pull back well regroup and strike them again later
good bye sothe
commander
oh  its you sothe id sincerely hoped we wouldnt meet like this
me too astrid
i knew you were with the daein army but i hoped that if i didnt see you i could pretend it wasnt true now however im glad i saw you how you have grown you look like a true soldier now
 im not the only one whos grown you look every bit the true knight now astrid
you really think so thank you sothe that means a lot to me
i know the answer but i still have to ask will you pull back we dont really have to do this do we
i was about to ask you the same thing i dont want to fight you sothe please fall back
 i thought as much lets get started im sorry astrid
i am sorry as well sothe
hello sothe shall we get started
uh i thought youd hesitate to fight me im  a little surprised
youve made your choice sothe and ive made mine its really that simple isnt it anyway im starving if i dont eat something soon i think ill pass out 
well we cant have that ready when you are ilyana
sothe i  
lets cut the small talk jill we both fight for the side we believe in theres no point in talking things over lets finish this
youre right  lets just get past this
ill forget about our time together during the mad kings war and the daein emancipation you should do the same we should fight without reservation and without sentiment
i agree sothe i do hope you survive for micaiahs sake but youll have to defeat me first
general tauroneo finally i found you please tell me what happened to daein why are you fighting
there is nothing to say we have parted ways that is all
what are you trying to hide daein has now committed atrocities on par with those committed by ashnard i want to know why youd continue to fight a war like this
and i say that there is no need for you to know mercenary zihark return to your allies in the apostles army
i will find out whats going on here if my country cant save itself then ill save it but ill never raise my sword against you good bye for now general i hope our next meeting goes better
 forgive me
general tauroneo
jill  i will tell you one thing i do not blame you for leaving daein you must live by your own beliefs that is what your father would have wanted
but  
i must live by my principles as well you cannot convince me to betray my king and countrymen i have done so once in the past but that was long ago now i intend to fight for my country to the end
i understand  general
i am tauroneo a general of daein
ah so we meet again i wont have mercy on you
as i expected theyre too strong  well need more drastic methods  and this injury is too deep  i have to retreat
general ike of the apostles army i challenge you to a duel
 all right
i see so much of him in you  your stance your spirit the expression on your face  you remind me so much of gawain lets see if your swordsmanship matches your fathers
test me you knew my father well tell me how i measure up
rolf is that you how youve grown kids always grow up so fast
general tauroneo  youre still fighting in the daein army lets not do this no matter how strong you are daein cant win this war and i dont wanna hurt you
youre right rolf daein cant win in most ways weve already lost everything but i must fight on rolf you stand on the battlefield as a man now i wont hold back you shouldnt either show me what youve learned in the last three years
ok general if you really wanna but just to tell you  uncle shinons been teaching me so this might sting 
is that you calill you look well i heard you married largo and opened a pub how is largo these days
that fool went and lost his arm in an accident no more fighting for him thats for sure
oh well uh im sorry to hear that
oh but hes doing fine otherwise a tough one that man our business is doing great and hes married to the best woman in the world thats worth an arm or two id say
indeed im glad you two are happy
how about you general i told largo that id visit you in daein and see how you were doing
me i just  i only wish to meet a glorious end on the battlefield fit for a general of daein
mmm hmm men are so full of it i mean honestly are you even listening to how stupid that sounds
wh what do you mean  
what i mean is that youre stupid you have people who care for you on both sides of this suicidal battle and here you are in the thick of things looking to throw your life away you selfish fool looks like ill have to do this myself im taking you back with me general the hard way
you have an interesting way of making your point
 sigh
taking a break on the battlefield things dont seem to rattle you ilyana
im not taking a break im just sad i have to fight against you general well that and im really really hungry right now 
i shouldve known lets get this over with so you can get back and have something to eat
 general tauroneo i hope we can meet again under different circumstances
i hope so as well ilyana well have to see what happens
what a strange twist of fate that we would end up facing off against one another
agreed it seems that fate is cruel in lots of ways lately
daein owes you zihark your efforts liberated our country for that you will always have our thanks however daein cannot retreat from this war we may face old friends as our enemies but we cannot stop
 
i will not apologize for this war and i cannot explain it to you you should do what you must we are two soldiers now facing off against each other on the battlefield
 very well i hope well get to talk more about this later general
jill 
general tauroneo 
how tragic that we meet again as enemies it was hard enough for me the first time
im sorry  i  
raise your head stand tall
 
if you havent done anything to disgrace your familys name do not cast your eyes away from anyone
i have not disgraced anything i joined this army so i could avoid that
i know jill im envious of you but this is the only way it can end
being outnumbered isnt such a bad thing at the very least ill get a good workout
the laguz of the west ive been itching to test your mettle
  maybe  i should not have been so cocky 
queen
stop squawking rafiel ill be all right   it makes me happy that you worry for me as you do but ill have to retreat for now
hold on a second when did you decide to side with them
i spoke to micaiah she made me see her side of the conflict besides she needed the extra help
she must be an amazing talker what did she say
i could tell you but you wouldnt really understand the situation is quite complicated but daein has no way out one side or the other will be sacrificed
queen nailah 
dont worry your pretty head about it beorc hero you and i are warriors  you of the sword and i of the fang we understand what to do now
are you enjoying yourself
if we cant avoid fighting we might as well enjoy it agreed besides ive been curious about your swordsmanship you seem strong for a beorc show me what you can do
how could i say no to that ready when you are your majesty
hm id always assumed that you cats were weak but i was wrong ive been watching you fight this battle youre really very good
queen nailah while im honored to receive praise from you id really rather not fight you i think id much rather run away with my tail tucked firmly between my legs to be honest
dont be so modest ranulf youll be a good challenge im sure and those are rare for me ready
thrown around by skrimir cornered by general zelgius and now this can someone tell me why i always seem to pull the short straw
 i must confess ive wanted this since i first laid eyes on you i can hardly hold myself back right now
lady the feeling is mutual why do you think i winged my way over here it looks to me like we can have a nice private time right here no interruptions just you and me
hawk king tibarn i think that a few more scars on your face will complete that rugged look youre going for
for a beautiful woman like you ill gladly offer my head of course youll have to bring me down to the ground first
challenge accepted i think youll regret it once i add your feathers to my necklace though oh and lets not tell rafiel about this agreed he wouldnt understand these urges of ours
ah the lion prince youll give me the challenge im craving wont you im having trouble finding decent enemies
gladly queen nailah ive wanted to fight a wolf ever since i heard the legends of your people as a cub let me show you why i am the heir to the lion king youd better hope you eastern laguz heal as well as we do
wolf queen 
ilyana i am not familiar with beorc magic you might actually stand a chance if you strike quickly
um ok  but  queen nailah would you promise me something if we both live through this will you take me for some good hatari cooking
zihark  you used to fight for micaiah
queen nailah do you fight for daein now
well lets say ive replaced some of the deserters
thats right im a deserter i dont have to defend my decision i made the right choice
zihark i dont care these are beorc problems what im interested in is you and your blade shall we get started i remember you as a skilled swordsman im excited to see your work up close
i dont know if my blade can match your jaws queen nailah but im honored to face you at your ready
queen nailah youre fighting for daein now
to tell you the truth im interested in fighting you jill an armed beorc trained to fight from the back of a wyvern  now thats what i call a challenge
very well queen nailah i dont know why youve switched sides but if its a fight you want youve found one
king pelleas would you please listen to what i have to say
zihark what is there to talk about youve deserted your country and your people
i just dont understand i thought i knew you you are a good kind man why do you continue to fight for those bloodsucking senators
i dont want to talk about it
your majesty 
it doesnt concern you anymore youve abandoned daein  and us if you want to stop us use your sword  not words
my sword and my allegiance do lie elsewhere now its true but i am not without honor i will not draw my sword against the man i call my king no matter what
 im sorry zihark at least youll be spared from the curse of the pact
king pelleas please wait i must talk to you
jill im afraid i have nothing to say to you you abandoned your own country
no i  yes i suppose thats true i just couldnt understand why we would bow to the empire after fighting so hard to free ourselves from their grasp why are you fighting an army that isnt even an enemy of daein
you dont need to understand
king pelleas 
jill you do what you think is best for you go your own way but dont return to daein ever
but i cant do that in the end i am a native of daein this is where the body of my father lies this is my home my only home 
 im sorry jill but theres no need for you to fall prey to the curse as well
if you thought to end this battle quickly by fighting me you have made a grave mistake
youre king pelleas the son of mad king ashnard i expected you to be bigger
you are the hero of crimea general ike you killed my father 
it was nothing personal your father had to be put down wait are you shaking
ive never killed anyone before  ive never even stood on a battlefield before today
then why did you come here do you want to die
i do but it wont change anything  i promised micaiah that i wouldnt run from my destiny general ike you may be able to take me down easily but i will not run
just what daein needs another mad king lets see if youre as tough as your father
the new king of daein pelleas how convenient i can end this farce right now surrender or die
who are you that mark on your forehead  is it a mark of spirit protection
no its something rather different
but that shape  it looks so much like mine
is that so you might still more powerful than you let on still i doubt this changes anything prepare yourself pelleas
but wait theres so much i want to ask you
ilyana  im sorry if i were a better king this wouldnt have happened im sorry 
your majesty i dont know whats happened all i know is that my friends are hurting each other if that means i have to stop you to save them then im going to try im sorry 
zihark  i only ever wanted to help our people im sorry it came to this
so am i your majesty i dont understand any of this but i do know that it has to stop
jill you told me once that you wished for me to become a good king for our people i tried so hard  but i couldnt fulfil your wish im so sorry
its all right your majesty id wrongly assumed that you had turned into a tyrant please forgive my desertion
to die in this lonely place  its my fate  but  for micaiah  i must  i must live 
dont come near me i can barely  i dont want to do this get away
ugh  gh  im impossible i wasnt  this cant  guh 
prince kurthnaga
its so hot  im burning up my body its on fire
can you hear me i guess not kurth whats happening to you
i dont want to fight  i  i dont want to take any more lives 
rafiel  exactly what in the goddesss name are you doing you herons are making me tear my feathers out do you want to die after all this time apart from your family you want to die did that crazy wolf hit you on the head
tibarn no its not like that i just want  
hey i know youre worried about this maiden of daein but thats no reason to join up with the bad guys
bad guys tibarn its not like that they are not evil and im not against you or anyone for that matter
then explain to me whats going on go ahead im listening
i i want to help micaiah thats all really thats why i thought i should be by her side for this battle 
right then that means youre an enemy now are you ready rafiel youd better hope that queen of yours taught you some fancy moves if youre planning on surviving me
tibarn i  sniff 
h hey rafiel cmon now you know i wouldnt hurt you sorry i scared you all right
sniff sniff 
rafiel stop theres no crying in battle get up now please
 uhh
rafiel you cant push yourself any further get away from here now i forbid you to die before i do
  as you wish nailah everyone  please forgive me
rafiel what are you doing why are you fighting for daein
please forgive me ike i only wish to help micaiah
then join back with tibarn if you stay here with daein youre our enemy and if youre my enemy then ill have no choice but to take you down
but i just want to help micaiah im not against you please put the sword down
i dont know how to deal with this rafiel you leave me no choice ill have to knock you out and drag you over to tibarn maybe hell know how to deal with you
daddy
meg im glad youre safe and sound hows my baby girl
im doin swell its good to see you too daddy
meg can you do daddy a favor i dont know what in blazes is going on but family has gotta stick together why dont you be a good little girl and mosey on over to your daddys side
no i cant im sorry daddy micaiah is a good person i believe in her i want to fight for her
well shucks this aint no good at all i hope those higher ups get their act together soon but one things for sure youre my girl no way are we gonna fight not for anybody or anything
meg why are you still with the daein army theyre in the wrong and you know it i know its selfish of me to ask but im pleading with you come with me
i cant  im sorry i hope that this doesnt get in the way of our wedding but i cant do that
is it because of micaiah
yes everybody knows that this whole war is a mess and that none of us should be fighting right now but lady micaiah is fighting for her people and im gonna stick with her until the very end
meg i understand how you feel
but i dont consider you my enemy not at all not ever please try to understand
im so sorry meg i should be standing alongside you but my country has lost its mind i didnt want to hurt you too
lets hope for the fight to end soon  then we can be together again and get back to making wedding plans
right 
meg im glad i found you lower your sword and listen to me
no i cant im not supposed to talk to my enemies
enemies am i an enemy to you meg
um  not really but this being a battlefield and all i just thought itd be easier for both of us if  
meg i could never attack you no matter the circumstance
i couldnt hurt you either jill its probably a bad thing for a soldier but i dont care youre my friend
i dont understand whats going on  this war is so meaningless cant you tell me why daein is still fighting
im sorry jill i cant its not that i dont want to its because i want to protect you all i can say is that i feel as helpless as a plow without an ox i wish we could all be together like a family again
meg 
ugh  all this chaos  i can barely see straight 
still no word from the battle whats going on out there i should go to my people they may need me
hey just where do you think youre going do you think the high and mighty apostle should be traipsing around a battlefield hmm
wha   oh its just you hmph how dare you sneak up on me that way
that beauty from the holy guards told me to keep an eye on you so do me a favor and sit still will you
but i cant see anything from here i have to know how my people are faring down there i i cant bear doing nothing hmm  i have an idea you carry me to a place where i can observe the battle dont give me that look youre the one who agreed to guard me so do your duty and obey your orders come on lets get moving
wait a minute  is that what passes for beorc logic these days no wonder youve lost your throne ow stop that
are you going to obey me or shall i have you chased back home in a cloud of feathers
by the goddess what have i gotten myself into as you wish empress my back is yours
my body feels like its on fire  i can hardly breathe so this is what war feels like  no please dont come near me  i dont want to hurt anyone
whe what did you say did somebody call for me who just called out my name
micaiah micaiah whats wrong
wait im coming ill be right there
ike get over here quick mist collapsed
mist mist whats wrong
ike  my head  it hurts so much  its the medallion 
what do you mean
the medallion is calling out to me  please ike  take me to the medallion 
mist talk to me wake up please
ill clear you a path take mist with you get her out of here quick
boyd 
dont worry i wont die here you take care of yourself all right hang in there for me
boyd  i will i promise
look after her all right ike make sure nothing happens to her
i will thanks for this boyd
whats this light is it the medallion
she collapsed too
i get it now anyone who has the spirit of order within them is affected by this light
tibarn queen nailah what are you two doing here
reyson collapsed suddenly i figured id take him to a safe place
rafiel fell unconscious as well i thought id let him rest with leanne but then i found that she had collapsed too
and you think the medallion did this to them mist
the seal on the medallion is about to break  it cant be controlled anymore  my song wont work anymore  were running out of time 
what are you talking about
call the apostle  she must sing the galdr of release  hurry before its too late  please ike  i can hear a voice  its inside my head  the voice is telling me that we must not awaken the dark god through war 
a voice in your head mist what is going  
hey mist wake up
ulki do you hear me bring the apostle here at once
are you sure about that mist is saying that she should sing the galdr of release shes saying that we should wake up the dark god
the seal will break anyway if thats the case then we should take a chance on your sister and do what she says
i agree with the hawk king its too late to calm the dark god back to sleep it would take too long
do you think well be safe if the apostle wakes up the dark god didnt we fight a major war to prevent that from happening a few years ago
i dont know are we safe now but i did always wonder why heron queen lillia passed down the galdr of release she must have left it behind for a good reason im willing to bet my life on it
its the only choice for our survival besides we wont know if itll work until we try
all right  lets do it
i brought the apostle with me
 and a little extra baggage
reyson leanne
now now tibarn i know youre angry but well work it out when this is over
not a chance naesala i hope youve said all your prayers and farewells after i break every bone in your body im going to rip your wings off and feed them to you before you get to die
hawk king tibarn i must ask you for your patience this man serves under my command
you think i care child this is a laguz matter you should see yourself out of it very quickly
i will explain later put aside your past quarrels for now not to repeat the king of kilvas but we have more pressing issues we must attend to oh and hawk king dont ever call me child again
hmph fine you get to live now naesala once this is done though youre a corpse
so what would you have me do i will use all the power at my disposal to help in this
sing the galdr of release for us the song that was passed down from the heron queen to my mother then from my mother to mist
but if i sing that galdr before the medallion it would awaken the dark god 
this is what my sister said we must not awaken the dark god with the spirit of chaos we must use the galdr of release instead the seal will break if we just leave the medallion alone please sing the song
better than releasing the dark god through war is that it very well i shall try
whats going on nothings happening
its not working but why
a bird
a melody alone wont work
wait this is right in the middle of enemy territory
sothe why are you here
commander ike and the laguz kings  even the apostle is here i thought youd all be on the battlefield commanding the army this just got really really bad 
mist and the herons collapsed because of that thing
 i can hear the voice finally we get to meet i have been guided by this voice for so long  i have finally found my purpose
galdrar consist of melody and lyrics without both in harmony the songs have a mere fraction of the power
maiden of daein the only part i was taught was the melody i do not know the lyrics
the words they are passed down through the ages like a bloodline though time may pass their meaning is never lost when i heard you sign the melody the words came to me
micaiah i dont understand what youre going on about theres no way you could  
sothe shut up and watch
when i heard the melody the lyrics felt as if they poured out from deep within me i know this song ive known it since before i was born i am 
good morning to you my goddess
what has happened a thousand years have not passed why am i awoken early
indeed my goddess you have been asleep for 780 years during that time the world kept its promise to you for a mere two hundred years at best it was as you said neither the laguz nor beorc could resist the urge to fight they are too weak though there are 220 years left until the thousandth year there is no longer any need to wait
is that so that is your analysis then i shall pass down my judgment i will save them from themselves
ugh 
mist how do you feel
ike you look so worried  what happened where am i anyway the last i remember i was on the battlefield 
you dont remember
i had a horrible headache and my stomach really hurt  then suddenly it all went away
unnh 
reyson
tibarn  what is this place
are you all right reyson
naesala why are you here you betrayed us again you dastard
i had my reasons i know youll never forgive me but i at least want you to hear me out but it can wait tibarn and i will work out our problems first you go ahead and sleep now all right
very well  im glad to hear that 
start talking before i tear your arms off
whatever my reasons you wont forgive me i know that but im asking you to put your feelings aside for now were both worried about the herons right
you spineless piece of trash you used that line on me before remember and look what my forgiveness did to my people you live now because i choose for you to live naesala once this mess gets sorted though ill be wearing your beak as a trophy get out of my sight
rafiel and leanne are still out cold will they be all right
theres no need to worry theyre just not used to the spirit of chaos being so near theyll wake up soon
micaiah what happened to the dark god is she awake
im not micaiah shes sleeping right now
what what are you saying if youre not micaiah then where is she
i wonder where ashera is we must hurry and make our judgment wait what are you doing no you must consult with me first no dont do this
mist are you all right
yes im fine what happened though what was that light
i dont know  but its very quiet outside too quiet i hope everyones ok 
so can you tell whats going on out there
 impossible i cant hear anything  either that light took my hearing or theres nothing out there 
what do you mean there were thousands of troops 
ill go take a look
its time everyone lets go outside
h hey micaiah wait
what in  what happened theyre statues 
hey anyone can anyone hear me somebody please
answer me is anyone here
whats this a bag of spirit powder
yeah you said you wanted one right
and you found one for me thanks boyd youre the greatest
yeah well you always take such good care of us
 
whats wrong mist are you feeling sick you look a little pale
yeah ive been feeling a bit under the weather lately
hey you cant go out and fight if youre feeling sick you should rest
no no way
mist
im staying with everyone i have to im not going to be left behind something might happen
but youre in no condition to 
dad never came back he died somewhere and i wasnt there to say goodbye
aww but thats  
thats why im not staying behind i want to stay with my family until our last moment together please boyd dont stop me
all right i wont say anything i wont tell you to stay behind either i guess ill just have to be careful to protect you when were out in the field does that sound good
yes boyd thank you
ah i see 
then you secure it right there and  there its finished
yeah shinon youre the greatest im so proud that youre my teacher
oh come on rolf dont make puppy eyes at me
what but its true youre really amazing
cut it out kid you exaggerate too much
are you going to sell this one to aimee again can i come along please
im not selling this one
what but  oh i got it youre going to use it yourself then can i fight alongside you i want you to teach me that trick where you shoot them in the neck and then  
we can talk about that later here this is for you go on take it
but this is  
youve been running around camp with that silly grin plastered on your face but i can tell all the fightings wearing you down i cant help you get a good nights sleep or make you eat your vegetables but i can see that youre using a decent bow
shinon 
i dont know why were fighting this stinkin war but i aint about to die like a dog and i know youre too young to be pushing up daisies
but i 
whats your problem kid
i cant possibly pay you back for it a great bow like this  what can i do you taught me how to shoot a bow how to make a bow and thats not all youve given me so much and yet theres nothing i can do to pay you back for it
of all the stupid 
ouch
quit whining at me
oww you didnt have to hit me with that bow
did i ever ask you to pay me back did i ever tell you my help had any strings attached no kids should be kids and just learn from their elders
but

assembling is forbidden all violators will be punished immediately
assembling we were just talking around the well 
silence no excuses
gyaaahhh
can i really have just seen that
lady fiona the self proclaimed liberation army is on the march marados army has been ordered to deploy with us
understood general we will prepare immediately but i need to address your soldiers conduct  
a new war is afoot you never answered ashnards call to arms in the last one you have a reputation for ruling wisely dont endanger your people by hurling ugly accusations at my soldiers i trust i neednt worry that youll fail to answer the empires call
i will not lie to you my people are proud citizens of daein and some agree with these so called liberators however i will not lead my people into danger over ridiculous rumors of some unknown orphan prince
im glad to hear it
i need a volunteer follow that womans every move i trust her no farther than i can throw her
well well the rumors that my operatives started have spread like wildfire through all of daein late king ashnards orphan surfaces silver haired maiden at prince pelleass side now that we have the peoples attention we snag their hearts well just extol the savior fan the rebellion go to battle and conquer the enemy in a blaze of glory
do we have sufficient forces to arouse said rebellion and achieve victory
you let me worry about that this highly sophisticated strategizing is beyond your young minds worry not my prince after painstaking investigation i have determined the exact locations to target gather round all of you hear my plan for our next strike
if the liberation army attacks any of these places we are assured of an absolute victory
masterful as always izuka its good to know i can count on you
first well target talrega it borders the frontier begnions hold is shaky and resentment runs high
no talrega is no good
wha what was that on what grounds are my decisions being questioned by this this child
the timing is wrong because of the rains we wont be able to advance well let alone fight
its true im from talrega and i remember well the landslides and floods that come every spring the mountain road leading to that particular work camp is notoriously dangerous
wha what impossible my my strategy is flawless perfect even hmph i never 
micaiah where do you think we should attack
  terin  well have better luck in terin
terin too lies in the mountains but in the arid northern region where the weather is predictable
micaiah youre amazing i count my blessings to have you as vice general you give me hope
lady micaiah few outsiders know of the landslides in talrega have you been there before
micaiah is a powerful seer we in the dawn brigade owe our lives and our freedom to her abilities
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhggghhhk
goodness izuka what is it
she can foresee battle outcomes magnificent why didnt anybody tell me of this this only makes the maiden that much more appealing and let us just be honest here my foresight in decreeing her vice general was wondrous  nay genius
 
excellent well then yes all bow to the maidens vision lets leave the camp and make for terin
yes thats what i heard what with that light and that silver 
could she  could she be the silver haired maiden
hm
oh it is it is you
oh  oh my 
youre fighting with king ashnards son to free daein arent you oh weve heard so much about you
oh what a blessing what a blessing
were all waiting were waiting for the day you free us from those filthy begnion pigs
please take this
its not much but people from all over the village pitched in
oh no i couldnt possibly 
thank you we appreciate your kindness
 
were all counting on you please free us
 
looks like izukas propaganda is working fast
mm
you didnt want me to take the money did you
its not that its just  oh never mind
oh come on what did i do this time youre not going to say great in that case lets get out of here and go find the others
so youre staying then
i appreciate your concern however i  
you cant leave prince pelleass side is that not so
thats right
then take this at least almedha a sending stone
do you remember how to use one
of course i remember how to use one but its such a precious gift  are you sure about this thank you kurth
kurth where are you
i must go now
please remain safe
you as well
 
kurth
micaiah how nice to see you
kurth im leaving for terin i know this is sudden to tell the truth im surprised too
i see you are off to perform your first duties as a general of this liberation army
yes
i abhor violence i do not think you should fight
kurth im not fighting because i enj  
i know i know you wish there were another way and i understand that you feel this is what you must do to save your country
 
here take this
what is it
may it serve to protect you micaiah i must leave you now i am going home to my own country
what so suddenly
im sorry micaiah being so close to battle frightens me to tell the truth thank you for rescuing me and thank you for the short time we spent together i enjoyed it immensely
will i ever see you again
who knows why dont we  yes let us leave it up to the goddess
i suppose we must
a small troop approaches from the east it appears to be the daein liberation army
 blissfully ignorant of the trap that awaits them i pity them really have the first platoon assume their battle positions
shall we deploy too
kind of you to offer lady fiona but the first platoon will suffice here this is really none of marados business
i see in that case well use this opportunity to observe the empires army at work
hornet hairs at this rate theyll breach our lines before we can stop them i have no choice you bring out the prisoners
im sc scared please dont hurt me
lord laverton exactly what are you planning to do
this so called liberation army is forcing me to sacrifice this boy
help
no
micaiah
fight and these people will be executed right now surrender and they will be spared
 everyone throw down your weapons
you have a feeling dont you got it well follow your instinct
ha ha ha ha ha  a wise choice girl well no more need for these prisoners is there kill them all
no
what do you think youre doing
ill have nothing to do with you and your monstrous tactics
so you betray us after all marado has never been known for holding its faith youll die like the rest
a troop of daein cavalry just mutinied is this what you sensed
yes now we must reinforce them and help save the hostages
y you pretentious little fools ill show you how insignificant you are
gu uarrgh  you disgust me 
making hostages of the helpless is that how knights of the great begnion empire operate
shut up shut up shut up
wh what kind of monster are you a su sub human b but there are no wolf sub humans
 
dont just stand there say something you vile beast
general jarod will never ever overlook this betrayal marado will be put to the torch and your people will be put to the sword you will rue this day
empty threats my fate lies in defending my country and my people you dont stand a chance against that kind of loyalty
dear boy im sorry you had to suffer on our account
i wasnt scared i knew the dawn brigade would save us thank you
thank you for rescuing my people
your people so you must be  
yes i am lanvegas daughter fiona after my father died i assumed the governance of marado
general lanvega from the song bryce tauroneo gawain and lanvega  four riders of daein one country one king while they bear our banner a free daein shall sing youre that general lanvegas daughter
indeed  lanvega of the four riders he was a good friend and a mighty swordsman as well and stubborn as a mule your father was a powerful warrior of unquestionable integrity a great man
yes and thats why he renounced his rank and title as rider and withdrew from court life rather than serve king ashnard youve heard the rumors no doubt that ashnard murdered his own father my father could not serve such a man  and so to protect marado from a madman we did not send men to fight for daein in the war i doubt you could ever forgive us 
no quite the opposite you are these peoples steward and you chose the course that would protect them but now begnion is willing to sacrifice innocent children to maintain their grip over our country we cannot allow that that is why we are asking you to lend your strength to the liberation army together we can reclaim our country
and now you ask us to bear part of the burden of restoring our motherland if you would have my lance then  i fiona steward of marado do gladly swear allegiance to your liberation army i and my men bind ourselves to your fate use my army as best you see fit
and now marado betrays us as well you are aware that riots broke out in three other regions yesterday are you not  all quelled immediately of course but the unrest grows
who cares what the commoners do or think does the shepherd fuss when his sheep butt their heads against the fence post
nevertheless as the insurgence grows news of it will inevitably reach begnion
yes  i see what you mean that would be less than desirable
the imperial prime minister sephiran casts a grim eye on dishonesty if he finds out what has been going on in daein under our rule 
that would not be good sephirans persistent as a mosquito and quick to judge though you and i know i have been nothing but fair and just in my rule here its best to avoid an inquiry
which leaves us but one recourse  crush the rebel faction before it grows larger exterminate them then the commoners bereft of all hope will turn their sheep eyes back to us and beg to rejoin the flock
i see well i leave the matter in your hands what funding you need is yours
im glad we agree on this well then pardon me sir while i tend to our little lambs on the loose
the liberation armys sweeping victory seems to signal a turn in the war for daein however general jarod uses his superior numbers to harry the group and threaten their fragile momentum begnion has fortified its army with weapons and supplies bought with funds stolen from daein begnion has also purchased the swords of a vast number of mercenaries from these same stolen funds
it must bolster its ranks if it is to meet begnion on equal terms its only hope lies locked in begnions prison camps where daeins former soldiers await their rescue
yes thats what i heard what with that light  and that silver 
could she  could she be the silver haired maiden
hm
oh it is it is you
oh  oh my 
youre fighting with king ashnards son to free daein arent you oh weve heard so much about you

how should we explain yesterday to sothe and nolan
its like you said we didnt have a choice we had to save nico and the townsfolk but i admit getting spotted by those begnion soldiers was unfortunate still id do it all over again the worst part is they know were near they could find this hideout as easily as they found our last one
i just dont get it this is our country  why do we have to live in hiding like prisoners in our own land
come on you know why we lost the war and crimea won its not our country anymore end of story
except that crimea walked away after winning leaving those heartless begnion dogs to rule our country for the last three years the occupying soldiers march around like they own the place doing whatever they want and no one dares to stop them
to be fair crimea didnt have the resources to rule another country
sothe and nolan too welcome back im glad you made it in one piece
at last the dawn brigade is all present but you are unusually late were you delayed
i think our fames catching up with us begnion patrols are everywhere it took us a while to avoid them
ive never seen so much begnion activity in this area before is there something we should know
um well actually the truth is 
ah thats what did it you had a run in with bandits
and begnion soldiers spotted us as we made our escape im sorry we only wanted to help we were careless
well worry about that later more importantly micaiah were you seen healing anyone with sacrifice
im afraid so
you cant allow anyone to know what you can do healing without any tomes or staves is a rare gift— almost unheard of if anyone saw you doing it youd be given away immediately and i dont know if i could keep you safe
i know sothe
i know you know but you keep doing it this place isnt safe anymore we should leave at once
correct ah but it would have been nice to eat just one meal in peace 
this ways no good either begnion soldiers have every alleyway blocked a kitten couldnt sneak past them
it looks like this really is the least guarded path then even so its swarming with soldiers
there are more coming up behind us well be trapped if we dont move quickly
we cant wait for sothe
the stairs by the church lead to the marketplace we can break through there
ill go first and secure the way micaiah and leonardo cover my back remember to keep your distance from the enemy team up and bring them down one by one
well be careful
leave it to us
edward you bring up the rear your skills have improved but youre still new to fighting dont rush the enemy just focus on surviving their attacks got it
yeah yeah i got it
captain isaiya just as you said a group that appears to be the dawn brigade is storming the alley
how generous of them ill wipe them out and advertise my exploits to our commanders back home
you there you must be  ah you neednt say a word i see the goodwill in your eyes take this and go quickly youve done so much for daeins poor its time we did something in return
those beasts they do whatever they want in our country theyre even sending our clergy to their awful camps but im helpless i dont have your strength or courage this axe  you should have it
what fast little mice you are how long do you plan on scurrying around in back alleys
what this cant be im in my prime  not so easily 
step aside
the girl weve been looking for the lucky little escapee too bad for you sweetie your luck ends today
everybody this way
theyre running to the center of town after them
good work i see the market if we can blend into the crowd theyll lose us and well be free and clear
hey lady
nico
theyre after you again arent they
are you and your friends all right
moldy onions whered they go
leave the soldiers to us go on now get yourselves to safety
quickly— dont dawdle you must escape youre our only hope
thank you so much
wait there they go catch them
what are you stopping for
w well they 
you wont get past us we stand by the dawn brigade
thats right goddess protect the dawn brigade
wait something terrible is about to happen
what is it
  no we have to go back
what youre letting this rabble stop you ready your bows nobody defies the will of begnion
no how could you shoot a child you vicious savages
someone someone help him quickly please this child is dying
 pay heed this is what happens when you meddle in begnion affairs of state remember it well
i didnt realize that the begnion empires affairs of state included murdering children in the street
dont point your fingers at us were just doing our job if youre upset blame the dawn brigade they made this happen
its the girl were looking for call for reinforcements surround and arrest every last one of them 
whats happening what does she think shes doing hey you step away from that child
it its a miracle weve seen a miracle today
that was sacrifice 
that girl she must be the silver haired maiden only she possesses sacrifice
stop right there after them we cant let them get away
we still stand by the dawn brigade
what is wrong with you people did you hear me clear a path or youll end up like that kid
 you sniveling idiots why are you just standing there give chase now
yes sir we would like to sir but the townspeople are blocking our way
oh i see the townspeople are blocking your way you dullards
clean out those dirty ears and listen to me you are soldiers and i am your commander you will follow my orders promptly and without hesitation understand you useless vermin now move
unbelievable if its not one thing its another why am i always stuck leading the buffoons
 mmm 
are you awake now thank goodness do you see this is why i told you not to use sacrifice 
we sure showed them in nevassa huh i guess we cant go back there  not for a while anyway
im so fond of nevassa its where we all met it feels like my only real home we will return someday
we will micaiah i know you and you have a way of getting what you want
because youre always there to help me get it sothe

why did it have to come to this i always thought our queen elincia was about as good as they come lowering taxes and looking after orphans
the young folk dont care bout that stuff they only care about whats getting their dander up then they ignore everything else i reckon thats why we gotta do what we gotta do if we dont step up the whole countryll be goin on the compost heap
thats why weve got to get to queen elincia right away its all gonna be just fine if i know her majesty shell take care of this uprising in no time then we can return to our farms and grow some mighty good eats all of ya just hold tight now
in a rural crimean town a band of rebels sow the seeds of discontent they are stopped by brom and nephenee two former crimean soldiers however more uprisings are sure to follow
brom and nephenee decide to travel to melior the capital of crimea and inform queen elincia as to the gravity of the situation
/***EOF***/
thank you for coming today everyone i am in your debt all of you the king of gallia caineghis the king of phoenicis tibarn the serenes royal family rafiel and reyson and the queen of crimea elincia who worked tirelessly to arrange this meeting and generously extended her hospitality she gave me hope when i was driven out of my country and offered aid when all seemed lost you have my sincere gratitude
before we begin allow me to make a few things clear about the recent war between begnion and the laguz alliance when we received your letter stating that the senate had made scapegoats of the herons for the previous apostles assassination prime minister sephiran and i decided to investigate the senate and prosecute them if needed then the senators made their move
what did they do
they imprisoned me in a room in the mainal cathedral they then forged an arrest warrant for sephiran and jailed him  i admit there had been major rifts between myself and the senators in the past however i had no idea that they would stoop to such deplorable acts i should have known this is all my fault
we didnt think you were behind all this war mongering what you just told us confirms what we had guessed
i have been forced to flee my country but that doesnt change the fact that i am the empress of begnion i will not allow the senate to declare me false nor will i stand by as they seize and ravage begnion i must return to my country save my people and take back my birthright to accomplish all this i would like to form an alliance with the laguz tribes help me save begnion
i will accept if you agree to a few conditions first the immediate and total emancipation of any laguz remaining in slavery second that new diplomatic relations between our peoples start with a clean slate no bias against beorc or laguz shall be tolerated lastly a full alliance between our countries to further solidify this agreement if you agree to these terms i give my support i hope that a long last the dream that both king ramon and i held can come to fruition
i agree with king caineghis completely if these conditions are agreed to crimea would like to join this alliance as well
do you intend to return the serenes forest to the herons when you take back the throne
of course the goddess loved the forest because the herons made their homes there i will see to it that you can return home
my brother we can finally go home our family can be together again in our own homeland for the first time in decades 
all right im all for this i didnt need much convincing though i just want to rip those idiots senators in half
gallia phoenicis serenes and crimea shall hereby make a pledge apostle sanaki we will wholeheartedly support your effort tot return to the throne so long as we stand united in our ideals please bring peace back to our lands
each of you has my deepest gratitude i will accomplish that goal
so it sounds like everyone is on the same side now thats the best news ive heard in a long time
i feel the same but its too early to celebrate i will not be happy until i take back my country how we fare in the battles to come will be of the utmost importance
the greil mercenaries would be glad to help i know that were a small unit but well do our best to see the job done right
i certainly hope you will especially since ive decided to make you the commander of our combined forces
wait hold on there what did you say listen apostle sanaki im really flattered but general zelgius is much more qual  
zelgius returned to the empire by himself to rescue prime minister sephiran our army consists of the troops he left behind as well as the armies of crimea gallia and phoenicis ike youre probably the only person on the face of tellius who commands respect from all four countries represented here
ike i know youre not happy about this but youre the only person who can bridge the rift between the laguz and beorc
no im not happy about it i thought my days of being a general ended three years ago but i wont refuse if you think im the only person who can pull this off then ill do my best not to let you down
thank you ike let us go meet with the armies and the soldiers you will be leading they will want to meet their new commander
not again 
it is time to get moving do we have a target
first well head for flaguerre the fortress town between crimea and begnion since the laguz alliance has fought in flaguerre already were familiar with the lay of the land
sounds like a good plan do you still resent your choice to command this army
no offense apostle but you didnt give me much of a choice in the first place besides if im not fully committed how can i expect these troops to be just remember when this is all over youll be getting one heck of a bill
oh im sure and i know youll be worth it speaking of which i have something for you consider it a down payment
im sure you remember this blade it is the holy sword ragnell please take it
are you sure about this i returned it after the mad kings war because you said it was one of begnions national treasures
indeed this sword was used by empress altina the first apostle of begnion back in the early days of the empire it was one of the two swords the empress used to fight the dark god i can think of no better person to give it to
all right id be happy to use it again thanks
excuse me i bring urgent news to queen elincia and general ike of the apostles army
what happened
weve received a report that the daein army has appeared near the border between daein and crimea the daein army demands custody of the apostle on behalf of begnion they will use force if necessary
daein wants to get in our hair again perfect
 i am puzzled by this why does daein support the senate well i suppose it doesnt matter ike we must change our target
agreed we have to get daein out of our way before we do anything else
so daein still refuses to negotiate
either they believe the senates lies or the senate is pulling some strings behind the scenes
well whatever the reason we cant attack begnion without taking care of this first
i will not give up i wont stop sending messengers until they respond ike i leave you in charge here
lets keep our numbers small we shouldnt provoke them any further
i understand gallia will stay behind
youll have your turn soon skrimir i promise all right lets go
i cannot believe this its an army of sub humans and beorc it must be true that this apostle is a fake the true apostle would never join forces with those filthy creatures
the enemy has sent a messenger once again commander this is the third time theyve asked to negotiate
ignore the messengers we must protect this bridge that is the order from the maiden of dawn
hey sorry to keep you waiting i had a little thing back at camp that i had to deal with
no problem tibarn what kind of thing oh and hey wheres reyson
he was exhausted but he insisted on coming with me i had to tie him down to a bed to keep him there
really
nah im just kidding he passed out earlier so i have a different anchor slowing me down this time
 tibarn youre horrible i am not an anchor
leanne
i um i will fight yes
shes reysons sister for sure the girl is as stubborn as he his listen up young lady you herons are supposed to be more like rafiel quiet and graceful and all that
dont mind tibarn leanne were honored to have you here
followers of the false apostle bow down to the miracles of our savior as long as the maiden of dawn watches over us we cannot be defeated
my death means nothing  the maiden of dawn will bring victory to daein
your troops fought bravely i commend your effort
but your force has been obliterated i order you to retreat continue this fight and you will die
fool the battle is not over yet the maiden of dawn has helped us overcome every adversity 
the daein army is much stronger than it was three years ago
yes by far even after the situation turned against them every soldier fought with valor quite impressive
they kept muttering about the power of their general this maiden of dawn the soldiers seem obsessed with her
this might sound strange but think of it like this they believe in her as much as you holy knights believe in the apostle
hmph i understand they are formidable and deluded then i shall use caution
micaiah its over the front line is broken the apostles army is crossing the bridge
all right then order a retreat
wh what no are you a simpleton just destroy the bridge
inspector  with all due respect daein soldiers will also die if we destroy the bridge now
those are called acceptable losses my dear and any losses suffered by your men are acceptable if it means stopping that army as a representative of the senate i will not allow you to retreat fight to the last man
inspector while i respect your opinion  the final decision is up to me as commander in chief of this army sothe order the retreat get those men out of there before theyre routed
insolent little brat how dare you disobey my orders
we could always leave you here while the rest of us retreat inspector hows that sound
y you  i will report this incident to both your king and the senate start thinking of an excuse now perhaps
pompous fool 
well ill go order the retreat
micaiah
i im sorry i 
dont move ill be right back
whats happening i was doing so well for a while  i feel like fog is clouding my mind  am i losing my powers
funny  i always wished that i didnt have this farsight  it often feels like such a burden  but this clouded vision seems so strange now i miss the clarity  ironic isnt it yune
 hm
whats wrong rafiel
i sensed something strange it just came out of the blue it was some sort of voice 
my brother did you call me
i did not you heard it too reyson
whats going on here what was that voice
i dont know but its calling for us the voice was coming from the northeast  from the direction of daein
i have a bad feeling about this let us head for daein please prepare to leave immediately i will speak with king caineghis and get permission to leave
i hope nothing has happened to your sister
as do i  all i know is that i must go there that much is certain
apostle sanakis army with ike at its head wins a great victory over daein at oribes bridge however apostle sanaki elects not to pursue the retreating daein forces instead she petitions king pelleas for permission to pass through daein
after waiting for several days she receives no reply and sanaki reluctantly orders a march avoiding the heart of daein the army skirts along the mountains and makes its way south
im here what do you want
hmph dont look so sour
i always look like this apostle sanaki
ah yes thats true well i didnt summon you to talk about your grumpy expressions i wanted to give you something before we set off for battle
what is it
do you know what this is
not a clue
when i fled the cathedral i took some valuables with me this is called a master crown its said to release a beorcs hidden power
ive never heard of it
not everyone can use it so think before you pass it on to someone
all right ill take it thank you
general ike thank you for helping the apostle i appreciate it from the bottom of my heart
i would have refused if id known that id be commanding the entire army
thats why we didnt tell you beforehand
thats a pretty devious move sigrun
here are some funds so you can properly prepare for the upcoming battle show us how youve grown since the days of the mad kings war general
rahh hyahh hahh
 
hiyah umph hahh
you really push yourself in training dont you kieran
huh ah oscar you snuck up on me only a true rival of mine could accomplish such a feat
ive been watching for half an hour
what then why didnt you say hello and i would have expected better manners
i did you didnt notice
ah yes my concentration while training is unbreakable no one can distract me
hmm i wonder if he realizes that he contradicts everything he says
what was that if you have something to say let it out speak like a man stand tall
yes yes whatever you say here i got this for you
what is this
this is an imbue scroll imbue is a skill you should learn especially since you always train until youre soaked in your own blood
ive never heard of such a skill is it special
oh yes its very special
why would you give such a precious thing to me
well um  i just told you
i cannot accept it i accept no charity from rivals
why do you have to be like this
we are equals i need no favors from you run along now
sigh
i dont have the time to talk to you im too busy training go on leave
ahem  it was meant as a symbol of friendship for my lifelong rival
what
but i guess if you wont accept it ill find someone else who will
wait ill take it
youd swallow your own words
ugh never however  i note that your lifelong rival is me and no one else if your gift will mark me as your lifelong rival i must have it
thats what i like about you sir simpleton
you insult me
no that was a compliment youre a very simple knight living only for battle and whatnot

where is the imperial occupation army this time how can they keep the peace when theyre nowhere to be found

theyre only interested in chasing down the dawn brigade they let the real scoundrels run wild and brutalize us
theyre worse than useless well be glad to help you just find someplace to hide and leave those bandits to us
and dont worry about us we happen to be members of that same dawn brigade that the begnion troops are so interested in
what really you guys are in the dawn brigade wow my friends and i talk about you all the time

but we cant fight the rogues so well take you up on your offer please be careful theyre slice clean through you if they can

hold it stop right there
who are you bellowing at soldier
general jarod wh when did you arrive
answer my question maggot i want to know who you were yelling at and why you did nothing but yell at them
s sorry sir we suspect they were from the dawn brigade a band of thieves that targets goods levied from the town people say they give what theyve stolen back to the villagers and strut around acting like heroes
theyre said to have a witch among them a girl called the silver  haired maiden they say she can heal wounds instantly by laying her hands on any injury townspeople treat her like a savior
and what have you been doing about this band of fools
sir a few days ago we stormed their hideout we found a girl much like the silver haired maiden  we ran the dogs from their den but they were cunning and cautious and we lost them
i see im beginning to understand
how do you mean sir
im beginning to understand exactly how incompetent you all are
urk
make the villagers talk i want to know who these bandits are and where theyre hiding
y yes sir understood sir
i dont care who they are the more kick they have in them the more fun for us dont you think sir
precisely overseeing this dusty old town is wearing thin a little fresh game is just what i need
the northeastern nation of daein lost a bloody war with neighboring crimea three years ago crimea however abdicated its right to rule daein and passed sovereignty of its former enemy to the powerful begnion empire daeins future is now subject to the whims of the empire
begnions occupations forces have gathered all of daeins men of fighting age and put them to work in labor camps their work is brutal and void of purpose designed to break both body and spirit the remaining population faces poverty and starvation as the fields lie fallow a band of young heroes has escaped the begnion army to form a group called the dawn brigade fighting for a free daein they alone have stood against begnions forces they alone have shouldered the hopes of their nation
among the company is a young girl named micaiah who is said to possess mystical powers the people of daein have come to know her as the silver  haired maiden they have come to think of her as the savior for whom they had been waiting
begnions forces have tried time and time again to capture and silence the dawn brigade however micaiahs ability to sense impending danger has thus far allowed the dawn brigade to evade the empires grasp
/***EOF***/
listen and be amazed big news afoot the apostle is sending an inspection team to investigate the occupation armys abuses
really
she sent me a message that preparations are finally complete but wait it gets better she also issued an imperial edict to the occupation forces telling them to cease all military action immediately
does that mean the fighting is over that weve won
indeed its hard to believe its over it almost seems too easy
and best of all duke persis is leading the inspection team well be home free the moment they arrive our worries are over
duke persis lord sephiran so apostle sanakis dispatching one of the empires greatest men to handle this
what kind of man is he
he is amazing the best person ever hes incredibly influential and high up but he never stood on ceremony with us well go on you guys dont just stand there you have to spread the news
we have to spread the news arent you going with us
umm nah its mostly your doing well hold back let you take the glory
its izuka isnt it you dont want to come because hell be with the prince
well yeah basically
all right but wait here well come right back once weve announced the good news
 in light of which her imperial highness empress sanaki has conveyed to you this edict occupation forces are to hereby lay down all arms convene in daein keep and await the inspection team
hmmm 
duke numida maintains that your forces performed alleged abuses independently in flagrant violation of his orders the apostle in her mercy will hear your testimony do not abuse her magnanimous spirit and lose your small advantage
hah what a magnificently ruthless maneuver i didnt know numida had it in him disowning the entire occupation army and framing me for their actions brilliant
so then the game is over might we at least drag duke numida down with us
not a chance we are proof that duke numida  and therefore the entire senate  is corrupt no doubt theyll work together to silence us besides theres more tantalizing prey than those tottering relics if im to fall so too should the one who upended our plans and drove us to this dead end  that girl
oh  i like that our final mission
you create a diversion with the troops tonight after dark and i will seek our target the girls silver maned head
a hhrrmm silence prince pelleas would now like to favor you with a word you may begin my prince
am i dreaming everything looks so delicious what should i eat first 
everyone youve done a fine job once the inspection team arrives daein will be free once again in anticipation of our emancipation i invite you to eat and drink to your hearts content
 whew  yune what is it you didnt need to slip away from the banquet too
silly you youre kind of a mysterious bird you know that how is it you can fly around even at night
oh yune for some reason i feel so tired lately  but it wont be long  ill go back home to nevassa and then save daein 
so you escaped the idiots ball to be alone how trusting of you silver haired maiden  no  im sorry  priestess of dawn if you really can work miracles youd best work one up for yourself now
hm what oh begnion soldiers
general jarod why are you here
im doomed thanks to you but if i have to go down im taking someone with me  the vice general to the daein liberation army the revered priestess of dawn
even if you kill me the kingdom of daein will be reborn as long as the prince survives the people will fight
hah the prince hes a sham a travesty a clod of mud no amount of polishing could shine the real jewel  whose radiance attracts the people like moths to flame  is you priestess and so i shall steal you and extinguish daeins light of hope know despair priestess of dawn
ah
guhahh
who are you
be at ease maiden i shall not let him harm you i was once one of the four riders serving the army of old daein if you recall the name of the black knight you will withdraw from this place at once
riiiight thats precious youre the legendary black knight maybe you havent heard he died in the war but lets put your claim to the test if only to indulge my own amusement
then have at me and learn your folly
in due time but before i bother why dont you have a go round with my restless minions douse the torches
maiden i shall be your shield remain by my side
i will i know i can trust you
sir knight how did you know i was in danger
that is not important right now are you injured
no im all right
maiden stay by me i will not let them harm you
i know you wont thank you
i see youre pretty impressed with yourself
did you think the likes of you could be a worthy opponent for me know your place
general jarod your occupation army has caused untold suffering to the people of daein  the time has come you must atone for your deeds
as if i should care one whit about the wretched worms i trample
make your peace this blow will be your end
heh  how kind of you 
gugrh 
alder you  why are you here
id rather fight beside my general than create a distraction with the other soldiers
you idiot who asked you to join me
general jarod  you are a terror to work under even so ive always sensed a kindred spirit in you i will follow you and fight for you to the very gates of the abyss 
he was a good soldier  what now why dont you kill me
my sword is not made for killing those who will not raise their weapons
youve got to be kidding me
stop stop it both of you a man has died protecting you dont waste his sacrifice
this is not the end
no its not
you would simply let him go
he is not ours to judge he belongs to the apostle now i suppose he must bury his fallen friend and pray before facing her
you have my thanks for saving me
there is no need for thanks
micaiah are you safe
you micaiah run
sothe its ok this knight just saved my life
what micaiah do you know who this is
everybody knows who he is sothe he is the black knight one of the four riders under king ashnard and the strongest swordsman  
exactly the scum that general ike defeated in nados castle in crimea three years ago so how can he be here now alive
you are correct sothe ike did defeat me in that battle in a fashion but as you can see i managed to escape
what do you want
for daein to raise its banner as a kingdom once again i came here to protect those who are necessary for that dream
sothe general jarod was here a moment ago if the black knight hadnt stepped in jarod would have killed me
what but i dont see his corpse here and that means hes still alive isnt he
yes there was another soldier who sacrificed his life protecting jarod i presume jarods burying him now oh oh no 
what is it
i see a dark cloud  its dimming the light of hope  by letting jarod go i may have allowed something terrible to happen 
you arent sure
sothe i hadnt told you but i havent been feeling well lately my mind feels foggy things i could always see clearly are now dim and vague i may have committed us to an irreversible fate
i shall aid you no matter what jarod may plot i will prevent it
micaiah and i dont want your help
sothe stop that in king ashnards war you severed below general ike and you and the black knight were enemies but now you are comrades with the same goal  daeins restoration listen to me the black knight was daeins strongest general we need him
and i am willing to serve
sir knight  that you should come to us now is surely the will of the goddess i thank you for your aid just now and ask you to lend us your strength a while longer
may my sword serve you well maiden of dawn
i dont like this 
a figure from daeins past appears unexpectedly in the night a figure thought to have perished in the mad kings war the blood stained right hand of the king himself the mysterious black knight
the black knight protects micaiah against jarods cowardly surprise attack however micaiah suspects that jarod has one last move to make deprived of his chance to capture micaiah jarod abandons all notions of retreat or negotiation instead he makes plans for revenge he murders an emissary from his homeland of begnion and reclaims control of daein keep
from within the keep he launches a savage barrage of catapult fire all but destroying the castle town the momentary peace that arrived with the begnion emissary shatters along with nevassas walls and the people of the city see their kin and their capital crushed under a rain of stone this treachery proves too much for them and their grief explodes into rage
micaiah and company have pitched camp on a nearby hillside when this merciless attack begins its brutality leaves them lost for words
sothe how unusual to see you alone
prince pelleas you here to see micaiah
yes at least i intended to but she is quite popular isnt she shes always so busy talking to everyone that i can never get near her
theyre your soldiers tell them to get out of the way
no i cant do that my job is to be the symbol of daeins liberation but the priestess of dawn is no mere symbol for her the soldiers will gladly give their lives
prince pelleas
oh dont worry sothe im not jealous if thats what youre thinking it isnt like that although i have to admit i do envy her from time to time
hm
i almost forgot here these war funds are for you
but the wars over and besides this is a small fortune
yes well share it with the troops if you like i may not be much a leader but i truly appreciate the sacrifices everyone has made they deserve something in return divide it up as you see fit i trust your judgment
prince pelleas you should be the one to give the troops their reward
lady micaiah
hello jill what are you doing here
i saw you walking over here as i was heading back to my tent is something wrong you shouldnt be leaving camp by yourself
im just exhausted from talking to so many people but theres no need for concern i just need some time to myself
now that you mention it you do look a little pale why not rest in your tent itd be much more comfortable
i dont want sothe and the others to know how tired i am they worry too much
ah i can see that sothe seems so detached from everything unless it involves you  he gets so  worked up he strikes me as a bit overprotective
weve always lived by ourselves just the two of us i dont think he can help it
then i shall bring you some medicine and ill make sure no one sees me ill meet you at your tent
oh no that wont be necessary do you see that tree ill be resting over there i should recover in no time
but 
ill be safe were still in camp besides dont you have an errand of your own to take care of it must be really important to leave the feast so early in the evening
oh no not really i just thought id write a letter to a friend thats all
to the man you told me about the one you run a wyvern delivery service with
well  um yes you know everything dont you lady micaiah
youre going to tell him that the fighting is over right
yes more than anything he despises trouble he made a delivery to begnion and never returned im sure its the war that has kept him away
really
well indirectly at least to be honest its probably more about his napping give him a few minutes of free time and hes sure to close his eyes and drift away the war would certainly disrupt his sleep schedule
what an  interesting fellow well you should write him and let him know its safe to return
are you sure youre all right youre not pushing yourself too hard
im fine please dont worry about me
all right ill let you relax alone then oh but here  please take this
what is it
its a pass scroll it might come in handy please keep it if youd like
thank you jill i will
good night lady micaiah
/***EOF***/
this might be the end of our war the northern and central armies have merged a force of that size is too powerful for us if tibarn and naesala cant help us it might be a good idea to go back to gallia and regroup convincing skrimir wont be easy but i cant let our people get killed in a hopeless battle
understood ranulf this is your war so ill follow your orders i have to say though retreating wont be easy according to soren the central army has mobilized and begun marching on our position during the last few days
they finally brought in a competent commander huh hmmm  our path is blocked both ways  hey
hello boys its good to know you two still hang out together
tibarn glad to see youre safe but what happened didnt the bird tribes hit the supply unit the begnion central army is here and theyre marching on us
talk later eat now sorry but i gotta put something in my stomach and get some rest 
hows tibarn
hes resting inside that tent over there ike did you see them did you see his wings
yeah they were covered in blood hes not hurt so it must be someone elses 
i have this awful feeling  a feeling that something terrible has happened i really hope im wrong 
ike ranulf
reyson youre here too
your highness please wait
i have to check on him im worried about tibarn
were worried too but reyson cant just let him be for a while
janaff ulki whats going on what happened to you out there
naesala and the ravens of kilvas betrayed us again
im so mad i can barely see straight the ravens were informants they told begnion our battle strategy
it was a trap the supply unit we raided turned out to be the central army itself the troops were under the command of begnions most famous general zelgius
general zelgius this just got a lot worse 
youve heard of him
i met him during the mad kings war hes powerful experienced and clever one of the best generals of our time
yeah for a beorc he was quite powerful all right tibarn while shifted mind you attacked this zelgius guy zelgius didnt even budge an inch but all of a sudden he stopped fighting and said weve delayed you long enough if you cherish the lives of your people return home at once
he said that
so the king made a decision we flew night and day and reached phoenicis but it was too late save for the elderly women and children they were all 
i also heard what happened and  i just couldnt believe it naesala has betrayed us once again i cannot believe hed play a role in wiping out phoenicis 
hey were not wiped out yet
huh
tibarn
im alive and well my people are few but they still live phoenicis is still a country janaff ulki you know what we must do
of course
yes begnion and kilvas will burn for this
 so thats the whole story sorry we were late but now were here to stay and see this war out dont tell me you kittens are going to run off with your tails between your legs i wont accept that
of course not king tibarn ill get skrimir right now a slight delay but now that weve merged with the hawk tribe we have the strength to fight
our goal is to cross the ribahn the core of our forces will ford the river and attack the central army head on ranulf youll need to form a small unit of your best warriors and lead them behind enemy lines undetected can you do it
no sweat well do some officer hunting and keep their leaders attention on us
good but a distraction alone will not get us across the river theyve got the terrain and zelgius in their favor
bah use fewer words tiny beorc tell us what we must do some of us have a battle to fight
dont interrupt me again skrimir all these words may be the only thing that can possibly win this battle as i was saying while ranulf and his men sow confusion in the rear ranks a group of hawk laguz will carry the greil mercenaries south around the battlefield well cross the river and make our way to the supply train which also serves as the senators camp
ahhh i see what youre doing youre going to involve the senators and have them start messing things up
precisely zelgius is the military commander but the senators have authority over him if attacked they will panic and request aid he will be forced to return and rescue them zelgius is a soldier through and through he will not disobey an order no matter how foolish it might be once he leaves their front line will crumble thats when you advance tibarn and skrimir will lead the charge thats all is everyone clear on what they have to do
hmph i still dislike beorc tactics id rather face my enemy and give him my name before i snap his neck in my jaws but in order to defeat cowards we must use the weapons of cowards lets go
general zelgius the men are in position
good work hm  its becoming foggy
it looks like the hawk tribe has joined with the main force but im sure this fog will hinder them
i wouldnt be too sure about that the fog might actually be a boon to them well wait and see what move they make
general we hear splashing the laguz alliance is on the move
the vans marching halfway across the river already theres no point in waiting  oh well enemyll spot them soon
then its time to fight you should go
dont remind me i hate flying anyway give the word will you
 no need our friends heard every word
ah finally its time ive had enough of sitting around to wing brothers keep up with me if you can
my lord
 its nothing im needed elsewhere keep them engaged until i return
 yes sir
well well  sorry to drop in unannounced we thought it best to hunt the strongest prey first
 of course interesting maneuver
will you draw your blade
i trust you know who you face zelgius commander of this army if you are not worthy of fighting me then you are only wasting my time
im ranulf right hand to gallias future king  will that do
we shall see i shall accept your challenge
at your ready
what is all that noise and at this hour
a battle has begun on the other side of the woods near the river
then tell zelgius to wipe out the sub humans quickly and quiet down i cannot sleep with all this racket dont you peasants know i need my beauty sleep i should have you all flogged you inconsiderate fools
wretched snob 
were in soren lets go over the plan one more time
our objective is to destroy the enemy supplies the senators store their food and personal effects in crates if we burn those crates the senators will likely pull their troops back to protect their own hides
so while the laguz distract the enemy we force the gate open storm inside and burn all the supplies
exactly
we can also set their horses loose that should add to the confusion
agreed also please try not to hurt the senators themselves harming them might cause us trouble later on especially once the fighting is over
all right weve got to finish before the fog burns off lets get this done attack
enemies in the camp were under attack
how interesting i never expected them to attack this particular camp while the senators may deserve to get kicked around a little bit i cannot let my general down i shall protect this camp with all my power  soldiers of begnion wipe out the bandits kill every last one of them
youre with the laguz alliance w wait please i dont want to die for those useless decrepit old senators im getting out of here you can take whatever you want from this stash thanks
what um yes i was ordered to keep the lords valuables neat and tidy but the lord he ran away and well  what this he told me it was very precious here you take it
aaaaahhh  p please i beg of you spare me mercy
protect the supplies men if anything is ruined the senators will have our hides we cannot let this camp fall into chaos for the honor of general zelgius protect the stores
the laguz assault was a decoy and your real objective was this camp youre more clever than i expected this isnt the strategy of laguz it must have been planned by beorc
our objective is only to burn these supplies step aside and ill spare your life
you know i cant do that our masters may be fools but we are their soldiers nonetheless our duty is to carry out orders from our masters
i thought youd say that but i have a duty as well
protect the supplies  stay calm 
the fog is about to clear our work is done lets pull back
im impressed that youve held out this long but its over now good bye ranulf
pray to the goddess youre finished
ahh  i tried 
farewell
what
 hey there yknow you look kinda familiar
the king of phoenicis why did you transform do you not wish to fight me
oh i wish to fight you all right unfortunately i dont really have the time so ill let you go this time
what do you mean
general zelgius you must return at once our supply camp is in flames we need you to take control of the situation
what
i see now i understand
you were kind enough to tell me of the attack on my country im only returning the favor
understood i accept the favor then
ill let you go this time next time we meet keep your sword drawn and make sure youve said your prayers
ugh 
hey how are you doing thanks to ike the army is crossing the river as we speak we should go join skrimir can you move
no 
damn fine ill carry you dont get thrown off kid you better hang on tight
the laguz alliance bolstered by the hawk tribe and by sorens tactical genius thunders across the begnion held river emboldened by their success they move east with amazing speed and capture the northern stronghold castle seliora the laguz alliance has made a vital step in its march toward the begnion capital sienne
begnion has now lost a valuable defensive line in the ribahn river and the central army has been forced to retreat east taking refuge in castle gaddos the morale of the begnion soldiers is kept high by their faith in general zelgius while the begnion nobles smolder with resentment at their defeat
your strategist is something else does he have some kind of magic hat that he pulls all his crazy ideas out of
well i do pay him plenty for them
soren said this mission would fail without help from the phoenicis army were asking you to take a very big risk king tibarn
we can handle it we can do anything if it involves teaching those vermin in begnion a thing or two
soren has even answered some of skrimirs more insane requests he doesnt listen to a word i say but when soren talks strategy hes all ears
is that why he hasnt been complaining during the briefings
he says he looks forward to what the little strategist will say next it looks to me like sorens charmed his way into the most powerful position in this army
im glad to hear it hes changed hasnt he
yeah i think so he still doesnt say much but hes a lot more at ease these days he used to be completely closed off rejecting anyone who tried to get close like hed lock himself away all alone in his own little world
we all lost and gained something during the mad kings war maybe it wasnt a complete waste after all
do you think well feel the same way about this war when its over
who knows well have to survive it first
fair enough

three years ago crimea freed itself from daein tyranny its nobles used that freedom to berate the queen and scrabble for power disgusted with their greed and arrogance ike and the greil mercenaries left the court behind and returned to work thanks to their efforts and to queen elincias even handed rule crimea has avoided a bloody civil war
before departing the capital once again ike receives disquieting news from queen elincia the black knight the man who murdered ikes father has once again been seen in daein the queens words hang heavy over ike as he leads the mercenary group back to their headquarters
wow how long has it been since we were here it sure feels great to be home
yeah weve been away for too long  dealing with crimean nobles always seems to take longer than it should at least now we can finally get some rest
still it was nice to be needed dont you think especially for a band of mercenaries as poor as we are
you know ike if you hadnt renounced your lordship we wouldnt have to run around like this to support ourselves
mist i 
oh i know im just teasing you silly besides id rather spend my time helping people who wants to live like some overstuffed noble anyway definitely not me we have fathers legacy to look after as well the greil mercenaries
ike a visitor to see you
a visitor who is it
long time no see ike ive been looking all over crimea for you youre never home
ranulf how are you my old friend hows everyone in gallia is caineghis well
everyones doing great we laguz dont take ill too easily so its hard not to be well
seeing you again brings back memories we couldnt have won the war if not for gallias aid and yours especially
well same goes for you who knows where gallia would be if not for ike and the greil mercenaries
speaking of old friends  i saw princess leanne in the crimean royal court apparently shed been looking for me too she said please save my brothers do you know what shes talking about
so shes heard let me get straight to the point ike i have some bad news war has come to us once again
what
the laguz alliance which is made up of gallia phoenicis and kilvas is setting out against begnion the situation has escalated very quickly
escalated seems a bit soft i know there are problems between the laguz and begnion but i thought things were getting better
rafiel the eldest son of the herons brought back some disturbing news from daein hed learned that begnion senators ordered the herons extermination this spurred the laguz to strike against begnion thats why i came looking for you ike we need your help
rafiel eldest prince of the heron clan returns in the company of the wolf queen nailah and the mage tormod to tell a dire tale the shocking story he relates ignites a terrible fury in the hearts of the laguz the assassination of the previous begnion apostle sparked the massacre of the heron clan as well as the burning of their home the serenes forest
that murder and the resulting catastrophes were long thought to be the work of daeins former ruler the mad king ashnard now however prince rafiel a survivor of the massacre reveals that those directly responsible were none other than the senators of begnion
upon hearing this tale the hawk king tibarn is consumed with an unspeakable rage he shares this information with the raven king naesala and the beast king caineghis and they form a laguz alliance together with the heron royal family they send messengers to the leadership of begnion demanding an explanation from the senators begnion rebuffs their requests however denying any wrongdoing and refusing to investigate rafiels claims as if to emphasize their decision to silence the laguz inquiries the empire goes so far as to murder an alliance messenger this callous act of arrogant defiance pushes the alliance into declaring war upon the begnion empire
gallias sub commander ranulf considers the merits of attempting to simply overpower begnion he recognizes however that pitting brute force against begnions magic and tactical prowess will result in massive alliance casualties he decides to enlist the strength and knowledge of his old wartime ally ike and the greil mercenaries
ike is an acquaintance of begnions apostle however and is at first reluctant to become involved in the conflict yet when he considers the senators cold blooded murder of the alliance messenger he can feel the anger that burns in the laguzs hearts determined to force the senators to answer for their crimes he agrees to help the laguz alliance
flaguerre is close now its a fortress city near the begnion border well storm the city at night and hit them fast enough that the troops inside the fortress wont have time to take their positions
yes finally a chance to rend my foes but i would rather have a head on fight why do we wait until nightfall like a pack of cowards
 
whats our role in this
i want the greil mercenaries to act as a guerrilla force take out their fire mages and ballistae theyre really bad news for us laguz
bah enough talking to the battlefield to taste my enemies fear no more waiting
no skrimir this isnt the kind of fight where a general takes the field you should stay behi  
are you insane oh ill fight a general of gallia does not hide behind his men leave this tactics garbage to the beorc we need only our claws and teeth i call an end to this meeting time to kill
wait skrimir blast
are you ok
yeah that thickheaded fool  thisll be his first major battle hopefully he wont get his teeth kicked out how about you ike are you sure about this
sure about what
well you know youre beorc im laguz you sure you want to take our side
the laguz alliance is in the right ranulf the senate is actively ignoring you and worse theyre murdering your messengers why shouldnt we help you get the senates attention im sure my people understand besides i would never abandon a friend in need
thanks ike
oh this is lunacy look how meager our force is especially considering our proximity to gallia
general septimus sir were only making the rounds this evening we dont need a bigger force
no youre wrong even now those bloodthirsty beasts are stalking us i just know it believe me
general p please calm yourself you say this every evening and yet weve never had any  
e enemy fire were under attack its those gallian beasts the sub humans are attacking us
what
see see now do you see fool i was right hah i told you um  n now what do we do
run down all who get in your way make your path of blood and bone advance advance advance
yeesh glad hes on our side i see the family resemblance keep up everyone lets get to work
weaklings where is your general come out and fight coward i am skrimir general of gallia
oh no theyre drawing near were finished were doomed
p please be quiet general youll hurt the troops morale wait where are you going
to safety i must escape to mugill the beasts  the beasts wish to  consume me
general septimus gutless coward are you scared of these worthless sub humans
wait there are beorc among them why would beorc fight alongside sub humans
sub humans  you dare to fight begnion theres no hope for you now this will be your end mark my words 
are we done
yeah the guards are dead and the rest of the troops fled to the east were in good shape
bah is that it i still crave blood find me more humans to kill
the civilians have no quarrel with us and the soldiers who surrendered have handed over their weapons
grrrrr if this is all the fight begnion can give this war will be over too soon
i wouldnt be so sure we won this fight yes but the empire has a massive army dont forget that there was a time when begnion ruled over us
hmph you forget that was before my time
did you listen to a word i just said
soldiers of gallia the battle is over we have won no human can stand against the laguz we are not done yet well continue to fight kill and crush our enemies
my  what a stupid speech
dont say things like that i hear that king caineghis of gallia was not so different when he was young so try not to judge so quickly
i dont know thats really hard to imagine
im sure that skrimir will settle down given time well i hope so anyway 
victory awaits us in mugill we shall attack conquer and celebrate our victory
ike ive been thinking is this war something that we should really be fighting after all we know about lehrans medallion 
as long as the dark god sleeps within the medallion the world shall not war is that what you mean
thats right our ancestors made a vow and its our responsibility to prevent the horror they strove against
chaos is born of strife if the land is covered in war the dark god will break free of the medallion and destroy the world this war could easily spread across tellius and the dark god could be awakened we were very fortunate during the mad kings war but it was a close call can we count on being lucky again already were talking about a war between begnion the largest nation on tellius and three laguz countries thats half the known world and its not over yet have they all forgotten about the possibility of the dark gods rebirth
hello all sorry to interrupt lady titania soren youre both very perceptive id expect nothing less from the deputy commander and the strategist of the greil mercenaries you dont have to worry though the whole situation is under control
the medallion is under the protection of the serenes royal family even if the god escaped the herons can control it with their galdrar
reyson leanne and prince rafiel was it
ah ages ago the heron leader lehran sealed the dark god within the medallion his descendants have therefore been taught how to subdue it with their seid magic
so thats the story well be relying heavily on the power of the greil mercenaries im counting on you all
understood well do our best to see this conflict finished as quickly as possible right ike
yes of course
the laguz alliance sacks flaguerre with ease and sets off immediately for mugill the fortresses of felirae and mugill are both key to the defense of western begnion and have figured for many years in the military plans of gallia crimea and daein
the fortress of mugill is well defended by thick walls and countless blades however the laguz alliance knows that if they are to win this war mugill must fall ike and his companions march on though thoughts of the medallion and the dark god entombed within fill their hearts with dread
sigh 
are you all right you look distracted
hmm oh its nothing dont worry about me
ranulf you know you can talk to me
sigh its just  i feel bad about this whole thing you know
im not sure i understand what you mean
ive pulled you beorc into laguz affairs its not exactly your problem you know
listen you offered me a job and i decided to take the contract its as simple as that i told the others they could leave if they didnt want to work with laguz but everybody decided theyd rather stay dont worry about it ranulf
what about the black knight are you going to abandon your search
yeah at least for now i figure that if hes still alive our paths will cross again theres no rush
hmm  yeah i guess youre right no point in dwelling on things i cant change right thanks ike
hey no problem anything to keep you from moping around like a sullen kid
fair enough besides ive had this nagging headache ever since i left gallia with that hotheaded lion 
do you mean general skrimir
thats the one skrimir is king caineghiss nephew and is on track to become the next king of gallia
hes the successor to caineghis he must be an absolute terror in battle
absolutely hes so powerful i think hes gonna get himself in trouble and  hes the reason for my headache
you need a sympathetic ear about that too
thanks ike but ill tell you about it some other time lets eat and catch some shut eye before we set off for battle tonight
all right
see you at dinner
hey ranulf
yeah
you can come talk to me anytime you want dont think youre alone in all this
heh  what are you an inquisitor
a guys got to do something between battles talk to you later
 
to be honest i didnt want you to come along on this mission
really well its not like you could have stopped me even if you wanted to ranulf is my friend too you know
come on mist i  
ike im not going to repeat the same mistake i made with dad i dont want you to die while i  while im somewhere else it was horrible  it ate me up from the inside im never going through something like that ever again
mist 
everyone in the greil mercenaries is part of a family we all follow the commander no matter what well live together fight together and die together right ike
 all right but promise me this when were out on the battlefield stay where i can see you itll put my mind at ease
i promise ike
ah ike beorc hero how are you
pretty good
giffca and ranulf told me about you you are a skilled warrior right
well  i dont think im a pushover ill say that much
dont be humble my uncle  er my king also told me about you observe ike and learn his skills then you shall become even stronger
king caineghis said that
he did i am eager to watch you in battle you can learn from me as well
i intend to
lions are the strongest of the beast tribe and i have been trained to fight by the king himself i was going to fight in the mad kings war but my uncle forbade it he said i still had much to learn but now my time has come and you will see the true might of the beasts
 so what do you think
ahh these are all the favorite foods of the beast tribe they will be happy
oscar youre a chef
thats right
hah great i cant wait to see the looks on all their faces when they learn that a beorc made all this delicious food
aww stop it youre embarrassing me
but its true where did you learn all this oscar you should start teaching classes
yes your food very good so good it will be eaten very quickly
really hmm do you think i should make more
us beasts have a healthy appetite of course on top of that we have general skrimir and ike  yeah id be surprised if whats here lasted past those two much less a whole pack of laguz
tsk youre exaggerating ike is a beorc he couldnt possibly eat as much as someone from the beast tribe well maybe he would actually  he most definitely would
yeah especially the ribs and steaks
mordecai how about we go hunt for more game
right
there probably arent enough herbs to flavor everything ill go get more
my we might need to harvest an entire mountain
/***EOF***/
are you sure about this micaiah this makes absolutely no sense
the daein royal army will answer begnions request and attack the laguz alliance at the ribahn river those are our orders from king pelleas as his subjects we will obey him
without even asking why daein is finally on its own why are we even speaking to begnion let alone fighting for them
i dont know i do know that king pelleas wants whats best for daein just like us he must know something we dont i trust him hes changed since the coronation though he doesnt smile or laugh anymore maybe its because izuka and the black knight vanished
who cares about pelleas smiling or laughing we have no quarrels with the laguz alliance why are we targeting them
well with a few exceptions the soldiers are excited about hunting down the laguz  theyve been promised a large bounty for each one they kill its certainly raised morale
listen to yourself laguz hunting thats just great weve gone from being freedom fighters to bigots in the blink of an eye i cant believe youd go along with such a murderous plan how do you feel about this micaiah tell me the truth
 i dont want to fight
then why ar  
what choice do i have im the general of this army it doesnt matter how i feel besides i cant let the king or the soldiers down my duty ultimately lies with them  im sorry
following pelleass orders is the same as approving of them
sothe you dont have to do this i heard that your friend ike is fighting on the side of the laguz alliance go fight with them or dont fight at all but dont let me force you into anything
im not leaving your side i swore id protect you no matter what i keep my promises if i cant talk you out of this insanity ill fight commander ike and his men
sothe 
but wed better prepare ourselves this fight will be harder than any weve had before
thank you i know this isnt easy but if one side must fall i will do all i can to make sure it is not daein i have no other choice
weve just begun crossing the river this fog worries me i cant see the other side at all
when we first crossed this river it was in triumph thanks to that tiny strategist  ranulf cmon skrimir  youre hurting morale
i was defeated by a beorc how can i return to gallia with this shame if only i had died i wouldnt have to suffer this humiliation
skrimir stop if you had died gallia would have lost a brave soldier
brave i am a failure  please leave me alone
 
hey kyza  do you smell that
i cant smell anything what is it
hm maybe its just my imagination
think hard what kind of smell
hello captain ranulf um well  lets see what is that smell oh i know it smells like one of those torches that the beorc use
what
are we being pursued i dont smell any beorc
thats because the wind is blowing from the other side oh no  i have a bad feeling about this call a halt on the river crossing kyza lyre go tell everyone else ill make a run for the lead force and let them know i just hope its not too late
no  no the enemy is here no way
lyre run to the left wing and inform them of the situation  lyre
not yet wait for them to get closer everyone stay quiet 
theres the lead force
everyone take your positions attack
blast were being ambushed grr  turn back brothers turn back
never
what did you just say
were the beast tribe id rather die than be a coward
 fine no pulling back we stay here and fight to the last all forces attack
lethe you idiot why wont you fall back
the soldiers think that if we retreat any longer wed be throwing away our pride
youre following the lead of some blood crazed soldiers youre supposed to be in charge
i know that retreat is the sane course of action ranulf but if we run now wed lose the values we hold dearest in our hearts
 fine lethe as long as its your decision not someone elses ill join the others in the back and watch over skrimir were counting on you
lethe are you out here where are you
lyre what are you doing here
lethe oh lethe youre safe im so glad youre all right
why are you sneaking around get back into position
what how dare you i was just  oh forget it i dont care what happens to you anyway
im sorry lyre its much too dangerous here get back in position now
 
sir knight youre safe but where have you been
my maiden i shall not ask why you choose to engage in this battle
for that you have my thanks
i am here to protect you there need be no other reason do not leave my side
i understand then i shall not ask you why you have been absent i want you to know im happy to see you again i am very glad youre safe
 
ah zee  eehark hm  sorry mordecai not say your name right not yet
what am i doing here this isnt right tell me this is all a bad dream 
oh its good to see  zee haark why are you sad
mordecai  im so sorry 
ahh jill its been a long time what whats wrong why are you sad
im sorry mordecai i wont take your life but i must take you out of this battle forgive me
what why mordecai does not understand this 
ahh you i remember you sothe youre so big now
mordecai  i have to fight you please fight back
what mordecai does not wish to 
sorry lethe  i am hurt  i must go back and rest
lethe
zihark so you also side with the enemy
lethe please surrender our commander doesnt want any more killing
surrender even you could not convince me to surrender you know that zihark
lethe please
enough we are enemies the only thing left for us is this fight
how did it come to this 
how unfortunate i remember when we first met as enemies
yes and then we became allies and after that friends but now 
let us keep emotion out of this this is war we will fight
my goddess  you can be so cruel 
you
wait  lethe is that you
sothe right youve grown to become a strong soldier
please surrender lethe you know the situation is hopeless continuing this will only mean that more of your soldiers will die
we will not surrender this alliance stands for something more important than our lives
what are you talking about death is final lethe nothing matters if youre dead
silence well never be the slaves of beorc ever again
grr  their defenses are strong we cant push through them but we cant pull back retreat is not an option ill give my life to uphold the honor of the beast tribe
this is pointless the gallian soldiers just keep coming no matter how many we take down if we keep this up both sides will take horrible casualties
grr i cant find an opening if only i could find one weak point we could break through
these guys are really clever they must have a veteran commander to use a strategy like this
ranulf but what about general skrimir isnt he supposed to be at the back of the army
you know how he is ive got six strong men trying to keep skrimir from coming out here
all right then well show these beorc a real fight we should regroup and 
wait look over there
all troops lower your weapons im going to propose a cease fire to the laguz alliance
ive seen that black armor before youre with the daein army why is daein attacking us
are you the general of this army i am micaiah a general of the daein royal army
wait youre the one in command
my king pelleas has decided to answer begnions request for help in fighting the laguz alliance you have no chance for victory further bloodshed is meaningless please surrender while you can
do not insult us tiny beorc wed rather die than surrender
behind you lies the begnion army in front of you is the daein army youve nowhere to run
well i guess well just have to chase you down like cattle and press on sound good to you skrimir
what in the goddesss name was that
get back micaiah that roar  that must be a lion lion laguz are stronger than the cat or tiger laguz weve been fighting
hey  is that you sothe you look so much older now beorc grow up so fast  just like ike remember him sothe
what so commander ike really is fighting with you
lets just say you shouldnt assume that you can see all of our troops sothe if you care for this girl at all get her and her men out of here thats my only warning to you
wait
stop micaiah if we chase them theyll kill us for sure
 
general tauroneo what brings you out here has something happened to the king
no i am here to deliver supplies  and to see how the battle fares
you made up a clever excuse and convinced the king to let you come here im impressed thanks for coming general tauroneo
dont worry about it i trust that the fight is going well against the laguz alliance
yes but the enemy seems to have additional forces deployed in the area i expect another battle to begin very soon and i doubt it will be as easy as the last
so we still remain on the brink of battle i see
i shall do my best to defeat the laguz alliance quickly when this battle is over please persuade the king to negotiate a peace treaty as soon as possible would you do this for me would you please talk to the king and help to stop this pointless war
i shall try 
the daein army takes to the field and deals a heavy blow to the army of the laguz alliance this sudden aggression shocks the alliance like a lightning bolt on a clear day
with their only avenue of retreat blocked the forces of the laguz alliance begin to despair as the last shred of hope is fading skrimir appears before his troops and rallies them on bolstering their failing strength gallian morale is further improved by the appearance of tibarn and ikes forces who aid the beast army with talon and steel
i wonder what this is
let me see ah thats a master crown king pelleas got one especially for you
how do you use it
he said that a beorc who honed their combat skills could use it to gain further power
someone who has refined their skills i see so not everyone can use it
sounds like it its a very precious item so choose the recipient with care
all right
here you go jill this weapon is for you
 thank you um  lady micaiah i have to ask what is the purpose of this war
king pelleas has decided to come to the aid of begnion
has he deigned to share his reasoning with you micaiah this war is madness why would he ask us to aid begnion
 i dont know
wonderful
i believe in our king thats all i can say
at least someone does
edward i have something for you 
really what is it
its a gift from king pelleas one of daeins national treasures the blade caladbolg
what whoa this thing is amazing ive never seen a blade so sharp is it really for me that means the kings counting on me right well caladbolg and i wont let him down
um  listen edward this war  daein really shouldnt be 
huh shouldnt be what
oh never mind its nothing forget i said anything
ok sure um micaiah look i dont know anything about kings or nobles or anything else like that but youre fighting because you believe its whats best for daein right and well thats good enough for me im with you no matter what
oh edward 
now i want to use this sword theyre going to write song about me after this i just know it
leonardo king pelleas asked me to present you with this bow this is lughnasadh its been stored away in the vaults of daein waiting for someone worthy enough its more powerful than the purest silver bow
its beautiful  honestly this bow is beyond my skill it was crafted for better hands than mine i guess  i guess we really have to win now dont we
yes i suppose we do
dont look so sad micaiah youre not responsible for this war were doing the best we can hope to do but im fighting for daein the circumstances may change but my feelings never will
hello nolan a gift from king pelleas has arrived for you
youre kidding me  it cant be thats tarvos isnt it thats one wicked looking axe id heard stories about the fabled axe of daein but to actually feel the heft  king pelleas wants me to have it i always did like that man ill take good care of it dont you worry
i know you will nolan king pelleas does too thats why hes chosen to give it to you
micaiah look  i know how hard it is to be a commander especially with all of this confusion and doubt flying around fighting a war you dont believe in is a bitter pill to swallow
nolan i  
just remember something will you were still the dawn brigade lots of us arent your comrades were your family if you need anything were with you no matter what nothings going to change that
oh nolan  thank you so much
/***EOF***/

sothe do you know the layout of the manor
i was here years ago as i remember theres a large armory tucked deep inside the building and if i understand correctly begnion soldiers guard valuables theyve stolen —from rare objects to necessary supplies— in that armory
then the medicine will be there too

of course not danger is part of our work leave everything to us
your abbot will have his medicine
oh thank you so much good luck

/***EOF***/
this is great i cant remember the last time we got to sleep indoors we can be thankful for the rain i guess
yeah the decorations are a little overdone but the beds will be warm and dry im glad i remembered this mansion was here
presumably were the first people to set foot in here since oliver was posthumously found guilty of trading in heron slaves i understand the senate confiscated his lands and property immediately after the mad kings war ended
well someone must be living here the place is spotless by law there shouldnt be anyone here i wonder if someone is squatting
 
is something wrong rafiel
i feel that we are being watched i sense no malice but there is definitely some sort of presence perhaps the master of the house
hmm ill be we find out soon
the disciples of order are here they just appeared in the outer building
all right lets get everyone mobilized
general come quickly our friends are in trouble
friends

all right lets help these guys out get ready for battle
oliver duke of tanas have a care the last time you faced these enemies you were defeated humiliated and your heron slave trade was exposed by the good graces of your fellow senators you were saved from death and hidden away here behind the backs of the apostle and the prime minister we have kept you safe do not fail us
i understand senator hetzel rest assured the savages who dare set foot in my home a second time will be eradicated for the glory of the goddess ugly creatures deserve nothing but an ugly death you will not regret the lovely mercy youve shown me
tormod its been a while
holy moly you are absolutely huge i feel puny next to you 
thats because you are puny magic clearly doesnt give you much muscle tone
oh i suppose thats true still it works pretty well for winning battles
actually tormod 
what

nah you just cant see me properly because all of your blood gets pumped to your muscles away from your brain  ike a little touchy tormod  whatever we have work to do
muarim weve got your back here are you ready for these guys

ill take you away from these savages i would never let them lay a single finger on you my precious no no  the jealous cretins mustnt ruffle a single feather  ill have to kill them come now come to daddy
hold on a second  arent these your men why are you fighting them
its quite simple really a true guardian of beauty stands with those who are beautiful if your exquisite heron prince will not stay here in my home i must follow him i have seen death it holds no mystery for me only my pursuit matters rest at ease friends

rafiel how   youre still alive im so glad youre safe 
i have nothing to say to you
so you know then what we did was unforgivable  i was against it from the beginning  i argued with the others time and again  ah whats the use  it doesnt matter what i say now rafiel  despite everything im very happy to see that youre alive but i beg of you  stay away from the capital you must not anger the goddess
ive seen that man before hes a pretty influential senator isnt he
his name is hetzel duke of asmin  i owe my life to him
ike im sorry but can we talk later rafiel needs to rest
yes of course
so  why are you guys here anyway
you wont believe me but it came to me in a dream ike
a dream
yeah shortly after that light turned everyone to stone i had a really strange dream i dont remember it very well but it was like there was a voice in my head whispering encouragement when i woke up i knew what i had to do i knew that everyone who hadnt been petrified was heading to the tower of guidance and from there wed all be saved
i had the same dream i thought this must be a divine revelation so we left the desert to make for the tower
sounds like more of yunes handiwork
agreed this is her way of gathering able bodies i suppose a goddess of chaos will do things her own way 
yune isnt that the dark goddess i keep hearing about should i even be listening to her
i cant really put it into words but i can feel it inside listening to her is the right thing to do i guess its a lot like the dream you described
we laguz are pretty intuitive i feel it in my blood that yune is the goddess of our ancestors
all right that makes it a little easier to come to grips with
are you feeling any better
yes much sorry if i worried you that was quite a shock
no problem  can we talk about it id like to know about you and that man 
yes hetzel  it was some time ago now a little while before the serenes massacre 
i was alone outside of the forest there i was found and captured by beorc slave traders the slavers sold me at auction and the winner was lord hetzel i didnt know until later but the bidding for me among the senators was extremely competitive lord hetzel actually spent much of his fortune on my purchase
after he took me home i fell deathly ill mostly just from desperation lord hetzel was deeply moved by my plight  he brought me to a temple and spent many days nursing me back to health i have no doubt that he saved my life but my wings never fully recovered i havent been able to fly since lord hetzel felt terrible  do you know what he told me he said once you fully recover you can return to the forest members of the heron clan we can look inside peoples hearts i knew the truth of what lord hetzel said  he was being absolutely honest i knew i could trust him from that moment on
then  the serenes massacre i didnt need to be told i would have felt the suffering of that many of my brethren from anywhere in the world lord hetzel never said anything but i knew that the senators had murdered the apostle and blamed my clan because of the monstrous ambition of a handful of evil men my entire race was burned to ash
rafiel 
late that night i returned to the temple something happened to me there  some sort of force took hold of me  the next thing i knew  i was lying in the sand if queen nailah hadnt come i would have died right there i didnt even realize how far i was from my dear home
so duke hetzel is both your savior and your enemy
hetzel was not directly involved nor did he give orders to those who were something about him still troubles me though  whenever i think of him i feel chaos boiling up from his heart  i sense it in myself as well i have the same feelings welling up in me i suppose thats why i can accept it in him
your people the remaining heron tribe  theyve also changed king tibarn has said many times that reyson and leanne are far from typical herons
yes i was surprised when we met again theyre both so strong and vitality seems to shine forth from within them
it makes you wonder if chaos is really all bad doesnt it
i am starting to think that what the world needs is a balance between order and chaos what do you think
i dont know i think there are some things were not meant to understand
tibarns group passes quickly through salmo drawing steadily closer to the imperial capital the hardships of the journey lead the group to overcome their racial differences and form bonds of friendship and trust
however almedha the queen mother of daein remains alone and aloof lost in thoughts of her own her son pelleas also seems to guard some secret thought tucked deep within his heart
 
er hello what can i do for you
 
hey thats an elixir
 
yes i like them too
 
volug speak out loud ike is confused by your silence
but your majesty  he doesnt understand our language
its better than staying silent sorry i dont mean to leave you out of the conversation
no thats fine i would have been confused either way i didnt know you could speak the ancient language
its hataris common language i would never have known about the tellius language if i hadnt met rafiel
the tellius language
you dont know the language we are using right now is called the tellius language you call it modern speech i suppose
oh i see
long ago beorc created the old tongue the ancient speech is what we laguz call it the language was too difficult for the laguz to master so the language of tellius was created in its place
huh ive never heard that before the only people im aware of who know the ancient speech are the heron laguz i think nasir of goldoa said he could read it among beorc only mages know how to use it and thats only for spells
well the laguz who live a long time such as dragons and herons have all the time in the world to learn it beorc probably left the ancient speech behind in favor of a newer and improved language with the exception of spells
that makes sense i suppose mordecai once told me that speech lets you avoid fighting when its not a good idea he said thats why its a good idea to know many languages
did he now volug did you hear that you can learn the language of tellius with mordecai
 i will  i will try
he understands what youre saying for the most part its the speaking thats the hard part for him
you dont need to feel obligated i mean it isnt like i can understand ancient speech
here i want you to have this um here  take
oh i understand thanks
its about time
i think i understood that you were happy that i understood what you just said
i guess you could say that
good as long as you have the desire to learn words will soon follow
i see ill try to learn a little ancient speech from now on too volug you be my teacher and ill be your teacher
all right its a deal
/***EOF***/
how are we doing for time janaff
theyre gaining on us their lead force is about lets say one day off
youve got to be kidding how did they cover so much ground since yesterday
theyre definitely moving faster than we expected at this rate theyll catch us soon any ideas
 with the enemy closing in so quickly it would be unwise to use this secret passage if begnion found it it would give them an open invitation to surge across gallia your kind would not be pleased
we cant expose our country to that danger we have to think of something else
well we cant start a fight in the serenes forest besides the terrain disadvantage the forest isnt fully healed and we cant risk burning it down again soren any ideas
our options are profoundly limited ike it appears our only other choice is those caves up ahead
caves oh yeah those are the kauku caves we dont want to go there its a complex maze full of lava and ash not exactly a place youd want to rest the legends say that through the caves theres one exit that leads to gallia and another exit that leads to goldoa whatever the legends say though the fact is that its suicide to go in there we dont even have a map
however the more you hens carry on the closer the enemy advances on us theyre now less than a day away
if the enemy catches up to us in this forest we will certainly die the caves are known to be dangerous so begnion may not pursue even the most formidable natural hazard isnt as deadly as an intelligent living enemy we must go to the caves now
all right soren i trust you lets move out for the caves
are you sure we have visual confirmation of the laguz alliance heading into the kauku caves
yes sir the enemy must be desperate why else would they enter that forsaken death trap
we cannot go there without preparation it would be suicide lets not follow them to their deaths  that ends our pursuit then tell the men that this mission is over
i cannot allow you to do that my dear general
youre  
senator valtome
uwee hee hee youre not even a tiny bit surprised lord zelgius of cador what a frightful bore you are i came here in secret just to surprise you
oh i am surprised indeed what would bring a senator of your station to a place like this do you bring new orders
uwee hee hee oh yes i am here to deliver a decision handed down by the senate in its wisdom the senate has appointed me commander in chief of the imperial army from this moment on this army is mine
 i see then i am at your command your orders commander
uwee hee hee oh you are ever so serious you havent changed one bit zelgius one of these days i will catch you off guard well i suppose that impassive face of yours is just part of your charm
 senator valtome your orders
oh yes orders hmm well this battle is taking far too long for my taste we will pull back and conquer gallia by taking a different path
i see then i shall inform my men
the northern force will stay here tell them to go inside the caves and search for bodies of dead sub humans or something
what sending them into those caves is the same as sending them to the gallows i implore you to reconsider commander
i gave my order did i not get those men in those caves right this minute and zelgius never question my orders again or ill have you killed is that clear besides you should be happy youre coming with me to finally wipe out those beasts come along now
 
why  why do i always get stuck with these awful missions i should have curried favor with general zelgius then perhaps i wouldnt have had to step into these ghastly caves 
hey ike we have company
seems that way what kind of numbers are we looking at i cant see through all this smoke and heat
its just like soren said a token force
as far as i can tell zelgius isnt leading them that helps things
we have to keep the enemy away from skrimir and the others while they look for an exit lets proceed as planned we have enough people here to deal with these clowns everyone ready
were set lets finish this and get out of here
they told me that the enemy would be burnt by the time i reached them the only thing id have to do was carry their dead bodies back as proof  its just my luck that the enemy is alive and well why does this always happen to me
ahhh th theyre here th th the sub humans the mongrels are here they want to consume me
i i knew it  i knew i would end up like this 
wh who are you
ike of the greil mercenaries you dont look too good maybe you should just leave 
wait a moment  hah look everyone look at this one hes not a beast oh thank the goddess victory is nigh
so  chasing us into these caves wasnt the plum assignment that all the best generals wanted huh
how dare you take my spear knave
ike ranulf this way i found a way out
excellent lets get out of here
you dont have to tell me twice
yes we did it we made it through the caves
looks like we finally lost the begnion army as well we can finally rest a bit
i thought we were finished  i thought my rashness had killed us but weve lived to see our land again
hey skrimir has all the heat gone to that shaggy head of yours look around is this gallia
 what no we cant be in  
you by whose authority have you entered this land
goldoa the land of the dragons  by the goddess did we mess up
the dragons  it is said they are the most powerful of all the laguz tribes ive always wanted to fight a dragon but i never expected it would happen like this  when our king finds out about this i will have much explaining to do
youve got to get home first skrimir i guess we have to pay that stubborn old lizard a visit dont we
lets go
 and there you have it we never intended to violate goldoas borders it was an accident
i see  i understand your predicament however your reasons neither justify nor change the fact that you trespassed on our territory i order you to leave immediately go back the way you came through the caves
you would have us go through kauku caves again never
stop talking skrimir
many of my men are wounded youre sending them to their deaths i will not allow this
it is regrettable yes however i cannot make exceptions your men will leave now
how could a laguz be so cold to his brothers we are your people as well
this isnt news skrimir goldoa and its lizards have ignored the suffering of their laguz brothers for centuries they even looked the other way while we birds and beasts were enslaved by beorc isnt that so dragon king
 our country is neutral it has been since time out of mind and will continue to be so
then you might as well just kill us now itd be the same as sending us back to the kauku caves and it saves us the walk
you are a beorc i would not expect your short lived kind to understand
i dont need to understand to see that its a poor king who has so little regard for his fellow living creatures
hmm 
 your majesty please hear our plea
what are you two doing here
please allow my grandfather and me to guide the laguz alliance to the borders of gallia i beg of you
prince reyson of the heron tribe stands among these men the dragon tribe owes him safe passage please your majesty he saved the soul of your son would you condemn them to die despite the good theyve done
 hmph do as you like this is the only exception i will ever make
thank you your majesty
well here you are i think you know the way from here
thanks nasir you really saved us back there
its the least we could do i will pray for your safety
hey wait up you two  we havent seen you in a long time dont you have some time to stay and talk with us for a little while
a long time what do you mean we just saw you three years ago
oh thats right  three years isnt all that long for you dragons is it
oh im sorry i suppose three years would feel slightly longer for beorc
ike i would love to stay and talk but now is not the proper time in truth we are not even allowed to speak with you at all now please go
why why do you isolate yourselves from everyone
 i dont expect you to understand but i want you to know that we obey our kings decision of our own free will thats all i can say
nasir 
you should go many of your wounded need immediate attention head back to gallia at once and tell the lion king what happened
all right  i dont get it but ill go now well see each other again
i certainly hope so you are one of our dearest friends
take care and be safe
goldoa the land of dragons lies secluded in the southwestern corner of tellius no foreigner laguz or beorc is permitted within its borders
the alliance emerges from the lava tubes and into goldoa by accident the dragon king dheginsea is displeased by this trespass however ikes former companions nasir and ena appeal to dheginsea to allow the passage of the laguz alliance reysons actions during the last war earn them the grudging respect of king dheginsea who allows them safe passage
meanwhile begnion calls off its pursuit of the alliance and finds its passage into gallia blocked by the nations great mountains and deep forests the central armys momentum breaks upon these obstacles like an ocean wave against solid rock senator valtome arrives to take command of the central army he orders zelgius to march on to gallia by way of crimea observing diplomatic protocol valtome petitions the queen for passage as well as supplies and additional troops
queen elincia however goes against the wishes of the crimean nobles and resolutely denies each of valtomes requests her reply enrages valtome who sees crimea as little more than a vassal of the empire ignoring zelgiuss counsel valtome orders his army to enter crimea and take whatever they need from the villages along the way
how are the injured holding up
theyre exhausted some are so bad off they cant even get up the energy to transform the unwounded soldiers have been taking turns carrying the injured
thats a good idea maybe ill carry one or two on my back once we enter the caves
hey youre hurt too be careful you dont strain yourself and cause permanent injury all right
hurt do i look like ive been wounded
skrimir youre standing in a pool of your own blood tell me the truth it hurts to even stand right
 a little do the others know
no none of our soldiers do but im sure king tibarn and ike both know
good our soldiers shouldnt know i have to be their role model theyll see that ive been wounded yet continue to fight maybe that will help them carry on
skrimir 
lyre come on you have to stop sulking
dont talk to me i hate you lethe
thats too bad because i like you
liar
im only hard on you because i worry about you and i want you to stay safe why did you even become a soldier you used to hate fighting
hmph
was it because of ranulf
that was one reason i guess
there were other reasons
yeah i wanted to stay with you
 does that mean youll start talking to me again
yeah even though you drive me crazy youre still my sister
im glad
here take this as a token of apology
what is it
its a daunt scroll i thought itd be perfect for someone as scary as you
what say that again i dare you
aaahh lethes mad at me again stop being mean to me
im the mean one
/***EOF***/
amazing weve been traveling for miles now and there hasnt been a single moving person
and yet the other plants and animals seem completely unaffected the only creatures turned to stone were laguz and beorc  a miracle of the goddess indeed
my sister just sent a warning about some disciples of order ashera has freed them from stone to fight for her shes also blessed their weapons and armor theyll only get stronger as we approach the tower they nearly beat leannes team
worse they can attack at any moment and wed have no idea who or where they are ill start working on contingency plans
all right well break here everyone be sure to keep your weapons and supplies in reach tonight
ena how is prince kurthnaga feeling
not good he keeps staring into space he wont say anything and he hasnt touched a bite of his food
im sorry to hear that i wanted to ask him some questions but it can wait
ike were under attack theyve already surrounded us
what thats impossible
how could they get this close without us seeing them
i dont know there was no sign or scent of their approach  i wonder if they simply materialized
ena stay here protect kurthnagas tent at all costs
understood
everyone watch the perimeter there are a lot of them but just focus on one enemy at a time
ena theyre getting close be ready to fight
its ok ike im ready
i am ready  arent i
unclean souls your executioner awaits repent before your vile sins pour out of your black hearts and consume you
death but my work is not yet complete 
pawns of your excretable goddess die you are a festering wound in the flesh of the world die and let it heal
i suppose talking it over is out of the question
that looks like all of them fanatics that appear out of nowhere and attack from darkness  thisll be tough
ena are you all right why didnt you transform
i didnt want prince kurthnaga to be frightened so i tried to hold them off in this shape he hates blood 
this cant go on im going to talk to him
hey prince kurthnaga
 eyuhhh ugh  stay away
whats wrong dont you remember me
 aughhh that smell  the blood on your sword 
what this no problem ill go drop it over there
hey look  no sword are you ok now
y yes
good i wanted to talk to you a little do you remember who i am
 yes we met once  three years ago in goldoa
thats right you do remember you helped us when our ship ran aground  and you gave us food and water
yes  you were the first beorc i had ever met
im glad our paths have crossed again we didnt have much time to talk back then  i didnt even get to introduce myself im ike of the greil mercenaries thanks to you we completed our voyage safely ive been wanting to thank you for three years so  thank you kurthnaga no it was nothing at all actually it was quite an experience  i had only read of beorc in books so meeting one was a rare privilege i wasnt really myself so i hope i didnt say or do anything rude its embarrassing when i think about it now im sorry
no if anything i was the rude one i was just an ignorant hothead with no manners or gratitude at all but you just laughed and forgave me im really grateful for that
im glad that i could be of some help it seems like its been a while since ive had that chance
prince kurthnaga  theres something i have to ask you before yunes awakening why did you side with the daein army to fight against us and the apostles army the dragon tribes are neutral and known for their hatred of blood and war as their prince i cant see why you would do it
i suppose i owe you an explanation for that first of all the dragon tribes had nothing to do with any of this i  i disobeyed my father and the laws of goldoa i joined the battle against all my training of my own free will ena just saw me leaving or i wouldnt have brought her into this i just wanted  i just wanted to help my sister
sister you have a sister in daein
yes  a sister and a brother actually
my sisters name is almedha she was the wife of the late king ashnard
mad king ashnard was married to a princess of goldoa
yes and my brother  my brothers name was rajaion
rajaion wasnt he the dragon that was warped and used by the mad king wasnt ena supposed to marry him
yes that savage ashnard held his own baby hostage the baby born of my sister almedha then he took my brother rajaion and warped him in order to use him as a mount like a common wyvern
im sorry i didnt know 
 ike you were there at my brothers last hour im sorry to ask you but when my brother died  did he die peacefully
 yes he did
before he died reyson was able to undo what ashnard had done to his body rajaion passed on in enas arms with a contented smile as if he were sleeping peacefully
thank you  its a tremendous relief to know that
my sister was tangled in ashnards schemes our brother was killed and her son taken away  she was unable to return to goldoa and unable to consult our father  my sister has suffered so much i wanted to help her
so thats why you came to daein  im sure that was difficult for you to tell me thank you
actually it makes me feel a little better just talking about it
i wont repeat a word of anything you just told me i swear on my fathers grave
 the dragon tribes and the black knight  they both lead back to daein something about that country always draws me back to it 
tibarns party takes a long circuitous route leading them east around lake semper the hawk kings company includes queen elincia of crimea her trusted aide lucia the heron prince reyson the laguz warrior ranulf daeins king pelleas and the queen mother almedha while they receive reports from the other two groups about the disciples of order they have encountered no resistance and have thus far traveled in peace
mmph
whats wrong prince rafiel are you feeling sick
 no i am all right thank you though
 youre a real puzzle you know that
why do you say that
you look a lot like your brother reyson but youre nothing like him reyson looks delicate but on the inside hes all iron you on the other hand  i dont know i worry that i might kill you if i shout too loud or something
 im sorry
see thats exactly what i mean you should get mad at me for saying that not say im sorry i mean come on
i i apologize
there you go again what i mean is that  
thats enough ike rafiel is everything that herons are expected to be quiet elegant and delicate those are words people use to describe herons and he fits all three
yeah well  none of those words fit reyson
true maybe princess leanne is only so innocent and sweet because she was asleep for twenty years prince reyson certainly doesnt seem to have any of the characteristics herons are known for
king tibarn did mention that real herons are more like prince rafiel
prince reyson spent a long time in the care of the hawk tribe no doubt hes picked up all sorts of quirks thank goodness reyson hasnt picked up tibarns speech or mannerisms though it would be completely ridiculous can you imagine a man with reysons looks talking and acting like tibarn i dont think i could help but laugh at him
well he told me he wanted to be just like king tibarn he admires tibarn a great deal
reyson said that
yeah what about you
well  sure itd be nice to be a bit more like tibarn i suppose
well it looks like you guys really are brothers after all
ike be quiet youre a bad influence i wont allow rafiel to be tainted like that
ike
what is it mist
take a look at this
how odd looks like a master crown
i had the strangest vision just now there were these places on the ground which were shining one was close so i went to take a look and here it was
stop it you sound like yune when you talk like that the enemy could attack at any time so dont go wandering around alone
all right youre the boss
ooo its my hero ike ill take the spot next to you
hello aimee
would you do me a favor take this and give it to little soren its an extremely rare item we dont know what well run into out there hell be ready for anything with a powerful tome like this
what you cant give it to him yourself
oh no way im trying to get your attention so id much rather give it to you
thats very direct of you
because you can be so thick sometimes i swear you wouldnt know how i felt if i didnt tell you outright
even if i did i wouldnt do anything about it
thats fine i understand you still have things you want to do places you want to explore thats why you dont want to be tied down by a relationship i know how you are
uh 
but someday youll be ready to settle down when you are maybe youll think of me thats why im starting work on you now dont worry about it for now
but it does worry me
see youre already under my spell well good night sleep well my hero
that woman has issues with reality
/***EOF***/
a rebellion in the empire is that true
yes the empire has been thrown into chaos since general zelgius freed prime minister sephiran theyve incited the peasants by asking who should you believe in the senate or the apostle
and the people have chosen the apostle correct
yes theyre rioting in the capital day and night demanding answers the senate is busy trying to quell the masses
this is great news if we were to forge and alliance between daein and the apostles supporters in begnion  
that is not a wise choice
the curse on the blood pact will begin killing our people as soon as we do anything the senate doesnt care for defeating the senate doesnt guarantee the curse will be broken either in fact it may ensure it can never be broken in which case daeins destruction will come more slowly but it will come nonetheless
so we cant attack the senate and we cant ask for help the only thing we can do is search for a way to get rid of the curse this is driving me crazy 
if we could only contact the apostle  but if the senate heard a word of it theyd destroy us our hands are tied
luckily for us thats not true i have some good news for a change i found a way to break the blood pact where is micaiah please bring her here
you discovered how to break the blood pact ill get her right away
you cant be serious your majesty
but i am dont you see this is the way to save daein the information was in a book hidden away in a secret room i think it is reliable
i must ask you to reconsider my king there has to be another way there must be
we cant afford to wait for another solution to present itself we have to try
 i cannot go through with it
micaiah the life of every single person in daein depends on this if it works we can stop fighting this absurd war it will be all right i know this will work please do this for me micaiah
i cant i thought i made up my mind  i thought id do anything for daein but then i saw sothe taken from me and i saw him fall  i was powerless to do anything id taken so many lives as a general and yet when i thought of sothe dead 
even if it hadnt been sothe in front of you you would have reacted the same way thats the kind of person you are
individual lives taken before your eyes weigh more heavily than the many lives taken during the chaos of war if that life is someone dear the burden is even worse its only human isnt that true
micaiah its your caring soul that i admire thats why i want it to be you
i want you to kill me
no i cant i cant do it dont make me do this please
the blood pact breaks when the pact maker is killed by a third party that is exactly how its written this is the only way to save daein
please please dont ask me to do such a horrible thing
this is my duty as king micaiah if you wont do it i must ask someone else
all right  ill do it  ill do it for you and for daein
thank you micaiah
general tauroneo please look after the people of daein
yes your majesty
sothe im sorry for all that i put you and micaiah through including this please forgive me
dont worry about that now pelleas
micaiah please give this ring to my mother tell her that i loved her dearly
 i will your majesty
good bye my friends
your majesty sniff what have i done
pelleas is he here
nooooo  pelleas my dear pelleas
who did this who killed my son was it you i know who it was  you you killed my pelleas
 
it was the kings wish he sacrified himself to make daein free he asked micaiah to end his life
it was an honorable end for a king thanks to his noble sacrifice daein has been saved
fools is that what you think daein has not been saved
wh what do you mean my queen
take a good look
the mark is still on his wrist my sons death was in vain
no it cant be sothe tell me that it isnt true 
murderer give me back my son you took my only son give him back

general tauroneo please look after the people of daein
yes your majesty

good bye my friends
no this is wrong we cant give up your majesty
eh
micaiah
lady micaiah 
what did you do
i im all right i 
fetch a healer now
no im fine really im just confused  is the goddess telling me that im not worthy to become a martyr for daein
or maybe she is saying that youre just too important to lose  but this is my fault it was all because i signed that blood pact i can only amend my mistake by giving my life
you must stop running your majesty
wha  
but what if your information is incorrect your majesty i couldnt live with myself if id let you give up your life in vain there must be another way well look for it together there is  i  i can see 
micaiah hey micaiah wake up
i will call a healer right away
micaiah  thank you 
welcome back whats going on with daein
theyre hold up in this big castle to the east id say ten thousand soldiers give or take theyre looking pretty desperate
to the east eh its just like soren said nox is the next battlefield
ten thousand they arent really going to try to fight us with only ten thousand men are they itd be suicide
daein should know about the rebellion in the empire by now we should speak with them they have nothing to gain by siding with the senate why continue the fighting
we cant afford to lose any more troops or time here either we should be at the senates doorstep by now
agreed sephiran has earned some time for us we cant afford to lose that advantage we must press on let us win this battle quickly and continue on our way
general ike please allow us to join you on the battlefield
shouldnt you be watching over the medallion with your brother and sister is it really a good idea for you to be away
they can manage without me for a while i am here because i must see micaiah i want to save her i can reason with her i know it
if we can talk to her face to face maybe she will understand its also for our own peace of mind
all right come with us ill tell my men to avoid firing at micaiah sound good
thank you ike
the outer gate has been breached the apostles army is storming the castle
here they come
 it all ends here
lets finish this fight quickly all units attack
we will not lose we cannot lose if we lose today everything pelleas has done will have been in vain in the name of king pelleas fight for daein
maiden please take this you are the commander general of the daein army it is imperative that you lead our troops from this spot however with this tome you can aid your allies from afar
thank you
ike are you safe wait that was a dumb question wasnt it i dont think any of us are safe at the moment
are you guys finished with the preparations
yeah the rest of the force is on the way they should arrive any minute
all right once we merge well launch the attack
rafiel are you ready lets go look for micaiah do not leave my side these beorc look edgy
yes queen nailah ill be closer than your own shadow
queen nailah are you going to try to hurt micaiah
no silly boy im here to talk to her since you know me why dont you take me to her i would prefer not to kill all your soldiers if i can help it
im sorry but i cant do that i cant let a laguz near micaiah lots of people from daein have issues with the laguz
we are not your enemy
i know that but our troops wouldnt understand im sorry queen nailah
 very well then
im im ashamed it has to be like this
try not to worry just survive all right watch after micaiah as well
i will were fighting for our survival as it is i dont plan to let anyone go
your majesty 
let me hear it from you why is daein involved in this war
the daein king was tricked into cooperating with begnion
what about micaiah and sothe
they havent changed at all they fight for the continued survival of their country
i see they are our friends we cannot let them fall
why would you seek me out i wont have mercy on my enemies that goes for former allies too
theyre holding out longer than i expected
ike our forces on the western wall broke through the daein defenses theyre requesting reinforcements we should move our forces to the breach
all right i just hope were able to keep micaiah from doing anything rash all units to the western wall
commander ike 
are you prepared this time sothe are you really sure about this
yes our battle has no justice there is no victory in this war only pointless killing but this is the path ive chosen
then stick to your chosen path ill strike you down with one blow thats the least i can do for you
 thank you commander
micaiah we have to talk this is insane
whats insane about a people fighting for their country
theres got to be something we can do let us help please
why would you want to help us after everything weve done no after everything ive done 
we know you dont want this fight isnt there any way for us to avoid it
 no no im afraid there isnt
just talk to me we can find a way
you dont understand we cant stop im sorry but i cant explain it more clearly than that
micaiah i dont want you to die i dont want all of your soldiers to die you have to let me help you
ike  now i see it now it makes sense
what makes sense
sothe always spoke so highly of you now i know the reason you truly are a good person its a shame 
why is that a shame
because it makes what i have to do even harder please prepare yourself lets put an end to this
as you wish good bye micaiah
  strike my enemy
 ugh  what a terrible place  to die 
soren retreat
but ike 
arent you supposed to be my strategist use your head i need your help
 i see as you command 
our last battle in the valley was that your strategy
 
that was impressive you killed thousands of beorc soldiers with your little ambush well done
i 
the maiden of dawn  what are you one of the branded thats for sure but there is something else about you  power yes i can feel it in you you possess great power
yes and you would know theres something very different about you too your energy feels so ancient you and i seem to have so much in common
that doesnt matter in the slightest the only thing that does matter is that you are a dangerous adversary you are also in ikes path so it falls to me to remove you its almost a shame farewell maiden of dawn
so you fight for someone as well so very much alike  but i will defeat you i will protect the ones i love
oww hey that hurts sorry ike im going to pull back
jill why why are you doing this
im sorry mist theres no way we can turn back now
but jill 
mist run i wont be expected to kill you if you just turn and run
ugh  they got me 
titania retreat and dont exert yourself we wouldnt be complete if you werent here we need you
ah i understand ike   youve  grown to become a legend  greil  are you watching be proud of your son
arg like being hit  with a mountain 
ranulf enough get back i cant let you die what would i tell king caineghis and skrimir
 im sorry king tibarn 
ugh they hit me good i hate to say it but i have to pull back
the enemy uses good tactics sorry ike im pulling back for now
why do these softheads keep fighting theres no chance theyll ever win this battle im pulling back for now im not wasting my arrows on these fools
ugh hey youre pretty good better than i expected honestly ike im pulling back
i  i guess its over 
ugh thats it for me  im pulling back now everyone
theyre strong i cant defeat them but ill be stronger tomorrow and then well see who wins
maiden of dawn the enemy is approaching please you must withdraw inside the castle
our defenses have been broken  we did everything we could its only a matter of time now  daein soldiers pull back immediately take up positions inside the castle we wont let them take us without a fight
the inner gate has been breached its only a matter of time before they break through the inner walls
that was fast we didnt even get a chance to rest
isnt there anything else we can do king pelleas has worked so hard to find the answer  was it for nothing there must be something  a rumor old folklore  anything 
hold on didnt lady almedha seem to know something about the blood pact come to think of it she recognized the mark of the pact on pelleass arm right away like shed seen one before
youre right  why didnt i realize it sooner where is she where is lady almedha
general its no use we cant hold them off any longer enemy troops have broken through and are headed this way escape while you can
no i must find lady almedha everything depends on it
break down that gate if they wont come out well just let ourselves in all forces advance
ike we have a problem a big problem all this battlefield chaos is starting to really affect the laguz theyre on the verge of losing control i cant stop them ike if they find micaiah theyre going to tear her apart i guarantee it
blast we need to get them under control wheres skrimir
sheesh what a relief to finally have the end of this thing in sight i cant believe what a fight the daein army put up especially considering their numbers wait a minute  hey ulki what the heck is that on the horizon
its flying toward us  the flapping sounds heavier than a wyvern  it sounds huge
oh youve got to be kidding me  all units get down now
all of you are ordered to throw down your weapons and cease fighting do this for your own welfare
ena elincia whats going on here
its a black dragon of goldoa 
tibarn whats going on
why are you asking me all i know is that im not ready to step up to a black dragon did you see that blast
point taken all units retreat platoon commanders gather your men
what just happened why did the apostles army leave and what was that horrible sound
micaiah
kurth where have you been i havent seen you since you left for home how did you get here why would you even come to a horrible place like this
i wanted to save you and my sister as well
your sister shes here
never mind that now im just glad youre safe are you hurt
no i dont think so im just very confused right now
the sub humans are here protect the maiden with your lives
stop stand down all of you
queen nailah  rafiel  i  th thank you thank you so much 
its all right micaiah itll be all right 
that black dragon is prince kurthnaga sheesh i thought the lions got big 
ah its the son is it i thought maybe the dragon king had shrunk a bit in his old age
you all know the dragon prince of goldoa
yeah goldoa hosted a meeting of laguz royalty three years ago thats when tibarn and i met him
elincia and i met him around the same time id say he was a nice kid except that hes older than all of us put together
the prince hopes to avoid the complete destruction of daein and its people he wishes to stop the fighting we would like to ask you to implement a cease fire and hold a peace talk
we have attempted to hold peace talks with daein on multiple occasions they refuse to listen to reason and instead choose to fight we have no more time to waste on people who choose war over peace at every turn
your people are waiting for you in begnion is that what presses you
its not just that all this strife and chaos has affected the medallion its shining brighter each day
no that cant be
the blue flame burns once more 
the light that radiates from the medallion looks like blue fire its this flaming aura that earned the medallion its other name the fire emblem
the fire emblem 
the flames on the fire emblem indicate the awakening of the dark god if the war is allowed to continue nothing can stop the dark gods awakening we must halt this fighting
if there is a way to stop the fighting we shall do everything in our power to aid in that effort we have pursued peace since this began
then let us wait until prince kurthnaga returns he is speaking with the leaders of daein now
elincia what are you doing here did ena and kurth ask you to bring them to this battle
no that wasnt the case prince kurthnaga and i ran into each other on our way here
we are actually in daein to look for count bastian of fayre
lucia youre here too
of course i cannot let her majesty out of my sight you know that
bastian  hed been so good about sending me reports until recently
he was searching for the black knight right
after the mad kings war begnion sent an envoy to investigate war crimes committed during ashnards reign the black knight had already left daein before the empires observer arrived where he went remains a mystery that was the last piece of information we received from bastian then he sent word saying that something more important had come up with regards to crimea hes been missing ever since i havent heard a single word from him
bastian likes to keep his secrets hes probably just laying low somewhere
im not so sure he mustve found something important some new piece of information that he had to pursue
i ordered geoffrey to watch over crimea and came here to begin a search for bastian
its too dangerous for you and lucia to travel by yourselves why dont you com with us everyone would love having you two around
than you ike well gladly accept the offer
queen elincia and the dragons of goldoa persuade both armies to accept a temporary truce the blue light that burns within the medallion grows more fierce with each passing day to prevent the awakening of the evil trapped within the fighting must be stopped
however the apostle and her army refuse to abandon sephirans forces in begnion though they hoped that daein would cease fighting they knew battle was inevitable the bloodshed begins anew
say edward weve been fighting really hard for quite a while now havent we
yeah i guess so the war of emancipation the war against the laguz alliance and now against the apostles army one after another just like that
the world cant always be like this these wars seem so pointless all i want is to be able to live in daein peacefully and in freedom
yeah the military is a pretty strange place hey i have an idea once this battle is over ill quit the army and go home
what about micaiah and the others are you going to abandon them
what no way ill just have to talk them into leaving with me and if that catches on all the soldiers will leave and then there cant be a war and then daein will have peace again
you know i dont think its that simple but your plan sounds good to me edward
see you know its smart first you and i will leave together we can tackle any obstacle
well have to survive the next battle first this should help here look what i got you
oh this sword is amazing where did you get this
ive been saving up micaiah chipped in too
you got this for me
yeah since youre always fighting so recklessly i thought this sword would be a good match for you
thanks leonardo youre the best friend i could have
i know were each others best friend and family
hey laura you dropped a staff over there
oh ah thank you aran
youve been carrying a lot of things lately
yes i suppose so many people are injured i wanted to help heal as many of them as i can
thats admirable is there anything i can do to help
yes of course
first hand me all of your things ill carry them for you
that would be great here you go say 
hmm
that staff you picked up earlier  it doesnt belong to me
really it was right at your feet so id assumed that it was yours
ive never seen a staff like this i wonder what effect it has
hey be careful it might be dangerous or something lets throw it away
well maybe if i shake it like this  and then  whoa
wuh
what did you say aran
zzz  zzz 
oh aran youre such a clown how do you fall asleep on your feet i guess you must be really tired why dont i just leave you be let me just take my things back
zzz  zzz  zzz 
/***EOF***/
i hope lady almedha is all right how is she doing
reysons song seems to have calmed her for now
i see 
what about her son hows he feeling
he is sleeping right now hes quite exhausted understandably weve been fighting one battle after another
pelleas is so fragile compared to his mother actually they dont seem anything alike that almedha is a formidable woman at first i doubted her claim that she was the daughter of that useless old lizard but even i had trouble holding her down me shes no ordinary beorc woman thats for sure
i agree lady almedha and prince kurthnaga share a striking resemblance as well not just their faces but their mannerisms too
is that how beorc spot blood relations we laguz use scent mainly speaking of which something has been bothering me about almedha she has no distinct scent its as if she is neither beorc nor laguz
she actually told me something that i wanted to ask you about she said that she lost her power when she became pregnant with king pelleas
hm so the ancient songs are true 
what songs would those be
it is said that the goddesses forbid laguz and beorc to procreate if a couple breaks the taboo the punishment is dealt to the laguz parent she or he loses the power of the laguz and becomes something that does not belong to either species  did you hear something who goes there
king tibarn
if the songs are indeed true then it is my duty to keep the honorable hawk king from being alone with my bewitching queen do you not agree your majesty
who  
my apologies for the lateness of the hour proper social graces are most difficult to observe in wartime
bastian
i have been absent for a long time your majesty i apologize again from the deepest place in my heart
oh you are all right how i worried for your safety
sorry to interrupt this tender reunion scene but where on tellius have you been lord jester what have you been doing up til now come on im listening out with it
i suppose one as swift as our king of the skies is unlikely to count patience as one of his virtues fear not i shall tell you everything but first i must ask you both to step away from other ears and would it be possible to rouse the prince with the elegant white wings
are you asking me to get reyson fine but do me a favor and talk like a normal person would you
it is a terrible habit of yours bastian ive never known anyone who talked so much but said so little
ah my dear beloved lucia it pains me to imagine your piteous tears during those cold lonely nights without me be of good cheer little one this day you may weep tears of joy in my loving embrace
ever the optimist eh bastian
geoffrey is that you
it is
geoffrey youre safe too
queen elincia  i swear that i shall never ever leave your side again
oh  im so glad 
 hello
i have told you not to sneak up on me volke your majesty this is volke a spy and fireman in count bastians employ he was working for ike during the mad kings war perhaps you remem  
our captive has disappeared he has been gone for approximately half an hour
he escaped no we must find him here is your next assignment find the escaped prisoner immediately
two thousand gold
that will be fine make it quick
understood
this is very rude of me after i was the one who asked you here but we have an emergency would you all gather here again once we capture the escapee
thats fine im not very fond of the dark anyway well gather later
geoffrey give me a hand would you i would like to take him to the carriage
lucia do you know who that man in the black cape is
i was curious too its no use asking though neither bastian nor my brother would say anything
even geoffrey i didnt think he ever kept secrets 
a mysterious escaped prisoner a man shrouded in black its a big night for secrets isnt it
sigh
there you are your majesty
 general tauroneo
is something wrong
take a look at this
the mark of the blood pact  it has faded quite a bit hasnt it
what do you think this means
hmm  i do not know i must think on it
yes well both have to the lives of daeins people depend on it
do you believe that people can be saved from the state they are in
of course i do to be honest im a little bit thankful for the situation right now daein was headed for destruction because of what id done but what the goddess did has changed the course of things i cant fail this time i have to save everyone
ah i see i shall do everything i can to assist
thank you
your majesty this is for you
its a dark tome thank you general tauroneo dark tomes are harder to come by than tomes of other elements how did you find it
i did not find it your gratitude belongs to someone else
what do you mean
lady almedha looked for it at every village and town we stopped in she gave it to me out of concern that you might not take it from her
i see
your majesty if youll excuse me
mother 
 so we have a bit of a predicament i know its none of your affair but we would greatly benefit from laguz assistance in our hunt for last nights escapee
no problem i could use a little exercise before breakfast
thank you king tibarn please follow me
why are the others up so early whats going on
is it the disciples of order are we under attack
no your majesty  its not the disciples of order if youll excuse me i must go
wait geoffrey  who does he think he is
lets follow them
bastian what in the world is going on i insist on a straight answer
your majesty sister why are you here
thats not important explain why there are feral ones here
see that odious man among them hes controlling them he is using fell magic to summon the poor laguz souls who were turned into feral ones he is the man who escaped our custody last night volke found him just now
his name is izuka he designed the process that created the feral ones
what hes the butcher who twisted the lives of my kinsmen he wont die quickly ill make sure his screams are heard in phoenicis gallia even goldoa
 dare not speak to me that way again  my work is humanitys greatest triumph  depraved ha  show them the meaning of genius come my children defend me come my feral ones
we cant let a creature that twisted roam free we must fight
excuse me  volke
 
um  sir fireman
 what is it
you seem to have some time on your hands  would you mind helping us
three thousand
three thousand
 thats what the job will cost you in gold
fine i shall pay you that amount after the battle
agreed i await your order
thank you and if i may ask 
what
why do you need so much money
one hundred thousand
excuse me
thats what it will cost you for me to answer that question are you prepared to pay it
 no
then lets get to work what shall i do first
ah my partner in crime how shall i convince you to move those leaden feet of yours into action how much convincing will it cost
three thousand
i thought i was the jester considering your usual schedule of services three thousand is negligible
i dont like that guy call it a personal discount do you want it or not
of course i shall take your discount do as you wish when you see him now get to work
understood
i almost pity old izuka 
dont you see if i am harmed my knowledge will be lost can the human race survive such a tragedy if you fools cannot see the larger picture you will have to be destroyed
izuka the cruel  you are the author of this atrocity against nature what gives you the right to perform your vile works on the laguz
the sub humans are perfect subjects what could be wrong with using them
 she always told me not to let anger and hatred get the best of me not to let them guide my blade  this will be my only exception
i saw the results of your experiments at gritnea tower the mutilated bodies the rotting flesh  it was the most horrifying experience of my life i wonder if my nightmares will pass when i kill you
how could you not see the importance of my beloved research that was my lifes work
then it is appropriate that you will pay for those terrible crimes with your life my long suffering kinsmen watch as i destroy your tormentor
you youre 
 under a new contract good bye izuka
feral ones kill him do it now
have a care crimean count if my knowledge dies so does your only hope of saving that man
hmm its true that your knowledge is a valuable asset
ah my noble count you are most merciful
i have some knowledge of anatomy once you are dead perhaps i will dissect your brain and see if i can identify the root of your intelligence
y you monster what you suggest is unconscionable
exactly yet you had no hesitation before doing worse to the laguz i will speed you now to the afterlife where you may contemplate your lifes egregious mistakes
dont you see if i am harmed my knowledge will be lost can the human race survive such a tragedy if you fools cannot see the larger picture you will have to be destroyed
i dont know what atrocities caused bastian to hold you prisoner but i know what you did to the laguz and thats reason enough for me to kill you
dont be too rash if you kill me crimea will surely suffer
i will silence your lying tongue degenerate
theyve broken through my feral ones i must create more
after the war against the mad king i always regretted not capturing you prepare yourself for justice
izuka
ah my dear prince pelleas excuse me king pelleas id assumed that you had been turned to stone how nice to see you again but i am saddened to see that you would betray me and fight alongside these shortsighted fools i found you and set you on the path to royalty i served you well did i not
i know that youve been working for the senate izuka
so you found out very well at least i dont need to pretend anymore it isnt like you will spare my life anyway
with most of daein turned to stone the blood pact can no longer harm anyone but that doesnt change the fact that you tricked me into risking the life of every citizen of my kingdom why would you betray me izuka were you ever loyal to daein
betrayal what of your betrayal to me i remember well how you valued one worthless laguz life over mine it was your betrayal that forced me to abandon my work you were supposed to be my puppet a weakling boy king that i could control giving me free reign
what how could that be 
oh princeling boy how completely ive fooled you  you are not king ashnards son all i did was look for a boy that could pass for the kings son
but  mother said  she said she was certain that i was her child
ah yes lady almedha paragon of sanity she is certainly fit to identify a boy she hasnt seen in fifteen years she was so desperate to have her son again that she would have believed anything i told her
no  no stop it stop talking
elincia the crimean queen are you here to seek revenge
revenge on whose account what are you talking about i am arresting a dangerous fugitive
ah  you must be the hawk king understand that my work was never intended to harm the laguz specifically
no power on tellius will protect you from me with your death i can finally lay my brothers souls to rest
aaaargh but my work is still incomplete 
disgusting filth i cant kill him enough times for what hes done
at least he is finally gone no one else will suffer by his hands
i suppose that is all there is then
laguz brothers and sisters i hope your souls can find peace now
hey count bastian
that man in the black cape you left with us is in bad shape we cant even hold him down anymore
oh no  your majesty we must return immediately i will explain everything
oh thank goodness youre here i couldnt hold him down anymore please follow me
aaaaargh ahhh grrr  graaaagh
shhh calm down sir its all right you are a strong man you will pull through please you must calm yourself duke renning
it cannot be  uncle uncle renning you are alive oh you are alive
ugh  ahhhhhh grrr rr 
whats wrong uncle please speak to me its me elincia
its no use your majesty your noble uncles mind has been broken by the drug that creates feral ones
no how did this happen uncle uncle you must hold on uncle renning 
forgive me please give me a moment to collect myself
what happened back there who is that man
that is duke renning the younger brother of crimeas last king and queen elincias uncle he was next in line to become the king of crimea but   he was believed killed in the last attack by daein three years ago
i see and whats wrong with him now
bastian no more secrets its time for you to tell us everything you know
duke renning was apparently killed three years ago  but as you can see he is still alive
duke renning was one of the strongest warriors in crimea and while daein tried to kill him he survived when the mad king heard of his skill he had renning kidnapped and gave him the drug that creates feral ones this drug made duke renning even stronger but shattered his mind he became bertram one of ashnards infamous four riders after her majesty and company defeated him i had him taken back to my castle i hoped to find a cure but i didnt want to raise false hope your majesty so i kept the secret however his mind continued to deteriorate and there were no signs of improvement as a last resort i hired volke to investigate a way to cure him
volke quickly discovered that duke rennings transformation was engineered by a man called izuka this man had made himself an aide to the new king of daein and was not difficult to locate feeling that renning was running out of time we kidnapped izuka to learn more of the condition
returning to fayre castle we interrogated izuka at length and discovered more about his experiments perhaps unsurprisingly beorc are affected differently by the drug than laguz izuka then offered to create an antidote in exchange for his freedom
did you agree to it
we refused without a second thought such a monster cannot be allowed to roam free besides we know a more certain way to cure lord renning
the galdr of rebirth
prince reyson i beg of you please save my uncle
i cant guarantee anything elincia but i will try
oh thank you prince reyson thank you
please give me a moment to myself i must prepare
are you sure about this i thought the galdr of rebirth was too powerful and complex for a single heron to perform
usually thats true right now however asheras awakening has infused the world with order ive never felt stronger whats more lord rennings condition seems less severe than a true feral one i think i can do this
well youre the expert just dont go taking unnecessary risks
i wont tibarn you neednt worry so much ive grown a lot
 grr grrr  aaarrrrgh grragh 
uncle hold on
 unnnhh 
 it worked hes sleeping peacefully when he wakes he should be his old self
oh thank you reyson thank you
so hows prince reyson
hes asleep with a big contented smile on his face hell be fine
i suppose we should give thanks to goddess ashera her power gave strength to prince reyson and saved duke rennings life
its hard to think of her as the bad guy after seeing a thing like that goddess ashera huh i cant die until i see what she looks like
ike and company manage to evade their persistent foes finally arriving in sienne the capital of begnion
the tower of guidance according to the creed of the goddess which has been taught across the continent by begnion this is where the goddess ashera will appear during times of great crisis to lead the people to safety as even the smallest child in begnion knows the tower is sacred and mere mortals may not enter
with the world edging toward catastrophe the tower glows like a pillar of pure light as though to pierce through the very heavens
oh queen elincia
amy youre safe oh im so glad its so good to see you
i came here with general geoffrey
with geoffrey
i was outside on the day when the bright light engulfed everything at first i thought that time had stopped then i realized that time was normal but everyone around me had been turned to stone i rode around the city to investigate and i found this little girl crying in calills bar
did you find anyone else what about largo
 
no  how tragic how am i going to tell calill
mommy is here i want to see my mommy
yes she is here amy lucia
yes your majesty amy do you want to see your mommy here take my hand well go together
yay i cant wait to see her
how unusual i cant believe a small child like that has been saved from petrification isnt she the first
king tibarn prince reyson
id assumed that only the people with a certain amount of power were safe from petrification but i guessed wrong
im wondering if there are even rules at all
hmm
mommy
amy youre safe thank goodness im so glad
m mommy daddy couldnt move h he wouldnt say anything he  sniff  wahhhhhhh

sheesh all im saying is that you should take it ulki
no  you are older than me one must respect ones elders its yours janaff
thats not fair you only say things like that when its convenient for you were only five years apart
five years is five years you deserve the perks due someone of your age you take it
did you just call me an old codger
come on i dont care who keeps it just make a decision already
shut up tibarn this is between me and ulki
should you really be addressing your king with words like those
who cares its not like anyone else can hear
selfish little magpie
hey lookit me im ulki the solitary peacock
all right janaff thats enough
what how am i the one getting scolded
you too ulki you know how to press his buttons dont egg him on like that
 fine
what are you fighting over
theyre arguing over who would take my gift neither of them seem willing to take it
really how uncharacteristically selfless of you to put up a fight ulki
what do you mean white prince ulki is just being an ungrateful wretch for not appreciating my thoughtfulness hell never understand
since the item is so nice i thought that you should have it im not the stubborn one here
well since neither of you want it ill take it
what
 prince reyson
it will come in handy during a battle right then ill wear it and fight next to tibarn sure its good to be thoughtful and giving but if neither of you appreciates it theres no point
reysons right all right this is for you reyson can be my one and only aide from now on i shoulda thought of this sooner
w wait no ill take it
no i shall take it
ulki
once we have it janaff and i will discuss who should wear the item
do you agree to this janaff
um  yes i do i have no problem with that
reyson
thats fine with me as long as you agree to keep me nearby im all right with whatever you decide
its a done deal then now dont you two feel a little stupid after getting lectured like that and by reyson as well
 sorry ulki
i  i apologize too
ive been with you and tibarn since our feathers hadnt even grown in yet i guess we know each other a little too well well the white prince certainly reminded me of who i am im an aide to the king of phoenicis
me too here janaff this is for you
 hey wait a minute you think you pulled a fast one on me dont you get back here ulki

how strange why would a begnion soldier mention me
the prisoners are escaping
surprise surprise they found us
micaiah this is for you
my tome how did you get it
i didnt know if it was yours but i figured you could use it so at the armory i borrowed it too
well done sothe now i can pull my weight and fight
and a staff for you sister
thank you very much
um  i  i can fight too could you lend me that tome
what you mean this one ilyana i didnt know you used light magic too
sothe thats a tome of lightning magic
it is
i give up you just grabbed at random didnt you
you know i cant read the old language the letters all look the same to me here if this one will work take it just like old times right ilyana
thank you  and yes sothe  i dont want to fight but im glad ill get to fight alongside you again 
ilyana if youre not up to it dont feel pressured to fight we can handle the soldiers you look a little woozy are you sure youre going to be all right
shes fine micaiah shes always like that
but 
i can fight  im very angry  the food here  it was terrible and they gave us hardly any  i will have vengeance
this girl takes her food pretty seriously interesting
i see ilyana is as hungry as ever
dont worry about us well carefully tiptoe around you all the boy and i cant fight so well stay out of harms way good luck everyone
i am sorry to impose upon you please be careful
aran i cant believe it it is you
laura
i knew it but aran why why would any true daein join sides with begnion
a true daein im not sure i still am one  not since a family of merchants from begnion took me in  but i could never do anything to hurt you youve always been like a little sister to me get out of here laura  while you still have a chance ill turn a blind eye
but what about micaiah and sothe theyve risked their lives fighting for the abbot  and for me i couldnt possibly abandon them now not even if it meant saving myself
oh bother 
whats wrong
i cant keep lying to myself any longer i know what begnion is doing in daein is despicable and i cant support it
then 
then from now on im fighting for whats right just like the abbot taught us come on lets get you  and everyone else  out of here
wonderful thank you aran i knew it you havent changed a bit youre as considerate as ever your family would have been so proud
ehhhh you wont get away ill slice through you like a hot knife through cold butter
even if you run  there is no place for you scum to go 
you crawl quietly back to your cell and ill spare you more than that however i cannot promise
dont be so sure this isnt our first fight and it wont be our last
a brave yet foolish sentiment before the might of the empire you lowlifes are just cracked dirt beneath my boots
thank you so much all of you because of your bravery i can finally rejoin my merchant caravan still coming back to nevassa im stunned at the terrible state of things who would have thought that begnion would rule with such an iron fist they run your nation with boundless cruelty looting the towns and sending your able bodied men to camps it breaks my heart
they make me miss ashnard daeins late mad king and i never thought id say that at least he never tried to destroy crimea as a country
what do you mean by that
people make a country one person  even a noble king  does not a country make and a strong country only exists when its people are strong as begnion crushes the citizenry it slowly destroys daein
the dastards are treating daein like a nation of slaves if this persists daeins strength will be sapped and the nation itself will cease to be
then what should we do what can we do to save our country
there is a rumor if its true there might be hope 
look here jorge dont go spouting off rumors
no i want to know if there is a shred of hope for us tell me
well the rumor is that king ashnard left an orphan behind
really is that true
king ashnard had a child why have i never heard of this
its just a rumor  nothing more but if its true it would be a strike of great fortune for daein
in the last war crimea used a scion of the royal family to unify its people and rally a liberation army so could daein
and drive out the loathsome begnion
so where is this orphan
according to rumor hes in the east near the desert of death trying to raise an army to lay claim to the throne shall we go there
micaiah what do you think
 in the desert an important encounter awaits us it shall be one that changes the shape of our future
well thats it then we must go to the desert to meet our destiny
/***EOF***/
the daein army is working with begnion thats unexpected to say the least 
why would daein join the war i thought all their resources would be tied up in reconstruction
yeah that bothers me too theres something weird about all of this didnt daein resent begnions occupation why would they be so quick to help out their former enemy
why does not matter we are running out of time we must deal with this quickly if we are to get home
general skrimir have you recovered from your wounds already
yes do not underestimate the healing power of the beast tribe
all right everyones here lets begin the meeting
the immediate threat is the daein army theyre dug in around the area that well have to use to cross the ribahn maybe we can find another spot to cross
no we cant afford it if we waste any more time the central army will catch up to us if that happens were dead
ranulf tell me your impression of the daein army anything special
 well there werent very many of them but their morale was really up there their commander seemed very clever as well
it must be the maiden of dawn
 who
she was the hero of the recent daein uprising micaiah is her name if i recall correctly supposedly she has performed miracles and turned many losing battles into victories an interesting figure
miracles im finding that a bit hard to swallow are you sure about that
who knows personally i doubt it all i know is that the daein army believes in her miracles which makes her dangerous
this maiden of dawn is supposed to be the savior of daein whose miraculous powers freed their people from tyranny in other words her followers are fanatics who see her as a goddess she will make a formidable enemy
if we attack them head on the fighting wont stop until one side is decimated theres got to be a way to avoid that right
what about a decoy force like weve used in the past
the decoy only worked because the enemy didnt expect it i wouldnt count on the same strategy working twice
not necessarily the empire assumes superiority over all other countries begnion is only using the daein army as a pawn to stop us and likely wont care if it is destroyed in the process as such the daein army is most likely uninformed about our past tactics
you might have a point there i went scouting after the fog cleared and their forces looked really unprepared to fight us they had no ballistae and they hadnt fielded many fire mages it felt like they didnt know a thing about fighting laguz
then we should definitely have a decoy force hit them head on while the bulk of the army crosses the river in the meantime
ill head up the decoy force then the armies of gallia and phoenicis can cross the river while we fight
ill go with you ike daein would get suspicious if they didnt see any laguz in the enemy force
sounds like a plan to me take some of my men as well if you want i dont want their talons getting dull
the laguz alliance may have lost the war of might but we havent lost the war to save the lives of our brothers this fight will be ours
yes with the fangs and wings of the laguz and the knowledge of the beorc we will return home
daein cannot stop us now just as they could not stop us during the mad kings war we can do this
the laguz failed to cross the river this is their last chance to try this time theyll attack with beorc as well
sothe you know what that means if we end up fighting beorc 
i know well probably be fighting the greil mercenaries im aware its not going to be pretty
sothe tell me more about commander ike
why you used to hate it when i said anything about him
i want to know more about the man ill be fighting against what kind of a person is he
well lets see  hes generous he doesnt care about petty things he holds no prejudice against laguz nor does he care about the opinions of the nobles hes a master swordsman he accomplishes everything he sets out to do hes a true hero
i see he sounds quite different from king pelleas
micaiah they dont even compare king pelleas lacks any leadership or decision making skills
 that may be but i believe in king pelleas his heart is in the right place i believe in his virtuous nature and his commitment to being a good king 
even though he would set you out on a war that doesnt involve daein at all a war of bigotry and hate fighting on the same side as our real enemies youre smarter than this micaiah
sothe weve been through this i know were about to fight ike and the greil mercenaries but i 
its time shall we
sigh  those two are still here so much for friendly advice i guess now its friends against friends  things are getting crazy around here
the enemy is on the move theyre crossing the river there are humans among the beasts
here he comes
without the advantage of an ambush this fight is sure to be tougher than our last one
janaff what are you doing here
h hello nice to see you prince what a coincidence huh im just um taking a flight at night in a battlefield
 oh i assumed tibarn might have sent you to protect me
oh no no nothing like that
janaff do you really think you can hide anything from me
it  it was ike ike asked me to help out the greil mercenaries really
mm hm
you see your highness the enemy might get suspicious if there were no birds among the force
ah thats a good point now i understand my apologies for jumping to conclusions
no worries your highness  ha ha ha 
then let us go together to ike and seek his next command
what whoa hold up there
whats the problem i thought you were here to help
oh hey no problem at all your highness no problem whatsoever
excellent lets go
perfect  tibarns gonna have my beak for this 
ulki what are you doing here
orders of the king i am here to assist you
oh i get it youre here to guard reyson
shh ike please i cannot let the prince hear about this please pretend that im only here to assist you i beg of you
sure thats fine with me whatever your reasons i appreciate the help thanks
dont mention it
janaff what are you doing here
oh hey ike dont mind me im just um getting some air
hm right and here i was assuming you were here to guard reyson
shhh not so loud you cant let the white prince know why im here
i know i know im just giving you a hard time
then help me hey how about this ill join the greil mercenaries
sounds great to me free labor is always welcome
ulki why are you here
kings orders im here to assist
oh i see its that thing about having some birds in the decoy force correct
of course your highness just so
good im sure ike is glad to have your help well be counting on you ulki
i shall do my best
zihark
lethe 
you defeated me last time but this time itll be different prepare yourself
you wont surrender
i am a soldier i will fight to my death
  i knew youd say that then im coming with you im at your service lethe just like old times yeah
what why
the daein soldiers call this war “the sub human hunt” you know i hate that word i believed that daein would change or at least i used to but now  i just cant stand by this war is the last straw i cant fight for daein anymore
  you may not have claws but i think your soul is more laguz than beorc welcome to our tribe zihark
you i know 
mordecai  i never expected us to meet like this on opposite sides 
ah zee  eehark hm  no that not it sorry mordecai says your name not right not right yet
but 
zeehork zeeehar ack zi hark ahh that is good zi hark
mordecai  dont you understand were now–
i know mordecai is your friend allies we are it does not matter who we fight for
but–
you have no fang or tail but you are a beast brother zee hark hmm  no mordecai forgets again sorry
hey dont worry about it ive got it ill go with you that way youll get my name right in no time
ah good idea mordecai likes this idea
sir zihark its not too late lets not fight
i cant do that  daein has just freed itself i cant betray it now
even if you have been ordered by daein to hunt down laguz
i i just 
but this isnt you when i met you you were so nice and you never doubted yourself or your friends you even risked your own life to fight on behalf of the laguz and now youre throwing it all away 
  ilyana
yes
thank you youve opened my eyes
pardon
i will leave the daein army my friends in daein are dear to me but i refuse to take part in any “hunt” or lie to myself any longer
oh zihark im so glad 
huh well hey there zihark long time no see
brom 
ah it sure is great to see ya youre looking mighty fine seem a bit sad though
oh im all right brom hows the family
oh theyre doin great we had ourselves some troubles but queen elincia took care of it ah speakin of my family about your engagement to one of my daughters  have you given it any extra thought all my daughters are eager to marry just say the word now
what all of your daughters you told all of your daughters about me
ah theyre all such dears i cant favor one over the others can i so what do you say my second daughter is startin to look a lot like me nice soft cheeks
um well i thought i was pretty clear on this the last time we went over it 
she left for daein to see you have you run into her yet her names meg nice girl she looks a lot like me
you havent changed at all brom youre still the same good man that i remember from three years ago im really glad i ran into you brom now i remember what i was fighting for back then and now i know what i have to do
hm whatre you goin on about son
im leaving the daein army my friends in daein are dear to me but i refuse to turn my sword against the laguz any longer
im sorry i didnt want us to meet again like this forgive me
i use my sword for daein  but am i really fighting for daein here what am i doing 
ike 
its been a while zihark so youre with daein
yep this is weird ike i never thought wed meet again as enemies 
its the nature of being a mercenary no hard feelings zihark any chance you could convince the daein army to retreat
i wish its too complicated right now too many politicians playing around
i see  im not much for politics all i do is live by my principles my sword and my friends what can i say i wont change who i am even if it means fighting you
thats fine by me youre still the man i knew from the mad kings war its about time i also threw away my doubts 
the greil mercenaries  they really are here theres no way we can win this sorry guys im turning back for now i really suggest you all retreat as well
my friends  it grieves me to meet again under these circumstances
sir haar why are you fighting for these people
hey you stole my question why are you fighting in the daein army
there was a war to liberate daein while you were gone so i joined the army again
well it looks like you did a good job daein has been liberated so why are you still with the army
i cant just leave these people are my friends
oh stop with the sentimental nonsense jill in case you havent noticed youre fighting your friends too
what about you then how did you end up in this fight
well  somehow i got mixed up in putting down uprisings in crimea and then i ended up with the laguz alliance because you know being old friends with ike and all that
what that is hardly a cause worth fighting for youre unbelievable
all right enough debating what do you want to do now do you want to fight me
of course not i could never 
then join me
easy for you to say
youre full of doubt how do you live like that all the time is that how your father wanted you to live afraid to trust your own instincts
but 
daein has no business in this war you know that right
but what about my comrades what about my friends
is dying how you show loyalty if youre really their friend then fight alongside us maybe that will get them to think about what theyre doing
oh captain 
come with me jill we both know that we should follow our hearts even if it makes us traitors we know that better than anyone for the sake of your father live your life without shame
y youre right captain haar ive been so foolish just as before i would be proud to serve with you and captain haar thank you thank you so much 
jill i cant believe it it is you
oh mist 
im so glad to see you
wh what
well i was wondering about what to do if i saw you here with the daein army i had it all worked out you see and well here you are its great
mist were enemies now
no you have to listen jill lets not fight theres a really easy solution to this whole mess
but  what
just listen its so simple since daein shouldnt be in this war they shouldnt be here right now right and you and i are friends right so we can each pretend that the other one of us isnt here isnt that great
mist that makes absolutely no sense besides thats no the issue here youre a mercenary you know how th–
were not fighting thats final
mist
jill youd never turn your weapon against me i just know it i trust you because youre my friend
oh mist  all right thats it ive had enough of this
jill
you made my last doubts fade away ive made my decision im not fighting in the daein army anymore im joining back up with you
jill i knew youd come around
i feel bad for my comrades in daein but im going to stand by what i believe i will not be ashamed anymore
thats the jill i know and love
thank you mist
jill youre back with the daein army
i know i owe you all so much  and mist would grieve if you fell but i cannot retreat i must stand my ground
fine do what you have to do since neither side can retreat we will fight and jill im sorry it came to this
 i am too commander ike are you ready
hello sir zihark
ilyana  youre on their side too
and you stand with the enemy 
i dont know why but it feels like youve been in my life longer than the others i couldnt handle it if you got hurt ilyana please pull back before something awful happens i beg of you
oh zihark 
ilyana youre with the laguz alliance no i mean the greil mercenaries
yes muston and the others are with me too
i see  we fought together in ashnards war and in the war to liberate daein we didnt spend much time together but you were a trustworthy comrade
thank you  i wonder why were here why is daein attacking us
i dont know the occupation soldiers left daein but daein still cannot refuse a request from begnion liberation was only a dream
yet you continue to stay with the daein army why do you do that to yourself
because i cant abandon my comrades
jill were crossing the river this time
im sorry lethe i have to fight i will do anything for my country 
theyre so strong  even stronger than three years ago lady micaiah i apologize i must head back for now
most impressive i cannot fight with a wound like this ill be back shortly 
oww sorry yall im turnin back for now
be careful theyre much stronger than any of the foes weve encountered they defeated me as well  im falling back temporarily
oh no is this blood im sorry lady micaiah i must heal my wounds
ugh  my ribs  sorry micaiah ive gotta fall back
were totally outclassed in this battle this is insane micaiah im sorry i have to turn back for now 
blast theyre better than i expected im sorry micaiah i need to turn back for a while
stand aside you are no match for me
micaiah the maiden of dawn   is that what they call you
who are you your wings look just like rafiels
i am reyson my brother told me about you this is why im here please pull back your troops our enemy is not daein this is not your fight am i not correct
i know how you feel  though i owe a debt to rafiel i cannot do what you ask its not that i dont want to i think this whole war is madness but i must keep fighting
why is that
this fight is my kings will i cannot stop fighting just because i dont agree with him if we dont pull together under our new king daein will fall apart again just as it did before its liberation i believe in king pelleas i believe that our king will lead the people of daein to happiness
 i see i understand your position please accept my apology for asking the impossible
what what do you mean
you are fighting to protect your beliefs i understand that now but remember that we also cannot and will not pull back we both carry a heavy burden thats why were here
yes 
meg is it you sweetie
daddy  daddy
there there dont cry darlin im just glad youre safe what a mess were in huh but thats war i reckon in any case  theres no way i could ever fight my own daughter you run along now
meg
sir zihark wh whats wrong whats going on
im sorry but im joining up with the alliance i dont want to betray you but i cant fight for daein any longer
no wh what are you saying
i know this is a horrible thing for me to say but listen please leave the battlefield i dont want to see you get hurt
sir zihark but  you cant leave me here alone
i wanted to tell you that i have to go im so sorry meg 
sir  zihark 
oh i thought i smelled you earlier we just have to stop meeting like this
 
back in gallia in crimea  we just ran into each other recently too i dont know about the others but i can tell who you are you have one heck of a stench
 enough talk prepare yourself
still wont own up huh fine if thats the case ill just tear your mask off and show everyone myself
so you are alive somehow i knew it wasnt over yet
of course it wasnt over you were a boy trying to live up to the memory of the greatest swordsman in history
and yet i was the one who walked out of the castle that day
you have your father to thank for that when you told me that he had crippled himself i realized that i had never fought him at all merely his shadow
what are you getting at
i saw immediately that you were not your fathers equal but that one day you might be so i did the only thing i could to keep you alive  i let you win
 you did didnt you ive relived that fight so many times  how could i not have seen it before
you were not yet capable of seeing it but i had to let you live so that you could continue to train and perhaps one day be worthy of gawains legacy my armors blessing is gone let us see if that day is today
i promise you that it will be begin
you should run im not the weak child you remember
commander ike
look at you sothe youve grown a lot i almost forgot  youre originally from daein
im glad you remembered i hope it helps explain why im here
did you find the person you were looking for
yes she commands this army
the maiden of dawn
please dont call her by that ridiculous name her name is micaiah
i see
commander i  i didnt want to see you like this
but you dont intend to retreat do you
thats right
sothe before you challenge me you better be ready never to see that girl again can you handle that
wh what
if you cant stay away from me youll get no mercy despite our past im sorry sothe but the choices weve both made have brought us to this theres no turning back now
i understand commander and to answer your question  yes sir i can handle that whenever youre ready commander
commander we cant retreat we have to keep fighting even if i have to fight you 
sothe youve already lost this fight
what do you mean by that
you dont think you can win against me so you wont going into a battle with that kind of doubt youll lose for sure just think of me as an enemy soldier to be cut down
hello sothe 
if youre here with the greil mercenaries does that mean the caravan is with you too
yes everyone is back together why dont you join us you should bring micaiah of course everyone is worried about you two 
im sorry i cant 
i see  im sorry sothe
jill what are you doing
im sorry i just dont believe that daein is in the right this time retreat now sothe daein has no business getting involved in this war
i cant do that micaiah has made up her mind and ill follow her no matter what even if i have to fight you
then ill be forced to stop you prepare yourself sothe
i understand i thought that fighting against the laguz would set you off
i wont make any excuses im finished with the new daein
you chose principles over country and comrades i cant blame you for that
but these people are my comrades look around you sothe these people arent your enemies theyre your friends
lets get on with this im with daein youre with the laguz alliance theres only one thing to do when enemies meet
i wont go easy on you i respect you too much for that
unh  micaiah im sorry
sothe no sothe please hold on im coming over to you
dont worry  i wont die so easily ill stay by your side
thank goodness youre all right but sothe go back and rest you cant fight with a gaping wound like that  promise me that youll go back and get some rest
 fine
just as you have a reason to fight so do we
micaiah the maiden of dawn  is that what they call you
who are you your wings look just like rafiels
i am reyson my brother told me about you that is why im here please pull back your troops our enemy is not daein this is not your fight am i not correct
i know how you feel  though i owe a debt to rafiel i cannot do what you ask its not that i dont want to i think this whole war is madness but i must keep fighting
why is that
this fight is my kings will i cannot stop fighting just because i dont agree with him if we dont pull together under our new king daein will fall apart again just as it did before its liberation i believe in king pelleas i believe that our king will lead the people of daein to happiness
 i see i understand your position please accept my apology for asking the impossible
what what do you mean
you are fighting to protect your beliefs i understand that now but remember that we also cannot and will not pull back we both carry a heavy burden thats why were here
yes 
oh 
ilyana i remember now  you said that you were a member of the greil mercenaries in ashnards war
yes
im sorry
lets not do this please
what
lets not fight
if that means letting the laguz alliance get by us i cannot agree to it
i see  thats too bad
how is everyone in the caravan
theyre fine
im glad to hear that
maybe  we should fight
what
were enemies now we cant stand here and try to have a normal conversation its too strange 
ilyana 
itll be all right im really strong against your spells and my magic is not powerful enough to defeat you well be fine
but if were equally matched why should we fight at all it sounds  wrong
of course its wrong the fact that were fighting is all wrong we dont even dislike each other
 
lets just fight and pretend like this conversation never took place
lady micaiah
jill 
lady micaiah  i cannot continue to fight for daein its all gone wrong im here to tell you that  this is good bye i must part ways with you
i  see
i am joining the laguz alliance but its not because i want to fight the daein army
jill i dont understand 
please retreat there is no reason for daein to get involved in this war you know that better than anyone lady micaiah this is madness
i cant do that
 very well i will not give up hope ill stand before you as many times as it takes i will get you to leave this fight
jill 
zihark 
as you can see im with the laguz alliance now i cant lie to myself anymore micaiah im sorry
i see 
tell me micaiah why did daein become an enemy of the laguz daein has a new king now why cant it escape the grip of begnion
i dont know zihark i wish i did im sorry 
no im the one who should be sorry i know this isnt your fault its just that  now i wonder if the time ive spent fighting to liberate daein was well spent it makes me sad
will you cut me down
that depends on you micaiah will you try to kill me
you are an enemy of daein now but  i  how could i how could i possibly kill you
i feel the same way i couldnt possibly hurt you however fighting laguz is something i will not do for anyone where do we go from here
i  i dont know 
my wounds  theyre nothing theyre nothing compare to what my people have suffered we wont lose well never give up
youre 
hello
you must be ike of the greil mercenaries
and youre the maiden of dawn micaiah
i feel like i know you already maybe its because sothe has told me so much about you
i hate to do this to sothe but if you stand before me as my enemy youll get no mercy from me
 good i prefer it that way prepare yourself
 ah that explains quite a bit about the stories that surround you
who are you youre  youre just like me
yes they call our kind the branded as the years pass i understand better and better how others see us
you are so cold its like youre cloaked in frost is there even blood in your veins
there is blood very similar to yours in fact blood that teaches us what it means to be rejected and alone
your heart is frozen but i feel a warm core trying to melt through that ice i see  you have someone you cherish very much someone you rely on
do not presume to understand me you ridiculous girl you have no idea who i am and what i can do none at all daein has no business in this war i will defeat you swiftly and send you and your army back to daein
i finally meet my own kind and he is an enemy   i will not retreat i wont let you go any further
 janaff the king is calling us
hmm right good looks like we did it ike the main force has crossed the river we did it
excellent everyone push through lets meet up with the main force
the beast soldiers are behind us were being attacked from behind
the gallians how did they cross the river
its not just the beasts there are hundreds of hawks as well
even the hawk tribe is here the begnion army never told us that they had moved out 
 they got us commander ikes force was just a decoy
staying will only increase casualties lets retreat
no maiden we can still fight please give us your orders
i have we shall retreat i will not let all of you die in vain
but 
generals orders we kept our losses to a minimum thats enough for this battle
yes sir
micaiah im surprised this is the first time you couldnt predict the enemys movement
 youre right
micaiah whats wrong
sothe dont  just act normal everyone is watching 
what micaiah failed to eradicate the laguz alliance no
hmm this looks bad king pelleas is this how the people of daein repay begnion for all the kindness it has offered them im afraid daein and the senates friendly relationship stops here
p please wait give me one more chance i beg of you
well well  since you begged i suppose  i will consider it
please just listen  daein remains loyal to the senate we will carry out any task give to us your whim is our command just please give us another chance
very well we shall overlook your failure this one time but only once farewell young king of daein
pelleas 
 mother
that man you were speaking with  he is a senator from begnion correct duke lekain of gaddos i believe he was here before as part of the empires inspection team he came in duke persiss stead
yes you are quite right mother that was vice minister lekain of begnion so you saw us together 
tell mother what happened you look absolutely terrified does that man have something on you is he trying to hurt you its all right to tell your mother th  
no its quite all right mother we were talking about the future of our two countries and how we might repair our relationship
but  
please go back to your room i shall go rest as well i find myself very tired of late
pelleas  wait oh my son 
the diversion created by the greil mercenaries allows the laguz alliance to slip successfully past the daein armys blockade
they must pass through the northern edge of the serenes forest from there they will try to make their way to a hidden road that will lead them out of begnion and back to gallia
so it happens to be that i have a very rare and precious item in my possession which one of you thinks you deserve a gift
ooo me me i want it
no captain you should give it to me after all im your faithful servant
what no way that stuffy know it all doesnt need it look at me im so tiny and helpless i need all the help i can get you wouldnt want me to get hurt would you
a stuffy know it all oh i say how dare you madam captain ranulf you know that rewarding her behavior will only encourage her to act up in front of others have i not always followed your orders without question both quickly and effectively
all right all right  sheesh you know i personally dont really care which of you gets it
you hold it right there kyza i think you just called me a brat
pfft im only stating the obvious if you dont like it dont act so childish
hmph you stuck up old alley cat
stuck up your mother would be ashamed at your lack of manners
argh stop already im sorry i asked obviously i have to make the decision for you all right kyza this is yours take it
oh thank you thank you youve made me the happiest person in the army captain hah
what why why did you give it to him
hes your commanding officer
thats not fair hes a stuffy old bore and im wearing my prettiest collar 
forget it lyre the captain knows who slaves day and night to keep the army running smoothly
no no no the captains love is mine all mine give it to me
if you want it youll have to take it
oh youre dead
what is it with you two sigh

i see  so thats whats going on thank you for bringing it to my attention im very sorry your village was affected by this you have my sincere apologies
oh no your majesty we dont need no apology were just happy we could help
lucia  broms story confirms what weve suspected all along
yes as we thought duke ludveck of felirae is firing up a rebellion we should have seen it coming to be honest queen elincia there have been a number of indications that something like this was under way wed hoped to uncover something more tangible than hushed rumors  i should have told you sooner
no  i bear some responsibility as well the discontent among the populace is due to my lack of experience as a ruler now that a rebellion is gaining momentum innocent blood will surely be spilled 
i have always held the well being of the crimean people as my highest priority  ive done my utmost in crimeas name  and all ive ever desired is a country where war and hunger are unknown
beggin your pardon queen elincia
 yes brom
your majesty is doin a bang up job of it this countrys a safe place to live and thats more than most can say once you get the hang of things im sure youll be the name future kings and queens try to live up to we know you can do it
and it aint like all the young bucks out there got bees in their bonnets theres a whole mess o folk doin their darnedest to make this a fine country they wanna make you proud your majesty
i  thank you
all nations experience unrest when the reins of leadership change hands its true the world over but for ludveck to start beating the drums of war as if this were unheard of  what utter nonsense we must not allow it your majesty would you be so kind as to appoint me to the task of his capture i myself will march into felirae and seize ludveck and his rebels
no geoffrey we cant do that unfortunately we dont have enough evidence to arrest him
but 
dont worry brother if we have no evidence then i suppose well have to dig some up your majesty id like to take on that job
lucia i appreciate your dedication you have my permission to proceed 
well well  my dear lady lucia quite a way from home arent we
please do excuse the sudden visit your grace princess leanne lady lethe  this is lord ludveck duke of felirae i was thinking that our laguz guests might enjoy the fine fruits this region is known for weve traveled quite a long way  i hope it wont be too much trouble
dont be ridiculous i could be nothing but delighted by a visit from you lady lucia although i must admit  i would be all the more pleased if you had come such a long way just to see me
  you are too kind lord ludveck
please feel free to take your ease you are welcome to stay in felirae as long as you desire
 this is it this document is an order written by ludveck himself marked with his signal if we show this to the royal assembly well surely have the backing to indict him thank you so much both of you we have to quell this uprising before things get out of hand
if there is no war we are happy but if there is war it is good we came
ludveck is poor prey he hides behind a shield of words not realizing that words can be seen through
yes and thats quite fortunate for us but we still have to get out of here without being detected
m my lady you mustnt raise your voice 
whos there show yourself
 
princess leanne sir nealuchi i thought you had returned to the royal palace  what in the world are you doing here
oh ho ho  forgive us  we just couldnt help but be concerned for you
 
well what can i say this just means well have to be even more careful to get out of here safely
 someone is coming
guards this cave has only one exit  i guess that means we do this the hard way weve obtained enough evidence to indict ludveck so theres no point in sticking around lets go
as i expected the queens house pets are playful little pups indeed the only thing your sniffing about will get you however is an abruptly shortened life span
to associate with beasts like you  one has to wonder where the queen acquired such a lack of taste
my death means nothing  our plan is perfect  there is  nothing nothing the queen can do 
well look what we have here  lady lucia and her pack of curs how interesting what cause could you have for roaming the grounds at night hmm
cause why weve merely lost our way
is that so in that case i will gladly escort you back to the castle
thats quite all right we should be going home but please do give lord ludveck a message  tell him that his revolt will never succeed
 tsk tsk i did try to warn lord ludveck but it seems that he is quite fond of you if he knew of your little discovery  im certain he would have no qualms about eliminating you
this way
as we suspected lord ludveck is intent on rebellion his followers are spread across the land inciting insurrection we have the documents to prove it
queen elincia i stand ready to defend the realm i will lead the royal knights into felirae and we will seize the duke
i am hesitant to resort to the sword without at least attempting diplomacy at all costs i must stop the people of crimea from fighting one another
your majesty news from the countryside duke ludveck has assembled an army and announced his intentions against you the rebellion in felirae is growing quickly
i see 
he must have realized that his operations were no longer a secret your majesty we have no time to waste we must stand against this for the future of crimea
 i understand geoffrey leader of the royal knights  i hereby authorize the use of military force against the rebel army
yes your majesty at once
i will begin marshalling forces this rebellion must be stopped before nobles in surrounding areas catch wind of it
 am i doing the right thing oh father  uncle renning 
welcome back marcia did you learn of sir ikes whereabouts
no  im sorry ive got nothing but sore feet and a tired pegasus ive talked to a few local villagers who say the greil mercenaries have been working low paying odd jobs here and there nobody seems to know where they are now but everyone agrees that this is the first time theyve been gone for so long
 
princess leanne please try to keep your spirits high i assure you we will continue to investigate sir ikes whereabouts
th thank you
oh princess leanne you spoke
quite a shock yes my lady has been studying your language which we often call modern speech
thats wonderful its hard enough visiting a strange land let alone learning the languages
 me not big no pr problem queen elincia has tr trouble heart
ah  id forgotten the heron tribe can peer into the heart i cant hide the pain im feeling  at least not from you princess leanne
queen  el elincia
 why does this happen my people fight brother against brother  and no matter what i do i cant stop it im a miserable failure i just want to crawl into a cave somewhere how can anyone believe in me now
i never asked for any of this  i never wanted to be queen
  
 sniff  i cant  i cant do it anymore 
insurrection erupts across crimea the wounds crimea suffered during the conflict with daein have finally begun to heal and it should be rejoicing in its hard won peace how is it that the fires of rebellion have been lit
bastian queen elincias most trusted advisor widely acknowledged for his political savvy is on a mission to daein and the greil mercenaries the original authors of crimeas recovery are nowhere to be found
queen elincia close to despair has nonetheless ordered the crimean royal knights to restore order in felirae her only wish is to win the coming battle so that she may stave off a civil war
awww  i really wanted to go to the palace i wouldve been happy with just a tiny little glance at queen elincia shes  glorious this is so unfair
yup its the pits but that queen of ours is a real nice lady knowin her shed probly just let ya talk to er noble or not
the nerve of that duke ludveck he ruined my one chance to meet the queen i wont stand for it he needs a kick in the rear or a punch in the mouth the things id do to him 
uhm  heather you sure are a lovely gal and all but  you sure do say some funny things
cant argue with that nephenee but thats just the way folks are they aint always what they appear to be aint nobody perfect neither less youre talkin bout the goddess that is
excuse me 
hm
oh
well hi there miss lucia what can we help ya with
i came to ask for a favor if its not too much to ask id like you both to accompany me to felirae
hmm naw that wont be a problem you goin ta catch the duke
something a little more  preliminary i guess you could call it espionage
espio what sounds serious nephenee you ever hearda that
oh sure when i was just a sprout i caught a real bad casea that i got this awful rash all over my back too
uh  thats  a very nice story maybe id better explain what i mean
dont you know anything espionage is all about stealing secrets and not getting caught its one of my many strong points
oh really and who might you be
my name is heather im a friend of nephenees id do anything to help her majesty seriously anything
 i see maybe you can lend a hand as well
miss lucia youre the greatest like amazingly stupendously great id love to help
lady lucia weve heard a rumor that youll be leaving to investigate an enemy is this true
lady lethe sir mordecai  i  well 
we could return to gallia and bring back soldiers to help you know as an ally in a time of crisis im certain our king would lend support
no lady lethe this is an internal affair we dont want to have to involve gallia in crimeas civil problems
more fighters are always better the people of gallia  all will fight for queen elincia
listen i know you mean well but i just cant allow it im sorry but if there were even a hint of gallias assistance there would be even more problems in the royal court
problems what problems
this conflict isnt exactly a life or death situation for crimea so  relying on support from a laguz nation would cause an uproar with the nobility is that what you mean
yes unfortunately im ashamed to admit it but its the truth
no its common sense given the history of both our nations i completely understand we wont report this to gallia
thank you for understanding i apologize for troubling you
no it is fine
why this tactic of rousing the people to rebel against the queen though any laguz who wanted to be king would fight for it with teeth and claws as is proper you beorc are always wasting time talking
our society is very complex theres history and tradition unwritten law and custom there are lots of reasons for why we  
bah attempts to compromise wont get you anywhere you should just kill him and get it over with
mordecai feels sad poor queen elincia  we cannot help her
thats not true mordecai having support from you and lethe is very helpful
really mordecai will help with anything
hmm i have a great idea together with the laguz 
ill go too
princess leanne why do i suddenly have a crowd
she says that shed like to go
no im sorry its much too dangerous where were going i couldnt risk something happening to you
hoo hoo i guess this mangy old coot will be joining the action then to ensure my ladys safety of course
sir neluchi as well stars above 
your majesty 
ok  all finished
what are you doing
dont worry about it its a secret
aha that was a needle and thread wasnt it did you just sew something into my collar
its a good luck charm to keep you safe while youre away so youll come back to me in one piece
elincia 
be careful out there ill be praying for you
thanks ill be back with good news i promise
lucia wait
you cant stop me geoffrey
i know that but i can try to keep you safe cant i so id like you to take this
an elixir i dont need it im just  im not going to fight you know
if you dont use it so much the better but just hold on to it for me
all right
promise me you wont do anything stupid promise for elincia and me and for bastian
for you to even mention his name at a time like this  i give up sure i promise keep queen elincia safe got it
of course on my life
/***EOF***/
you summoned me your grace
jarod there is trouble the apostle has formed an inspection team shes dispatching it to daein
oh ho 
ive arranged to meet with the senates vice minister duke gaddos if we ask him the favor  i imagine he could discreetly sweep their findings under the rug but in the meantime you must obliterate the insurgents once that is done well devise excuses
understood sir
whats the plan will the senators be able to cover up this mess
if the inspection team and the rebel army ever cross paths even the senate wont be able to hide the truth well lure the rebels to shifu swamp well plant tales of a mass execution there and theyll be sure to come then well trap the malcontents and wipe them from the face of the land
its amazing  my wound is healed i give you thanks i never thought id see the silver haired maiden work miracles before my very eyes
silver haired maiden help them you must help them
help who whats going on calm down and tell me
theyre killing our men i beg you please save them
prisoners from joad work camp are being collected in shifu swamp and executed 
not only joad theres reportedly a plan to exterminate all prisoners in every camp and let the swamp conceal the remains
ive heard nothing of such a plan its a false rumor or an enemy trap
it may indeed be a trap but if we dont investigate we risk a mass execution
and what if it is a trap and they vanquish the liberation army the dream of restoring daein to glory will die instantly for the good of daeins future we must ignore this threat
 i understand and thats why i wont take any troops only myself and my old friends will go
mi micaiah
if you refuse them your permission i will go alone
stop right there little lady i will not authorize this action without the princes full approval
izuka  let her do as she wishes please she hasnt disappointed us yet
my prince  hrrgh fine but i cant help but feel as if these children are running your army
were just about ready lets talk to tormod and  
 
micaiah
oh sorry
hey remember our promise from three years ago there are no secrets between us
sothe muarim knows that im older than i look
i see well dont worry too much about it you can trust him
yes im sure of that muarim seems very trustworthy but what about everyone else what would they think if they knew all of my abilities came from the mixed blood running through my veins blood they consider cursed
micaiah stop 
right now when they look at me they have love and affection in their eyes but would they look at me the same way if they knew i dont want to find out sothe i dont think i could bear the truth
you know we can stop
what do you mean
look this was an impossible situation to begin with youve always led such a secluded life  ever since you were thrust into this position i worried that the pressure might get to you
youre right i knew it would turn out like this despite that i accepted the job i cant stop now
but micaiah 
listen sothe i realized something after daein lost the war
whats that
i realized how much i loved my country
and
during the war i spent a lot of time with the people of daein while i was waiting for you to return after we lost the war all our cities and towns had been reduced to ruins we had to help each other to cope we supported and comforted each other thats how we survived
you never mentioned this before
ive been secluded so long i had no idea people were so strong and kind no one knew who i was but they helped me because i was from daein they were so loving they were my friends
and now you wont leave them
i was touched by their kindness now im scared to lose it very scared
micaiah 
i suppose this isnt the time to worry about such things if my power is needed to liberate daein i will stand my ground and fight
well not to spoil your resolve  but if things get too hot im just going to grab you and run
sothe 
friends and daein are important but not as important as you are to me remember that
 all right thank you sothe
sorry about this lady micaiah just this once i agree with lord izukas concerns
i completely understand this is my fight and mine alone please keep the prince safe general tauroneo
ill protect micaiah ive enlisted extra help too well make it back in one piece
i place my trust in you sothe best of luck oh i nearly forgot you should take this
what a peculiar staff  what power does it possess
it is a restore staff it will help you recover from poison sleep and paralysis enemies will use every method they possess to destroy you it is best that you be prepared for every eventuality
thank you general tauroneo we will return safely
i know and i know youll save the hostages too
hm  i wonder where boss is these tents all look the same 
hello vika can i help you

its all right sorry to bother you

but 
i know how painful it is to be feared im really really sorry lets be friends ok if you can forgive me that is 
of course i forgive you thank you vika id be honored to have your friendship

we are the daein liberation army everyone hold tight youll be safe soon
look at her hair  could it be the silver haired maiden our countrys savior come to rescue us
the savior of daein
whether they suspected a trap or not theyre here brazen fools all hands take battle positions
silver haired wench im going to drown you and all of daeins hopes in these filthy waters youve no escape
so its a trap after all
dont get too smug you cruel cowards we have a little something up our sleeves too tormod heres your chance
lady nailah volug
su sub humans theyre everywhere how
rafiel even you came to help
what happened just now what was that strange song
that was vigor a heron galdr that can reenergize our allies in a fight dont be distracted micaiah lets set our formation while we can
queen nailah are you sure its all right involving not only you but rafiel as well
rafiel cant fly so sometimes he has trouble keeping up but even so the effects of his galdr make him a valuable asset in battle all i ask is that you keep him near me so i can keep him safe
i understand i will
rafiel why did you come i thought herons abhorred fighting 
wherever the queen goes i follow i practice seid magic  even if i cannot fight i can lend strength to my friends and companions
yes i heard you singing to queen nailah and volug earlier we are blessed to have you at our side
and if i sing to you i can restore your spirits as well so that you might attack your foes swiftly
so you will help us
helping you would give me great joy
you have my thanks
silver haired maiden or whoever you really are i knew youd come i knew how your reputation would suffer if you abandoned these prisoners here you had no choice but to come
how many innocent defenseless people have you ordered killed just to lure me here
look whos passing judgment maiden of miracles savior of daein  youve spun quite a pack of lies to inspire your conquered people but that ends here wench lets show them how insignificant you really are
that wench her powers much too dangerous  she mustnt be allowed to 
were nearly back to camp i wonder if the prince will overlook the fact that i insisted on this mission
im sure hell be happy when he sees the prisoners are safe
sothe do you hear a noise coming from the canyon is it people shouting
look look up there the maiden has returned and the prisoners are with her
she won another victory she escaped their trap and destroyed the enemy again
radiant with divine protection she truly has the goddesss blessing the silver haired maiden our priestess
priestess of dawn hooray lady micaiah
what could they be celebrating
it seems the soldiers are celebrating your liberation of the prisoners you should wave to them people like their heroes to seem approachable it would make them happy
im no hero  but i see what you mean
what a glorious sight she is
lady micaiah lady micaiah the priestess of dawn
here you are ive been looking for you
sothe after all those soldiers cheering  i feel like im doing real good here 
 micaiah
sothe please come quick theres something wrong with muarim
ghh grraaahrrrr 
muarim get ahold of yourself look at me
 gh  li ttle one 
this happens over and over  muarim suddenly transforms and he growls like hes losing his mind and if i if i grab him and yell his name again and again he returns to himself but then it just starts over and and when hes growling his eyes they look  its as if as if one of them is looking at me 
them one of them one of who
you cant mean  no
h help him please i dont know what to do the time between transformations is getting shorter and shorter 
agh  my body cant   no no no  little one get away 
no i wont let you ill die before i let you go feral muarim look at me
that song 
rafiel 
gh 
wha   muarim muarim
 the galdr of rebirth restores twisted bodies and souls to their proper states he will be all right now
th thank you  without muarim life would be terrible 
what was that song it was different than when he sang before 
it was the galdr of rebirth i heard it once before in the war but  micaiah whats wrong
i feel odd maybe it was the song  im shaking for some reason  but im truly glad that muarim will be all right 
feral ones
in the mad kings war  daeins military developed living weapons they were called feral ones laguz that had been warped and twisted by terrible experiments
terrible you say do you mean to refute the highly effective results of my brilliant research
then it was you you secretly gave muarim the drug to turn him into a feral one
and whats wrong with that maintaining constant battle strength in beast state  how splendid
how dare you transforming laguz into feral ones dramatically shortens their life spans it destroys their sense of self and they do nothing but fight until they die and you you gave muarim that drug
pawns need no sense of self its only natural to sacrifice soldiers for victory in war
you twisted maniac you are the lowest  
everybody wait please izuka clearly did a terrible thing to that sub hum  that laguz i apologize tormod  im truly sorry he will not use the drug again so please  try to forgive him 
prince pelleas 
my prince we must not have royalty bowing and scraping before swine like  
 thats enough
tormod
let him go 
i see  is that true
yes apostle our occupation forces have engaged in appalling and inhumane excesses in daein these excesses were perpetrated entirely outside the knowledge of the occupational governor duke numida
i come to you penitent  failing my duties as governor i numida share a measure of guilt for this disaster i am prepared to take the appropriate punishment apostle sanaki however i feel that freeing the people of daein from the clutches of our oppression is our most urgent task 
urgent you say then we must make haste we will forthwith convene an inspection team and request a meeting with the army led by the late king ashnards orphan we will assure them of begnions intentions then we will immediately address the occupation forces tyranny
excellent in that case please deign to allow me your humble servant lekain to lead the inspection team the soldiers who have stained the empires name will be toppled where they stand i promise they shall not live to return here
that is unacceptable i will decide the soldiers punishment only after hearing their side and i have chosen to appoint sephiran duke persis to lead the investigation team is that acceptable sephiran
i hear and i obey my empress
what but but apostle sanaki 
this is a dire situation accordingly i judge the prime minister duke persis to be more suited to the role than you vice minister lekain that is all
hrrgh 
l lord lekain  what shall i do
duke numida my friend  im afraid you must sacrifice every last begnion in the imperial occupation army
what th thats ridiculous but grrgh blast that spoiled brat and her cunning little schemes  youll regret this apostle sanaki
micaiah and her small band of fighters knowingly walk into a trap to save condemned daein prisoners even without the benefit of izukas vast information network news of micaiahs heroism in shifu swamp spreads like wildfire across daein
the once hopeless citizens of daein dub her the priestess of dawn and find their spirits restored in their troubled hearts they see in her nothing less than the promise of salvation throughout daein the people rise as one against the brutality of their oppressors begnions occupying forces cannot deal with open war on so many fronts
general jarod redeploys his men to key locations to better defend the capital city jarods forces still outnumber those of the daein liberators and he has hardened his defenses in hopes of holding off micaiahs army
the liberation forces fight with a fury not to be denied however and the occupation army begins to lose its will to fight breaking through enemy lines again and again micaiahs forces gain vital ground and momentum
despite the anger micaiah feels toward izuka for his treatment of their laguz allies she continues to lead the army in its lightning quick advance nevassa is now mere days away
/***EOF***/
so  were guessing that flare sent up from geoffreys troops means ludveck plans to come for your majesty hes probably marching his troops toward this fortress as we speak since its come to this id like to stick around and help let me know if you need me
 i see thank you ever so much sir haar  i have one more question what about lucia have you heard from her is she safe
we found a mans body in the village safehouse we believe he was her messenger we also found this 
no this is  this is lucias hair but  how
well we assume that ludveck infiltrated her network of spies and captured her this is his way of letting us know it also means shes still alive which means we still can save her queen elincia its up to you to determine the best course of action
y yes i  i know  royal guards arm yourselves and prepare to meet the rebel forces in battle i will be commanding you personally
your majesty but you are the queen its much too dangerous please assign a subordinate to this duty
i will not it is my indecision that has allowed the rebellion to come this far i refuse to run from this problem any longer
lucia  lucia im sorry somehow i promise you  i will save you
princess leanne sir nealuchi  this fortress will soon be under siege
wh whaaat
somehow the enemy has found out that i am hiding here my two fine friends  you must escape
i sing and h help queen elincia
no under no circumstances i wont allow any such thing
i like help q queen elincia
now now when my lady makes up her mind nothing in tellius can sway her and me im sure you wouldnt mind having these old bones on the battlefield
sir nealuchi  honestly i couldnt  sigh 
wait until you see me  even at my age ill be one step ahead of those freshly hatched whippersnappers
 very well i must prepare as well i had hoped this day would never come  amiti the treasured blade of house crimea will awake from its long slumber
 the battle will begin soon i want both of you to promise me that you will fall back if in danger understood
fall back your majesty no one can hold a candle to the speed at which the raven tribe retreats
ha ha  thats a relief
reporting sir fort alpeas gate is sealed and they are readying their defenses
i see  lady lucia must have arranged some way to warn the queen but alas even if they were to have all the energy and luck in the world the royal knights wouldnt arrive for two days in any case theres no way we can lose considering that we have a card which has yet to be put into the game
y your majesty dire news the rear gate is open and the rebel army is storming in
what how could this happen
i think youll understand once you question this man
you guard the inner garden correct
you scum you helped the rebel army didnt you
yes yes i did i did it because it was the best thing for the future of this country those daein murderers killed my entire family and now the queen bows down and wags her tail at them its a disgrace
silence youre the traitor here prepare to die
wait killing this man will do nothing to help our situation we have to halt ludveck and his men theyre already inside
im going out there too
mordecai will fight for you queen elincia
you can count on me your majesty
queen elincia crimea needs you more than anything and i reckon you could use my help
my homeland being ruled by a snobby stiff like ludveck please i dont think so
your majesty we would give our lives for our queen allow us to fight
thank you everyone i am indeed the queen of crimea and a queen does not hide our enemies are fellow citizens of crimea but we can no longer sit idle as they destroy the harmony of our nation
could our situation be any better just look at these fragile defenses  as fragile as the queens reign ludveck  oh the queens taken command i expected her to abandon her people turn tail and run for the hills how preciously naïve we shall have to teach her that being overly optimistic can be fatal
queen elincia i made it
marcia
thanks to general geoffrey we spotted an ambush on the main road and snuck by on the old highway instead the royal knights will be here soon i flew ahead to tell you and to serve you some traitor pie on my lance
 thank you im impressed you made it back so quickly
my pleasure your majesty now which monkeys do you want filleted before the royal knights get here
your majesty well countercharge their flank the royal knights will succeed again indomitable knights of crimea this is the hour you have trained for hold the line and run them down
geoffrey geoffrey oh geoffrey
find ludveck duke of felirae seize him immediately he must not escape
what a bother they arrived far faster than i had expected but i will prevail i wont lose to that worthless queen
geoffrey
elincia im relieved youre safe leave the rest of the battle to us find someplace safe
no this is my fight this is my problem and it will be resolved under my power
very well if thats your decision your majesty
the day is upon us  a day that will stand proudly in the history of crimea today a weak queen falls and a new king prevails
thats enough duke ludveck you have no chance of victory the royal knights are here and we have our queen to lead us
ho ho  its the valiant geoffrey i assume general that you have yet to hear about lady lucia
lucia whats happened
well  i could tell you but what would that gain me now if you were to turn on the queen and grovel at my feet i might consider telling you
how dare you you rotten 
queen elincia 
ludveck
looking quite gallant arent we i thought you would surely be fleeing by now or pleading for your life i must commend you on your unexpected bravery
i am the ruler of crimea i will not abandon that role
oh i see  self sacrifice is it how very honorable of you by the way your majesty lady lucia is often in your company wherever could she have gone to
where is she tell me shes safe tell me  now
oh my you look pale you two grew up like sisters  you must be worried then ha yet another facet of your weakness
elincia i yield to you please  you may imprison me your majesty be merciful spare our lives we surrender our weapons
queen elincia im so glad youre safe  please forgive my tardiness ive let you down im sorry
ridiculous you did no such thing geoffrey  thank you so much so what of the rebel army
without ludveck at the helm theyre a mess theyre all running about trying to escape as commanded we are not pursuing fleeing soldiers and lord ludveck is locked up in the dungeon
queen elincia
lucia is being held captive if were to save her we need to talk to him
your majesty general w weve received a missive it concerns lady lucia
queen of crimea we demand that you release the duke of felirae refuse and lady lucia will die
no
 lucia
you have half a mark if the duke is not released by then the girl dies
queen elincia dont listen to them dont worry about me
guh
quiet you can die sooner if you like
 your majesty you cant  you have to let me do something about this
 
lucia would willingly die fighting for her country i know  but you have to help her elincia if you were in her position she would surely do the same please just give the word
hello your majesty  by the look on your face i can see my plan has been a success
 what exactly is it that you want to throw our country into chaos
no i want to protect it your majesty
what
queen elincia youre so naïve cold and callous decisions are sometimes required of a nations ruler  i was testing you we all wanted to know if our queen would have the power to stop a civil war but no you were too hesitant and too concerned about harming the people  now look what has happened the rule of crimea cannot be kept in your hands please your majesty you must abdicate and cede the crown to me and considering lady lucias life is on the line you havent much choice now lets have you free me from this prison cell and then we can discuss any further details 
i dont think so
what are you truly willing to sacrifice lady lucia
 lord ludveck all your dissatisfaction and misgivings about me are well founded however do you realize how many lives youve simply thrown away strength without compassion does not a ruler make you care nothing for the people sir you cloak your desire to rule with pretty speeches but it is petty avarice nonetheless
 so this is how it shall be very well  but lady lucia cannot be spared without my order
allowing you to plant the seeds of rebellion and play havoc with the lives of my people is a failure for which i must answer but i will see crimea through this trial i will give my people the future they deserve no matter the cost
 ha  ha ha ha ha well played your majesty indeed i have failed yet i wonder  are you capable of watching lucia die or will you crawl back to me your face awash with tears begging for mercy how i pray to see that face your majesty
rebel soldiers hear me ludveck of felirae having conspired against the nation will stand trial as the queen and ruler of crimea i refuse to negotiate with those bent on destroying it
 so youre going to let this girl die
hah
i will be strong lucia 
tch  kick scream beg  give us a show wench
your highness your trusted friend will now die let this burn forever in your memory
people of crimea  behold a true queen your queen long live queen elincia
come on do it its a clean shot
 whats the problem
im nervous what if i hit her
 its too late for nerves rolf if youre not up to it just leave it to the master eh  watch and learn one clean motion no hesitation
the queens men are attacking
stop him
soren always lost in your books what have i said about watching your back
form up surround them all dont let a single one escape
hold on lucia everything will be fine
can you hear me hold on
queen elincia its sir ike and the greil mercenaries they came to our aid now well get lucia back in one piece weve nothing more to worry about ill deploy my knights at once
 hh   
sir ike  if you hadnt come to help i would have lost one of my dearest friends thank you  thank you ever so much
we were happy to do it and bastian pays well for mercenary work
bastian
yes the count of fayre knew about ludvecks plotting before he left for daein bastian guessed that if he left the country the rebels would feel confident enough to make their move what else could you expect from crimeas top tactician well crimeas most deceptive old dog at any rate
yes thats just like him 
sorry that we had to stay hidden until the last minute for a ruse like that to work you have to deceive allies as well as enemies i know you were acting in crimeas best interests but im sorry you had to let that happen to lucia
no  it worked out fine in the end please put it out of your mind
lucia geoffrey  i value your lives more than even my own but its my duty to protect this country even if that means losing you ive learned a lot from all of this i hope to keep them out of harms way and ill never make the same mistakes again
good to hear so what are you going to do about all the escaped rebel soldiers
the rebel army will be eradicated we cannot allow them to sow the seeds of discontent among the people of crimea
thats the right choice would you consider contracting my mercenaries for the job
 no sir ike ill leave that up to the royal knights im certain this task will create anger among the people and the royal knights may be resented for their role in it  but my duty as queen demands that it be done the people will have to learn to accept that
i respect your devotion to duty so you dont need me then
thats right im going to move on together with my vassals and the people of this country
sir ike  before you leave theres something id like to talk to you about
what is it
when you heard from bastian  did he say anything about daein
no nothing
he informed me of a number of things apparently daeins reconstruction is playing out much like crimeas  he spoke of a new king raising the banner of war and a charismatic young hero carrying it into battle he compared king pelleas to me and a silver haired maiden to you  its almost unnatural he suspected that someone might be scheming trying to manipulate daein bastian seemed quite suspicious of it all
so bastian went to daein to try and confirm his suspicions on that
yes there was also something about daeins resurrection that we cant afford to overlook  the black knight
what
ill never forget him  he was the one warrior who the late king ashnard trusted encased in pitch black armor standing tall with a crimson cape  when the liberation army fought at the capital he was there he sided with the silver haired maiden
the black knight  the man who killed my father  but i defeated him three years ago im sure of it at the very least he couldnt have escaped when nados castle came crashing down on him
the day after you fought bastian ordered some men to search the remains of nados castle there was no trace of the black knight no armor  no sword  no corpse
if the black knight that was seen in daein was indeed the same black knight  he might prove to be a threat to crimea
hmm if hes still alive  i have no doubt ill see him again elincia this is very important information to me thank you
of course
/***EOF***/
your majesty the begnion army has crossed the border they are seizing food and supplies and calling it tribute to the empire there are no casualties yet but they are acting like bandits
i see  so they simply ignored me
what shall i tell the troops your majesty
 order the royal knights to mobilize ride out and advise begnion to withdraw if they do not comply  i approve the use of force to remove them from our lands
but your majesty this is the begnion army we are talking about it would be unwise to provoke them
i had hoped to avoid this situation  but the empires attempts to strong arm our people shall not go unanswered deploying the royal knights is the only way to protect our borders from incursion however i remain open to suggestions do you have an alternate plan of action lord saron
n no  please forgive my impudence your majesty is quite right
i am glad we are in agreement lord saron
this whole situation disturbs me greatly i wonder  what is happening to the empire
i doubt that the apostle would allow this sort of thing to happen we should prepare for the worst i fear something horrible must be happening within begnion
hey did you hear the imperial army is requesting crimeas assistance
yeah i heard i also heard that the messenger treated our queen with no respect at all who do they think they are
shhh not so loud begnion is ruled by the apostle they helped us when daein invaded its only right that we pay back the favor by coming to their aid
but begnion is fighting the beast tribes of gallia why would we fight gallia the beast tribes helped us rebuild crimea
thats true but come on think about it who would you rather side with a land of beorc or the land of sub laguz the answers as plain as day we side with the beorc
hmm  you have a point
id choose gallia over begnion
really
but why
the people of gallia helped us rebuild the village even though were beorc they even repaired the road to the farm thats up on the mountain that wasnt an easy job either
yes i remember what was his name  mordecai he was strong yet very kind he looked frightening at first but the children in the village loved to play with him he was a wonderful man
if the queen decides to answer begnions request for troops wed have to fight gallia how terrible would that be
thats war isnt it
yes i suppose it is at that
hmm
i wish we didnt have to fight anyone at all
its been one thing after another first the civil unrest then the imperial invasion im so sick of hearing about all of it
you and me both i figured id be able to get in some me time now that crimeas peaceful again get a card game started or something 
youre a royal knight if the queen decides you should go sweep away ten or a hundred imperial soldiers you should probably go do it
yeah  weve been ordered to mobilize and i cant think of any excuse to get out of it maybe i could pretend to be dead any ideas amy
dont make general geoffrey mad youre a royal knight you better follow his orders
amy youre supposed to help me shes obviously been spending way too much time with you calill
well of course you twit all right makalov its time for you to pay up and go
what but  i think my stomachs acting funny 
thats enough you layabout
oh hi marcia dont surprise me like that
makalov i knew id find you here slacker youre making the whole squad wait for you hurry up and head back
i dont know about all this fighting the imperial army means fighting my old comrades i dont wanna fight my old friends you know what i mean
 i think i see you owe them money dont you isnt that the real reason why you dont want to see them cheese breath
w when did you learn to read minds like the herons
i cant you spineless sea cucumber its just so typical of you that i guessed
marcia please thats quite enough
but astrid its despicable
look at how calm sir makalov is he never gets irritated or upset its the mark of a true knight a good knight must know how to keep his cool on the battlefield
um but  were in a bar
oh i hope to be as good a knight as sir makalov someday how i dream of that day
heh
i dont believe this
 you dont wanna end up like me baby
oh i completely agree whod want to end up a clown haired chowderhead
the love you two have for each other is so wonderful i wish i had a sibling
uh sure 
ill sell him to you cheap
geoffrey please take this with you
why  this is a master crown i am honored your majesty i will cherish it
i have been asking you to fight difficult battles against terrible odds
your majesty allow me to reiterate that is exactly what i wish no matter the task and no matter the odds i can only succeed at it so long as you depend on me i am yours entirely your majesty
i shall take those words to heart geoffrey of delbray you are truly my finest and mot faithful knight
thank you your majesty
here are the war funds remember geoffrey you will face the imperial army should there be a conflict you must not be caught unprepared
i shall be prepared lucia
are you layabouts done collecting supplies we dont have all day
no sir progress is slow these people just dont have much something about an uprising earlier 
fools i dont want excuses take anything you see and if these bumpkins complain at all cut them down because you can bet your armor that senator valtome will do the same to us if were not done by the time he arrives
reporting sir a crimean army is approaching from the southwest it seems to be the royal knights
wh what crimea is moving against us those backwater fools all right keep working ill take several men out to slow their approach colonial fools  ill teach them what it means to defy the empire
general geoffrey weve confirmed the presence of the begnion army in the village ahead of us
i would prefer to avoid a fight but i suppose that decision is up to them lets hurry
crimean soldiers how dare you turn your weapons against us you will pay for this betrayal men burn these shanties to the ground show these fools what we do to traitors
monsters theyre setting the village on fire knights evacuate the villagers and put out the fires immediately
dog of crimea ill crush you
the empire will not forget this  once our main forces arrive they will slaughter you like cattle
i am geoffrey the commander of the crimean royal knights do you command these men
knight of crimea you are clearly guilty of treason against the begnion empire do you understand what it means to send an army against us youve just killed your people
you have been warned queen elincia will not accept any further acts of violence or banditry within our borders withdraw your troops immediately or i cannot guarantee your safe return decide quickly
how dare you take that tone with me ill put you in your place
good the enemys retreating knights stay here and help to fix the damage done to this village
good work geoffrey you sent them running
lucia what are you doing here
im here to protect her majesty
superb work geoffrey you have my thanks
your majesty  forgive me i could not avoid a confrontation with the imperial army
it wasnt your fault geoffrey however im afraid our situation continues to deteriorate lucia i appoint you as envoy to negotiate a treaty with the commander of the imperial army they might be willing to listen now
i shall leave immediately your majesty
senator valtome  i sincerely regret having to meet under these circumstances
oh i completely agree your majesty i never dreamed wed suffer so much mistreatment from our allies so youve decided that crimea will side with gallia and honor the alliance with those filthy sub humans over ours
as ive said before crimea remains neutral crimea will side neither with begnion nor the laguz alliance that is my final answer
ah then please enlighten me  why prevent us from getting what we needed begnion is your suzerain you should be delighted to comply with our request for supplies but instead you launch an ambush and inflict horrible pain on us your loving guardians now begnion is a patient parent but i do hope you realize that your actions thus far have amounted to treason and sedition 
you have violated our borders stolen from my people and inflicted harm upon them i will not allow such actions within my lands no matter who the aggressor may be
how quaint uwee hee hee  your majesty do you know what the penalties are for the crimes youve committed i can only assume you do not or you would not so rashly endanger your life but dont worry queen elincia once begnion has your crown  along with your head  removed for treason im sure we will take very good care of your people
senator valtome
i think after the dust has settled ill place my portrait right over your throne    mmm hmm it was a pleasure chatting with your majesty i am leaving now shes all yours general
your majesty  please forgive my superior officers insolence
wait i recognize you  you came to our aid some time ago during the mad kings war general zelgius wasnt it
yes your majesty this is the second time ive had the honor of seeing you i sincerely apologize for my armys actions during the resupply operation please forgive us
the begnion empire and the apostle gave us much support in our reconstruction effort crimea will always appreciate begnions generosity however  crimea and gallia are allies as such we cannot take a side in this quarrel please understand
 i understand your majesty our forces will refrain from levying supplies while in crimea
oh  thank you for your understanding
however i must ask you to agree on these two points first the imperial army shall be given leave to pass through crimea toward gallia second we shall be allowed to engage the gallian army in towns near the crimea gallia border
excuse me this peace talk is meaningless you will still do battle and spill blood within our borders
im afraid this is the best i can offer its sometimes necessary to cut your losses for the greater good please think on it tomorrow my army will begin marching toward gallia if the crimean army does not interfere i will take it as a sign of agreement farewell your majesty
general zelgius please wait
does the apostle know anything about this war with the laguz
 
its just very hard for me to believe  is this war truly the will of the apostle
 that is not for me to answer your majesty
then at least tell me this is the apostle safe
 excuse me i must go
general 
after elincias meeting with valtome the crimean royal knights return to the capital of melior leaving the border villages between crimea and gallia completely undefended
the begnion central army crosses the border once more but crimea makes no move to march against it valtome sees this inaction as a sign of crimeas capitulation to begnions demands the begnion forces occupy the crimean castles and forts on the border with gallia and prepare to launch their attack
the laguz alliance finally makes its way back to gallia but word of begnions approach allows them no time for rest the news that gallias ally crimea has allowed begnion to travel through its lands comes as a great blow to the laguz alliance
/***EOF***/
felirae mugill and telgam are ours but this war has just started the enemys main force is in sienne the capital the real fight starts now
ah now we fight the big battle my claws itch for beorc flesh hey ranulf are there strong enemies in the capital
there will be plenty before we go we must fight the northern nobles their collective army is massive
by now i imagine the begnion central army is heading our way theyre going to be our real problem
so if were too slow we get caught in the middle
i dont like the sound of this soren do you have a deployment plan worked out
actually why dont you all just relax you might not believe it but we have a plan this time
i see an army of that size would require a massive amount of supplies to be able to sustain itself so the bird tribes will hit the central armys supply unit and slow their advance
exactly the empire fears the bird tribes the shipless pirates theyre called they specialize in surprise attacks and have been raiding begnion merchant ships for years
after they hit the supply unit the bird tribes will head north well meet up with them after we finish off the nobles forces then when the central army arrives well attack them together does that pretty much sum it up
im surprised as laguz strategies go its not bad at all we might even win provided everything goes as planned
tibarn we cant see it yet but begnion is close shouldnt you let your men take a break
yeah  lets land on one of those islands and get some rest
youre full of surprises naesala i never expected you to join the laguz alliance i wish you could be this helpful all the time
tibarn just stop im not interested in your friendship
the hawk tribe and the raven tribe used to live together in phoenicis our tribes were like brothers maybe if you fess up about some of your secrets i might consider helping you out in the future
that doesnt really narrow it down tibarn which secrets are you talking about
how about the secret of how you suddenly became first in line to succeed the throne of kilvas
oh that secret sure no problem ill tell you if we live through this war sound all right to you
sounds fine to me you know this war is going to be vicious but at least our tribes will grow close again
do you actually trust me you might live to regret it
youre trying to protect reyson leanne rafiel and their father king lorazieh isnt that so as long as theyre on our side you wont betray us i think thats enough rest and small talk though lets go
 
so i told him you know i thought it was important
are you sure about this youre always exaggerating stories to make them more impressive
no im deadly serious trust me youd have done exactly the same thing if you were there
oh  i finally found you
oscar  boyd  its been such a long time
eep
how did you find us
shes in here
let go
what are you doing here intruder youre coming with me
no please im not done yet
sigh  please let her go shes a friend of ours
she is you should have said something
 thank you oscar oh that was scary
why did you come here
please you have to let me see him
i do
hes here with you right let me see rolf
uh  why should we
what
you abandoned him you left me dad and rolf for some guy what kind of mom does that huh
i was different back then i was so young  i didnt know how to raise two kids while looking after your bedridden father believe me i tried i tried  but it was too difficult
at least you and i arent related but rolf  thats different hes your son yours and you left him behind because it was too hard
im sorry  ive regretted my decision since the day i made it i thought of you each and every day
my father died not too long after you left him wed have followed him too if my brother hadnt abandoned his knighthood in crimea to take care of us
i  i had no idea  oh  ive made a terrible mistake im so sorry forgive me
leave now youve got no right to see rolf
boyd please im begging you i i want rolf to come back and live with me
lady youve got some serious nerve hes our brother youre not gonna take him away from us
 just wait here ill go get rolf
oscar
oscar thank you
dont get the wrong idea i havent suddenly forgiven you
then why 
because you are still rolfs mother nothing in the world will change that well leave it up to rolf to decide
oscar 
are you sure are you sure you dont want to see her
yeah i dont even remember her face shes just another stranger to me
rolf 
i have my family oscar you boyd everyone in the greil mercenaries i dont need anyone else why should i let her try and change that
 
dont look at me like that why do you look so sad im not sad
then ill ask her to go home
tell her never to come back shes being a nuisance
 fine
rolf 
i  i do love you boyd we fight all the time and we might not be related but youre my real brother dont make me go away you cant i want to stay with you i want to stay with my family
you little idiot of course you can stay we raised you remember youre not some thing to give away to a crazy woman youre one of us
 thanks
general levail how did it go
it was no use no one would even listen to me it makes my heart heavy the nobles are too busy competing with one another for rewards and status to realize the danger to their lands begnion rewards are they crazy the sub humans are at their doors and all they care about is some reward
they only listen to each other no one wants to listen to me
general levail how are we going to survive this
ike are you in position
yeah ready when you are
well leave the troops on the left to you beorc sound good
fine by me well teach these nobles a thing or two
all right move out
what luck enemy comes in tiny numbers get up comrades we cannot let other army take reward crush enemy and gain glory for lord seliora
i am istvan general of lord selioras royal army you leader of sub human filth state your name
im ike of the greil mercenaries
greil mercenaries hm never heard of them you are just small time bandits yes argh if we had left behind dead bodies of sub humans our reward would have been bigger my lord is not being pleased with heads of bandits
oh i wouldnt worry about our heads you have no chance to win this fight leave while you can
w wait  this cannot be our reward 
the enemy general is down let the fleeing soldiers go everyone fall back
hey youre done too that was fast
yeah it was easy work they retreated pretty quickly
their soldiers were well equipped and well trained but their commanders were terrible
thats lucky for us i suppose things seem to be working out pretty well so far unless they bring in a real commander its only a matter of time before they wave a white flag
e enemies to the south its the central army
what
tibarn failed in stalling them  does that mean hes dead
doubtful i dont think there was even a battle the central army has arrived too quickly
grrrr  we only know one thing for sure the enemy now has the advantage
there are still enemies to the north this is quickly turning into our worst case scenario
skrimir we must retreat were in serious trouble here
show my back to beorc never we will fight on like the gallians we are
skrimir listen to me we must retreat this is the central army were talking about
ah finally finally we get to fight the begnion central army i have been waiting for this
i can see you wont change your mind skrimir all right if it has to come to this 
are you joking you cant beat me ranulf you know that
i cant let you or our men die in vain its my job to keep you from doing anything that stupid if i have to knock you out to keep you out of this battle then thats what ill do
fine try
ike stop them
no they need to do this
do not worry about him i might have broken some bones but he will heal quickly
my soldiers we are leaving head back to base camp
general skrimir 
we will return and regroup it pains me but we must damn it ranulf  he got my leg
but youre still willing to carry him
if he doesnt rest and heal all his little chores fall on me i cant have that
reporting sir the laguz alliance is retreating
so the enemy does not persist with the situation turns against them im impressed theyre flexible and adapt quickly to a changing environment
shall we pursue them
no first we will join our allies to the north i hear theyve taken heavy losses
general zelgius its an honor to meet you
general levail of duke gaddoss northern force is it are you in command here
no not i rather  the northern force lacks any order we do not have a central commander to direct us in battle
so each force was fighting the enemy on its own
quite so taking orders from others is beneath the nobles i suppose
how pitiful
a sad state of affairs yes but now that you are here general the situation will be rectified
yes one can hope
 so are the rumors true
ive heard that power in begnion has been split between the apostle and the senators
true they do not agree on how to deal with the laguz alliance however 
as long as there are enemies who threaten the empire we shall fight that is our duty is it not
 indeed
then do not trouble your mind with politics let the nobles worry about their games we should focus on this war
the apostle sanaki empress of the begnion empire does not wish war with the laguz and searches feverishly for a peaceful resolution however many imperial senators see the war not only as a means to expand their own influence but also as a convenient opportunity to exterminate the laguz once and for all these ambitious senators meet with vice minister lekain and vigorously advocate a full scale war
having seen their homeland invaded begnion citizens desiring peace are now few and far between against the apostles wishes begnions army is now fully committed to the war with the laguz
zelgius easily escapes the talons of the bird tribes meant to delay him and the central army he arrives at the sestohl plains to reinforce his weakened allies
the laguz forces are surprised by the sudden appearance of this new enemy and seek counsel from ranulf of gallia ranulf orders a retreat with all speed thus avoiding a full on engagement with the central army
general zelgius chooses not to pursue the fleeing gallian army instead he orders his army to hold position on the eastern banks of the ribahn divided by the river the two armies are deadlocked able to do little more than glare at one another in hatred
so youre ilyana thats such a cute and delicate name id never have guessed thered be such a pretty girl around all these laguz what a lucky day
sigh 
is something wrong ilyana are you feeling sick you look weak
im  so hungry 
oh no thats no good hold on ill bring some food for you right away

um all right i guess that means you eat pretty much anything ill go find somoe dupe who thinks im cute and ill con him into cooking something you stay put
how interesting  heather  her name is heather ill have to remember her name she likes to feed me

glad to see you remember me
of course i remember all of the mercenaries well most of you anyway oscar prepares such delicious meals i remember that well enough oh i cant wait to eat his food again
well i can see you havent changed a bit

nothing in life is free ike suppose you said what she asked you to say hmm what then youd hear it all over the camp in nearby villages eventually the entire country would be saying it ike hero of the mad kings war is in love with aimee the shopgirl rumors can quickly spin out of control
come off it youre exaggerating
ooh dont be so sure with my network of merchants ill spread the word to the four corners of tellius within half a year everyone will know then you will be mine forever ike youll have no choice at all
man you go right for the neck dont you all right soren shes all yours
yes sir what i do now i do for the good of the company

ooh  decisions decisions
youre a diamond and other beorc only glass beads miss aimee ill buy more than enough to justify the discount
half price maybe
a touch less than three quarters then what do you say rose of tellius o goddess of desire
all right you win just this time mind you take this
ah a silver card i can buy everything for half price at all of the shops
thats right remember what i said though its a limited time deal ill have to take it away soon oh and while you own this card you wont be able to sell your weapons as raw material got that
understood miss aimee stay beautiful
/***EOF***/
as far as i can see and ulki can hear it seems were the only ones left
strange i guess only the strongest of us didnt wind up as statues
anyone who was in the building with us was safe too but everyone else was petrified 
wow there are quite a few more of you flesh creatures left than i imagined
thats good maybe that means well stand a chance against her
micaiah are you feeling all right
im not micaiah how many times do i have to tell you that
if youre not micaiah then who are you
im yune pleased to meet you
yune what did you do to micaiah
micaiah is here with me now she knows that youll never save the petrified ones without me so she let me use her body to talk to you
all right let me ask you this yune if you dont have a body of your own what the heck are you
ive been asleep inside the medallion for a long long time longer than any of you can imagine but the galdr woke me up
lehrans medallion are you the dark god who was sealed inside it
hmmm dark god dark god  no im pretty sure im not one of those i am neither holy nor base neither angel nor devil i am freedom chaos transformation future mystery i am yune
i dont care what youre called was it you who turned everyone into stone
no that wasnt me i havent done much of anything i just woke up so i dont have that kind of power just yet that was asheras doing it was her judgment upon this world
nonsense holy ashera would never harm us she protects us at all times and guides us toward the right path
youve got it all wrong little meatling ashera is neither kind nor loving to the beings of this world neither is she holy nor base angel nor devil she is restriction order stability past certainty restraint she is ashera
i dont understand  why would the goddess ashera try to destroy us if anyones going to kill us all shouldnt it be you the dark god who was sealed inside the medallion
you called me a dark god again how would you like it if i called you a dark bag of organs i dont want to talk to you anymore
what
instead ill talk to you yes youre the one ill talk to
me
ashera has always hated me but i like her youve got some of her in you so ill talk to you
oh ok  so  youre yune
thats right im yune ashera is order i am chaos we are sisters but opposite in all things were linked to one another though when i sleep ashera sleeps when i wake ashera wakes
oh then youre a a goddess i im so sorry please forgive my insolence ive been talking down to you like youre a little kid
no no its fine talk to me however you like you dont have to stand on ceremony with me
well  all right if you insist  so you were sealed inside the medallion but now youre inside micaiah
thats right
 and the goddess ashera was the one who turned all the beorc and laguz into stone oh are you here to tell us how to save them wait i get it you were the one who spoke to me you said wake me with the galdr of release not with the spirit of war
yes i did im so glad you understood youre so very clever of course i was hoping by sending you that message i would stop all of this from happening
what do you mean
were running out of time so ill explain quickly long long ago your ancestors made a promise to ashera they promised they would start no wars among all the nations for at least one thousand years if this promise was broken then ashera would destroy the world and try again with a new one despite this promise you bone cages kept fighting each other eventually war and conflict spread throughout the world when ashera woke up she cast down her judgment upon those who failed to keep her promise
i still dont understand why would it make a difference whether you were woken up by the galdr or by the spirit of chaos how were you planning to stop ashera from passing down her judgment
im not talking to you
oh by all thats   would you stop acting like a child
please forgive my brother yune we want to save the people who were turned to stone we need you to tell us how it did matter that we woke you with the galdr of release right
first of all you should understand that because of our link waking me is the same as waking ashera now if ashera had been awakened by the spirit of chaos none of us would be standing here right now by the terms of the promise she was just supposed to destroy the world no hesitation no discussion but if she was awakened by the galdr of release she was supposed to consult with me first she wasnt supposed to pass down her judgment until she heard from me ashera went ahead and turned everyone into stone without asking me thats so unfair ill show her though ill turn them all back somehow the problem is that i cant do this by myself i need your help will you help me
of course well help its strange but i trust you yune and we all want to save the people who got turned to stone
yes well do whatever it takes
thats right we will allow nothing to stand in our way we will fight
its all so confusing  but we must do everything in our power to save the people
 to be honest ive spent my life teaching that the goddess ashera watches over and protects us this is all a little hard to accept
you dont have to believe me you could just let her destroy the world 
no i will do whatever it takes to save the people who were turned to stone i will join the others in helping you
so what youre saying is that we all have to play nice and work together just forget about all thats happened
sothe open your eyes and look around there arent that many people left to fix this mess if you dont help we cant do it besides i would think saving the world is something we could all agree on
youre right commander all of this is the result of our war i guess theres not much reason for flag waving on either side first thing we have to do is unpetrify everyone and well  i uh  im actually kind of relived at least i dont have to worry about fighting you anymore
i wasnt looking forward to that matchup either
its settled then how should we begin i know lets divide the army into three teams im pretty sure that ashera is going to notice what were up to 
dividing us up is smart it reduces the risk of everyone getting killed at once
we have to hurry i can feel asheras power building
its all over if we get turned to stone too all right everyone its up to us
whats your name
im ike
all right ike you wont call me a dark god ever again will you
not if you dont like it can i call you yune
i would like that i guess i forgive you then oh i know as a sign of my forgiveness ill make sure that you can get to your destination safely i cant do it for everyone because its a bit exhausting for me but  hold still and close your eyes

wow youre very confident for a being that can die lets see  you go with this team
im going with you im not leaving your  micaiahs  side
 fine micaiah says thats what she wants too
let me talk to her
not right now youll have plenty of time to talk on the road all right  hey youre with this team over here
 damn it
each team will take a different route but your destination is the same its the tower of guidance that stands in the middle of the land you named begnion go there at once  i hope to see you all there ill be waiting
waiting arent you coming with us
ill see you at the tower
a bird
yune then she must be  
micaiah
 oh hello sothe
youre back i was so worried
hey if that bird was yune where did she go
i dont know where exactly but she said she must go look for something
leaving us by ourselves whats she thinking
at least we know what we have to do lets move out for the tower
may i have a moment before we leave prince kurth has requested that i pass these out to the herons
those are sending stones right
correct fortunately for us each heron has been assigned to a different team
king tibarn would you give this one to prince reyson
thats ideal we can each communicate with the other teams using the stones good idea
queen nailah please give this one to prince rafiel
i will
and the last one is for princess leanne
shes on my team ill give it to her
all right were ready to go see you at the tower
yeah see you at the tower  hopefully
ike
since were on different teams i need to tell you something before we go something important its general zelgius next time you see him ike use caution hes your enemy
what do you mean
hes the one hes the black knight
what
zelgius is the black knight i became certain of it when we crossed the river
it cant be 
i wasnt going to tell you until i had hard proof but it looks like were out of time sorry i didnt tell you before
general zelgius is the one who killed my father
i doubt that zelgius has been turned to stone be careful ike you might run into him  good luck to you
zelgius  the black knight 
ashera the goddess of order has awakened her righteous fury has turned nearly all of the warring soldiers to stone
yune the goddess of chaos has also awakened freed from lehrans medallion she counsels ike and his companions to split into three groups and make for the tower of guidance
micaiah is joined by her constant companion sothe general skrimir also accompanies her along with naesala and princess leanne apostle sanaki rounds out the group traveling with her chief bodyguard sigrun and others
micaiahs company decides on a southern route and sets out for begnion save for the sounds of the local wildlife their path is eerily silent and empty its as though they have stepped into a vast and desolate monument to the war
blessed servants of the goddess i bring dire news the dark god has awakened and made its wrath manifest in stone all of us were turned to hard rock by its evil power yet we stand here today made flesh again by the power of the goddess why is that it is because ware the chosen ones go forth disciples of order deliver her divine judgment upon the dark god and those who worship it
all right everyone lets spend the night in this town please be sure to get some rest and prepare for tomorrow
excuse me
oh its you
i saw you having an argument with general skrimir
oh that yeah that happens sometimes
i know you had no choice but to betray the laguz alliance if you wish i can speak to him about it
no stay out of it whatever the circumstances what i did was unacceptable the pieces can fall where they may
youd carry the burden of your crime alone to protect your people thats very selfless of you
of course id take the blame my first priority is my people as long as theyre safe it doesnt matter one whit what the rest of the world thinks of me
you indeed are a good king to your people i have no doubts of that i wonder will the history say i was a good empress for begnion
the people of begnion rose up and overthrew the senate for you isnt that proof enough that youre a good empress
thats only because they thought that i was the apostle but now 
youre worried over the galdr of release
yes that song  it can only be sung by the direct descendents of altina  the first settlers of begnion why was that girl able to sing it moreover why couldnt i
you know you could just ask her directly
i cant work up the courage it doesnt matter who she is all i know is that she possesses all the powers which i lack im  im frightened of the truth
sothe wake everyone and have them gather at the square enemies are on the way
wha  huh all right im on it
lady micaiah has the enemy arrived already
not yet but theyre coming im sure of it
i cant smell troops or weapons how can you be certain
i dont know who they are or their exact numbers but the enemy army is massive
hmm 
l know it sounds strange but i swear its true you must believe me
no one doubts your gift micaiah i will not ignore the words of one who has spoken with the voice of a goddess
oh 
micaiah it looks like you were right we have guests
leave them to me the weak among you should hide for the battle will be fierce
empress sanaki we should leave the fighting to general skrimir i will take you someplace safe
no i will stay and fight with the others
with all due respect empress i cannot allow it what if you are injured
if micaiah an untrained girl from the streets of daein is fighting then i shall stand my ground as well
empress 
you cant win an argument with royalty but dont worry about her ill look after the apostle
that is a kind offer but i must decline it is the first and most sacred duty of the holy knights to protect the apostle
it looks like the enemy is about to take this argument out of our hands theyre here
do you beorc ever stop talking take your positions now
here are the minions of the dark god go forth disciples and deliver the holy judgment of the goddess destroy them
you all of you you are all begnion citizens im so relieved you are all safe
sanaki be careful i dont know that theyre going to be pleased to see you
what do you  
minions of the dark god we are the disciples of order led by blessed lord lekain we have been charged by the goddess ashera to cleanse your taint from the world
death to the tainted souls let none escape
empress sanaki please stay back these traitors must have sided with the senate during the coup
apostle sanaki is a fraud any apostle who defies the edicts of the goddess is an enemy to the people
what no i  
silence betrayers of the empire how dare you accuse the empress treason can only be punished by death
die die
how could this have happened how could betrayers of the goddesss word defeat her appointed champions
death to the false apostle show her the punishment for her wicked deceitful acts
i i have not deceived you i am the true  i am the true apostle 
you are the dark god made flesh the source of all evil
dont speak that way about yune she is not a dark god
death to the filthy sub humans despicable rabid beasts
yes feed my rage make me hate you give me reason to crush your bones in my jaws 
black winged demon eater of carrion prepare to receive the goddesss judgment
hmm how colorful
the dark god breeds foul corruption through the words of its false apostle her soul is a blackened withered husk and we shall banish it from this world
as long as i draw breath you will not lay hands on apostle sanaki
traitorous knight of the false apostle prepare to be cleansed
oathbreakers you are servants of the empire and the apostle the holy knights will teach you the meaning of loyalty
hmph they were strong for beorc has the senate held back its elite forces
no i knew a few of them by face some of these soldiers were new recruits i cant imagine how they could have fought against us so fiercely
simple they were protected by ashera
i sent a message to micaiah about the impending attack then returned here as fast as i could ashera freed the petrified soldiers who would pledge loyalty to her by themselves they werent a threat to skin puppets as strong as you so she blessed their armor and weapons now they are worthy to be her true disciples and their power will be stronger as we get closer to her the battle will only get more difficult from here
their weapons and armor are blessed by the goddess herself
is that similar to the black knights armor or ikes sword ragnell
its the same idea yes the disciples blessings were much weaker because there were a lot of them still it makes them a lot more powerful than they originally were id like to bless you all with protection too but i havent been awake long enough to wield that kind of power sorry about that
ahhh that was how they were able to stand against us
poor souls  when they were turned back from stone they probably thought they were the chosen ones or something no one is good enough for her though when shes done using them against us theyll all be stone creatures again
micaiah there you are
oh its her shadow again i should go all right everyone ill see you later good luck
micaiah
unh  what
hey glad to have you back we should tell the other teams what happened here
hm
i am going back to sleep i dislike being awakened so early in the morning even if it is for battle
yune was here again i dont like that she keeps taking over your body she should stick to being that stupid bird
please dont say mean things about her shes like an older sister to me
your older sister is a dark god
i finally understand now remember the voice that used to warn me about impending danger that was yunes voice i finally realized it this morning even as she slept she watched over us yune loves beorc and laguz with all her heart i can feel it when she speaks through me
then why do people call her the dark god
i dont know  but she doesnt like that name it hurts her when you call her that
sorry  i wont call her that again
you mean it then i forgive you
 hey is that you yune
sorry  i wont call her that again why cant you be that nice with me to be honest it makes me a little jealous but thats all right i guess i know that micaiah needs you thats why i cant let you die here come closer to me
 hey what are you doing
dont be so jumpy im giving you the power to protect micaiah
wow amazing  i feel incredible like i could arm wrestle skrimir
good  always stay by micaiahs side
yune
no its me again disappointed
never but i do wish she had at least let me thank her
it just would have embarrassed her you know you two are very much alike youre both very stubborn
 
im just teasing you sothe anyway did you hear what the enemy said before the battle
yeah  they called out lekain by name no mistake about it that means hes still alive and probably not petrified since they said he was their leader i suppose well run across him once we get closer to the tower thatll be our big chance
right we must break the blood pact no matter what it takes of course our first goal is to save everyone from the goddesss judgment but we have to break the pact while theyre all stone if we dont we may save the world but still lose daein
 we seem to have missed our chance to speak with her what a remarkable girl lady micaiah can hear the voice of the goddess yune and learn of impending danger she is much like you empress sanaki
 let us head back
are you sure you said before that it was imperative you speak with lady micaiah 
its not important forget it
empress 
ikes route leads his group to the west he is accompanied by his old comrades deputy commander titania and master tactician soren also with him are nailah queen of hatari the heron prince rafiel prince kurthnaga of goldoa and his loyal subject ena having received a warning from micaiah about the disciples of order ike and company stay alert and wary as they cross into seliora
ahh 
whats wrong micaiah are you still tired
no im fine the air is nice out here its calm quiet even i dont remember the last time it was this quiet its almost relaxing isnt it i hate to say it but i feel like the world is back to the way it ought to be finally i know that sounds horrible but thats how i honestly feel like all debts have been settled and everything is properly arranged
hmm i think i understand what youre trying to say
sothe  im scared i dont want to get used to this its too comfortable like our mothers come home
a mother whod smother her children in order to protect them
hello muston i would like to purchase some weapons
ah micaiah good timing
you have something for me then
indeed i do missy look at this
thats a thunder tome the most powerful of its kind too how did you get it
thats a trade secret but its the best thing i ever acquired for sale and thats a fact
how much are you asking for it
you want it
yes yune told me that the goddess ashera would do everything in her power to stop us i have no idea what to expect but im certain the battle ahead wont be easy we have to be prepared for anything
i know you can have it for free
what but why
its not like we have any other customers everyone else has been turned to stone listen micaiah i still have hope we have your goddess and an army of heroes on our side i believe in you  all of you youll put the world right again im sure of it
i believe that too thank you muston with your tome in my hand and your hope in my heart im sure well succeed
good luck maiden of dawn
hmmm  im confused
is something wrong general skrimir
here look at this
its a satori sign what about it
i found a patch of ground that was emitting light so i started digging this was what i found
oh so thats it 
you buried it
no but i saw a vision in a dream rays of light fell from the sky wriggling into the ground and burying themselves
ah so maybe there are more
yes  i think so somewhere 
/***EOF***/
we have to go back to the desert we still have something we need to do
itd be great if it were to find ashnards son im burning up out here
im not sure what it is i see a lot of images stacked on top of each other its hard to see what they all are theres danger battles and terrible sadness but also hope whatever our destiny is i know well find it in the desert lets go
i understand micaiah ill tell everyone to make ready
weve already been north where we met prince rafiel and his party that leaves east or south  which way
what is it volug is something wrong volug says he senses beorc to the south a lot of beorc
that settles it then well head south
hmph
impressive as ever general tauroneo however we cant hold out forever we are seriously outnumbered its time we put these vermin in their place are you ready jill
just give the word
all right then lets get em
who could the begnion soldiers be attacking out here in the middle of nowhere
whoever it is we have to help them
wait a moment those people fighting the begnion soldiers  it couldnt be  that white armor  only certain generals were allowed to wear it i may very well know that soldier micaiah really well then all the more reason to help them lets hurry
really well then all the more reason to help them lets hurry
ah 
ilyana its been a while
too long zihark 
so you remember my name
how could i forget you zihark why i think of you often you treated me to food glorious food  on 23 separate occasions but whos counting
apparently you are and now might i request something in return
well um yes what exactly did you have in mind
for you something sweet you join our merry band and together we fight for daeins freedom im counting on you my dear you wouldnt want to disappoint me would you
 ah er  what
hey jill jill fizzart it is you isnt it
sothe
havent seen you since the war ended
that does bring back memories  what are you doing out here in the middle of nowhere
we heard that king ashnards orphan was in need of soldiers we came to find out if its true
the prince hes just inside the fort
then its true
it is will you help us protect him
of course
general tauroneo
well if it isnt our little sothe id never have thought to see you here
general these ruins youre defending  do they hold hope for daein
they do in fact these walls hold what may well be daeins only hope
i see then we must protect this place at all costs
indeed
need a hand
sothe where did you come from what are you doing here
hello zihark i see youre fighting begnion soldiers i assume youre siding with daein here
thats right this is my homeland these are my people
oh really i didnt know you were from daein
yep im a daein through and through
all that time we fought together and i never knew
thats because i never told you at any rate lets rejoin the fight we can talk later
ah yes 
youre a tenacious bunch ill grant you daein isnt known for winning its wars  so why do you keep trying
absurd  one must not meet failure against the tattered remnants of a conquered coun try 
come to help the helpless a dainty little flower like you is hardly worth the effort well do your worst
what is begnion doing out here in the desert is there something or someone in these ruins that youre interested in
thats none of your business little girl well slash our way in no matter what anybody else wants
general tauroneo zihark and jill too i havent seen you since the war ended three years ago who wouldve thought wed meet again in such a desolate place
sothe youve grown i hardly recognized you
we have a lot of catching up to do but for now ill just make introductions this is micaiah 
and who have we here hmmm
step back who are you
lord izuka theres no need for concern this young man is sothe we know him well sothe may i introduce lord izuka he is advisor and close confidant to prince pelleas ashnards son
micaiah did you hear that the prince is here still i cant believe we ran into you three  of all people  guarding the prince what a lucky coincidence general tauroneo we came here because we heard the prince was gathering forces in the desert we want to help you in your efforts will you let us join you
certainly daein needs all the courage we can muster let us join forces
see here what do you think youre doing you cant just ignore me and start making decisions these people are suspicious verrry suspicious youre all begnion spies arent you come now tell the truth
were the dawn brigade wed never work for those filthy curs
the dawn brigade but how then perhaps the girl  no could it be are you the silver haired maiden do you have the healing touch of sacrifice
excuse me
take your hands off her
what a coincidence or is it fate or maybe its my unrivaled skill as a revolutionary organizer with the silver haired maiden at our side well surely win over the people of daein and then yes incite scattered rebel movements mm hm and then further the future of change 
is he touched in the head
oh my but yes ill beckon to no demand that the vicious scalawags surrender perfect i am a genius come come my dear maiden you must meet the prince
goddess help me that man could try the patience of a stone
hmmm 
look here before you stands the one and only the grand prince pelleas true blooded son of the king of daein and here we have the consort and queen of our late king ashnard lady almedha and look at you youre standing did the desert dry out your brains kneel ye before these royal personages
its all right izuka please dont stand on ceremony i didnt know i was a prince until very recently so really im not used to any of this
what do you mean
until a half year ago  that is until izuka found me  i was raised as a normal commoner to be frank it still doesnt feel real to me that i i myself could be the son of king ashnard its a little overwhelming
dont talk nonsense darling you are my own sweet sweet son prince pelleas yes  ill never let you be parted from me no never ever again 
ahem enough of the pleasantries then shall we get down to business well then micaiah of the dawn brigade i henceforth appoint thee to the post of vice general of the daein liberation army
excuse me what do you mean by that
wait a moment i appreciate the offer izuka but im afraid i cannot accept i have no war experience and no knowledge of battle tactics daein needs a general with both
are you not a member of the heroic dawn brigade whose conquests precede them do you not want to save the people of daein serve the prince and you can step out of the shadows and face the empire boldly without shame why hesitate
this is a thinly veiled scheme and i see right through it you just want micaiah to serve as a figurehead for your revolution
is that a problem
yes thats a problem shes not some fancy stoneware for you to set on display if youre going to do this then i cannot sign on
exactly
micaiah please wait that isnt what we meant youre not the only one who knows nothing about battle i dont either but if i dont act the devastation of daein will grow ever worse so i have to be brave please im asking you to do the same micaiah  for the sake of the future of daein will you join our cause
 prince pelleas i will
micaiah
thank you
and in return will you ensure beyond a shadow of a doubt that daein will be freed from the rule of the begnion empire
i promise
i trust in your word
i cant believe you
sothe why are you so angry about this
you have to ask you know we cant live in the public eye doing something that will deliberately make you stand out  im just saying it isnt like you micaiah
when we were separated during the war you changed sothe and i changed too i want to protect daein more than anything our people must be saved and if i can help in that effort i will
so much so that youll risk your life and sacrifice who you are
yes but that isnt all prince pelleas cherishes the same wish that i do i can feel it deep in his heart he wants to save daein if we work together i know that we can do it
and you dont hear that voice we spoke of the voice that warns you of impending danger
its all right sothe the visions i see spreading out before us  most of them shine with hope
all right i trust you more importantly i believe in you i wont resist anymore but let me just say one thing
what
i will protect you
i know that why do you think you need to say it
i just wanted to make sure you knew
 thank you sothe
three years past daein mustered all of its formidable military might and cut a bloody swath through neighboring crimea in a sudden invasion daein was defeated however and the dreams of its ruler mad king ashnard died with him
ashnards son pelleas possesses a gentle sincerity that is a bright counterpoint to his late fathers violence and duplicity ill suited though he seems for these troubled times his presence is a welcome sight of micaiahs eyes pelleas declared rightful heir to the throne finds his name becoming a rallying cry for daein at his side is the only person he believes can lead his liberation army the silver haired maiden
hey micaiah i sold the treasures we took from the ruins we have traveling cash now
how did we do
we have 10000 in gold
great thatll help a lot
maybe we could use more
sothe 10000 is plenty we just need enough money to live on more than that and the soul becomes impoverished
i know i know we should be rich of heart and poor of pocket  me i just follow your orders
so youre returning to the desert
yes we must go back
my dear 
yes rafiel i know micaiah i have a question how can we help you in this fight
what but 
i know you probably dont want to be seen with laguz but we cannot just sit on our paws so to speak while our allies are in danger
i appreciate that but 
no fine sorry to bother you
no no its not what you think please dont apologize its just that 
what is it volug
 
i see that is a good idea
oh yes i agree thats a wonderful idea
yes volug whats going on
micaiah it will not seem so strange if you travel into the desert with this dog at your side will it
what
as you know we laguz fight only in our shifted forms however we cant remain in that state for very long it is too exhausting volug however has halfshifted when he does this he can remain in beast form all day long
queen nailah i appreciate you help–
he is not as strong in this transitional form even so he is still more than a match for any beorc
how could you call volug a dog
i know hes not as friendly as a dog and i dont know if hes housebroken but he can fight
that is not what i meant
micaiah we wish you good luck volug guard her well
do be careful
i will thank you volug is she always so blunt
so you are an old friend of lauras
yes im afraid i must apologize for my poor choice in employers
please dont worry about it after all you saved us
when i saw laura i simply couldnt stand by any longer
thank you aran
ive been meaning to ask you laura whats become of your church id heard that since the occupation most of daeins clergy have been excommunicated and sent to prisons i know that the empire sent its own replacements was your church affected
no thankfully our congregation would always say  the clergy of the empire wouldnt even consider coming to a dingy church in a backwater village like this youre been spared minister ha ha ha  we extended our prayer time to thank the goddess for saving our church
ah  i see
oh aran i meant to tell you now that youre one of us youll have to become a bandit
excuse me
im sorry a bandit
theres really no need to worry the dawn brigade bandits have virtuous people like micaiah in their ranks
er  okaaaay 
no were not ban  
but always remember aran we must strive above all else to be honorable bandits for the future of daein
uh  all right 
 bandits
oh man  where is this prince anyway i wanna go home to nevassa
a long lost prince of daein who even knows if he really exists 
of course he does
how do you know do you have any proof
simple micaiah told us we should look for the prince so its gotta be true
yeah youre right her farsight is always spot on
even if we dont find him theres no need to worry  cause im here
excuse me
since we left nevassa my swordsmanship has pretty much improved tenfold by the time we get back home ill be invincible ill kick those tyrants out of daein with my own two hands and one sharp blade
its great to have a dream edward but you should wake up now
are you saying im not good enough
no im saying theres a limit to how much one person can achieve im going to do the best i can but  it doesnt matter how strong the two of us become we cant change whats going on in daein not by ourselves
well duh im just saying its a goal you know just something to work toward
sure but you shouldnt say such things lightly it might be just a joke to you its not to me
wow sorry
ya well so am i i didnt mean to get so serious all the fighting it just gets to me sometimes
hey boys what is this a funeral whats with all the doom and gloom
nolan
i couldnt help but overhear and i have a little to say on the subject youre right each of us can only achieve so much on our own but you boys are still young dont let go of your hopes and dreams not yet anyway
but 
listen theres no way we can free daein by ourselves but we can find king ashnards lost son and fight against the empire under daeins banner if we gather our strength we stand a better chance of freeing our motherland now then hows that for a little motivation to get your sorry backsides into training harder
thats great thanks nolan youre pretty smart for an old man
hey now  none of that or ill show you what an old man can do leonardo are you feeling better
yes sir thank you nolan i guess age does make you wiser
how old do you think i am anyway now im getting depressed 
/***EOF***/
begnion is attacking nevassa
no my parents live there theyre far too old and frail to defend themselves
my wife and kids are there too its that heartless murderer jarod  he just wants us to suffer to the bitter end
prince pelleas we have to do something we must liberate nevassa and save the people form this brutal attack
is there no end to your lunacy the apostles envoy is nearly here why be rash when victory is so close
people are dying and nevassa has already suffered more than enough do you really expect us not to lift a finger to help
if you will not help we will go by ourselves again
wait where are you going you cant take the laguz and rush off on some harebrained mission again
cant i
of course not you idiot girl youve already been far too impulsive acting without the princes consent and do you think i do not see what has happened your name has been raised to lavish heights among the daein people  your name and yours alone why even our own soldiers heap their praise on you like sugar on berries sparing not a thought for their prince
oh 
hah the prince hes a sham a travesty a clod of mud no amount of polishing could shine the real jewel  whose radiance attracts the people like moths to flame  is you priestess and so i shall steal you and extinguish daeins light of hope
and then even once their rightful king is crowned the people will still await the approval of their precious priestess of dawn why if we are not careful some calculating wretches might decide they would rather see a priestess on the throne instead of a king and once again this country will be torn apart all because of your glory hounding disregard for our princes command
please izuka 
come to think of it perhaps our priestess here has been planning this all along pretending to help the prince when in truth she seeks to wear the crown herself
stop your tongue worm or my knife will stop it for you the only one who seems too hungry for power here is you  
thats enough
izuka micaiah does not deserve any such attack on her character she is pure and noble and i  i am inadequate
have her actions poisoned your mind too my prince
since we met micaiah has led every battle even joining the soldiers on the battlefield not so with me i cannot defend my people how could our people not rally around her they see her fighting throwing her lot in with their own they respect her that said things cannot remain as they are izuka is right to worry about my standing i need to earn my peoples respect therefore  therefore i must take action
um  soldiers of the liberation army heed my   no no  hear my words i am pelleas true prince of daein
yes we know who you are milord we ought to by now
and so uh  so   
 is he all right
 prince 
sir knight
 and so   and so beloved friends and comrades dear with thanks to you our capital lies close and if we do not act if we turn back the war still ends with us the victors proud and daeins rule still falls back to our hands and if we choose to fight and free this town we may enrage the empire once again thus daeins fortune turns to sorrow swift but while i speak nevassas hardship grows our brothers suffer our sisters die and  i shall not  i  i cannot ignore this tragedy no man can and certainly no prince  i cannot look away when my people suffer and so i ask  i ask you all please will you join me
long live the prince
long live prince pelleas
long live daein its time to save our country
ah 
very well my prince we are at your service
my army is arrayed and waiting be well and no overly heroic risks please
company at attention our objective is to save the town and take the keep now move out
the rebels are on the move
mm and a good thing too what is more honorable than a death fraught with purpose
i wonder where jarod is
listen up all of you this is our last chance to die as weve lived as proud soldiers of the empire if we survive this fight imprisonment and a hushed up execution await us if we run from this fight dishonor and pursuit will dog our miserable days so i say lets give those daein curs a fight to remember and let the glory of our deaths light our way weve lived as proud soldiers of the empire let us die as proud soldiers of the empire now go
that shout thats jarod for daeins sake this time i swear i will put an end to him
maiden take no risks upon yourself you are the heart of this army the soul that inspires us we must not lose you leave this battle to me and stay back
thank you for your concern sir knight but i am going to fight you and everyone else are putting your lives on the line i will not shirk my duty
you are much like her
what
 nothing
 
pardon sir knight i wanted to thank you thank you for fighting beside us
no thanks are needed i do nothing more than fulfill my duty
when our fighting is done will you remain in daein
 
never mind its none of my business its only  if you were here with us we could take heart in  
i may take leave of daein
oh but why
more than this i cannot say forgive me
 
 
 what do you want
 
why are you trying to get close to micaiah
so that i might protect her
i protect her
as things stand i simply cannot entrust her safety to you
what is that supposed to mean
if you hope to protect her become stronger strong enough to surpass me and stronger still
what what could he mean 
so you have the audacity to approach me at last dont expect an easy fight before i die i will see each of you dead before me
so sub human the slave turns on the master ill teach you to know your betters
youre one arent you one of those odd sub humans that witch brought  youll make a nice rug
well well well look what we have here the loathsome phantom of old daein  why in blazes are you here what inspired you to slooooowly clank your way up out of your grave
my purpose is not for you to know
oh i feel so rejected must i crack that helm open and ask your ugly naked face directly i have to take vengeance for alders death after all
this is how you meet your death sad come at me then and join your friend
that face i remember you the kid whos always with that little wench
sothe of the dawn brigade
the dawn brigade hm oh how i despise your ilk the thought of draining the life from your body  it makes me tingle all over
ditto
so its you little girl
general jarod the battle is over surely you can see it you never believed daein could do it did you but here you stand broken defeated by my countrymen and friends
have i really i wonder didnt i tell you with you dead there is no liberation army this is my golden opportunity  one blow is all it takes to turn defeat to victory such a lovely thought
i will not lose to you more importantly the people of daein will not lose to you
gh ghuahh  i am sorry for nothing i regret nothing because i did it my way  you win priestess you must be delighted enjoy it while you can  because sooner or later you 
we won weve taken back our country daein is under our control once again
thank you micaiah  thanks to you the kingdom of daein lives again
i didnt do it alone we did it  everyone fighting together
well you didnt hurt the effort id hazard a guess that daeins reconstruction would have only been a dream without you i regret i have no other way to show my gratitude but  i want to officially name you supreme commander of the armies of daein
 i see and i accept it is with great honor that i assume this office this battle may be over but the fight to return daein to its former glory will take time and effort if my support can be of service then i am honored to assist
im glad well then ill perform the simple ceremony  will you kneel in the name of the king of daein i dub thee micaiah supreme commander of daein and grant thee the authority and responsibility pertaining thereto
 it feels odd
you wear it well wont you join me as i champion daein to a great new era im counting on you
i will
are you really leaving already stay at least for the feast tonight youve done so much you deserve some celebration nothing i can say will convince you to break bread with lord izuka
well there is that but honestly  if we stick around too long the soldiers are gonna start giving us dirty looks its kind of awkward
what do you mean
most daeins still loathe laguz getting rid of that hatred  lets just say you have your work cut out for you look we dont want to ruin everyones party its been great but well just quietly slip away
thats terrible i cant believe i never noticed tormod im so sorry
ah dont cry i hate it when girls cry
um take care of yourselves its you know good that you came to help us so um  thanks
whoa youre thanking me better get ahold of yourself sothe youre gonna make me get all weepy
you little 
muarim before you go  i just want to thank you thank you for not telling anyone about my brand
no thanks are needed its rude of me to ask but do you know anything about the circumstances of your birth
no i know nothing of my parents but just before she died the old woman who raised me told me what the brand was and what it meant
this is proof that the blood of both beorc and laguz course through me and so i am anathema to both she told me never to let anyone see it and to be always on my guard
wise advice 
ive avoided people most of my life to conceal my brand and my powers but theres no way to hide how very slowly i age i just keep moving through daein the same holds true now  i wont be able to stay in this army long
even so  as long as little sothe is by your side i think that you can overcome any difficulty
yes  just as you have tormod
yes
muarim boss i know you dont want to go but at this rate well be standing here all night
vika my thanks go to you too sothe and i will visit you in the desert
ill be there but i wont be waiting waiting for people who never come is hard
vika i said ill come and i will
 ok then
micaiah sothe were going with them
what arent you going to gallia
yeah were taking them cmon neither of you can leave daein for a little while right dont worry we can handle it
once the battle ended it seemed time to move on im sorry to change our plans but this is better for all of us
thats awful  i cant believe youre all leaving us at once
micaiah  fate brought us together you and i guided by the same voice our paths are fated to cross again someday  i am sure of it
im embarrassed  i didnt mean to cry  its been so nice meeting you all 
til next time cause i know well meet again
what was that sound
volug lady nailah  did she send you back to guard me volug
ridiculous  as if you didnt already have that annoying bird 
ouch ow ow ow ow i take it back
sothe we freed our country from tyranny together but its not over yet well have to work hard for a long time to return daein to its former grandeur i know it wont be easy but if i have you two with me i know we can do it
lady micaiah im sorry to bother you while you prepare for battle may i have a word with you
of course what can i help you with
if my memory serves me correctly you always use this type of tome correct
yes thats right
oh im glad i remembered correctly then please take this
for me are you sure
its a token of appreciation for letting me  and marado  join your army
were lucky to have you and thank you ill use this tome well
listening to prince pelleass speech earlier im certain that daein will exist anew it will be a greater and more unified country than ever before
i agree so many things have happened along the way but i am glad to be here now i feel happy and very proud
i feel the same way and im sure all the soldiers of the liberation army do as well daein will soon be free  lady micaiah please lead us to victory
 yes together we shall see victory
volug where   how did you get this
i got it from the ruins in the desert
from the ruins of the desert oh you got it when we were there before
no not quite
no then  how when
you should keep it
what its for me
i will catch up to you later
wait volug did he go back to the desert just to get this 
/***EOF***/
are we going the right way
yes ashera is at the top were going up this is definitely the right way
im a little disoriented because this is much bigger than it looks from outside its not my imagination is it
to be honest you probably shouldnt look around too carefully true miracles can overwhelm and terrify mortal minds if you dwell on what you see here you might stop climbing
really
yes really well for most people anyway youre all the exceptions you are all focused on your one goal and you cant die until you achieve it thats what you think right
yes
desire propels people forward thats how its been since the beginning of your kind you hope take give kill struggle  out of all those needs and desires hate and strife are born and thats all right you should want you should strive to fill that want you should challenge your fates when all else fails you can still die fighting
your philosophy is pretty extreme too ashera doesnt forgive people for their imperfections but you embrace both the good and evil natures of people you seem to enjoy our internal struggles
a straight road is boring defeat and destruction are far more interesting than stasis
huh is there a goddess who takes a middle of the road approach
well long ago  wait stop everyone we need to talk the next one who stands in our way is someone deeply tied to you
 lets go
youve come welcome son of gawain welcome all courageous warriors
 
i wonder how i didnt notice your composure bearing voice  it seems obvious in retrospect
 
i wish id had the chance to fight you or see you fight general then i wouldve known a lot sooner
unfortunately for both of us that opportunity never came
so it really is you the black knight  no general zelgius
ike i have long looked forward to the day we would fight again now that it is here let us not delay any longer raise your sword and begin
lets finish this
stop right there ive got a debt to settle with this scum
true your revenge against me remains incomplete however may i ask you to step aside for now though at different times ike and i both learned the way of the sword from the same master one of daeins famous four riders general gawain he left daein under an assumed name and formed a mercenary company
i was entranced by greils swordsmanship while he was in daein i studied under him i fought next to him  i idolized him when he left i was crushed i vowed to find him again and challenge him to  duel i had to know if i had surpassed him three years ago i caught up to greil i challenged him to a duel and was victorious but something was wrong  the fight had been too simple i thought id never feel satisfaction again then ike told me why it had been so easy greil had severed all the tendons in his right hand and swore never again to draw a blade can you imagine my joy at the news i knew that a swordsman of his stature couldnt have been so easy to defeat
my masters skills were passed down to his son ike i will defeat him and finally surpass my master i trust that you understand once our fight is finished i will allow you to settle your quarrel hawk king
please tibarn
 fine if youre taking my place youd better win got that
of course this is my chance to avenge my fathers death this time he wont walk away
let us begin
i wont allow anyone to interfere with our fight
agreed its better this way i can focus on you
no draw no escape one wins one loses we shall end this one of us will live 
and one of us will die
im ready good bye general zelgius
face me in an honorable duel and know that i shall be the one to take your life
why do you avoid eye contact am i not a worthy enemy
attacking a defenseless man goes against the code of chivalry please stay back man of serenes
do not insult me
i know you  you were a general in the gaddos army did zelgius betray sephiran and side with the senate
no no i swear upon the generals good name that he would do no such thing i was the one who abandoned the duke of gaddos to follow general zelgius
what is going on here i dont understand the relationship between the black knight and the senate or who is friend or foe 
of one thing i am certain empress sanaki we are not your enemy z sanaki then order your men to stand down i must speak with zelgius take down that barrier
i cannot do that general zelgius was very clear he wishes to fight that man alone my orders are to eliminate any intruders inside the tower in the meantime my deepest apologies empress
wait i wont allow it halt levail halt
you must be the silver haired maiden micaiah correct
who are you
dont worry ive no intention of harming you far from it in fact im under orders from general zelgius to keep my men away from you please retreat i dont want to disobey the general
captain haar you are still alive
what happened that you didnt expect me to survive
um  nothing i suppose its just that its been a while since you left begnion
yeah twenty years ago wasnt it
i was still very young at the time you had just been dubbed a knight oh it brings back such memories  the bravery of the dracoknights especially the fizzart platoon it was legendary among the soldiers but then you suddenly defected to daein
i got sick of taking orders from corrupt senators so i ditched the country with general shiharam
i joined the army after i came of age but it was different after you all left it was as if you took its spirit with you the only exception was general zelgius the general of duke persiss army
i see is that why youre under his command
yes he is the last true knight i will die for him
yes levail you will
how i dreamed of fighting a proper foe i am honored sir haar have at you
 it seems as though you have been avoiding me since this battle began what is the meaning of this
attacking a defenseless man goes against the code of chivalry please stay back man of serenes
 
um  you  keep  run away  from me why
attacking a defenseless woman goes against the code of chivalry please stay back woman of serenes
what but 
general zelgius  id hoped to fight for you a while longer 
face me in an honorable duel and know that i shall be the one to take your life
captain haar you are still alive
what happened that you didnt expect me to survive
um  nothing i suppose its just that its been a while since you left begnion
yeah twenty years ago wasnt it
i was still very young at the time you had just been dubbed a knight oh it brings back such memories  the bravery of the dracoknights especially the fizzart platoon it was legendary among the soldiers but then you suddenly defected to daein
i got sick of taking orders from corrupt senators so i ditched the country with general shiharam
i joined the army after i came of age but it was different after you all left it was as if you took its spirit with you the only exception was general zelgius the general of duke persiss army
i see is that why youre under his command
yes he is the last true knight i will die for him
yes levail you will
how i dreamed of fighting a proper foe i am honored sir haar have at you
sir levail you stand against empress sanaki lay down your weapons
i cannot lady sigrun as strong as your loyalty is for the apostle so is mine for general zelgius
sir levail how dare you raise your sword against empress sanaki has goddess ashera taken over your mind too
no lady tanith i fight for general zelgius i care not for the goddesss cause
lady astrid please stand down a lady like you shouldnt have taken up a weapon in the first place
no i am a knight of crimea here to fight you please forget about the past the lady astrid you knew no longer exists
you have indeed become strong very well prepare yourself
duke tanas i thought you were executed as a slave trader three years ago
true beauty is immortal look at me right now i am flawless you are not without potential with education you could aspire to be me
 no thank you
lets see how you handle this
impressive most impressive
ugh hahh
you are stronger much stronger than before 
i have you to thank for that i grew stronger through our previous fight to be honest  i was overjoyed when i heard that the black knight was still alive that surprised me  i felt neither sadness nor hate just joy my hands were shaking with anticipation i couldnt wait to fight my most formidable enemy again your swordsmanship was fearsome fiercer and more powerful than any ive ever seen after our duel three years ago i trained hard trying to remember all of your skills and techniques
general gawain was invincible at the time he trained me to surpass him was my ultimate goal as a swordsman
was i as skillful as you remember my father in his prime years did you see his shadow in my sword
i certainly did ike thanks to you i was able to fight my master at the height of his glory days
black knight zelgius you were my fathers killer and my last teacher
 i spent most of my life shrouded in darkness  but my life had meaning now im certain of it 
 phiran i will wait for you in the afterlife 
 
 lets move on we dont have much time left
the swords are calling to each other 
the holy sword alondite  its the counterpart to your sword ragnell i think it wants you to take it up
alondite  the sword that took my fathers life
what happened here
we have arrived too late
general gawain
general oh thank the goddess  hes still alive but oh no  what has he done elena  did he kill her
it must have been the medallion he touched it and the chaos bound within sent him into a rage beyond reason tragic 
ike wait for me
ahh father mother
the generals children 
whats wrong with them are they asleep  father mother
theyre very tired child lets not disturb them
we cant leave them sleeping here its cold out we have to take them home ike you have to help me
 
ike
ill take them home will you show me the way
yeah come with me
may your final slumber be a peaceful one it appears the medallion was too much for lord ashnard it would be unwise to allow him access to it again
ah hey
thats my mothers medallion no ones supposed to see it
no child you mustnt touch it
we cant let it get lost ill keep it
you  you are unchanged
you said youd take my mother home too
yes of course
ike whats wrong why are you just standing there are you hurt
you saw everything didnt you poor child
ike
ah aaah aaaaaaah aaaaaaah
ike whats wrong
ahhh
ouch ike that hurts let go
nnng aaagh aaaanngghh
what happened
give me a moment
  
sweet children  sleep now rest
what did you do to him
merely helped him to forget i could not leave this memory to haunt him it is too heavy a burden for one so young
what will you do with the medallion
the girl seems safe from its influence we will leave it with her for the time being
mm
what  what was that
you saw it too didnt you ike that memory  could that have been  
i i was there  in that place  my mother she tried to stop my father and he killed her  i saw it all 
is that what happened i was contained inside at that time i had no idea
zelgius 
 
can you still fight
yes i will keep fighting i wont stop until i die
whats happening ah what 
you bear the mark so thats your secret is it the blood of the laguz runs through your veins
yes there was someone on my fathers side who who was with a laguz
my lord the brand do you know of a way to remove it this cursed thing i i am an outcast from my family i joined the military to escape the shame and hatred in their eyes  i live in fear of discovery when i think that i might see that same shame and hatred in anothers eyes i  i come close to despair  i have lived my life alone unable to trust or become close to anyone
such loneliness and isolation you poor child  it pains me to tell you that i know of no way to remove your brand
i i understand  it was a foolish question i apologize
lord sage i   i realized some years ago that i was aging more slowly than others do
and you wish to conceal that fact dont you is that why you rarely remove your armor even when indoors
yes but this ruse will not last indefinitely in a few years i will be forced to leave this armys service
and once again you will be alone
i am accustomed to being alone my only hesitation is that i will miss studying the sword under my commander general gawain
when the time comes for you to leave will you come to me perhaps
my lord
we share a similar condition i see something familiar within you i can  understand your pain and isolation
but why me
i have a task that i must accomplish with you at my side i would feel more confident of my success
if i join you will i be redeemed
i cannot say at the very least however you will no longer be alone and neither will i
that is enough then you have made my decision simple when i leave here i will find you
i am a soldier in the daein army i serve under the command of general gawain my name is zelgius may i ask your name my lord sage
my name of course 
whose  whose memory was that its just one of many  theyre swirling everywhere  the tower resonates with their strength but who is it who do they belong to  there is such sadness  zelgius met someone one lonely soul calling out to another  but hes no longer with us zelgius is gone  and now the soul that remains is once more alone 
/***EOF***/
the dark gods tainted minions have defeated our forces at every turn now they have set foot on the holy ground of the empire itself we have no choice but to lead the army ourselves and destroy them once and for all we are the chosen ones our will is the will of the goddess with us at its head our army is invincible
y yes quite as you say vice minister
when ive beaten that brat sanaki ill make her kneel before me and plead for her life heh heh heh
the vice minister says he hears the will of the goddess yet ive heard nothing of the kind in my ears why would the goddess choose lekain and me we are the ones with the most to atone for 
empress sanaki
the silver haired maiden 
yes its me micaiah um  may i sit next to you
what oh  uh 
 of course you may
thank you  this is awkward im sorry i know that you are not very fond of me but i wanted to talk to you
its not that i like you just fine its just that you make me feel inadequate
its because i can sing the galdr of release and hear yunes voice isnt it
how did you know
i can sense the flow of peoples thoughts by seeing the movement of a persons mind i can usually deduce what the person is thinking 
you can read minds what a boon that would be to running a country  if i could read peoples minds i could tell what the nobles and senators were thinking behind their smiles i wonder why the goddess didnt bless me with such power
micaiah was born with her power we didnt give it to her
ah is that you the dark g—no i mean the goddess of chaos yune let me ask you one thing yune why was micaiah able to sing the galdr of release but i wasnt
im sorry little empress i dont know but i knew that micaiah could sing it thats why i stayed close to her
i dont understand how can you be a goddess and not know i thought gods were perfect beings who knew everything
gods perfect where did you get that idea you havent met a lot of gods have you
well no but divinity created life from nothing surely only perfect beings could do that
we did create life and can do many things that you creatures of flesh cant but that doesnt make us perfect it just means we can make mistakes on a much grander scale 
were not what youve been taught and were much closer to you skin wearers than some will admit but we do make mistakes  sometimes we make terrible mistakes sometimes all it takes is one emotional outburst and the entire world is drowning underwater
ow where did this sandstorm come from yune you need to calm down 
i wish we were perfect then there wouldnt be any wars and no one would have to die because of our mistakes
y yes i understand yune now please calm down
yune
shes gone now she got upset she hasnt lost control of her emotions like that in a long time
micaiah im supposed to be the voice of the goddess ashera yet ive never once heard her speak i wonder what she is like
we may find out before this is over 
king naesala you are by yourself today
yeah how about you wheres that stone faced sidekick of yours
hes just hesitant to show his emotions
im only joking dont get so defensive
then dont insult my family
hmph you say hes your brother but theres as much resemblance between you two as between me and skrimir
were not related but were very close perhaps like you and princess leanne
what you didnt  
yes i can sense your emotions i also know that you just closed up to keep me from looking in
you possess the same power as the herons how stupid of me to let my guard down
im sorry
what else did you sense
excuse me
did you find out anything else about me
no i didnt try to read your mind intentionally i just felt that your feelings for princess leanne were very warm and thats all i saw
youre sure fine youre a lot like me ill let you off the hook this time
what do you mean by that
youll see when the time comes
king naesala 
i almost forgot here this is for you
this is a tome of light 
we need you to stay alive all right see you later
naesala 
how did it go sigrun did you find anything useful
only this unfortunately
ah its the tome of bolganone this is quite rare good work commander
sigh 
such a heavy sigh whats wrong
what sort of state is the world in when the apostle  our empress  has taken up arms and fights alongside the common soldiers
is that still bothering you i already told you not to worry
i know but what would the duke of persis think if he saw you right now
ah sephiran  i wonder what he and zelgius are doing right now
theyre awaiting your return of course
you dont have any doubt about that
of course not duke persis comes from a family of great mages general zelgius is the finest general in all of begnion they wouldnt have been petrified well see them when we return to the empire
thats true im certain that theyre safe too they must be waiting for us let us make haste toward sienne
yes that is why i keep suggesting that you should stay away from danger and  
nonsense we will fight with everything we have and in order to fight to our utmost we need powerful magic at our disposal follow me sigrun under these sands are many precious treasures help me find them
im glad she is feeling better but to see our empress is digging around in the dirt like a common farmhand  sigh
yune visited again huh did she have anything interesting to say
sort of i think she might be responsible for the ancient flood that sank all of the other continents
sorry to break up your alone time you two but we have disciples of order troubles again
hey thats  
i knew this would happen eventually
what is it empress sanaki oh i see
ah my dear sanaki the false apostle what a pleasure to see you again and this time ive an army of the righteous behind me ready to strike you down
vice minister lekain you are the foulest kind of traitor i can never forgive you
ha ha  how amusing forgiveness from a fraud is of no value to anyone
empress please dont force me to listen to his blasphemies any longer all me to silence him for you
hold sigrun i want to understand lekain on what grounds do you claim that i am not the true apostle
the apostle of begnion shall be the firstborn daughter of each generation in the line of altina first empress she will give voice to the goddess she will pass judgment give prophecy and protect her people and their lands sanaki you have never once heard the voice of the goddess have you
that is  that is only because  i have not come of age yet
oh what a hysterical coincidence thats just what the senate has been telling the people for years now apostle sanaki is too young to hear the goddess give her more time how funny that the lie youve been living is the same lie weve been telling
but how  explain yourself lekain
poor false apostle  no one ever told you about your older sister did they she was the true apostle
i had a sister
she died before you were born assassinated along with apostle misaha by the heron clan so the senate installed you the second daughter as the apostle instead
you lie you impugn both me and the noble herons
heh heh heh  im glad to have exposed your secret perhaps now you will be able to accept the truth
silence the lying tongue of a treacherous senator proves nothing
you seek proof fine we shall settle this in the ancient way in a battle to the death whomsoever the goddess sees fit to win the day must be in the right
lekain weve finally found you nows our chance sothe we must do whatever it takes to get the blood pact
right lets go
vice minister lekain i take it we may begin champions of the goddess crush these heretics give them the reward for rebelling against our goddess
ugh  theyre so powerful  are we destined to perish here
my maiden  hold on a little longer i am here
hello how can i help
what who  
you and i were born under the same fate
same fate do you also carry the mark
indeed i dont know who you are fighting or why but attacking my kin in the desert is the same as attacking me i will not let them leave this place alive

by the goddess  you
you fear me i do not blame you i apologize for the circumstances of our last meeting be assured princess i am not here to harm you if you are frightened i shall step away
nothing good can come of his being here hes a walking nightmare 
i knew it i knew that even if the end of the world came youd be the last one left standing
your faith is touching
well you and the commander commander ike will defeat you you know you cant run forever
you are correct we will soon meet again
shouldnt you sound more worried about that you sound as if youre looking forward to fighting commander ike again dont delude yourself you cant beat him
we shall see
ah sir knight i am glad to see youre safe i knew someone of your power wouldnt have turned to stone
i am glad to see youre safe as well maiden
are you here to save us again
not us
what
i am only here to save you no one else
but why why just me
we will talk more when the battle is over i shouldnt have said anything yet forgive me
sir knight 
hmm reinforcements i suppose i must turn back for my own safety it is vital that i not be harmed for the good of the world to come while it pains me to leave the field of battle i mustnt put myself at risk
hmm its beginning to look dangerous here i suppose i must turn back for my own safety it is vital that i not be harmed for the good of the world to come while it pains me to leave the field of battle i mustnt put myself at risk
i dont understand why would they fight against the vice minister chosen of ashera are they somehow deficient you will perish for your defiance of the empire vermin
no one escapes from their past numida we all have to answer for our crimes one day today is that day for you
silence cur
this is for the free people of daein haaaa
dont you idealistic twits ever give up
ahhhh what a fearsome beast only the dark god could create such a monstrosity
whats wrong little beorc frightened if you cannot look upon me you cannot hope to defeat me
ah duke numida unbelievable that a coward like you was changed back from stone particularly surprising given some of your more impious transgressions
i i have no idea what youre talking about i am a senator in good standing
my country produces excellent spies your grace i know every atrocity you committed while in daein i actually hold quite a bit of incriminating evidence that would destroy you if it became public its a pity that all that work will be wasted though since this is the last day of your life
i am second commander tanith of the holy knights enemies of the apostle beware
how said that you still put stock in your laughable infant of a holy figure fool
its tragic really that the holy knights have wasted so much time and energy protecting a sham apostle its not too late you know to align yourself with the true chosen of the goddess
the loyalty of the holy knights can only be commanded by one person and that will never change it is my duty and privilege to execute her orders and destroy the enemies of the apostle
so child what the vice minister said was true wicked infant how dare you pretend to be divinely inspired while you heard absolutely nothing from the goddess
i 
fool do you honestly believe that your dark god can triumph in the face of asheras divine majesty
shes not my dark god to be honest i dont care about the gods they have nothing to do with me
what then who do you fight for
i fight for my family and i fight against tyranny that is enough
you
who are you girl
duke numida i will never forget your oppression of the daein people or your cowardly flight from justice
ah youre from daein you should know that i had nothing to do with that unpleasantness that was all general jarods doing
general jarod was a scoundrel and a fiend but at least he had a soldiers honesty in his villainy you black hearted senators nauseate me weaving a dense tapestry of lies that you yourselves believe
what  whats happening vice minister i lost the battle 
sir knight how good to see you you always save me from danger
maiden i have a favor to ask of you will you come with me my master awaits you at the tower of guidance
the tower of guidance if i may ask who is your master
you will see when we get there please take my hand we will be there in the blink of an eye
 i cant i cant leave everyone behind we have to get to the tower together
your allies will turn to stone with the light of judgment next shines i do not wish for you to see it
the light will strike again when please tell me
 maiden i will come for you again make up your mind by then
wait 
dont tell me hes gone again right i knew we couldnt count on him
um sothe 
lekain got away didnt he
yes he did but well have another chance
im sure of it i know hes going to attack us again dont know if thats good news or bad 
i know we have to be ready
sigrun tanith i need to talk to both of you
empress why so serious whatever it is you can be sure that sigrun and i will help you with it
tanith let her speak
when the last apostle was assassinated and i was not yet born begnion went a long time without central authority the people were frightened both of the murder and the power vacuum without the goddesss voice begnion was lost sephiran once told me that when the senate confirmed my appointment as the next apostle it was as if a sign of relief sounded across the country
its true i still remember your coronation the first time i ever saw you empress sanaki with your tiny hand in sephirans you stumbled as you walked  a little girl barely visible in the grand hallway of the cathedral it was a moving sight
i remember as well the empress stepped on her cape and tripped a total of five times
tanith that hardly seems appropriate
i think the countrys sigh of relief was unwarranted i cannot hear the goddesss voice i never could this has perplexed me for years at first i thought my youth was to blame but this excuse grows thinner each year there is no clear age at which previous apostles heard the goddess for the first time but all of them had heard by now
empress if this is about what duke gaddos said  
if i am not the true apostle have i betrayed my people even unknowingly you two are my most trusted friends how would you feel about me if i were not the apostle be honest with me
you would like an honest answer very well it would change nothing
what
if you thought that our allegiance was to the office of the apostle well you were wrong even from a young age you have been working with lord sephiran to fight the senate on behalf of the people
our loyalty lies with you empress sanaki you will always be our empress please do not forget that
 i am blessed not by the voice of the goddess but by loyalty like yours
be strong empress sanaki even if you are not an apostle you are still the one true empress of begnion
prince kurthnaga tells of the connection between daein and the dragon tribes ranulf reveals the identity of the black knight these revelations send ikes mind spinning in a whirlpool of confusion and doubt

according to our scouts the enemy has split into two forces one is east of the ertz mountains the other is approaching from the north by crossing through crimea
so they plan on flanking gallia from the north and east if we dont stop them this is gonna hurt
agreed what is the crimean army doing
from what the scouts have said nothing at all im guessing theyre waiting to see how everything pans out
crimea let begnion pass without a fight what about their alliance with gallia
its not that simple skrimir begnion is crimeas suzerain state its difficult for crimea to refuse begnions demands
a suza what someone explain to me what that means
hmm how can i explain  all right hows this begnion still holds political power over countries that won independence from them anything you want to add ike
dont look at me ive always thought the whole idea was ridiculous
never mind what it means has crimea broken its treaty with us
not as such i didnt say it was right just that it was complicated 
its not complicated at all crimea has betrayed gallia we cannot let this pass how da  
control yourself skrimir youre acting like a fool
m my apologies your majesty it is just  
i doubt that crimea has sided with begnion queen elincia is very clever and i will not stop trusting her judgment just yet she most likely allowed the imperial army to pass through her lands in order to avoid a slaughter
who is this beorc queen who warrants so much trust please enlighten us
she is a delightful woman both in manner and in reign her late father king ramon and i forged an alliance between beorc and laguz we sought to bring our peoples closer she has taken her fathers ideals as her own and strives to create a country where anyone beorc or laguz can live free and in peace
how times have changed  i never could have dreamed of a time where such a beorc ruler would exist i must admit i still have doubts
i dont blame you my brother change has been slow but the circle of acceptance in tellius has been widening as you can see both leanne and i have many beorc friends queen elincia of crimea is one of them
both the king and reyson speak well of this woman is she truly so special
she truly is but right now thats beside the point the most important thing is elincia will never betray her allies in gallia
i couldnt agree more we can trust her
all right lets assume for now that crimea will not aid the empire in any military fashion during this conflict hawk king lets hear your thoughts
well if crimea wont make a move then i see no reason to wait until the empire reaches gallia id prefer to take an army up north and end this mess for good
very well ike do the greil mercenaries have anything to add
 i agree with tibarns idea we should strike while their army is split in half im pretty sure that general zelgius will be there though wed better be careful
very well hawk king may i ask that your forces protect the eastern border while they do that i would like you to lead our strike force to the northern border take ranulf with you as well
send me too your majesty please let me reclaim my honor i beg you
i second that your majesty skrimir is perfect for this mission
ranulf
 very well will you look after him hawk king
sure i can handle him hes easier to keep under control than you are lion king
hmph hes all yours then now everyone prepare to leave before daybreak we are all depending on you
insects of begnion well show you the power of the beast tribe
beorc scum for the razing of our homes well make you wish youd never been born
filthy sub humans this war ends now prepare yourselves
a beorc army is approaching from the hill to the left that flag  its the crimean army
c crimea intends to side with the empire after all
elincia what are you doing 
uwee hee hee finally they see the light and are coming to fight with us excellent took them long enough i suppose when you have the brain of a gnat these things take some time to sink in
 i am queen elincia of crimea i have a message for the commanders of both armies i am here to declare the will of crimea and its people crimea has been ruled under the ideals of peace and equality since the reign of my father king ramon as such i cannot and will not allow you to spill blood upon our land therefore 
i demand that both the laguz alliance and the imperial army leave crimea at once
withdraw our troops you foolish girl we will not be ordered about by the proclamations of a peasant like you puppet rulers such as yourself should stay inside their pretty castles and play dress up begnions patience has worn out after we finish slaughtering the sub humans well be coming for you in melior
commander of the laguz alliance how do you respond
 you have some serious guts jumping into the middle of a battlefield all by yourself but your high and mighty beliefs dont change the fact that begnion must answer for its crimes step aside
 very well ive heard from both commanders then  
this is crimeas answer we will not sway from our ideas my countrymen stand united we will not use force but we are willing to do whatever it takes to end this here and now
what have you lost your mind
heh 
 
 ha  hahahahaha  ike i thought you were the craziest beorc id ever met but you have some serious competition crimeas queen is one tough woman  your majesty i like your style skrimir i cant let such a pretty woman down lets get out of here
of course the beast tribe will not use our claws against unarmed beorc soldiers back to the forest
thank you king tibarn
this is only temporary the war between the laguz alliance and begnion isnt finished yet
yes i understand that even so i want you all to know where crimea stands in this
 hey you and i should get together and chat sometime ill be seeing you again soon
general zelgius what are your orders shall we launch an attack
no we will withdraw
are you certain general
could you cast aside your weapon while surrounded by armed soldiers
i dont know sir  no probably not
queen elincia has done something that even i would be hard pressed to do for that we must show our respect
stop this instant wait where do you think youre going attack those mangy beasts
please forgive my audacity however we are withdrawing every battle ebbs and flows to go against these tides is unwise please understand senator
you self righteous fool  youll understand something else once were through with this battle
i dont want to go back yet  do we have time to talk to elincia
it has been a long time since we last saw queen elincia we should at least say hello
sure sounds great to me theres probably not much time for small talk but well see
 soldiers kill the queen of crimea that girl is a traitor to begnion
whoa this isnt good the imperial army is on the move theyre after queen elincia
so much for imperial honor greil mercenaries looks like we have our old job back protect queen elincia
tch i knew it follow me my knights we shall protect her majesty
kill every living thing that stands in our way show them that i  no the senate  controls this pathetic land
of course senator valtome id be happy to kill the wench
elincia
sir ike
im glad youre safe that was one crazy move you pulled
its what i had to do to stop the fighting however my efforts have failed i could not stop them
but at least you made your point to the laguz alliance im sure there are those in the imperial army who understand as well you did the right thing
youre always so kind thank you sir ike
general zelgius senator valtome is about to run down the queen of crimea
that useless parasite attacking an unarmed woman  this is beneath even him
the crimean army and a part of the laguz alliance have joined battle in order to rescue the queen they are fighting senator valtome shall we assist the senator
prepare to leave we are not fighting
but general  that would mean that we abandoned duke culberts force 
i will take all responsibility for this make my command clear to all of the men i will not accept more units joining this fight
commander our force is taking heavy losses defeat is imminent even our strike force cannot keep the enemy at bay please you must escape
ive been defeated me by worthless rabble like this ugh blast that zelgius how dare he not assist me ill have his pompous head for this
fools how dare you fight my master he is senator valtome duke of culbert die in his name
we are under the direct orders of senator valtome his words carry the weight of the entire senate mercenaries you know how war works you know that begnion can pay  
save your breath the greil mercenaries choose our employers all the wealth in the senate couldnt buy us lay down your bow and surrender
what wretched fool youll rot in the ground next to that treacherous girl
phew  begnions finally given up that took some doing
tell me about it but we did get some good information out of all this now we know for certain that there are serious leadership problems in the imperial army im glad general zelgius was honorable enough to withdraw if the full strength of the two armies had clashed elincias effort wouldve been wasted
sir ike sir ranulf thank you for helping us save queen elincia
geoffrey im really surprised you let elincia do such a dangerous thing you must be more relaxed these days
it wasnt easy for me as you could guess but i can never really say no to queen elincia what choice did we have anyway
you didnt have any and you all did what needed to be done im really impressed crimeas become quite strong
dont talk like such a stranger the greil mercenaries are also from crimea youre part of that strength
true im very proud of my homeland
lets go see her majesty you do have time to speak with her right
i shall now dispense punishment for disobeying my orders general zelgius do you have anything to say i would hear your pleas now
 i am prepared to face the consequences of my actions
quite an admirable sentiment general although i imagine you should have thought about the consequences before you abandoned your allies now on your knees its time for your execution good bye general zelgius
wh what senator i must ask you to reconsider to execute a man of general zelgiuss caliber without a trial  its madness its horrible
levail are you questioning a senator a senator holds the right to punish a prisoner however he sees fit oh ill make sure to tell our people that the general was cut down in battle after felling hundreds of sub humans that way the people will not trouble themselves over details that they couldnt possibly understand
you would bury the truth do you think the apostle is as easily fooled by your lies
oh i sincerely doubt the apostle will ever get to hear them  all right ive waited long enough your wait is over as well zelgius execute him
dont worry zelgius ill make sure that your lands are looked after theyll be mine of course uwee hee hee
 
what
silence valtome all soldiers loyal to begnion are to stand down immediately
hello senator valtome
you  youre one of the holy guards
the apostle will be here shortly soldiers sheathe your weapons and kneel before the apostle
what no  its impossible
ah its her theres no doubt about it
its the apostle the apostle is here
  my soldiers i apologize for my sudden disappearance
i am here today to explain things and to bring you news from home that is of the utmost importance my soldiers listen to me carefully i never wished for this war it was started by those who wanted me dead it was spurred on by their desire to rule begnion for themselves this war was the work of the senate and was organized by vice minister lekain of gaddos
the senate wished harm upon the apostle
no  impossible how can that be
 lies she lies do not be tricked proud soldiers of begnion she is not the true apostle
ah i see then we are not the real holy guards is that what you are trying to say
n no this is a farce you cannot trick us you are using a fake apostle to disable the senate and take over begnion men we must act that vile sephiran is their leader the fact that hes been put in chains is our proof
hurk
 i will not allow you to disgrace my masters good name one more syllable and i shall snap your neck valtome
urk  ahh
apostle words cannot express how good it is to see you alive and well we have been awaiting your return
thank you general zelgius you and i have much to discuss
apostle sanaki arrives without warning at the central armys main camp in crimea with a strength born of conviction she exposes the senators vile plot to undermine and usurp her
valtome counterattacks with a claim crafted by the senate  that the apostle is a fraud who along with her prime minister sephiran is attempting to deceive all of begnion and lead them away from the goddesss graces to the citizens of begnion the senators are chosen by the goddess and are worthy of the same respect given to the apostle as for the apostle her image is tarnished when the senate imprisons prime minister sephiran in her name
an ever growing number of begnions citizens are willing to believe the senators claim that the apostle is an agent of evil trying to deceive them so it is that the central army is divided one camp believes in the apostle and the other supports the senate this new turmoil fans the flames of chaos into a mighty conflagration burning across tellius
welcome back you two
giffca apologies for worrying you
you persevered through many difficult battles we are glad to have you back in one piece
each and every soldier in the army helped me i couldnt do anything by myself alone i was powerless
thats good if thats what you learned from this campaign then it wasnt a wasted effort for gallia good work ranulf
thank you sir
skrimir come here i have something from the king
what is this
its a satori sign it is said to bring out the hidden power of the laguz
amazing
here its yours
ranulf you should take it
what why the king said it was for you
yes but youve been looking after me its  a sign of my appreciation
skrimir 
very well ranulf this is yours to keep
a all right thank you sir
skrimir you reply to his thanks
um yes youre welcome i am grateful for your continued support
of course general
/***EOF***/
oh goddess  will you please stop is this not enough your sister regrets all she has done if you look closely at any of yunes actions and their unintended consequences you will see they were all born of fear fear that you would expunge her from yourself if you would but allow her back within you this would surely never happen again
yune is chaos she is an imperfection in my being it is because of her that i i have done this thing that cannot be undone
no matter how i admonished you you would not stop fighting there was nothing i could do every day my beloved children were killed killed by others of my beloved children with every death my rage and sorrow grew until i could control myself no longer my emotions burst forth and i razed the land furious storms savaged the heavens roiling waters rose in tremendous floods lives were lost beyond counting
i will purge chaos from within myself never again will i allow myself to commit such atrocities i will become a goddess to properly guide and protect my people i will become perfect
but to nullify half of your being  we were terribly monstrously wrong to suggest it you shouldnt have to bear the weight of our foolish ideas
i i was just lonely my other half spent all her time worrying about the laguz and beorc she said she was going to erase me i was only playing i never meant to hurt so many
i understand yune
i wont do it again i love all of you too you paid attention to me i dont want to go away it would be lonely and i dont like being lonely i want to stay here with all of you
 goddess i have a suggestion if we here of our own will were to make a pledge to coexist there would be no need to erase yune would there in which case we give you our solemn oath never again will either the laguz or beorc seek the extermination of the other soan dheginsea this is agreeable is it not
i do not accept your pledge
why
i cannot believe you you are living creatures created in our image you cannot seal away your instincts with reason you are like us you feel profound sorrow anger fear  a conflict will surely arise to overwhelm your reason and discipline you will be unable to master your emotions and i may once again make the mistakes that have led us here the only way to prevent this is to expunge chaos completely yune must not exist my decision has not changed
in that case goddess  would you consider an alternative to such drastic measures we shall use the power of seid magic to seal yune in this medallion someday and it may be in the far distant future  someday we may be able to earn your trust goddess in the hope of that day arriving refrain from annihilating yune please
in my eyes imprisoning yune and destroying her are the same thing  if the chaos and disaster that yune begets can be averted i have no objection i do not know however if yune will submit to such confinement
goddess yune please hear me i will never give up someday i will see you restored to yourself please 
 mm 
do not look so sad i will always be with you i will sing to you you will not be lonely i promise
theyre getting stronger and stronger  whose memories are those i know him
everyone ashera is nearby just beyond those doors  thats where well find her
we made it finally 
you should know ashera may have changed since before her slumber order and chaos are meant to naturally balance each other out if you take one away balance is lost i dont expect ashera to have the merest shred of compassion talking to her will likely do no good
we dont have much choice if talking wont work well have to use force otherwise this has all been for nothing
how about you
what do you mean
are you completely chaotic are you out of balance as far as i can tell you dont seem to lean too far in either direction
ashera and i see things a little differently  during my long sleep i was wrapped in sweet gentle music
heron galdrar
yes but more important than the song itself i was never alone there was always someone singing comfort to me ashera shouldnt have isolated herself she became lonely and bitter and lost touch with her people 
hold on  this thing wont budge
whats wrong with it
those doors cannot be opened
they have been sealed with powerful magic
sephiran youre all right  im so relieved to see you
im sorry to have been a cause for concern apostle forgive me
sephiran  theres something i need to tell you im not a true apostle i didnt mean to abuse your trust
ive known that for some time sanaki dont forget that i was almost a father to you it honestly doesnt make any difference to me whether or not you can hear the goddess
sephiran  th thank you for having always been there for me
empress  shouldnt you tell him about general zelgius
yes i suppose i should sephiran zelgius is dead  i know you put a lot of trust in him but he was also closely allied with daein im sure youve heard of daeins so called black knight sephiran the black knight was zelgius
 but thats probably not news to you is it after all it was you he was taking orders from
wha  ike what are you saying
a man like zelgius could never serve conflicting interests  never everything he did he did for one master isnt that so sephiran
i think i understand you wanted to monitor events within daein you sent zelgius as a spy
precisely i felt it important to observe king ashnard carefully  that was my goal
at the time it was relatively easy to get an outsider close to the king ashnard was famous for employing powerful men with no regard for their background or social status
obviously he would have needed no convincing once he saw the bladework of general zelgius
the black knight tried to take the medallion from my father and killed him tell me sephiran whose plan was that ashnards or yours
calm down ike sephiran would you please explain
sir ike im afraid your fathers death was an unfortunate result of zelgiuss own personal agenda i did not order sir gawain killed however i must admit that i did ask him to seize the medallion and hand it over to king ashnard the goddess was to be freed and all living creatures destroyed
 
come again
youre insane
i couldnt be more sane sir ike attend and learn  my aim has always been to wake ashera so that she might pass judgment on all the people of the world what i needed was a war that would spread all across the continent how could i achieve this my attention turned to the young daein prince  i could use the fiery ashnard for my purposes he was ambitious a fierce warrior and more than anything he had an earnest desire to change the world when i allowed him to know of the goddess sealed inside the medallion he became determined to set her free we could use heron galdrar or a massive continent spanning war to throw the world into chaos
lord sephiran what are you saying are you saying you wanted this you cant be serious
sanaki my long life has shown me the people of this world deserve only destruction the selfishness the brutality  the disregard for others the endlessly quarreling laguz and beorc we have been given many chances to correct our behavior and ourselves and have squandered them all the only remaining hope for a peaceful orderly world is for ashera to wipe us all out and begin again to fulfill my ambition of destroying all beings i had to use you  i had to betray you
this is some kind of monstrous joke 
so youve been pulling the strings all along
correct
beyond just empress sanaki you were trusted by a lot of people sephiran i need to understand  did you really betray all of those people
i did
i dont need to hear anything else then im going to make your death as painful as i know how
i dont get it  why would you wake the goddess to pass judgment on us tell us why how could you want that
it wouldnt make any difference if i told you you would have to live a few centuries before you could understand
years ago my father went into hiding with the medallion at the time he got help from both you and zelgius does this have anything to do with that
hmm you seem to have sparked a distant memory of mine
answer me why did you do this
im sorry i cant tell you at least not in any way you would understand
then ill have to make you talk
this cant be happening i wont fight you sephiran i cant
poor sanaki  youll have no choice but to fight the doors leading to ashera are sealed by my very own magic killing me is your only way through
sephiran
so it was you  all those memories penetrating my mind were yours  since we entered this place ive seen what youve been thinking lehran give it up
goddess yune  why do you insist on calling me that name i discarded it so long ago yune ive changed lehran is a thing of the past all i want now is the end of all that is please dont stop me
lehran 
youre running out of time at this rate i wouldnt count on being able to face the goddess i would hate to see you denied after coming all this way
well now you know who brought you here and why  i suppose that just leaves our fight to the death to take care of
i am about to tell you a very old story  a story you should know as the new king of goldoa this is one of the oldest and most heavily guarded secrets in all of tellius youll find no trace of it in any histories or sagas
if its that important maybe we should go somewhere else other people might hear us
hmm what do you think nasir
i called upon lady micaiah because i felt that she should know the story as well no  i think now is the time to let everyone know would that be all right your majesty
there will be no secrets from now on tell us everything
as you wish your majesty in the dawn of this age after the goddesses began their long slumber the kingdom of begnion was established in those early days laguz and beorc lived side by side in harmony and peace yes that kingdom would become the begnion empire the hero altina was chosen to be the kingdoms first queen lehran supported her as an advisor and as a husband
what
despite their differences lehran and altina loved each other very deeply
the people accepted a marriage between a laguz and a beorc
that was what king dheginsea said this was before the people thought of such differences they saw only a queen and her husband
at this time king dheginsea also created his own kingdom far from other laguz tribes and beorc nations he believed that the dragon tribe was too powerful to interact equally with other tribes and peoples that kingdom became goldoa
begnion had been established for four years when king dheginsea received news that altina had become pregnant the news brought great joy you see the news was also quite surprising there had been other unions between beorc and laguz but until altinas pregnancy no children had ever been conceived indeed hers was the first child ever to be born of beorc and laguz
as close friends of both altina and lehran both king dheginsea and soan rejoiced at the news the child would be the first to carry the joined blood of both laguz and beorc the king said that the baby would become a symbol of peace between the two peoples
but joy over the childs birth did not last soon after the child was born lehran lost all the powers of the laguz he could not transform any longer nor could he sing galdrar
it became apparent that the child of such a union neutralizes the laguz parents powers to make matters worse the child bears only the characteristics of a beorc
lehran felt he was no longer a true laguz and felt he could no longer act as a bridge between the goddess and the people of tellius he lost hope and also his mind at least temporarily he attempted suicide several times which is an unthinkable taboo for anyone who has sworn to serve the goddess
king dheginsea fell into despair if people caught wind of this news he believed it would create a deep rift between the two peoples the king was especially concerned about the reaction from the laguz they might interpret the birth as a herald of their eventual end some might even attempt to harm the child
lehran needed to hear the voice of the goddess then more than ever before  but he could no longer sing the galdr of release is that what happened
just so lehran was forced to make a very difficult decision to protect the peace between beorc and laguz he decided to retreat into seclusion and consider the problem once he regained his sanity he announced his decision
lehran was forced to ask the  unthinkable of his wife his aides and close friends for the sake of begnion you must tell the people that i died in an accident tell them the birth was merely a false rumor
lehran left the medallion to his tribe moving to goldoa under king dheginseas protection he simply disappeared from history after that
after lehran had left and life returned to normal altina eventually welcomed a beorc husband she raised the child shed had with lehran as though it were an ordinary beorc child born of her new husband since then marriages between laguz and beorc have been forbidden it became known as a crime against the goddess
even so the taboo was broken several times over the next few decades usually no child was conceived but when there was it was swiftly covered up the parents soon learned what it meant to bear a child who possessed both laguz and beorc blood after they learned of the consequences none of these parents ever rejected the edict forbidding it
the child was to be raised by the beorc parent and raised as a beorc child that should have been enough to hide everything end of story
it was several generations later that the certain descendants began to manifest physical marks which indicated their ancestors sins fortunately this mark looked very similar to the marks on those protected by spirits they could pass as students of the dark arts for at least a few years unfortunately the branded lived much longer than beorc
most branded chose to hide living outside of ordinary society and they disappeared into the shadows of history rumors had already begun to spread across begnion however the branded were shunned and cast out wherever they lived where the laguz held power they persecuted the branded and executed them in honor killings
thats horrible
it was king dheginseas opinion that these were crimes that he had to carry on his conscience from the beginning he realized that he and the others in power had made a mistake they understood that they should have revealed everything about altina and lehrans child the people should have been told the truth but since theyd kept the truth from everyone the branded were marked as unclean persecuted wherever they traveled
here is the family tree for lehran and altinas bloodline only king dheginsea knew the truth until now
father  youve had to endure this burden alone for so long
it was the same in lady almedhas case when she lost her powers after giving birth to the mad kings son king dheginsea had no choice but to hide the truth from everyone so he chose to hide almedha from everyone better to deny her existence than be forced to explain long hidden secrets
in the process hed lost someone even more dear to him prince rajaion he deeply regretted his decision when he learned of the princes death the only choice left for king dheginsea was to remain stubbornly neutral in all wars on the continent he hoped  in vain  to keep the goddess from waking up before the thousand years had elapsed
im such a fool  i had no idea what father went through all i did was deny what he fought for
kurth 
your majesty you are the king now you know that it is a sin to fight against the goddess and yet youve chosen to move forward
king dheginsea left everything to you you must succeed do not be afraid of what lies beyond forge ahead
i understand i shall be true to my convictions i have no more doubts
nasir
ike im sorry about earlier
thats all right i know that you were in a tight spot
ahh the beorc hero we will follow king kurthnaga from now on if he wishes to fight alongside you i shall assist
i see then you should receive a blessing of protection from the goddess yune
we already have we can fight ashera now
youd lend us all of your might
of course
we swear upon the good name of the dragon tribe that we shall do our best
mortals cannot stand against gods dont you see the futility of what youre doing
the laguz and beorc have doomed each other with their mutual hatred you have brought extinction on yourselves
go back to your forest heron you are like me an avatar of order you understand what i must do bask in the light of asheras judgment it holds no fear for you
i refuse to save only myself such an act would be an unforgivable betrayal i will stand by my companions and fight to the end
are you sure youre of the heron tribe ive never met a heron like you  your will is extraordinarily strong
it is you  now that ive seen your face  i know that you once went by another name
you are mistaken i am known as sephiran and nothing else
you have closed your heart why
 i have nothing more to say nothing
you  it  it cant be 
go back to the forest this is not where you should be
no im staying here with everyone these people are my friends  my family i will not leave them
has the heron clan changed so much theyve always been so passive and accepting of their natural fate 
 sephiran  everything youve ever told me every time you gave your hand to me every time you smiled  they were all lies  youre the most appalling fraud ive ever known
no lady sanaki  ive actually lied to you very little what i have done is hold things back ive also twisted the truth from time to time  but i have only told you one blatant falsehood that one lie has weighed heavily on me it makes me hate myself sometimes
sephiran 
ill always care deeply for you my little lady sanaki  you are my sun and my moon i never wished to harm you please  you must understand 
 no sephiran no
its your fault what happened in daein every pointless death in this war is on your head sephiran duke of persis  history will remember you as the worst kind of man
everything its all been my fault you should know one more thing however i also had a hand in the death of your father
 die monster
we never spent much time together when i was in begnion  but sephiran  i think i know you pretty well
i havent forgotten you haar shiharams hotshot young protege you were both exemplary soldiers your defection from the begnion dracoknights was a huge loss
hmmm  sort of like the huge loss when the senators managed to defeat all those great changes you proposed
 
i suppose if any of those changes had happened we wouldnt be here now am i wrong
an interesting question  im honestly not sure but thats all i can say about that
too bad for you and for me
king naesala it seems as if everything went well with the pact
yes for which i am thankful the blood pact yoked kilvas to your countrys control  but we no longer suffer the curse for opposing the tyrannical edicts of your corrupt bloated senators present company excluded of course
im quite glad to hear it
you shouldnt be youre not like the other senators but your insane agenda has turned my nation to stone freedom means nothing to a statue
my goal was simply to save sanaki with your help she is safe the mutual benefit of your country was a happy accident so dont feel indebted to me
so you wont object when i tear your lungs out here and now
by all means be my guest
who wouldve guessed that a madman on the other side of the desert would somehow threaten hatari
hatari im sorry i didnt get a chance to see it the wolf tribe has survived all this time in the far corner of the world only the goddess could have known that
perhaps even she didnt know it your goddess isnt perfect you know does an imperfect goddess have the right to judge imperfect beings
i see your point does the creator retain the right to destroy her creations when they are no longer what she envisioned i imagine we could discuss this sometime  if only we had more time i believe you alone might be able to sway my opinion on this lady nailah queen of wolves
you have too many opinions im done talking
duke of tanas imagine seeing you here
lord sephiran as lovely as always but has it come to this must we fight to the death and deprive the world of one of our beautiful countenances can other lovers of beauty endure such a loss
i confess that your presence has me bewildered could this be part of yunes plan i simply never would have imagined you here your presence proves that tellius is unravelling at the seams judgement cannot come soon enough
lord sephiran explain yourself your reasons for deceiving our empress may prevent me from striking you down as an enemy to the crown
i have nothing to say to you i am merely an obstacle do what you must do
sanaki trusted you and so did i youve turned your back on us and the empire how is that even possible
sigrun do with me what you will promise me that you will look after lady sanaki from now on
i will i will protect her from the likes of you
so as long as youre alive the doors dont open ive got an easy solution to that problem
tanith you are a kind woman
dont flatter yourself i do this only for lady sanaki
lord sephiran your every action in office earned you the trust of millions of begnion citizens i cant believe that you could stab every one of them in the back like that
young lady  actually i should address you properly  astrid of the crimean royal knights did you happen to stop by your home on the way here
no i didnt
arent you worried about your family perhaps you should check on them 
no everyones fine even if theyre frozen solid im going to save them i have nothing at all to worry about
youve grown stronger but your heart hasnt changed good
king pelleas correct arent you brave coming all this way
if youre the one whos been pulling the strings behind all this please tell me  who  who am i
 i dont know all i know is that you are a powerful practitioner of magic  i know you were an orphan born and raised in daein but that is all izuka ever told me
so  im not ashnards true son
no youre not ashnards son is of dragon tribe blood and is thus branded
i think im going to be ill 
be assured that you were essential to daeins reconstruction which was a vital step towards waking the goddess fortunately izuka was able to use you to execute my plan
you are going to pay you are going to blaaarrrgh
hello king tibarn i thought i might see you only the strongest reach the top its only natural that you would be among them
you know what i dont believe youre the big bad evil guy you want us to think you are
what could you be talking about
ah i was right i see it in your eyes ive been around for a while and learned a bit about spotting fakes so now that your secrets out maybe youd like to open up and tell me who are you really
 
here goes 
hello child  im a little surprised to see an ordinary boy like you fighting for the world this day is full of surprises
no ones more surprised than me i cant read peoples feelings like micaiah  im not invincible in battle like ike  between all these laguz kings and great beorc heroes i dont really belong here
then why are you here
because theres one thing that i cant afford to lose micaiah ive come all this way just to protect her  i wont lose her now
the depth of your feelings  might i ask your name
sothe now if you want to stand in our way im prepared to cut you down
you  ive heard about you have we met before
the silver haired maiden its taken so long to finally meet you if i had known you still lived i  i  no its too late this changes nothing i cannot falter
what is the matter with you
im just overly sensitive dont feign concern over me
i have to ask sephiran what are you after whats this all about
why do you wish to know you would achieve nothing by learning my reasons you would help no one i lost faith in lesser beings and desire an end to them thats all
so why did you save me on that day
may i ask you a favor ike tell me how you feel about it now can you bear recalling those horrific memories
yes  im fine now but i suppose at the time i wouldnt have been able to take it
all beings endure tragedies for as long as they continue to live it has always been the case that suffering is unavoidable and this grim reality plays out over and over in every country under every ruler  as long as there are beings who feel they will feel pain
so what we should all just give in and die put it behind you deal with it
do not make light of this 
im not sephiran im extremely grateful that you once helped me through a terrible time but i have accepted that occasionally we all have to deal with hard times ive had pain ive had suffering and i have gotten up and moved on i dont try to forget what happened that day i just accept it  and neither that or anything else will ever stop me
you are a strong man ike son of gawain but not everyone is as strong as you 
at last  im dying
what it cant be true our apostle 
cant believe it myself but the senators made an announcement it must be true
pardon me has something happened to the apostle
oh my lord sage the apostle shes shes dead
what how
according to the senators announcement she was assassinated by the serenes herons
they look so gentle like they couldnt harm a fly but  theyre nothing but beasts no better than the other sub humans
peace friends this is simply not possible the heron tribe could never assassinate anyone they 
shes dead isnt she those damned sub humans  every last one of ems got to die for the apostle
thats the truth theyre nothing but monsters oh i wish i could kill them myself
you can grab a weapon grab a torch come on well burn that forest to ash and wipe em all out
 no you mustnt 
whats wrong my lord sage you dont look well are you feeling all right
ungh
gwaaaaahhhh wings from the sages back wings  hes one of them hes a monster
youre nothin but a lying sub human piece of filth how dare you pretend to be one of us get him
the medallion must be quelled i cannot allow this madness to come to pass judgment the goddesss judgment 
no what have they done the forest the trees  the herons were innocent  why
the medallion  i must quell the chaotic energies must calm them 
ungh no chaos madness  so much anger so much pain 
why why was my family taken why why was my forest destroyed the apostle did not deserve this fate  killed by her innocence her murderers free to seize power  this is monstrous this world does need beorc and the laguz are deeply flawed there is no need to wait for the covenants thousand years awaken oh goddess awaken and judge
 sephiran
sephiran hold on open your eyes
yune help me what should i do  what really  ok ill try
sana ki 
sephiran you can hear me s somebody help hes wounded

please dont mourn for me im not worth it
im so sorry i wanted to help you i really did
forget about me this path was my decision my tragic mistake
lady  sanaki  i want you to have this this is the rudol gem wear it in memory of me it will protect you please forgive me  im sorry i lied to you
sephiran  dont worry we still have all the time we spent together  nobody can take that away nobody
thank you  my lady sanaki  ill be leaving you now zel gius is waiting
sephiran  no  nooooooooo
ashera is waiting just beyond those doors  lets go
im sorry sephiran i once lost hope in the laguz and beorc too i can see now that my punishment was far too strict i was young and naive and so sure that i was right i wish i could have shown you the error of my ways sephir   lehran good bye
sephiran  dont worry we still have all the time we spent together  nobody can take that away nobody
thank you  my lady sanaki  ill be leaving you now zel gius is waiting  al ti na 
sephiran no  noooooooo
now please micaiah
dont die  you cant die 
 hes breathing sephiran is breathing
ahh  just in time
you saved him thank you micaiah thank you
micaiah is completely spent shes sorry but she wont be able to fight in the next battle but theres no time hurry
goddess yune is there something you havent told us about you and sephiran
he saved my life
y your life sephiran saved the life of a goddess is there something you havent told us about sephiran then yune hell wake up in just a moment then you can ask him directly
oh all right ill do that
why did you save him
should i not have
i can think of a few reasons why you shouldnt have yes
hey get up now
take it easy on him hes had a hard day
 unh   hhhuuunnn  i  im alive
lehran
goddess yune  why why did you  
because i want you to live youve always taken care of me and i couldnt bear it if it ended like this
but ive lost all my hope all hope in the world and the people in it  i did what i did for future generations so they wouldnt have to live in this world please yune let me die
i wont lehran i wont
lehran now hes some kind of hero saint
 
if death is what you really want then im not going to let it happen on my watch i dont care what youve gone through i dont care how much youve suffered what youve done is unforgivable
stop it ike
 
ashera is waiting its time for the final confrontation with her you can come  if you want to
you  youre asking me to turn my back on goddess ashera
if you really want the total extinction of beorc and laguz alike then you can just lie here like a lump if not this is your last chance to start rectifying your mistakes think hard on that
but ike
 
ill be waiting for you lehran

general zelgius why did you retreat so quickly order an all out attack
the laguz alliance is inching closer after successfully crossing the river it would be unwise to attack them head on at this time
at this time that is for me to decide you are a fool zelgius the senate wants all sub humans roaming our lands to be exterminated at once i forbid you to retreat from now on am i understood zelgius
pardon my impertinence but that is madne  
i understand my lord i will do my best to end this fighting as soon as possible
but general zelgius
general zelgius why didnt you say anything the senators orders are madness
dont make me repeat myself we soldiers are in no position to question the orders of our superiors
but i thought  no i was certain that you would steer the military in the right direction
general zelgius  
im late my apologies
ah here comes the great strategist dont be so shy come sit next to me
not if you begged me skrimir
soren im so sorry hes rude to everyone but strangers especially
you still dont trust me then i will take the first step i admit that we won the last battle thanks to your cleverness i underestimated the wisdom of the beorc as a general of gallia you have my thanks
 youre welcome
what do we do next we hit begnion hard in the last battle surely we will use this opportunity to wipe out the enemy entirely
actually it would be unwise to launch a new offensive now i recommend we negotiate a peace treaty with begnion
what youd give up our best opportunity to crush begnion for some peace treaty
for once please try to think for a moment skrimir yes we crossed the river but we havent so much as touched the central army not one scratch consequently begnion still has the advantage it would be foolish to press the attack
i must ask you to think harder a peace treaty now my soldiers will never accept this we need another way
what do you think ranulf do you feel the same way
well  its not so much how i feel but how we laguz are as a species once the fighting begins laguz cant see anything except the enemy in front of them in a long fight like this its even harder to keep ourselves in check
the same goes for my tribe if we were to stop fighting now id have to go around knocking every one of my men unconscious
but rushing headlong into the enemy and getting killed is not an option soren can you think of something  maybe its too much to ask
no i can do it   just let me think   all right i have it gather around the map ill explain what we have to do
hey captain ranulf the hawk kings decoy attack got the begnion forces to move out
good our unit will hit them from the north ike from the south and skrimir from the west im impressed if everything goes according to plan soren will have delivered another easy victory
captain we appear to have a situation general skrimirs western forces are charging down the cliff
what i told him to keep his men under control at all costs
apparently an enemy commander challenged general skrimir to a duel he accepted of course he always was an impatient one the challenger was a large raven haired beorc clad in stunning crimson armor
that must be zelgius no no no skrimir cant win hell get slaughtered send a message to tibarn and ike tell them im going to save skrimir we cant let him do this
ike a company of enemy troops has appeared to the south of skrimirs forces
general zelgius seems to be in command
uh oh thats not good
if skrimirs force collapses well get penned in by begnion we must change our strategy ike lets help with the rescue you cant take everyone though assemble a strike force to accompany you
got it titania let tibarn know whats going on
wheres skrimir
he charged up that cliff chasing after zelgius
we have to get up there the two of us might be able to save him from zelgius
kyza can you carve us a path to the top
certainly captain id be happy to well neutralize anyone in your way you can count on me sir
all right lets clear this pass time is a factor here everyone so lets make this quick
none shall pass general zelgius forbids it
so sub human are you worried about your general
you bet im worried without us looking after him who knows what kind of trouble that hothead might get himself into you can see were in a big hurry get out of my way or ill move you painfully
never if you wish to reach the top you must move me do your best sub human
you will not gain the peak nor shall i yield my position you will wait for the duel to finish
duel
correct the general does not wish to be disturbed during his duel im certain that it will be over very soon you may then pass and fetch the carcass of your general
you are too late  the general  he is strong 
i have a bad feeling about this  ike com on theres no more time
ranulf this way hurry
 no
skrimir
stop ranulf dont get too close
heed my words laguz alliance i am zelgius general of the begnion central army your general has fallen to my blade in single combat my army does not wish to continue this senseless bloodshed leave this place immediately soldiers of begnion i forbid you to attack the fleeing laguz soldiers this fight is finished
general zelgius is amazing he kept the damage on both sides to a minimum
yeah thats great but  i wanted to fight how am i going to get my kid a stuffed laguz now
no  general skrimir was defeated by a beorc
if general skrimir is defeated we must fight on in his name we must get revenge dont be fooled by that human fight on brothers
stop we will fall back brothers listen to me i swear upon my life that ill take skrimir back with us fall back
a wise choice
levail go back to base camp i have business to take care of
what are you plotting you could have crushed us
true thats exactly what the heads of the senate want but the apostle feels differently the apostle wishes to resolve this conflict peacefully begnion is not united on this idea however so how about this arrange a peace proposal from your people the apostle would accept it
but to begin a peace talk under the current circumstances 
the most favorable opportunity for a peace talk would have been when you crossed the river you missed that chance and now look at where you are
 
think it over ill give you three days request a peace talk within that time if that isnt possible negotiations are over i sincerely hope that wont be the case  as for the heir of king caineghis he will be fine treat his wounds quickly
you mean you didnt finish him off why not
it does not matter who the enemy is if there is a way to avoid taking a life that is the path i will choose leave now i swear upon my name that my men will not attack as you retreat
 three days huh what will the beast tribe do ranulf what will become of gallia
im sorry tibarn now that skrimir has been incapacitated  gallia cant go on any further
right  thats too bad i guess the laguz alliance has to take a break then
what about you will phoenicis agree to a peace talk
i havent decided our force lacks numbers and supplies we cant possibly take them on but  i imagine that a peace talk would be far from pleasant
general zelgius seems like a trustworthy beorc i also know from the mad kings war that even the apostle is not a bad person at heart but in reality the senate controls begnion right now they were the ones who killed our messenger
i know that general zelgius cant disobey orders from the senate but what about the apostle shes begnions supreme leader right cant we just contact her directly
trust me we tried all our efforts were in vain its not just the laguz either tanith said that the apostle wont even meet with the holy guards these days
wait she wont meet with tanith but tanith has been at her side forever theres something very wrong with all this 
what is happening in begnion
well well stick around and see what happens the laguz alliance will disband temporarily the problem is gallias retreat youve got a lot of ground to cover before begnion attacks in three days
agreed 
general zelgiuss plan succeeds in breaking the morale and momentum of the laguz forces skrimir accepts a challenge to single combat with zelgius and barely escapes with his life his defeat sends a wave of doubt and fear through the laguz alliance
ranulf knowing that the situation has turned against them orders a full retreat and the beast tribes use the three days offered by zelgius to recross the ribahn and begin the long march back to gallia
oh you have no idea how happy youve made me do you have any idea how long ive been waiting for this
hey im a busy guy but im glad to hear it i guess
dont be so cold you could do this for me anytime if you want you know ill pay good money
no thanks its more trouble than its worth
ill make it worth your time how about it baby you could leave your mercenary lifestyle behind and 
uh  what the heck are you talking about
ike my hero are you here to see me
hmph im outta here
hey wait what about what i owe you
give it to him and dont tell him anything that he doesnt need to know
 and now hes gone what a selfish man
care to tell me whats going on
ike no are you feeling jealous dont you worry darling theres only room for you in my heart really
youre scaring me aimee
oh come on its just a joke business only i promise first this is for you
a blue gem
you heard what the man said im supposed to pay you instead
youre paying us im very confused id assumed that shinon owed you money or something
no no nothing like that this is what i owe him for   oops he told me not to say
aimee im getting scared again
all right fine its a payment for a bow
a bow
i paid a lot for a bow he made me im going to offer it as a one of a kind item at the shop
right  is that why rolf is making bows now he mentioned something about bows being good income in emergencies
probably rolf is learning from a good teacher but hes still no match for the master himself
rolf is shinons student
oh dang you think that was a secret too
how should i know shinon wouldnt tell me that he smelled smoke if i was on fire
well  i dont think shinon likes people especially you for some reason i wonder why he came back to you after he left the greil mercenaries during the war
shinon likes our little group i know that much this is probably his way of trying to help us be less broke
you think so why wouldnt he just come out and say so hes so strange like that
ill keep this conversation a secret i dont want to risk losing shinon by putting him on the defensive about all this
right its a secret between you and me ike

king tibarn queen elincia we may need to halt for a bit
why whats the problem
we have some stragglers lagging behind
you mean almedha and pelleas are slowing us down again we have to reach the tower of guidance as soon as possible we cant have them always hampering our progress
but we have no idea when the disciples of order might attack we need to keep everyone together for safetys sake
reyson well rest here you can land and give your wings a break
reyson i remember when a trip like this would have exhausted you im impressed at how well youre handling it
yes physically im quite healthy but i cant say that im really happy about that 
why would that be
we of the heron clan can feel the energies of others in times of war negative energy is dominant and we sicken now that all of the people have been turned to stone the energy is gone and physically i feel much better its unsettling to feel healthy and know that the reason is such a sad one
its a terrible irony  we finally have the peace weve been praying for at the cost of all freedom everywhere
could this truly be the world that goddess ashera wants for us
no this is the world she had to give us after we ruined hers
 
ah welcome back any sign of the disciples of order
unfortunately no
i dont like this why are they leaving us alone
im not sure i see the problem tibarn if theyre going to let us stroll on through i wont complain
not me right or wrong i would prefer a stand up fight right now even
what are you saying tibarn how could you wish that upon us i dont understand you
right now the world is calm peaceful almost eerily so it almost feels comfortable if this goes on we might relax lose our edge im worried that well get careless
hmm 
everyone lets get one thing perfectly clear here this isnt a natural peace its asheras work dont forget for an instant that the world isnt supposed to be like this it should be noisy vibrant and chaotic
youre right a peace built on the sacrifice of so many lives is monstrous and unjust it cannot be allowed to stand
i didnt mean that im losing motivation to save the petrified people its just that before we started talking about it i was feeling complacent is it just me
the spirit of order is hanging heavy across the land when we fight we get a dose of chaos which may help us get back in touch with our true selves if our enemy has also figured that out it might explain why theyre staying away
pelleas dear how are you feeling
mother im fine please stop asking after my health
but youre so pale darling you were always such a sickly little boy  you should rest a while we cant have you exhausting yourself
no mother  if we stop walking now we would slow the others
never mind them sweetheart they can wait you should take a nice rest under that tree son remember that you are a scion of both daeins and goldoas royal families you are more important than any of these peasants the others can certainly wait for you dont spare a single thought for them
l let go of me leave me alone
haah
mother
pelleas 
im sorry mother i 
pelleas wait pelleas
weve spotted the enemy theyre over there to the southwest
how did they get so close without being noticed did we have men out of position
no i just checked in enemy forces just suddenly appeared with no sign or warning at all
guess thats one good thing about fighting a goddess  things are sure to be exciting everyone get in position
 an entire legion that can appear from nowhere who are these disciples
to be honest i dont care who they are i just want to knock a little disorder back into the world
my humblest apologies i hope we didnt sneak up on you im sure that cheeky little queenlet is still amongst you i hope so im going to make her pay for defying me uwee hee hee
im sorry to be late what unit would you like me to support
oh king pelleas you shouldnt endanger yourself besides i dont think well have too much trouble with these guys
i appreciate your concern but as the king of daein i fight for the people of all free countries it is my duty
wait where is your mother
w well 
listen i dont know what shes been telling you but dont throw your life away i appreciate that you want to help but this battle is beyond you try to stay out of the way
 y yes sir
uwee hee hee uwee hee hee i have always known that only i valtome possessed the grace and beauty to be chosen by the goddess how wonderful to finally be recognized for my excellence if only that insufferable zelgius could see me now i am divinity uwee hee hee
you are no soldier who are you boy
i  i am pelleas king of daein
oh how precious i was hoping that id meet the simpering moron who signed the blood pact with lekain  uwee hee hee
y you will regret this
ah there you are queen of hayseeds i look forward to scraping you off my immaculate nails uwee hee hee hee
lord valtome i desire no battle with you withdraw your troops immediately if you do so no more lives will be lost
uwee hee uwee hee hee  are you touched as well as homely i offer you the chance to surrender but you elincia i will only forgive if you beg and crawl and lick the sole of my left boot
im sorry that you feel that way if thats how it has to be may the goddess have mercy on you valtome
zelgius  where is zelgius do you think you can hide him that man must be uwee hee hee punished
sorry to disappoint you but zelgius is my prey theres no chance im passing him on to the likes of you
oh how quaint a bird do you seek to defeat me havent you herons learned its not safe to play with senators uwee hee hee beg for my mercy
mercy will be done when you and your fellows are gone from this world
the so called queen  where is that brazen little hussy bring her before me now right away immediately
are you the best that ashera could do this really is the end of the world
you are no soldier who are you boy
i  i am pelleas king of daein
oh how precious i was hoping that id meet the simpering moron who signed the blood pact with lekain  how funny uwee hee hee
y you will regret this
ah a crimean soldier yes ugh that queen of yours has no style what ridiculous armor you go out in that
i will brook no insult to my queen or my armor you face kieran second commander of the royal knights and your doom
whew thats just what i needed queen elincia are you hurt
do you all feel as alive as i do this is proof that we need a little chaos everyone understand that now
yes but it doesnt make me fond of war i know we cant stop but 
i understand elincia your path is important too leave the rough stuff to us
king tibarn  thank you
that was some good work you did back there
haaaa haaa haaa 
 ok just relax get it together 
haaa haa 
hmm ill go get the others you just sit down and catch your breath
haa huff  ahem
considering hes the only son of ashnard the mad king scourge of crimea and butcher of innocents he is quite the mamas boy
  hm  pelleas
queen almedha  you shouldnt be out here all by yourself its dangerous
 queen elincia
i was worried when i didnt see you at supper so i came looking for you
hmph i didnt think anyone in this merry band cared about me after all my own son is trying to avoid me
dont say that a lot of things have just happened  im sure pelleas is just confused hell come around
i hope youre right lady elincia can i ask you a question what of your mother was she also turned to stone
no  my mother died three years ago both my mother and my father were killed by king ashnard 
by ashnard i im sorry
lady almedha you were king ashnards wife correct
there was never a formal wedding ceremony so i suppose some would call me a mistress  but i was the only one he could ever call his wife and im the only one who can be called the mother of his child 
king pelleas
yes pelleas we were separated so long  finally having him back is the greatest gift imaginable
 forgive me for asking but why did king ashnard suddenly decide to invade crimea i want to know why my parents died
truthfully i dont know
you were closer to him than anyone didnt he say anything did he never explain his reasons
the last time i saw ashnard was long ago more than twenty years im afraid i dont know many state secrets from after that point
but why 
you look so surprised we had a falling out and ended up living separately  it happens rather a lot im afraid
no its just that  well you said that king ashnard had no other wives or children  i just assumed that you had always been by his side
ha ha  there was always gossip of course and i hated it but i know with absolute certainty  ashnard had relations with no other woman and so i said as much
so he did love you in his own way
love love ha ha  seriously  ha ha ha ha ha haa
wh whats so funny
there was no love between ashnard and me there was a strong mutual attraction between us eventually resulting in a child  but all i ever was to him was a source of power once i became pregnant i was useless to him bereft of my strength he found my presence nothing more than an irritating distraction after pelleas was born ashnard became obsessed with the boy  but once he realized pelleas had no special powers  ashnard rejected him and used him as bait in a cruel trap for my brother 
lady almedha
i  its just that i 
im sorry it was not my place to ask
where is he where is my pelleas hes the only thing that matters  i cant lose him ever please i beg of you bring me my pelleas tell him his mother needs him  hurry  bring me my pelleas
of course i ill bring him as soon as i can
oh rajaion  im so sorry please forgive me 
the journey to the tower of guidance becomes more difficult as asheras disciples of order hound the travelers every step micaiahs ability to sense danger proves invaluable as it gives her allies advance warning of attacks by the disciples thus prepared for each battle the group keeps casualties to a minimum
as they travel south through begnion micaiah and her company clash repeatedly with the disciples of order eventually they pass through the central mountains and into the lonely wastelands of the vast grann desert they are sustained only by their faith that they will reunite with their companions at the tower of guidance
reyson where are you
over here tibarn
what are you doing so early in the morning
im hunting for treasure
could you repeat that
i believe it was the goddess yune she sent me a message in my sleep i saw patches of ground that glowed i went to one of those spots and found this
a satori sign  dont see these very often its a good find but blast it reyson why didnt you wake me up
i didnt know what i would find besides you looked so comfortable
hm i didnt even notice youd snuck out i cant believe a heron snuck by me 
even heroes need their sleep to keep fighting tibarn wheres the harm in sleeping i know that you havent had a good nights rest since the incident in phoenicis
yeah but you know there must be something in the air  despite all thats happened i feel fantastic its a perfect day for hunting treasure and enemies
excellent
good morning queen elincia
oh good morning jorge it looks to be a pleasant day doesnt it
indeed and a splendid morning is the best time to present a queen with a fine gift
oh jorge  your kind thoughts are enough you and daniel have worked so hard to supply our army if you have something for me please let me pay you for it
even under these circumstances queen elincia you always try to be good to us thats why we wanted to give you a gift its a token of our appreciation
daniel 
well take payment for everything else but please take this one item without any protests its our pleasure
please queen elincia we insist
very well i suppose it would be quite rude of me not to accept it
wonderful
here it is please use it with our compliments
oh  this is a fire tome
yes its a very valuable one
so i can see i am not a mage but i feel great power from this tome
daniel and i happened to be in that building when there was the big flash of light thats how we escaped being turned to stone but you avoided it because you were one of the chosen
but we still want to help you we can collect weapons to help you in battle
please save the people who were turned to stone
please give us the world we used to have
i promise you i will do my utmost ill work toward it with everything i have together we can accomplish anything
/***EOF***/
how dull i dont sense any enemies nearby i know would you all like me to tell you a story as we climb
what kind of story
one from long ago long before the grandparents of anyone here were born
in the very beginning of this world there was only water until one day a girl appeared the girl was very clever and she forged the first land then she made trees and flowers and then she created beings
the story of the grand creation heard it wake me when its over
the girl was you right yune or are you talking about ashera
both really and neither actually at first the girl was excited by her new world and she thought of little else then she started feeling lonely everyone every being shed created was different from her not a single person that could truly understand her all alone she grew sadder and sadder crying for thousands of years then some creatures began to grow and change becoming more clever and sophisticated they tried to comfort the girl and eventually grew closer to her  that was the birth of the zunanma they were your ancestors beorc laguz everyone
in begnion we are taught that the zunanma were human—uhm i mean beorc ancestors   it makes me wonder what else in my country has been warped beyond recognition
its possible that the truth was simply misunderstood like the way everyone calls me a dark god 
but let me continue  the zunanma worshipped the girl as their own goddess they said her hair was as striking a color as dawns first light so they gave her a name  the goddess of dawn she was a much loved goddess
the goddess of dawn 
the zunanma continued to evolve and change giving rise to a variety of races and tribes across the land naturally each of the races thought their own was superior to the others and conflict arose between them
the goddess tried to make peace among her people but nothing could stop the warring zunanma trying to separate the factions the goddess gave them different names laguz and beorc  but this only intensified their conflict
and then the great flood occurred
the goddess was only trying to bring an end to the fighting but her power was so great that all the continents were drowned in the flood all except tellius
are you sure about this story its very different from the histories that weve each been taught
among beorc nations we only know a vague fairy tale about the dark god stirring up a great disaster
neither the laguz nor the beorc have an accurate description by the sound of it i wonder where the story got twisted
there is another standing in our way  i have a feeling he might be able to tell us
 fa   father
huh
my father  just beyond these doors my father is waiting
dheginsea king of goldoa  hes supposed to be one of the three who defeated the dark god yune
he has been blessed by ashera not only that but its a powerful resilient blessing from long ago he may be nearly impossible to defeat  lets get everyone together theres no better time than now
i was hoping to avoid this until we reached ashera  actually i hoped not to have to do it at all  but shes left me with no choice i will give you the blessings of yune goddess of chaos and freedom in their natural state the attacks of mortal creatures have no effect on divine beings
when ashera set out to defeat me she gathered her strongest warriors and bestowed on them some of her power this is called the goddesss blessing  she empowered the dual swords of the beorc swordswoman altina the laguz warrior soan and dheginsea the leader of the dragon tribe were also blessed
i failed then  but this time will be different ill use asheras own tricks and i wont be defeated everyone  take some time now to ready yourselves beorc be sure to equip your best weapons ill begin when everyones ready
i think were all ready ill need the laguz to transform
lets begin
ok im all done now whew  i  that was really hard  i think i  i think i need to rest
micaiah are you feeling all right you dont look so good
 im fine thank you sothe
what happened to yune
shes sleeping she wants us to take it from here
all right  if were all set lets move out
father
caineghis the great lion king  how many times have i said it now how many times have i warned against starting another war
i know old friend i know 
tibarn the great hawk king  how many times have i said it now how many times have i warned against starting another war
dont you dare preach to me you dried up old fool
naesala the great raven king  how many times have i said it now how many times have i warned against starting another war
and since when have i ever listened to the likes of you
we have betrayed our vow to our goddess we should have learned but the fighting never stopped now we must pay for our crimes we must take responsibility and accept asheras judgment
no you dont understand it wasnt the war that awoke the goddess it was my song  the galdr of release freed the goddess
 you cant expect me to believe that we will wait here patiently for the punishment we deserve if you are unwilling to await judgment 
you will stand against  the greatest of all dragons
father no why must we fight there must be a way to talk this through
its no use kurth we have no choice but to fight we must reach the goddess and not even the king of dragons can stand in our way
feel the power of asheras faithful
you have followed yunes path here that puts us irrevocably at odds im sorry it had to be this way
youve declared war on a goddess  a foolish action with terrible consequences
please let me pass gareth
i will not move such was the kings command
is there nothing i can do
no im sorry to be so hardhead ena but i must serve my king
maybe were the hardheaded ones  opposing our king and our goddess but weve chosen our path 
lady ena promise me youll look after him keep the prince safe
of course i promise  i will protect him at any cost
i was afraid it would come to this squared off with the very prince im supposed to protect what to do
gareth let me pass i need to reach my father
without the kings word i cant let that happen
do you mean to fight me
of course not you know i couldnt do that all i will do is stand here plant my feet and wait
gareth
prince kurthnaga it has been a privilege to serve you i wish you all the best
my prince  i was supposed to protect you but  i failed
no gareth it was i that turned my back on goldoa gareth  im sorry
i have lived long enough  ena i wish you the best 
nasir  nasir grandfather 
im sorry to see that you stand with the king grandfather
i turned on him once and i will never do it again will you follow your grandfathers example
you know that i wont i cant im sorry 
its all right my dear you can side with the prince stand by your convictions
nasir you must talk to my father convince him to stand down
 we have committed two crimes we ignored the will of our king and in so doing let war rise once more we must atone for our sins
 i am willing to accept my own punishment but is it right that the innocent  women and children who have never lifted a weapon  are also turned to stone
you cant change my mind i have made a solemn vow that i will never again betray my king
king dheginsea you are more powerful than any being alive  use that power to help us save the people
you are not the first to make such a request but my answer is the same now as it was before i will not change my mind i have no choice but to follow the will of our goddess
king dheginsea i dont understand  why why must we fight i just cant  i  i  i cant take it fighting only causes more pain and suffering why do this
 you remind me of a friend from long ago he was the kindest soul ive known but he was so terribly weak youve moved me more than youll ever know  but i will not budge i await my judgment
hello princess leanne you cant fight me  i advise you to stand down
sadness  your heart is filled with such sadness whats wrong cant we talk about it
i have nothing more to say to you this is the way it has to be my feelings do not matter
fools by denying your judgment you merely rush to your death
no  unh  has my body grown old or is it my heart 
your majesty 
come now ena fight
im sorry i cant i may have turned my back on my king and left my own country but i still belong to the dragon tribe i wouldnt dare attack my own king i couldnt
then as your king i order you i order you to fight for kurthnagas life
my king
you and he need each other you are different from other dragons
 very well your majesty
father please think about what youre doing
the time for words has passed the only option remaining is to stop you with brute force
why father why
that is enough no more sniveling you kurthnaga were to rule the dragon tribe in years to come show me that you would have been capable
but   yes sir  ill show you
in my eyes the mightiest of you looks no different than an infant can you hope to stand a chance
of of course i am sanaki 37th empress of begnion it is my duty to save my people even the worlds mightiest dragon will not dissuade me from that calling
all right then child fulfill your duty
you too deign to oppose the goddess ashera
i will do whatever is required to rescue those who were petrified i beg of you dragon king please reconsider what prince kurthnaga said to you
it is too late people in our weakness betray the gods and are meant to be punished for it
i cannot believe that people are capable of both terrible and wonderful things to describe them so simply and cynically does them a disservice
if i am defeated today that may convince me that i am wrong come  im waiting
i never would have believed that one day id be facing off against you life sure is funny sometimes
even you tibarn dont make me kill you you havent got a chance
dont be so sure about that you just might be surprised besides youve got a lot to answer for dheginsea youll finally pay the price for all those years of inaction and indifference as your kin were butchered and enslaved
you shortsighted fool you still dont understand  all right im waiting show me what youve got
have at you follower of yune
i wont live as long as you have and ill never be as powerful things like saving the world and fighting goddesses are just beyond me theyre out of my reach thats why ive always chosen to fight for the smaller things in life and the people close to me if that means i have to fight you to protect them then so be it
you youre one of the parentless 
you know me
yes i knew the first of your kind i have been alive for a very long time  perhaps too long but soon it will all be over
dheginsea dragon king i can see you have no intention of letting us pass
i follow my goddesss decrees my will is unwavering
i have no choice then be on your guard
very well beorc general our blessings may be equal and opposite but your strength is a mere fraction of mine show me your best
naesala you dare challenge me
heh its funny you should ask that  im not deluded enough to think that i can beat you the goddess herself would hesitate to fight you but my people are frozen solid and i have to delude myself enough to think that i can help save them
you are a true king naesala i am ready when you are
ill be thrilled if i land even a single blow im much better at fleeing than fighting
you  are of the wolf people
yes after the floods we built our country to the east of the great desert
 so we werent the only ones to survive 
until we met rafiel we too thought ours were the only people left
in your country are there only people of the wolf tribe
no beorc live there as well there are also a number of what you call the parentless children born of both laguz and beorc parents are still relatively few but they live normally among us
is that so
thats probably enough chatting do you still intend to block our path
 i will not deny my goddess
and i wont deny my conscience i will revive those turned to stone and you cannot stop me
 well done you have beaten me
father
dont lose your head now boy this wound  this is nothing your power  how could you defeat me i was blessed by ashera herself 
i gave them my blessings
yune is that you
that war long ago  im so sorry you were right to fight against me i was young and immature the great flood was a result of my unchecked emotions
you dont have to apologize yune i always knew that you werent actually evil  you were just too powerful
so why did you choose ashera again i had hoped that this time you would join me to help protect the people
im sorry yune but ive done worse to you 
long ago we made a vow before the goddess ashera herself  we vowed that we the laguz and beorc would never commit the same genocidal sins we didnt keep our promise  and for that reason i was committed to accepting my just punishment
silly stubborn old scalebag  you just dont know when to quit  you need to lighten up a bit
to convince the laguz kings to follow my example i rewrote history hid my tracks and declared you a dark god all i ever wanted was to avoid conflict  please forgive me
dont worry about it dheginsea i caused enough trouble for you so ill forgive you just this once
im pleased to hear that
gareth gather our survivors kurthnaga is their commander from now on
understood sir
nasir  you followed your sovereign very far for having once left your country in disgust  i give you my sincerest thanks
no my lord  unaware of my own kings true heart i did what i thought had to be done  i apologize
ena  i would like to tell you only that i wish you the greatest happiness in life
thank  thank you sire
now then kurthnaga  get these men moving i will remain here for i cannot move
yes father we will stop ashera wait here for our return we will be back
 yes my son ill be waiting
we must save them even now as we speak countless laguz slaves endure begnion chains they suffer terribly
we have done all that we will do
admonitions and censures change nothing now is the time for the dragon tribes to use their strength to save the oppressed laguz
goldoa does not interfere with the outside world as king of dragons i will not allow my people to fan the flames of war conflict on the scale you describe will wake the goddess and call down her judgment upon us all this is the path to destruction a thousand years  that is how long we swore to the goddess that there would be no war have you forgotten our covenant
of course not yet there are laguz who are treated as less than livestock i cannot believe that this is what the goddess wants
goldoa will not move this decree stands from the time our nations were formed the goddess has not yet slept one hundred and fifty years would you see the laguz and beorc destroyed would you see all of tellius awash in blood no unless destruction comes to seek us at our door goldoa will not move for the sake of future generations
tell me do you care nothing for the laguz who suffer in the current generation do you think it would comfort them to know that you condone their misery
all things require sacrifice
 
where are you going
to begnion i will find a solution without you
you who have lost your birthright all you will accomplish is your own destruction hold hold i say
my queen  rajaion  i will soon join you
my lovely almedha  cherish life 
its happening again  whose memory is that something feels so familiar about it is that  is that your memory
father   
kurth  hes gone 
i know this is simply another reason to move on  entrusted by my father to care for our people i will stand before ashera  as the king of the dragon tribe
are you all right micaiah
yes im fine how about you sothe are you all right youre not hurt
im not a child micaiah when are you going to start treating me like an adult
show me your hand
what
look at your hands theyre so big  they were so small when we met
micaiah 
ahh  sorry am i interrupting something
c commander
its all right ike how can we help you
i was scrounging around in my stuff and found some extra medicine i figured id ask around and see if anyone needed it
 i need to go get ready
hey theres no rush we still have  he didnt catch a word of that did he
im sorry about that
how long have you been with him
 a long time i met him when i was hiding out in the back alleys of nevassa over ten years ago he was so skinny but his gaze was so piercing  i wondered how such a young boy could look like that one day i noticed he was standing close to me just watching he continued like that for a few days one day i held out my hand he was suspicious of me but came over anyway he looked like a scared animal then his little hand slipped into mine it was shaking his fingers were so thin and frail i couldnt let go after that
after that we traveled together all over the continent no matter where we went we were always together
the first time i met him hed hidden on a ship we were taking he mentioned he was looking for someone who was like family to him it was you he was searching for wasnt it
i i tried to leave him behind when we went to crimea i split off from him and took a ship to begnion but when i reached begnion war had broken out between crimea and daein i knew i had to return to daein to look for him i couldnt find him so i went to crimea but i still couldnt find him  we found each other again after the war in daein in the back alleys of nevassa where we first met
you took routes opposite to each other
when i told him why id disappeared he got so angry  id never seen him get so emotional before
i cant say that i blame him id be pretty furious if i heard someone that i loved was wandering around two countries at war besides im sure hed hidden his feelings about being abandoned until he saw you again
i thought i was reaching the limit of how long i could stay with him he grew each and every day but i remained the same  i didnt want him to be harmed by the curse i lived with can you imagine how hard that would have been on him
you mean the blood of the laguz
so you knew did you find out from the boy whos always beside you
soren yeah i guess you both know how to recognize people with a similar nature
yes he and i are both branded
 dont use that word you and soren are both people just like me and everyone else
people youre just like yune you call both laguz and beorcs people
why should i care about the color of your hair eyes and skin or your ears wings or tail no matter how long you live or what powers you possess were the same at the end of the day were all people
  sothe talks that way too his time with you changed him thank you ike ive made up my mind
about what i didnt realize we were doing anything but talking
i thought i might travel to a far off place after all of this was over but i wont ill go back to daein no matter what happens ill have sothe by my side i have nothing to fear as long as hes with me
it seems the feelings between you two run both ways but thats probably the wisest choice for daein and sothe too anyway 
oh um  may i have some medicine
oh yeah i almost forgot survive micaiah we need you and the goddess you host to save the people of tellius
yes i know
zelgius is the black knight i dont know what to say  its unbelievable
what was he like in begnion
he was the right hand man of my most trusted aide duke sephiran of persis he was a hero a perfect general and the best swordsman in all of tellius he was never anything but loyal but he was serving another country
hmm it makes me wonder how sephiran is doing
i doubt hes been turned to stone even though he was captured by lekain and forcibly removed from his post hell have found a way to persevere sigrun always said theres no other master of the arcane arts who can compare with the duke of persis
makes you wonder doesnt it
ike  dont tell me you suspect sephiran
well look at the facts 
do not trouble your mind with that thought he would never betray me
its nice to think so but if hes not petrified hed have received a message from yune so where is he
the goddess isnt perfect she said so herself maybe the message didnt reach everyone
 you have to admit thats a weak excuse lets leave it at that for now we need to focus on moving forward
please lets oh i almost forgot i have something for you
what is it
um  uh  well youre my trusted aide just like sephiran you have to live so protect yourself with this
a mercenary with a contract to act as aide to the empress of begnion whod have thought but thank you sanaki
youre welcome ike and thank you
ike take a look at this
hey now  whered you stumble across it
inside the tower i thought of using it myself but 
yeah i dont think that its right for you
 indeed thats why i brought it here for you to use
thanks its a very rare item im in your debt
its the least i could do
ike take a look at this
hey now  whered you stumble across it
lying around inside the tower it seemed like the sort of thing i should bring to your attention
thats very nice of you but you didnt have to do whatever you want with it
really do you think id be able to use it
well dont get hasty i dont think its right for you
 i know im just kidding ike
thanks its a very rare item ill cherish it
please do
micaiah have you ever seen one of these
yes leanne i have thats a very powerful artifact actually it would be of great help to us with whats been happening
i found it inside the tower do you think i can use it
um  i dont think so leanne but you can try if you like 
 im only kidding here you can have it
oh for me thank you very much its a very precious item ill make good use of it
please do
/***EOF***/
hey have you heard the sub humans are retreating
general zelgius is amazing as long as we have him begnion has nothing to fear
ahem gentlemen this is no time for idle chatter however if you wish to praise general zelgius i suppose that is all right he is the glory of our forces after all
its true as long as he leads us we wont be afraid of any dirty sub humans
gah that insufferable fool i cannot believe he killed one sub human and ended the battle who gave him an order like that1 i dont care for such a petty victory
i understand my lord i was hoping that this would be the end of the sub humans once and for all however can we really punish him for winning the battle
no you fool thats what makes it even more bothersome zelgius and the apostle are both making mockeries of the senate theyre more of a threat to begnion than those filthy sub humans are
my lord please let me fix this painful situation i shall take to the battlefield and earn us the result begnion desires
that does sound lovely i admit but hasnt general zelgius ordered all forces to cease fire for three days
who is in charge here my lord must you follow zelgiuss orders
hah i see your point i shall leave everything to you then make begnion proud lord lombroso
ranulf has started his retreat tibarn and his men are gathering information on zelgiuss forces before he left tibarn asked me to take you to gallia where youll be safe are you ready to go
no i wont leave ike i wont leave this place
reyson please 
ive lived with the hawk tribe for twenty years they are my family ill  ill stay here and fight
 well since i can see i wont be changing your mind  you can join up with us the greil mercenaries can stay here as long as we want after all were not on anyones payroll right now were free agents
ike  thank you
ike come out here hurry its the begnion army
what
what are they doing here1 it hasnt been three days yet
it seems they couldnt care less they are demanding the castle back if we dont comply theyll attack
they were probably waiting for both the gallians and the hawk tribe to leave the castle
oh they think they can take us now that were all alone huh they obviously dont know who theyre up against lets make them remember the name of the greil mercenaries everyone get in position lets take them out
fools cant you see that youre outnumbered you have sided with the laguz and betrayed the empire the senate will be happy to see the likes of you dead and buried
the outcome of a battle depends solely on the number of troops in the field tactics and skill are nothing in the face of sheer numbers wait are you laughing at me gah die you insolent cur
hmph pathetic your tiny band of outlaws doesnt stand a chance before our might we have more troops on the way the onslaught will not stop until every last one of you lies dead
are you really the best begnion could send
what how dare you take that tone with me
or did they send you at all does general zelgius know about this little excursion
i dont take orders from that sanctimonious has been enough questions prepare to die
im impossible but now we outnumbered them 
general lombroso has fallen r retreat fall back to base camp
theyre retreating that was close
hey hold on a minute whats going on here we hurry back and you dont save us anyone to fight
sorry about that youre back sooner than i expected how far out did you scout
we went to the enemys headquarters castle gaddos as promised the begnion forces were waiting quietly in their castle apparently some of their soldiers disobeyed orders but we can trust zelgius to keep the rest in line i have other news however i ran into someone quite unexpected on the outskirts of enemy territory
who
the commander of the holy guards
general sigrun
yeah she was by herself she seemed hesitant to get near castle gaddos it was odd i figured since shes a friend and loyal to the apostle why not try to get some information from her she wouldnt budge tough girl that one she wasnt at all surprised to see me then she said in such a sad voice please escape at once
i wonder what she meant by that it cant be a good sign this whole mess is getting worse by the minute
general zelgius general sigrun of the holy guards is here to see you should i let her through
general sigrun let her through at once
is something the matter general you do not look well should i send for something water perhaps
general zelgius i  i carry an order from the senate the cease fire has been repealed you are ordered to destroy the laguz alliance and their allies as well
what the enemy has already lost the will to fight the apostle and lord sephiran would never agree to such a terrible plan
 
general sigrun
lord sephiran of persis has been stripped of his titles as prime minister and head of the senate he is currently under arrest and is charged with committing high treason and fomenting rebellion
no impossible this is madness
it doesnt end there the apostle has gone into seclusion with illness as the stated reason
damn it theyve been captured
ive ordered my subordinates to find out where the apostle is but i have yet to hear any word general zelgius i beg of you follow the senates orders our friends lives are at risk
 curse those senators
you called for me your majesty
it is nice to see you micaiah you remain daeins goddess of victory but i never see your face around here anymore are you busy in town
your majesty my room in the castle is much to lavish for my taste id rather be in town helping with the reconstruction its good work and it makes me happy to help our people
how precious still obsessed with garnering the adoration of peasants are we arent you past that yet my dear
mother please stop micaiah is my dear friend she is the only person i have to turn to for a kind word now that izuka and the black knight have both left daein they mysteriously disappeared on the day of my coronation  do you think theyll ever return
im quire sure that they were both kidnapped by those who wish harm upon you my beloved son those mongrels intend to throw the country into chaos by holding daeins leaders hostage but mother will always protect you pelleas i will never leave you not for one moment when you seek kind words or good advice you must come to me and no one else
i understand mother
the royal blood of daein runs through your veins do not be afraid of your heritage reign over your people as a king whatever popularity that girl might garner from the peasants is of little consequence she is your obedient subject after all now give her your orders
micaiah daeins maiden of dawn your king requires your service once more mobilize the daein royal army immediately
another war against who
we are answering the request from the begnion empire to wipe out the barbaric laguz alliance your targets are  gallias sub humans
during the war between the laguz alliance and begnion the three remaining countries on tellius  daein crimea and goldoa  have thus far remained neutral
in daein the war for independence is over and prince pelleas has been crowned king daein is now free from begnions rule and is once again universally recognized as a sovereign nation micaiah decides to honor the promise she had made and continue on as the general of daeins armies until the country stabilizes most of her companions remain by her side helping to restore their beloved country it is their hope that daein will recover soon both politically and socially focused as they are they realize that they can spare no time on outside concerns including the current war in begnion
however king pelleas has a mysterious change of heart and orders micaiah into the war  on begnions side
 
you need something from me fearless leader
i thought you were asleep
yeah i was until you came within fifty paces of me yaaaaaawn 
do you mind fighting alongside us
i like it fine as long as i can catch some sleep i dont care where i am what can i do for you
ever since you joined us ive been meaning to ask you about jill the last id heard you were running some kind of delivery service with her how did you end up passing through crimea and then coming here
i stopped to chew some fat during a delivery thats all
hows jill these days
last i heard she got mixed up with the army again fighting for daeins emancipation
i see dont you think you ought to go back to daein and give her some support
shes a big girl now she doesnt need me always lookin over her shoulder jill can do whatever she wants
i dont understand i thought you two were  you know living under the same roof and all
shes the daughter of my dead teacher nothing more hey if you dont want me hanging around feel free to just say so all right
no it isnt like that youre great on the battlefield i appreciate you being here
good i like your mercenary group theyre laid back and we have the same goal crushing the empire
thats true
anyhow is that all im gonna nap until we deploy dont wake me up until then
all right
hey  wait
hmm
see that bag on my wyvern theres a souvenir in there for you feel free to take it
a souvenir
its a small thing you dont need to thank me  yaaawn  zzz  zzz 
asleep already what a strange guy
/***EOF***/
good luck ill be sure to keep the palace safe im sorry we couldnt allocate more troops for you youll be ok though right
of course we might even have too many actually im more worried about the queens safety make sure the guards stay sharp
count on it ill maintain a tight watch on the area and there is the backup plan just in case
good  hearing you reiterate that makes me feel better i have to admit
remember this isnt for glory youll be confronting our own people just do your job and come straight back
the royal knights have left the capital we estimate roughly 4000 soldiers are marching on felirae
that means about 2000 are left in the capital  thats more than id expected  hmm i suppose it cant be helped the column headed toward felirae is primarily cavalry is it not
yes sir exactly as you surmise sir
in that case the forces at the capital will be led by the queens confidante lady lucia this is most perfect the soldiers remaining at castle felirae have been given detailed instructions false instructions i might add  the dear pawns they are so very heroic and so very disposable
general all troops are in position we stand ready for the assault
thank you kieran the majority of the castle vanguard appears to be common soldiers and theres still no sign of ludveck or any of his subordinates
correct sir and the rest are a bunch of amateurs you should see them flop around on their horses like rag dolls they wont last long against the finely tuned skills of our crimean royal knights
dont get overconfident now  most of their forces are likely inside waiting for us to exhaust ourselves out here
yes good point sir
and the main gate  have you seen it breaking through that is not going to be easy we must be patient
yes sir
and remember were not facing enemy soldiers yes theyre foolish enough to be lured into joining ludveck but they are fellow crimean citizens her majesty would prefer to capture these rebels alive and try to talk some sense into them
im amazed sir her majestys kindness is touching ill convey that to all our men
listen up were to sweep aside the rebels and punch through the fortress gate her majesty wants as many lives to be spared as possible set lances all forces charge
not one step backward be strong the duke will soon arrive with reinforcements stand strong a little longer  stand firm for the revolution
w we have to hold out the duke is on his way well be heroes adored and showered with riches
duke  duke ludveck  where are our reinforcements 
rebel forces i am geoffrey commander of the royal knights of crimea lay down your weapons and submit to the rule of law further resistance is futile her majesty the queen promises leniency and means you no harm listen to me you must yield
tch  what nonsense is this do you take us for idiots our reinforcements will arrive shortly and your fate will be sealed death to the tyrant and her lapdogs
grr  the queen lives to serve you why cant you see that
sir the rebels have been routed some managed to escape but most have surrendered their weapons
 general geoffrey no sign of the felirae regulars is there
 no this was clearly a ruse duke feliraes main force is most likely en route to the capital
but how quickly rally the troops we must return to melior at once
dont panic they want us to act rashly settle down  we have contingencies in place light the flares to notify the capital move man
scout commander
its very likely well be ambushed on the way back to the capital dont let anything escape your notice we may need an alternate route back to the capital  send some men out to investigate the old highway
those of you who remain disarm the prisoners and tend the wounded lets move everyone
 well look at that someones launched a flare  and from felirae of all places
the emergency signal from geoffrey as i suspected  the rebels were just a decoy sir haar thank you for your assistance
hey wait  are you telling me that you knew about this all along
we knew the duke was up to no good but if we had known about the decoys we wouldnt have sent the royal knights to castle felirae i suppose im just surprised that lord ludveck the supposed epitome of nobility would so willingly sacrifice his followers
you know you play a pretty deep game woman
we all do wouldnt you say her majesty is at fort alpea were due to hear from her at any moment ill go check on that
sharp as a tack arent we i think ill excuse myself then 
actually theres one more thing  i want you to wait here a little longer if all goes as planned ill be back shortly with your payment then you may do as you wish
and if all doesnt go as planned
then set out for fort alpea and alert the queen ill also send a messenger to geoffrey thank you
very well time for a nap 
 
 well any news from queen elincia
what how
you 
yes me i was very hurt by how cruelly you manipulated me my lady and i am not easily wounded
lord ludveck  how did you 
my lady i am certain to know of any and all facts that concern your activities my dear lovely lucia oh yes it was quite some time ago that i was informed of both this place and your network of shadowy assistants
ah
i would like to know one more thing  something only you are aware of  where the queen is currently hiding
good luck finding that out
perhaps its a little place called alpea all that foolishness  the ruses the informers the secret flight from the palace  ha ha ha  all that effort wasted
 is that so
hm i can see that my lady still retains secrets would it trouble you so much to tell them to me
to you lord ludveck i am afraid there is nothing to tell
lady lucia  im done with these games youll tell me whatever i wish to know  but i believe i already know your secret
we shall see
having anticipated queen elincias attack the majority of duke ludvecks forces left felirae the troops stationed at castle felirae were merely the bait with which to lure geoffrey and his troops away from melior
in geoffreys absence ludvecks objective is nothing less than to take the royal palace and queen elincia with it lucia foreseeing a possible attack on the capital arranged for queen elincia and princess leanne to be secretly moved to fort alpea
yet lucia herself is unable to evade duke ludvecks agents she is captured in the dead of night while attempting to contact an informant
queen elincia receives the sad news the next morning
come on in
may i
well speak of the devil if it isnt general geoffrey himself i wouldnt have expected a visit since youre leaving tomorrow
hi general geoffrey what can we do for you today
sorry amy but im not here as a customer
huh
oh i see why youre here its about time too im ready to string that blathering drunkard up by his heels
ta dah  whoops  who put that chair there i could have been killed lady calill you beckoned
makalov why are you drinking you realize that tomorrow we have a battle to fight yes
greetings general my youre looking even more dashing and handsome than usual your excellency
good grief  that mans an embarrassment are you sure hes a royal knight hes like a pig pretending to fly why not put a dog in armor and call it sir
miss calill thats not very nice i think sir makalov deserves a little more respect than that
are you blind astrid its the night before a mission and that fool is stinking drunk probably gambled all his money away too and you you follow him around mooning over him and cleaning up his messes do you have no pride girl what the man needs is someone to slap some sense into him perhaps i should  
ive chosen to look after sir makalov nobodys forced me to do it and its really none of your business
you know im really starting to wonder about your good upbringing of all the men out there what possessed you to place your bets on such a shabby prospect
wh what did you just say there are no gentlemen in this land half as fine as sir makalov
oh my 
all right settle down everybody keep this up and the generals gonna pretend he doesnt know either of you
fine fine im sorry all right happy so  what was it that you needed with that ale soaked oaf anyway
i just wanted to go over our battle plan one last time before retiring
i heard youre going after the duke of felirae you think you can handle him
of course however hes been marshalling his forces for quite some time now which means our preparations will have to be flawless if we want to end this quickly
if only i were up to it you know me hah id crush him id kick him apart
well i suppose i could go someone of my wisdom and power is easily worth two of you clods
yeah thats a great idea lamb blossom like i always say the best enemies are the ones that are on fire
im sorry but no although i do appreciate the enthusiasm
i dont see the problem do you think ive gone soft my magic is still in tip top shape ill have you know
no its just that im sure queen elincia wouldnt be pleased with civilians fighting against their countrymen
hmm i suppose you have a point
in that case let danved join you danved is not a citizen of crimea danved will fight like ten men
devdan when did you get here
actually general  this uh  this is not devdan this is a friend of mine danved
yes its true people often make that mistake but danved is definitely not devdan
uh huh you look exactly like him
doesnt he amazing isnt it anyway you can take him with you oh and no pressure but the fate of our country depends on the royal knights good luck dont blow it
danved will fight like a bear like a tiger we dont need largo and calill because danved is pretty amazing
uh  i understand i think thank you for your help
well i suppose thats settled its time for you to discuss tomorrows tactics good luck with that as for that useless drunk  ill have someone carry him over later
thank you
sir makalov is not useless how many times do i have to say it
astrid its about time you got back as well
y yes general forgive me ill hurry back as soon as sir makalov is feeling better
give me strength  the sooner the better
your majesty what are you doing with that lance
i asked your servant for it and he gave it to me
why would your majesty as queen do such a thing who knows how tangled the web of rumors could become because of that 
let the court say what it wishes you are far more important to me than the whispers of nattering nobles
 you dont need to say that
geoffrey  im sorry
i dont understand whats wrong
three years ago  you fought to free crimea from the clutches of daein while you held this lance your courage was dauntless and your prowess legendary
yes its a brave lance and im very proud of it
i  i cant have you raise the same lance against your fellow people of crimea im sorry  i just cant
your majesty is worried about the shadow it would cast over my name the dishonor of using that weapon on crimeans
i would never want to damage your pride as a knight it would be too much to bear
believe no such thing your majesty my pride as a knight is most deeply rooted in my service to you that will never waver no matter what elincia  you know that
then take your lance use it to fight for crimea once again
forgive my tardiness sir kieran second in command of the royal knights at your service
sorry to have disturbed your rest
not at all if it were your will general i would hasted to the very edge of the world at your calling
kieran im lucky to have such a devoted follower this is no reward but theres something i want you to have
a silver axe th this is  its so sharp do you mean i can have it
do you like it
like it my heart is ready to burst i feel  its like its my birthday and i just got my first suit of armor
wonderful im glad to hear it
it will look fabulous on the mantel my family will enjoy it for years to come i cant tell you how grateful i am
kieran thats an axe not a painting paintings are for mantels axes are for fighting i want you to use that axe
what i couldnt
you cant refuse its an order
sigh  understood sir i promise to keep it well protected and free from scratches
sigh youre hopeless
/***EOF***/
lehran  i will not countenance this plan
hear me goddess ashera  yunes imprisonment within the medallion has begun to change you order and chaos you are one being comprising both parts the one must naturally affect the other
even so i will not return yune to this body she is unstable and i must be perfect in order to protect this world it is as i have said yune must be destroyed
ashera you mustnt you cannot survive without your opposite please you must not do this your world still needs you
lehran you have ever been a wise and kind  hearted child in deference to you i will place my faith in your kind one last time for the next thousand years i shall sleep as well when i wake again i hope it is to a world of peace and order where all prosper as equals if i do then i will know that you have advised me well i will reward your counsel i will also allow yune to return to me i will once again be the goddess of creation whole and complete ashunera the dawn goddess  the name your ancestors gave me so long ago i should like to hear it again
however during this thousand years if the chaos of war should arise and awaken yune from her slumber in the medallion  i will know that you have strayed from your path and i will punish your failure as i would reward your success and then you will know my judgment you will pay for your sins each of you to the last
in the names of our people we vow to keep this covenant there will be no great war between laguz and beorc for a thousand years so pledge altina of the beorc dheginsea of the dragon tribes soan of the beast tribes and i lehran of the bird tribes
if you believe during this thousand years that you have created a world that has outgrown the atrocities of war  or if you feel the world has fallen beyond hope of redemption you may sing the galdr of release and awaken us both your heirs will possess that ability as well  sing to awaken us and tell us your tale tell us of the world your two kinds have built in our absence we will listen and we will judge fairly and impartially this is our covenant with you
its her 
ashera
ashera its me yune can you hear me
 
please please listen to me you dont need to pass any more judgment you can return the people to normal
i cannot there are still people in my world who are made of fallible flesh this imperfect world has passed beyond control now i shall pass my final judgment
wait you cant violate the terms of the covenant ashera one thousand years still hasnt passed we were woken by galdr not by mankinds war
it doesnt matter
during my long sleep beorc and laguz continued to fight the children of flesh will never learn nor grow time will pass as always but nothing can change the destiny of mankind
you have to look deeper the first judgment didnt turn everyone to stone and ill tell you why because these people are not people as we know them ashera these people have become something new
people  the zunanma  are the only living creatures of this world that we didnt create animals evolved to become zunanma who then became laguz and beorc that evolution continues today
ashera  ill tell you a secret you didnt know  children can be born of both a beorc and laguz parent they are still very few in number but if allowed to flourish mankind might become anything if the two races continue to evolve im sure something wonderful will emerge you cant just bring that to a halt
do not claim certainty of anything the children of this world are born of chaos and nothing could be more uncertain the world does not require the evolution of man my responsibility is to protect order the balance of all life forms beings that evolve without my guidance will only destabilize and threaten this world because of that  
you have to wipe out everything made of flesh is that what youre trying to say  very well then
you and i have nothing more to talk about my only choice is to defeat you
yune do not be absurd  you cannot overthrow me just as i cannot overthrow you
of course not but they can everyone the time has come defeat ashera or everyone you love will be a statue forever
these people they carry your blessing yune  you mean to fight me
ashera our goddess  this is the world  and we are the people  you created you make it sound as if were some sort of filthy creatures that just decided to settle down here and cause trouble
ike dont say it like that
were not perfect sometimes our brains tell us one thing while our emotions tell us another and war  the more we try to avoid it the worse it is when it comes to us
people are probably the dumbest creatures alive
but  somehow youre also the most endearing its your imperfections that make you so interesting  imperfections very similar to ours
we know that weve messed up well do our best to avoid more war and to make peace our highest priority ashera just give us one more chance all we ask for is one more chance
you expect me to reverse my judgment the goddess of order cannot be so mercurial my decision is final
so thats how its going to be huh then we will fight   and we will save our people make your peace with whatever the gods worship your end is near
my end  is near
in every battle that mattered in my life ive always been the one left standing no matter how slim my chances this battle means more than any of the others because its for the life of every person that ive ever cared about i will win this fight
ike  um  were you joking when you said you couldnt remember how we met
well sorta it was a long time ago
how could you forget
relax soren i got to thinking and i remembered i remember what happened in gallia on the day we first met
ike 
mother had gone shopping with mist that day i was wandering around the village all alone i walked to the edge of the forest looking for a stick i could pretend was a sword there was a raven haired boy lying on the ground
i remember the huge oak tree by the clearing  id been sleeping in the hollow by the roots
he looked like he was my age he was as skinny as a twig wearing rags and covered in dirt he looked like he was near death i took out my lunch and i handed it to him he made a noise like a scared animal and shied away he was suspicious of me at first but eventually he took my sandwich and started to eat it was like hed never eaten before in his life i didnt have anything else to feed him so i told him to come to my house but he kept shaking his head no
i was afraid you were going to trick me afraid that you were going to chase me away after taunting me with food just for a laugh 
i told the boy that id bring him some food the next day at the same time and place he finally nodded when i said that it made me happy i felt like i was doing something right helping this boy like i was the only one whod do that
 i was happy too not just because i wasnt hungry anymore because someone finally would talk to me so i went back to the village again the next day i was scared of the other villagers and their rocks and sticks but i still went back
thats right that was gallia back then the beorc abused and tormented the branded because the laguz shunned them they wanted to avoid upsetting the laguz
the villagers threw stones at me called me an animal and a devil but on the next day the village was littered with corpses soldiers and peasants were in a panic
it was my dad he went crazy when the spirit of chaos in the medallion touched him
i walked through the empty streets checking bodies to see if you were dead but i couldnt find you i decided that you had to be alive i took money and food from the village and headed for crimea a land of beorcs
soren 
on my way to crimea i kept seeing laguz from the beast tribe they were terrifying but after a while i realized something they never attacked me they all seemed to notice something about me and then pretend they couldnt see me that look was burned into my mind and it was always the same theyd scowl then walk away like theyd never noticed me in a way that left me feeling older and more alone than if theyd attacked me hate  that i could understand this was denial they made me feel like i wasnt supposed to exist at all that my simply being alive was an affront to the world that was how the beasts treated me and i hated them for it it sat in my heart like a lead bar like a glacier
 
when i reached crimea i took refuge in a church along the way they took my brand to be a sign that i had been trained in the arcane arts they took good care of me and taught me things once i had learned to speak and behave like other people i wandered crimea for several years then i finally found you
but id 
yes youd forgotten that day in gallia but i didnt care my only wish was to see you again i just wanted to see the only boy who had held out a warm hand when i had nothing
soren  dont cry
dont cry what im not crying 
soren youre smart but youre no good when it comes to your emotions come over here
d dont treat me like im a child im not that  
come on
shut up shut up 
then ill come over to you
its all in the past soren 
 sniff  sniff  gwuh  wahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh
forgive me goddess i must end my service to you now my dear goddess ashera please forgive me
lehran 
everything ive done was a mistake this is all a result of my weakness the changes were unbearable to watch too frightening to understand it grew painful to accept change and with that my heart filled with cowardice i was overwhelmed by the pain and could think of nothing but soothing it as long as i suffered i was blind to anything else even to the beautiful things of the world i can see it now  the people deserve compassion they deserve to have their lives back
no you were always too flexible too inconstant you cannot sway me any further
ashera  my goddess  please
be silent now and watch as i erase these things that confuse your simple heart
 
everyone listen carefully in order to reach ashera we must first destroy the aura protecting her got it attack the aura
you would face me in battle i need no further evidence of your kinds imperfections this will hardly be a battle at all simply an end perish flawed one
the aura is gone
excellent now we can finish this
 
youre lehran 
prince kurthnaga  how youve grown
you know who i am
i resided in goldoa for more than seven hundred years
i  i had no idea
thats because i was kept in hiding but i did meet you several times when you were just an infant
i remember a a mysterious man with black wings was that you i always thought it was a dream 
 
i was always so fascinated by that man and his songs  i remember him well and fondly
you finally made it sephiran
sanaki i 
i was starting to wonder how i would punish you
im sorry
you are my subordinate after all i have decided that leaving ones empress to die is punishable by drowning in a pool of rancid butter
of course it is my empress
i hope youre a strong swimmer
um 
yes
youre lehran arent you
yes
you  forgive me for asking but  arent you my  
can we talk about this later
what oh i mean of course  sorry to bother you 
child you couldnt possibly bother me its just the talk you and i must have is going to take a long time i dont think ashera would wait for us to finish
oh  very well
what is it
oh nothing  never mind
micaiah
y yes
looks like you could use some backup im good with a staff too you know
th thank you
sephiran  i mean lehran 
i cant apologize enough i was so terribly mistaken and now theres nothing i can do to help
dont worry
what z ike wanting to do something that matters is enough sometimes how you feel is more important than how you act
ike i  theres no one that i think more highly of 
no time for compliments we still have work to do here
yes  yes we do
you would face me in battle i need no further evidence of your kinds imperfections this will hardly be a battle at all simply an end perish flawed one
it is tragic that you are too limited to see how hopeless this is you cannot hope to defeat the divine
youre right we cant hope to defeat you
then why continue
you havent left us much choice id rather die like this instead of being turned into some mindless statue
simpleminded fool 
dont waste your energy fleshling you are physically unable to harm me
yune  im fine i can hear you no im not afraid i know youre with me
ah son of the dragon king  you may be the greatest among the enfleshed but you are no match for me
goddess ashera please listen to me we know that we are clearly imperfect but you unnaturally created of pure order  might that not be considered an imperfection
no i am perfect free of emotion i have no doubts therefore i commit no errors
lehran you have joined my enemies
my goddess  never before have i defied you in even the least thing but i have seen the error of my ways and wish to save the people whom i once desired to destroy i am one man and my life is precious how much more precious are the lives of the countless multitudes
 
its over its all over 
we did it our fighting is finally done now the people 
now the people should all turn back to normal
yes
lets get out of here im sure the others are getting tired of waiting for us outside
wait
huh
 
what  whats going on this is insane we defeated her 
you defeated nothing this is nothing at all out of the ordinary mortals cannot defeat the divine it is not possible
but  we won  general ike  we have to fight one more time the people out there need our help
you can try as many times as you like the result will always be the same there is no way for you to win
i cant believe that general ike you can do it forge a new destiny for us ike please  youve got to
i dont need encouragement id fight to the end no matter what ashera you cant stop me it doesnt matter if youre a goddess it doesnt matter if i have no way to win fighting defines me and i will not lose
when will you tiresome gnats surrender
we have to put an end to this take all the power i have
thank you ill use it well
what of you are you leaving
i am but i believe its for the best this world does not need gods we have always failed you weve made you weak thats why we must go
you dont have to leave
hm
its true we dont have much use for gods but well  you show us what we should aspire to we need inspiration you give us a reason to grow to become more than we are
and if we dont have that yune were nothing more than statues
can you forgive me for the pain ive caused
i dont know but you have already forgiven us how could we not
we are all family we will try to understand one another even when we disagree
youre right i will try one more time
/***EOF***/
micaiah whats going on i heard that you took ill on the field are you all right what happened
what do you think genius micaiah fainted because youve been pushing her too hard shes terrified that she wont live up to your expectations
i didnt realize  i am so sorry micaiah
according to the doctor she is suffering from severe exhaustion she must stay in bed for a time
well im glad that she is all right do you think it will take long for her to recover we must stop the laguz after all our task is not complete
ok thats it are you out of your mind im getting micaiah out of here at this rate if the laguz that we shouldnt be fighting dont kill her you certainly will
what b but you cant leave
oh yeah id like to see you stop me i held out until now thinking it was best for daein i was wrong were through with you
please sothe you must reconsider micaiah cant leave now
king pelleas i agree with sothe let lady micaiah go she has done enough
no dont leave please im begging you i need micaiah to stay
p pelleas what are you doing
our army cannot function without micaiah i cant let that happen the army must continue the fight
listen i dont know what deals youve made with the empire behind our backs but i wont let you hurt her anymore
if micaiah leaves the army she will die
so now the king shows his true colors  pelleas i dont care if youre the king threaten micaiah again and ill kill you where you stand is that clear
she wont be the only one to die you me every single person in daein well all die and its all my fault
pelleas you didnt  you signed a blood pact didnt you
you signed a blood pact with the senate after you were crowned thats why youve been so scared so terrified as of late oh my son 
what is a blood pact
micaiah you should try to  
please tell me your majesty what is a blood pact
i i swear to you i didnt know i had no idea 
what could be so urgent that the empires messenger would pay a visit at this hour has something happened
king pelleas  please prepare to receive vice minister lekain
what
how do you do king pelleas
h how did you get here
our empires magical research has made leaps and bounds this rewarp staff is our latest invention with this staff one can get to any desired destination instantly isnt that just wonderful before this lovely little item we used that ghastly warp powder it worked well enough but would completely exhaust whoever used it whats the use of someone traveling anywhere they wish if theyre too exhausted to do anything afterward itd take a very strong soldier to withstand the powders side effects the rewrap staff solves that problem
vice minister 
ah now ive said too much i just cant help myself i love innovation so
um  if i may what is the purpose of your visit
oh yes no time for idle chatter we have a favor to ask of you your majesty as you are no doubt aware the false apostle has raised an army of sub humans to reclaim her throne we require the use of the daein army to wipe out this upstart laguz alliance would you be so kind
i  im afraid i cannot deploy my army on begnions behalf my country cannot continue to rebuild while fighting a war please understand
ah so you reject our request then ive no choice but to watch you and your people perish slowly
what you came here to make threats
the terms of our pact are quite clear in this document
thats the treaty i signed on the day of my coronation i dont see how this pertains to  
all will be made clear young pelleas yes this is the same document you my naïve young king signed it believing it was an oath of reparation from begnion sadly for you however 
what are you telling me
in truth this wonderful scrap of parchment is a blood pact once you sign the paper in blood you can never break the terms of the pact
a blood pact but izuka said he saw no problems with the terms of the treaty  no izuka no how could he 
thats right izuka is one of us he found the perfect king who would execute the senates will
i cant believe it i wont
youd better start believing it youve at least heard stories of the forbidden blood pact havent you its a marvelous tool used by the wise to control the foolish a ruler agreeing to the pact is bound to it absolutely once sworn the pact will punish any transgression against its terms with the complete destruction of his country
you you cant be serious thats impossible
calm yourself young king and listen ill tell you an interesting story long ago a foolhardy king signed a blood pact with the empire to take back his lost kingdom in exchange for his country he vowed complete obedience he soon broke the terms of the pact and began to disobey the empire presumably he didnt understand the power of the oath hed sworn  would you like to hear what happened after he defied the empires will
 what
it was quite tragic one man died on the first day he was only a peasant so no one really noticed two more died on the second day three more on the third day i think you can see where this is going the wave of mysterious deaths spread across the kingdom like a contagion after thirty days the king finally realized that this was the curse of the blood pact the price of infidelity he apologized to the empire and pleaded with them to lift the curse his plea was graciously accepted on the one hundredth day by then the king had lost half of his subordinates as well as his lovely wife and child that country remained under the control of the senate for a very long time
i hope ive made myself clear no matter how you struggle you have no choice but to follow the orders given to you by the empire no matter how noble your motives defiance against us will result in the death of your nation this you must never forget ahhh and one more thing  if youre considering seeking aid from outside of daein think again we have spies and informants in every corner of tellius we will know immediately if you tell anyone
let me get this straight everyone in daein will die if you disobey the senate
what a heavy burden  it cannot be
show mother the mark of your pact
its true  this is the mark of a blood pact my son has been deceived
oh give it up you expect us to buy that ghost story its just something to scare little kings into eating their vegetables before you go shining begnions boots get some proof of the senates claims
 
weve done enough here micaiah lets go well let them find out if that story is real or not
its all true sothe
what
king pelleas and queen almedha are telling us the truth its hard to believe but i can see it  my power hasnt gone away it was just weakened from exhaustion this is all so horrible  now daein can never be free from the senates leash
even if its true micaiah that doesnt mean you have to go to war again we could leave daein 
but without me who would hold our forces together leaving the army would be the same as abandoning the people of daein i wont do it
but 
im sorry everyone im so sorry  i i i didnt know 
king pelleas  what then do you propose we do
why obey the empire of course we have no other choice in the matter as long as i follow the senates orders no one will die because of me
no i cant accept that we have finally wrested our country back from the occupation forces  id rather be dead than have to bend to the will of the empire what are we dogs
and now that begnion is ordering daein troops into battle we are treated as disposable pawns many daein citizens will die of this pact whether we obey it or not
it would appear that i have been crowned king during the last days of daein follow or fight the result is the same we will be destroyed
with all due respect your majesty we cant give up
what
you heard me the only way to really be doomed is to give up
micaiah theres no way out of a blood pact none what do you suggest we do
look for a way out i know duke lekain says the pact cant be broken but of course hed say that king pelleas you have the resources of an entire country to draw on and the best of reasons to do so check the royal library check the archives somewhere im sure youll find something
micaiah forgive me i was so overwhelmed that i let myself give in to despair but youre absolutely right we cant give up just yet we have people to save
unfortunately we dont have much time begnion will not put off triggering the blood pact until after weve found a way to break it
we can make time if we take on the empress and the laguz forces itll look as if were obeying the senate in the meantime you can research the pact
all right ill start immediately just give me as much time as you can 
of course well do our best to hold them back whatever it takes
it looks as if the apostles forces are using this road to avoid a head on confrontation i guess we were right in assuming that they dont necessarily want to fight micaiah are you still set on this
are the rocks ready
yes theyre in position
general maiels forces have encountered general ikes laguz forces the battle has begun the decoy operation succeeded the apostle and her holy guards are heading this way
 all forces get in position our target is the apostle we will attack her while general ike is distracted if we let her through her army will cross into begnion that will surely anger the senate and the senate will move to destroy daein we must fight with everything we have so that daein may live on
but micaiah  is this really necessary cant we avoid all of this fighting and somehow pretend to obey the senate
micaiah it was you more than anyone else who used to hate plans like this 
the apostles army has incredible numbers we wouldnt stand a chance taking them head on they would march right through us we need to give pelleas more time but if we hold back the senate will know were up to something for now lets just try to draw this out a bit and stop the apostles army
lady micaiah your strength moves me i shall not falter
micaiah  all right lets do it lets do it for our friends  and for our country
we have visual confirmation on the holy guards theyre heading this way
blast were being ambushed i should have known 
what is happening
were under attack we will engage them now please stay inside the carriage your majesty
someone go tell general ike
fear is our greatest enemy defend the apostle with your lives
nnngh  i must not falter 
sigrun pull back get out of here right now
no apostle sanaki i shall fight until my last breath i wont leave your side until you are safe
sigrun
you are daeins maiden of dawn your reputation is known across the face of tellius they say you are the savior who rescued the people of daein from the empires oppression i see now that their stories were false daein remains a simple puppet
i am not here to talk i am here to fight this is daeins only chance of survival
i knew id run into you you never leave the apostles side
you  you used to travel with the greil mercenaries
used to not anymore im a member of the daein army now
does sir ike know about this
it doesnt matter im my own person
youre right it doesnt matter if you are after the apostle you are my enemy prepare to meet the goddess
if i may ask  are you not lord fizzarts daughter
how did you know
i am sigrun of the holy guards have you not heard my name from haar
yes i remember  you were the one who negotiated to let my fathers men and their families stay in begnion
thats right
 im so sorry im sorry we have to meet under these circumstances
lady jill  its not too late would you please withdraw
no  i cant i know that this mission is terrible even so i cannot abandon my comrades or my country
i see  very well i shall remember your conviction when the battle is done
i remember you  you used to travel with the greil mercenaries why are you fighting us
i couldnt abandon the people of my homeland
i see  you are from daein then there is no way for us to avoid this confrontation
im afraid not just like you want to protect your own country i want to protect mine
  i am sorry to hear that
come to me you dogs whatever might you think you possess pales to that of the holy guard
ugh i must protect the apostle i am a holy guard it is my duty 
tanith stop fighting you must not throw your life away
i cannot fight any longer  but i can become your shield i will not let the enemy harm you not even a scratch
tanith 
sothe how youve grown i didnt recognize you at first
 you havent changed much
i dont understand why you are with the daein army but it doesnt matter all i need to know is that you stand before me are you my enemy then or is this some kind of mistake
its not mistake im your enemy and im prepared to fight
then this conversation is useless have at you
jill why does daein continue to fight us does the maiden of dawn hunger for blood or is she a warmongering fool who doesnt listen to reason
she is none of those things lady micaiah fights for the people of daein
for the people you say look around you naive girl is all this death for the people
i i cant explain we dont have any choice in the matter
fools you merely assume that you have no choice
you used to fight alongside the greil mercenaries you now fight for daein but general ike is on our si–
yes im aware of that even so i cant pull out of this fight
then you are the apostles enemy prepare to die
lying in wait for your enemies what a dirty trick
i am kieran of the crimean royal knights prepare yourselves evildoers of daein
i dont care what you say this is our only choice we cant stop fighting
you you used to travel with the greil mercenaries

ah you did well for yourself are you still traveling with oscar
yes hes my archrival

and now you insult me even though we know each other i will not go easy on you you are my enemy now this is your last chance to run ill give you to the count of three one  two  three 
hey now dont get mad other than the announcing thing you were all right but i have to fight prepare yourself
dracoknight jill why did you return to the daein army
i 
last time we fought together you betrayed your heartless homeland to fight on crimeas side you used to know how to tell right from wrong what happened
sir kieran 
why do you look so sad it isnt like you come join us in righteousness
i truly envy you you fight with pride and loyalty in your heart i wish i could do the same these days 
zihark what are you doing in the daein army
i couldnt abandon the people of my homeland
you are originally from daein
thats right i want to protect my country just like you want to protect yours thats why i fight for the daein army
i am sorry to hear that  i will not go easy on you just because we know each other
thanks kieran i prefer it that way
ugh  aargh we will pull back temporarily im not fool enough to let my men die needlessly
were in position at the top of the cliff and the holy guards are at the bottom just as we planned
all right thank you
there is no turning back now micaiah you have to give the order
yes i know
general maiel has fallen to the claws of the sub humans general ike and the laguz alliance are heading this way to rescue the apostle

general tauroneo ill ask you one last time talk some sense into that girl all right shes losing it
 we wont pursue you this time however we cannot avoid this war that is all i will say for now and ike im sorry for this
what is going on with you people 
whats the situation
its awful the begnion central army and the crimean royal knights have almost been completely obliterated on top of that the oil that daein used has injured the holy guards pegasi and all but grounded them
yeah i think awful fits thoughts everyone
thoughts daein must answer for this we attack them immediately
we cant if we fought daein now we couldnt possibly take on the senates armies we have to get daein to listen to us
confusion is exactly what lekain wants daein is merely a pawn in his scheme but there is one thing i do not understand why use such horrible tactics oil and fire what is that girl micaiah thinking
micaiah the imperial army has micaiah on their side
rafiel when did you arrive
just now with reyson and queen nailah
reyson went straight to his sister he will be here with leanne in a moment
is it all right for the three of you to be here what about the medallion
the medallion is right here
were very near the point where galdrar wont be able to contain its power if this war goes on much longer the dark god will surely awaken
please  please save him please save my son come save my pelleas i beg of you 
ive found it this is it a way to break the blood pact thank the goddess  i will be able to save my people after all
prince kurth what are you doing out so late looking for something
oh hello ena no i was just looking at the moon its reflection on the lake is quite lovely isnt it
yes quite
 
you h how did you get in how did you find us help hes here  aaaargh
my apologies for the long wait
is the apostle safe
she fled to crimea then exposed the senates plots to the world currently she leads the apostles army through daein and is preparing to storm the empire
i see very well  its time for us to make our move
as you wish my master
daein launches a surprise attack against the apostles army devastating her forces it is all apostle sanaki can do to allay her remaining troops burning desire for revenge she knows that there is no hope of victory if her weakened forces are divided however she cannot move forward while danger follows at her back this dilemma weighs heavily on the apostles troops crushing their morale
meanwhile the daein forces pull back to the fastness of nox castle micaiah unable to explain her mission to her soldiers keeps daeins army together through sheer force of will
i have to head back to the castle i have to know if there is a way to break free of the blood pact
please be careful
 please micaiah stop being so kind to me its too difficult for me
i can feel how youve suffered youve had to endure it all alone for so long its ghastly
it was my fault  i brought this curse upon daein
no you didnt know i will protect daein ill protect our country from harm no matter what happens you have my word
micaiah  very well i wont give up well fight destiny together
yes
i want you to take this i found another one in the treasure room of the castle stand fast micaiah i will find a way to save daein
 
sothe
hello general
i thought you were going to leave the army taking lady micaiah with you
i was but now we cant both micaiah and i are from daein we cant abandon our own country
hmm i wonder if its the same if you leave daein 
i dont understand
if you abandoned daein and fought on the side of a different country i wonder if youd still be cursed
who knows im not a sage in any case it doesnt matter micaiah would never leave daein behind
i see sothe here take these
why are you giving me these
i kept them as a parting gift to you since youre staying id like you to take them now
general 
these are all the funds we have for the near future the problem now is stopping the apostles army from advancing
conventional tactics wont slow them down theyll easily break through our lines  what should we do
micaiah
 
are you all right ill leave the gold here youre still not completely recovered yet you have to rest micaiah
ill try
keep safe
nolan sorry to keep you waiting
hmm hey sothe dont worry i was reading while i waited
i didnt realize you were such a dedicated reader nolan
its human nature to crave knowledge i thought you would know that as well as anyone how is micaiah by the way is she doing well
yeah i believe so shes alert and she seems generally stronger
i see well thats good right
sorry to make you worry
dont mention it
and i brought this for you
hey now this is a good axe must have cost you a fair bit thanks
nolan i 
dont force it youll only hurt yourself
what
you look like youre carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders youre wondering if you should tell me right
right 
the best thing to do is think it over give it some time to sit later if you decide you want to tell me you know exactly where to find me
i will thanks nolan
anytime
there she is hey lady
who oh nico
this is great i was hoping id find you
nico mind your manners the silver haired maiden is the saviour of daein shes not just some lady
oh its all right im still the same simple girl from daein you met before nothings changed so are things well with you
well the fightings got everyone worried coming so soon after the last war and all  but were doing all we can for daein it doesnt matter who or what were up against believe me when i tell you well never give up
thats right we wont give up ever i know were gonna win too ‘cause weve got you on our side thats what everybody says the dawn brigade will save us
is that what they say i see  listen to me nico you can believe in us i promise well keep you safe
i knew it
come along nico we should be going the maidens got better things to do than stand here chatting with us all day
bye lady see you later
yes good bye nico
 
i  i want to save them all the world is a better place with people like them in it
i know how you feel micaiah thats why we started all this weve always been fighting for them but this war were in  its not just were fighting on the wrong side
i know i dont want to see anyone die its ironic  im killing with no malice because i dont want anyone to be killed i  what am i supposed to do am i supposed to stand back and let all of daein perish is that the just thing to do
 
if thats what it takes to be just then i want nothing to do with justice id rather be hated and feared like mad king ashnard id rather the dark god take my soul im going to save my people sothe if the rest of the world paints me as a beast to be reviled and hated so be it
