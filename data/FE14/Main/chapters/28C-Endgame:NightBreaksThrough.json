I always wished we could have been close, as you are with your Nohrian siblings. Right up until my last moments, I wanted so badly to call you my brother/sister. To look up to you and love you\u2026and never allow anything to come between us. I wish I had told you that before I died. While there was still a chance\u2026 I was just so stubborn, so hurt.

It is because you have a pure heart. Kind and strong. You have suffered much and endured much sadness in your life. But now is not the time to look back. Wake up and stand strong. Put one foot in front of the other and press onward. Fight with all your heart to end this war. The Yato chose you for a reason. You can do this.

We\u2019ll probably find her along the way. Let\u2019s do it!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "\u2026What is this strange feeling I have? I can\u2019t help feeling\u2026like I\u2019ve seen Azura for the last time. Hmm\u2026 I\u2019m probably just still wound up from the battle.

The war is finally over, and we have formed a new alliance with Hoshido. Though once enemies, our kingdoms will now strive for peace together. Since the war began, and long before, both Nohr and Hoshido were in agony. Freedoms were oppressed, possessions were plundered, the land was ravaged. Rebellions and uprisings tore our great kingdom apart. Our world was in pain. I never wish to see that happen again\u2026 Not to anyone. I won\u2019t allow it. As such, all tribes and other peoples of Nohr shall be granted autonomy. We will not seek to expand our borders by infringing upon Hoshidan land. Instead, we shall strive to build a foundation of trust. Both kingdoms will do all we can to plant a seed of mutual respect. In the years to come, I look forward to watching that seed grow. We have a long road ahead of us. It will not be easy, but it is worth treading. On this day, as I assume my father\u2019s throne, I vow to steady our course. The night sky is dark, but that is what allows the stars to shine so brilliantly. As king, I hope to be the light that guides Nohr out of this long night. I swear I will not rest until our beloved home awakens to a brighter tomorrow. For the great people of Nohr\u2026 Here\u2019s to a future of peace and prosperity!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "That was a beautiful speech, Xander. I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll be able to do what Father never had the chance to. We\u2019re going to build the kind of world that people can live happily in. Some day in the far-off future, people will sing songs about all this!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "That was amazing, Xander. You sounded just like a king! You\u2019re so cool, Big Brother!"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "Elise!! Keep your voice down! And stop waving your arms like a fool! Are you actively trying to bring shame on the entire royal family?!"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Haha, calm down, Leo. Why not let her be? In any case, your voice got rather loud as well. Everyone\u2019s staring at you."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "Ah\u2026 Well\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Hahaha, check out that nasty stare Gunter\u2019s giving you! We\u2019re all going to get an earful about this later."}, {"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "EHEM. If I could have everyone\u2019s attention\u2026 The coronation ceremony is now complete.

Sakura! I\u2019m so happy to see you. Thanks for coming today."}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "No thanks required, Corrin. Our kingdoms signed a permanent peace treaty, so we can visit whenever we want. Of course I\u2019d be here for such a big event. I\u2019ll come running whenever you need me."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Haha, I know. Thank you\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Hey, Sakura! Did you see me waving at you? Did you?!"}, {"speaker": "Sakura", "line": "Y-yes\u2026 But isn\u2019t that part of why you got scolded? Your \u201cexcessive\u201d waving?"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Heh, so you heard that? Stupid Gunter\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "I thought you looked energetic and happy, just as a princess should be.

I never thought it would fall to me to rule Hoshido. I always took it for granted that Ryoma would eventually be king. And after him, I suppose I expected to pass on the honor to Takumi. I never had any interest in the throne. My brothers were the born leaders\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I\u2019m so sorry, Hinoka. I miss them too."}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "Corrin\u2026 No, it\u2019s fine. It is what it is. To be honest, I still battle with feelings of hatred toward the Nohrian army. The way they violated our kingdom for so many years\u2026 I won\u2019t soon forget it. But in time, I know even those wounds will heal. I trust you and Xander to prevent such things from ever happening again. In my heart, I know Ryoma and Takumi don\u2019t hold any grudges either."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Hinoka\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "You should know, however, that there are many Hoshidans who still don\u2019t trust you.

After all the evil that has been done in the name of Nohr, it\u2019s only natural. The lives that my kingdom has taken are a burden I shall bear for the rest of my life. The blood that was spilled, the tears that fell, the hearts that were broken\u2026 For all of that and more, I am truly sorry."}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "Please, Prince\u2026erm, I mean, King Xander. You can\u2019t take the blame for all that. As queen, it will be my job to help clear up our misconceptions about Nohrians. It will take time, but it will happen. I will make sure of it."}, {"speaker": "Sakura", "line": "I\u2019ll do my best to help out too!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Hinoka\u2026 Sakura\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "Corrin\u2026 When tensions finally subside in Hoshido\u2026 Well, I want you to feel free to return to the castle anytime you like.

What banquet?"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "Oh, right! This is your first time at an important Nohrian event. In Nohr, whenever something big happens at the castle, we hold a royal banquet. But this time it\u2019s going to be a huge event that spans the whole capital. Xander decided he wanted to provide food for the whole town, not just the royals. Now everyone can celebrate the occasion and enjoy the banquet together."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Wow! That sounds amazing!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Doesn\u2019t it! I\u2019m gonna serve up yummy food to all kinds of different people!"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "But you can\u2019t carry it all by yourself, right? I\u2019ll go with you."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "I, for one, shall busy myself by entertaining the lords and ladies. We must not neglect making a good impression on them as well."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "I\u2019m counting on all of you tonight. I doubt I\u2019ll be able to stray too far from the throne."}, {"speaker": "Felicia", "line": "Time to get cooking and show everyone the true meaning of Nohrian cuisine!"}, {"speaker": "Jakob", "line": "I\u2019ll make sure to set aside a few plates of your favorite foods, milady/milord."}, {"speaker": "Kaze", "line": "Hmm, I wonder what kind of foods are served at a Nohrian banquet\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "The capital is brimming with jubilation. This is the Nohr I always dreamed of!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Haha, this is going to be perfect. Let\u2019s all enjoy ourselves tonight! Seeing Nohr filled with so many smiling faces is a dream come true. We sacrificed so much to arrive at this victory we\u2019re now happily celebrating. The path I chose was difficult, but I now know it wasn\u2019t the wrong one. Even if a path looks dark up ahead, you must keep walking until you see the light. Thank you, all of you, for believing in me. Having all of you here at my side fills my heart with joy."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Phew! Everyone seems to be having a great time at the banquet. It doesn\u2019t seem like it will stop anytime soon. I\u2019d better take a little break\u2026. Hmmm\u2026 This place\u2026 It reminds me of the lake where I first met Azura.

Just do as I say."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "OK\u2026  \u2026 Azura\u2026 I\u2019m really happy you decided to come back to us.
