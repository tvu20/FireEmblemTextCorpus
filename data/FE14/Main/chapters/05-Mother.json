I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re feeling better. If you wouldn\u2019t mind, I have a small favor to ask. Would you try sitting on the throne for a moment?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Why would I do that?"}, {"speaker": "Mikoto", "line": "Well\u2026this throne is infused with the power of the First Dragons.

The ceremony is about to begin."}, {"speaker": "Mikoto", "line": "Thank you, Yukimura. Corrin, you probably don\u2019t remember him, but this is Yukimura. He\u2019s one of our strategists and brightest leaders. We would be lost without him!"}, {"speaker": "Yukimura", "line": "You are too kind, milady. Though in truth, I still have much to learn. That said, I am here to help in any way I can, Lord/Lady Corrin."}, {"speaker": "Mikoto", "line": "I\u2019d like to make a public announcement about your presence here, Corrin.

Yukimura, is everything ready?"}, {"speaker": "Yukimura", "line": "Yes, milady. People are beginning to gather at the plaza."}, {"speaker": "Mikoto", "line": "Excellent. Thank you. Corrin, I\u2019ve arranged for Takumi, Hinoka, and Sakura to give you a tour. I thought you might want to get to know the area a little bit before this event.

It\u2019s a lot to process.

Mmm\u2026I\u2019ve never tasted spices like these before. This is amazing!"}, {"speaker": "Old Woman", "line": "Ha ha! Told ya! Here, take an extra one on the house.

This is delicious."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Everyone really is friendly here. And it\u2019s so\u2026bright\u2026and open.

I just wanted to tell you that to your face."}, {"speaker": "Sakura", "line": "I apologize for Takumi\u2019s rudeness. He\u2019s a bit of a hothead.

Did she say something to you?"}, {"speaker": "Yukimura", "line": "I hate to deliver this news, but\u2026 Queen Mikoto foresaw her own death. This isn\u2019t your fault, Corrin. King Garon set these events in motion. And the queen speculated that there may be an even darker force at work. She didn\u2019t know when or how death would strike, only that it was certain.

A massive Nohrian force is gathering at our border."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "This is the final straw. I have worked hard to avoid an all-out war, but now\u2026 Death is too good for them. Who\u2019s with me?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "There must be another way. Surely the answer is not more bloodshed. But I feel I must follow Ryoma to the border. If I can help avert total war\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Wait, Corrin! There\u2019s something you need to know. If you become embroiled in a fight right now, it would be easy to lose control. Your dragon blood could take over again. And if you yield completely to the dragon, you may lose your humanity altogether."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Is there anything I can do?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Yes. This is called a Dragonstone. It will allow you to control the dragon\u2019s power and still return to your human form.

Um\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I\u2019m sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable? I know we\u2019ve known each other only a short while, but I feel close to you. You already risked your life to help calm my dragon form. I only hope I can repay the favor someday."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Thank you, Corrin. I feel close to you as well.
