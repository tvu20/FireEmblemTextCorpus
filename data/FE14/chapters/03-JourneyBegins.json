I hope you\u2019re right."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "All right. Deep breath, and\u2026 here we go. Father!

Right, Corrin?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry for questioning you."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "You may enter."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "Corrin\u2026 You disobeyed a direct order from me. Ordinarily you would not still be alive."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I understand\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "No! Father, I can explain-"}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "Silence! As you are my child, Corrin, I will grant you some leeway. I have something in mind for you. A mission. If you complete this task successfully, I will pardon your crime in full."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Really?! What sort of mission?"}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "There is an abandoned fortress perched on the Hoshidan border. I wish to know if the building there remains serviceable. You are to travel to the site and inspect the premises. No battle will be required. Do you understand? I won\u2019t tolerate being disappointed twice\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, Father. It shall be done."}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Darling, are you sure you\u2019re going to be OK out there? I don\u2019t like this\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Of course! Please don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just an abandoned fort."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "You\u2019re acting rather casual about all this, Corrin. It isn\u2019t like Father to be so forgiving\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Huh? What do you mean, Leo?"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "That\u2019s enough, Leo! Don\u2019t be so worried all the time, sheesh. And don\u2019t even try to scare Corrin before his/her first mission!"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "Hey! That\u2019s not necessary."}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "I suppose I\u2019ll just have to come along. That way I know Corrin will be safe."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible."}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Why ever not, Iago?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Lady Camilla, King Garon intends his expedition as a test of sorts. As his top advisor, I have been entrusted with coordinating this mission. He would like to know whether Prince/Princess Corrin is worthy\u2026 After all, he/she IS a part of the royal lineage. Therefore, your assistance would simply muddy the results."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Understood. Camilla, I need to do this all by myself. Surely you understand."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "Not all by yourself, Corrin."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Father! I didn\u2019t see you there."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "Rest assured, I don\u2019t intend to send you out there completely defenseless."}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "\u2026Milord/Milady."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "This is Hans. He is a veteran warrior and will ensure no trouble befalls you."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Thank you, Father."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Hmm\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "I\u2019d be wary of that man if I were you, Corrin\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Why do you say that?"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "He\u2019s a criminal. A murderer and scoundrel. I arrested him myself, years ago. Father seems to think he\u2019s rehabilitated, but I\u2019m not so sure. That said, he is a formidable soldier."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I see."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Wow\u2026 Is this it? The Bottomless Canyon?"}, {"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "Yes. It\u2019s the natural boundary dividing Nohr and Hoshido."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "It can\u2019t be really bottomless, can it?"}, {"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "Let the eternal darkness below be your answer. Those who fall in never return\u2026 I truly despise this place. Something about the land around here just isn\u2019t right. The sky here is always dark and foreboding, and lightning strikes all who fly across. This clearly a place us mortals were never meant to enter. Normally we\u2019d go around\u2026 But the fort that King Garon wants surveyed is right over there."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Oh, it\u2019s not so bad. Or perhaps I\u2019m just happy to be outside in the fresh air! Compared to the inside of that fortress, this is downright exiting."}, {"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "Ha! That certainly puts things in perspective, milord/milady. Come, let\u2019s proceed."}, {"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "Blast! It looks like this fort isn\u2019t as abandoned as we thought. Why the devil is this place crawling with Hoshidans?"}, {"speaker": "Hoshidan", "line": "Hold on! Do not advance any farther, soliders of Nohr."}, {"speaker": "Omozu", "line": "Crossing that bridge is a violation of our border treaty.

Die, scumbags!"}, {"speaker": "Omozu", "line": "You\u2019ll pay for this!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Hans, what are you doing?! We had no reason to engage these troops!"}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "Pfft."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "We should have tried diplomacy first. We weren\u2019t sent here to fight!"}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "Speak for yourself, weakling."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "What\u2019s that supposed to mean?"}, {"speaker": "Omozu", "line": "Soldiers of Hoshido, hear me! Do not leave a single Nohrian alive!"}, {"speaker": "Hoshidan", "line": "Prepare to attack!"}, {"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "Argh! Looks like there\u2019s no getting out of this now. Get ready to fight, Lord/Lady Corrin."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "Now then, Lord/Lady Corrin. There are two kinds of battle formations. You\u2019ll need to learn both, and fast! You can take a defensive position by moving to the same space as an ally. Your ally will benefit from your support, but you won\u2019t be able to attack. If you want to unleash the most potent attacks, stand in adjacent positions. From that alignment, allies may be able to attack simultaneously. I\u2019d tell you more, but you\u2019re about to receive some practical experience\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Gunter", "line": "I\u2019m afraid the enemy\u2019s position across that bridge may be impenetrable.

Who are we dealing with here?"}, {"speaker": "Felicia", "line": "Look!

There\u2019s no reason to engage Hoshido further at this point. Corrin, you take the lead with Gunter. We\u2019ll follow close behind."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Will do.

Once I recovered, I was able to take human form. You were so kind to me that I decided to remain a human that I might serve you. But now I have used a power that goes beyond the capacity of a human body. I will not be able to return to that form. I don\u2019t mind, though. The most important thing to me is that you\u2019re safe\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "Eeek!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Lilith! Be careful! Drop me if you must\u2026 I won\u2019t have you sacrifice yourself for me!"}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "First Dragons, I call on you. Grant us access to the astral plane!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "What just happened?! Where\u2026are we?"}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "This is a world parallel to the one in which you live, Lord/Lady Corrin. It is known as the astral plane."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "How were you able to get us here?"}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "The First Dragons have granted us the power to inhabit this dimension. Under their protection, we are safe here. Oh! Allow me to prepare a place for you to rest\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Did\u2026 did you just use a Dragon Vein?"}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "Yes. The power of the First Dragons flows freely in this realm. You should know that space and time operate differently here as well\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I have so much to learn\u2026 Is there anyone else here?"}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "No, we are alone. There\u2019s no one left here\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to invoke any bad memories."}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "It\u2019s OK, Corrin. I\u2019m not lonely as long as I have you in my life. Now\u2026you should get some rest."}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "How are you feeling, Corrin? I know this is a lot to take in."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, it is. But I feel much better now. My wounds seem to have healed already. And my mind is racing! I have so many new questions about this world\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "All in good time. For now, some business remains in the other world."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t relax until I know everyone made it safely home."}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "Of course. There is just one thing you should know before you go back. When I open the portal, you will return to the same location you came from. That means you\u2019ll arrive right on the Hoshidan border. There may be soldiers lying in wait for you\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I understand. I\u2019ll be ready for them."}, {"speaker": "Lilith", "line": "Very well. Then I will open the gate."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Ah, I\u2019m back. But\u2026 where is everyone?"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "You\u2019re mine, Nohrian!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Hmm?!"}]}
