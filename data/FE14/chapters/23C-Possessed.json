How is Sakura holding up?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Not well. She won't speak a word, and I'm told she refuses to eat."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I'm not surprised. Poor thing. For someone so young to witness the massacre of all those soldiers... We're lucky we were able to take Sakura, Yukimura, and the retainers as hostages. If Iago and Hans weren't frightened of Xander, they would be dead right now. I've heard that Sakura is being kept separate from the rest. Is that so?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "I'm afraid so. I believe her isolation has made all of this even harder on her. But Elise has been visiting her quite often, making sure she gets food and blankets."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Elise has been doing all that? I'm a little surprised. Back in Izumo, she seemed rather hostile toward Sakura..."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Perhaps she's learned to focus on what they have in common. After all, they are both princesses, and the youngest of all their siblings. ...You should know that Garon's men don't agree with our choice to keep them alive. We should keep close watch on them, or I shudder to think what might happen."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "You're right. I wish it weren't so... But those who still follow Father over Xander are not to be trusted."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Indeed. As it were... The Nohrian army is split in two as of now."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "There are those whose allegiance lies with you, Xander, Leo and the others. And those who still swear fealty only to King Garon, Iago, and Hans. Conquering Hoshido is our only option, but our methods have drawn attention. If things continue like this, we might have a rebellion of sorts to contend with. It's convenient that King Garon is already here in Hoshido... But if something happens and we lose his trust, we will all be in grave danger. Until he sits on that throne, we should all proceed with extreme caution."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "You're right. We must be patient. The whole world depends on it. Once Father sits on that throne, everyone will finally know the truth. Only then can we\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Lord/Lady Corrin.

Did you need something?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "King Garon orders you and your troops to prepare for battle immediately. We will be arriving at the Great Wall of Suzanoh before long."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "The Great Wall of Suzanoh?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Oh, my apologies, young prince/princess. I take it you've never heard of the place before? It's the last hurdle that stands between us and the Hoshidan castle. Once we pass through, we will enter the capital city. My forces shall be leading the charge. You, on the other hand, have been tasked with conquering the enemy's core legion. That means defeating their leader, Prince Takumi."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Takumi...is leading Hoshido's core legion?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Yes. We received word of it from our scouts not too long ago."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I see."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "We already have Princess Sakura as a hostage, so no need to keep him alive. I'm sure you would prefer to spare him, but I doubt our dear king would agree..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "*sigh* You are correct, Iago. I will deal with Takumi for the glory of Nohr. However, first things first. For now I must focus on the battle ahead. I will tell my troops to prepare for battle."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Understood."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Heh heh... Now, to joyously watch Corrin suffer! Poor prince/princess...
