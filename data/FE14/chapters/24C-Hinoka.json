The Hoshidan capital. What a long journey it's been."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Yes, but soon this long ordeal will finally be over. If we can take control of the capital and seize the throne room, victory will be ours."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Azura... Are you OK with that?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "...Why do you ask?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "We're about to conquer the place where you grew up...the castle you called home. If this is too much for you, I'd understand. You can leave the fighting to me. If you need to, go hide somewhere safe until our work here is done."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Thank you, my friend, but I'm afraid I can't do that. I didn't side with Nohr just to lose my nerve and turn tail at the pivotal moment. I told you once, and I shall tell you again. I am with you until the bitter end. Ending this war will benefit us all, even the kingdom I grew up in. This is what I need to do, not just for you, not just for the world... But also for the Hoshidan siblings I love so dearly. That is what I believe, with all my heart. It is why I am able to bear this burden."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Azura..."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Speaking of our Hoshidan siblings... We never did find him."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "You're right. I don't know what to think... It's too much to process right now."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Poor Takumi. Our troops made a thorough search of the area, but didn't find a thing. Nothing... Not even a single clue as to where he might have gone. It's as though Takumi just...vanished. But I know that's not possible."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "We should probably keep this from Princess Sakura. She has enough to deal with at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, I agree. There will be plenty of time to further break her heart later. *sigh*"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Corrin, I must speak with you."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Let me guess... Is it time?"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "We have received our orders from Father. We are to invade the capital immediately.

The Nohrian army is headed this way!"}, {"speaker": "Girl", "line": "They're so frightening...

Out of my way!"}, {"speaker": "Old Woman", "line": "AHHHHH!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Iago!"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Hmph, one less blathering fool in the world. Rest easy, Lord/Lady Corrin. I shall personally destroy anyone who dares speak an ill word about you."}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "GWAHAHAHA!! Just try and cross us Nohrians, and watch the bodies drop!"}, {"speaker": "Boy", "line": "Ahhhhhh!!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "No... Please..."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Patience, Corrin. King Garon is close behind. There is no telling what he'll do if he sees you standing up for Hoshidans."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Ah, we've finally arrived at our new castle! And no guards to stop us, heh heh. They must be in defense mode. I'd wager that all of their forces are waiting inside."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Hmm, so it would seem. This bodes well for us. Our army is large enough to surround the entire premises. We might be able to secure their surrender without raising a blade."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Oh, I'm afraid that won't do, Lord Xander."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Pardon?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "This is our only chance to finally eliminate those pesky Hoshidan insects. They don't deserve the honor of a clean and quick surrender. Besides, so long as they live, those who follow them will never stop fighting. Now is the perfect opportunity for us to kill their royalty and stake our claim. For the glory of Nohr, every last one of the Hoshidan royals must die."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "That's low even for you, Iago!"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Oh? Well let's ask our king, shall we? King Garon! Your Majesty! What do you think of my plan? May I proceed?"}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "Kill them all."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "I thought you might say that. Thank you, my liege."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Father..."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Now that we've settled our differences, let's begin the invasion. My men will attack from the rear while Lord/Lady Corrin's troops storm the front. Divide and conquer, as they say!"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "... What say you, Corrin? Any objections?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "...None. If this is what Father wishes, then so be it."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Oh, Xander, hasn't our \"little prince/princess\" grown so? How proud must you be! Now then, let's begin. My troops will meet up with yours in the throne room. Do try your best not to slip and die on your own tears, will you? Heh heh heh."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "... Xander, what do we\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "I know. I don't like this plan any more than you do. But we must stay strong. If we falter now, the whole world will pay the price. Corrin... Camilla told me you once asked her where justice lies."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes. She didn't have any more answers than I do."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Little prince/princess... The sad truth is that justice is an illusion. A child's fairy tale. There is no light path that always leads to good, nor dark path that leads to evil. To believe that\u2014to see the world in black and white\u2014is missing half the picture. All that matters are the choices we make\u2014especially the hard ones."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "But this? It's too much..."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Letting innocents die is a tragedy, but so is letting the chance for peace slip away. This is war. There is no such thing as a clean win when lives are on the line. Instead of clinging to a false sense of justice, hold strong to something true... The desire to do what you know is right and to protect the ones you love... And the ambition to see your vision of a peaceful future through to the end. If we allow evil men to let their vision take precedence over our own, we all lose. Remember that, and find solace in it."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "You're right, Xander.

My sister, listen carefully. As of this moment, you are dead to the world. Leave this place, and do it now. I beg of you, take your retainers and find somewhere to hide.

You see, my brother/sister...who is not yours, by the way... Well, the sweet thing chose to spare your meaningless life. It's rather precious. I support his/her choice, of course. But only so long as you keep your end of the bargain. If you cause my darling brother/sister any harm... If you disobey him/her and refuse to run away... When you least expect it, my naughty little blade might just slip.

And she will stay that way if you help me keep my brother/sister safe. That's MY brother/sister, darling. Not yours. In case you were keeping score.

You win. I will do as you say."}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Wonderful! I'm so glad we had this little chat. You know, now that I'm up close...your face is rather cute.

You said you wish to avoid bloodshed, and I'm choosing to believe you. So whatever happens...don't kill him. Please, find a way to spare my brother. We've already lost Mother. We couldn't bear to lose Ryoma too... If he fell, it would tear the heart out of our kingdom. I couldn't survive that."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "You have my word, Hinoka.

I know the awful things my kingdom has done to Hoshido and to your family. I know that because of those things, I can never hope for forgiveness. But when all this is over, and peace has been restored to our world... I dearly hope that one day we can all come together as siblings again."}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "Corrin..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I'm sorry. Perhaps I should not have spoken.

Good-bye, Corrin."}, {"speaker": "Azama", "line": "Lady Hinoka! I am truly grateful that you escaped that ordeal with your life."}, {"speaker": "Setsuna", "line": "It's time to go, milady. If we stay here, they'll catch us for sure."}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "Yes. Let's get going. Brother/Sister... You're right about one thing. I cannot forgive the Nohrian army. They started this war, and they're winning it like cowards. They're all barbarians! Yet Corrin's dream of us all uniting as siblings in a world without war... His/her wish is so earnest, so pure, I can't help but believe in it too. Ryoma... Please don't hurt Corrin. Don't kill that lovely dream..."}]}
