Is that the throne room up ahead?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Yes, my liege. Nothing stand in our way. The kingdom of Hoshido is all yours!"}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "Mwahaha, the time has finally come! I have awaited this moment for decades upon decades..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "... Yes, Father. Please, sit on the throne and claim what is rightfully yours. Let us admire you in your first moments as the conqueror of Hoshido!"}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "No. Stay right there."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Hm?"}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "I must first consult the sacred mystical dragon, Anankos. No one may enter the throne room until I say so."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "...Understood, Father."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "Mwahahaha!! I am ruler of both Nohr and Hoshido, the two greatest kingdoms of all! I shall be remembered forever as the king who conquered the world!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Corrin..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "It's all right, Azura. Once he's done praying to his god, we'll be allowed to join him in the throne room. Then everyone will finally see his true form. After all we've endured, waiting just a few moments longer is nothing."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "You're right. It's almost time..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Relax, everyone. Father will give us permission to enter any minute now."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "The fighting is finally over. Let's lay down our weapons and rest easy for a change."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Corrin, behind you!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Huh?!"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Drat, I missed! What a slithery little snake you are."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "What are you doing, Iago?! Why did you attack Corrin?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "What am I doing? Is it not I who should be asking that question? What exactly do you think you're doing, Lord/Lady Corrin?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "What are you talking about?!"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Princess Hinoka is alive and well. Do you deny it?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "That's...that's nonsense! You have no proof!"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Oh? While you were fighting Prince Ryoma, I had soldiers search the castle grounds. What do you think they found? Surprise, surprise! Princess Hinoka with a small group quietly escaping from the back."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "You don't seem surprised, young prince/princess. I take your silence as a confession. You let her escape, didn't you?! Such betrayal is an act of treason, and the only possible punishment is death."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "As such, I think I'll go ahead and take your pathetic little life myself!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "No!"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "As though I would ever allow that to happen."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Xander!"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Out of my way, Prince Xander. Otherwise you too will be branded a traitor and executed for your crime."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "So be it. If you wish to kill Corrin, you will have to defeat me first. However, know that I do not intend to go down without a fight."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Wh-what do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "I challenge you to a duel, Iago. I have had enough of you and your cruel manner of doing things. You are a disgrace to the great kingdom of Nohr, but that ends today. If you choose not to repent, the only fate left for you is to die by my blade. As the crown prince of Nohr, I am taking back my kingdom!"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "Count me in. I've long hoped for the chance to express my discontent with Iago's dirty schemes. If you are going to take him down, allow me to share in the pleasure."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "You d-don't intend to kill me, do you?! Your king's trusted g-general? That's not very becoming of a N-Nohrian royal, now is it?!"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Say what you will, coward. Our father is not here to protect his lapdog. We'll tell him you were murdered by some remaining Hoshidan rebels. How tragic."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "What?! No! That's deceitful! It's traitorous! It's\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Hmph! Who are you to judge us?! You and Hans have done nothing but awful things to innocent people for years! And what's more, you've been openly mean to Corrin! I've always hated you two! It's time to pay for being such big jerks!!"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Hmm, well, I perhaps don't feel as strongly as our little Elise here... But anyone who tries to hurt my darling Corrin most certainly deserves death. It's only fair. You're ready to die now, I hope?"}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "Lady Elise! Lady Camilla! Th-this is bad..."}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "Are you traitors really turning your blades against your own?! Fine then! Bring it on, gwahaha! I don't care if you're a prince or a princess. You're weak\u2014all of you!"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "It seems the only way to settle this is with a battle. Do not expect me to hold back. Though I do not regret returning to Nohr... I will not stand idly by while you desecrate the kingdom I grew up in!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "If it\u2019s a fight you want, Hans, it\u2019s a fight you\u2019re going to get. I always try to avoid needless violence...but there\u2019s an exception to every rule. You want to see me act more like you? Like a merciless killer? Then watch this. You may be on the side of Nohr, but I will punish you all the same!"}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "Don't worry, Corrin. We all share the sentiment, and we have your back. You are still the leader of this army, and we are awaiting you orders. You have plotted the course, little prince/princess. Give the word, and we shall act upon it!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Right! Everyone, ready your weapons! These men have employed cowardly tactics to hurt innocent people! They have destroyed the reputation of our beloved kingdom! They are traitors, and they will pay for the crimes with their lives! Hurry my friends! It is time to obliterate the king's army and take back Nohr!"}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Hans", "line": "I've waited a long time to wipe that smug look of your face.

So much...power..."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "You impertinent traitor! Your ragtag group is no match for my army!

That person is King Garon."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "Father?!"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "You...you can't really be telling us to kill our own father, can you?"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "That's a horrible thing to say!

You have our attention."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "OK. This isn't going to be easy to hear... But you have to know. I fought so hard and sacrificed so much for this moment.

I did all that so I could show you, my family, the truth about Father."}, {"speaker": "Xander", "line": "And what is this truth of which you speak?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Father...King Garon...is no longer human.

You must be joking!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I'm sorry, Xander, but I'm dead serious. I had a hard time believing it myself, but I swear it's the truth. I can prove it to you, too.
