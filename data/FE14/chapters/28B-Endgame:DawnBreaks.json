What do you think Father's true intentions for you are?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "That's a weird question... I mean, he's my father! He gave me this castle and servants and raised me...

But the casualties of this war have been almost too much to bear. I speak, of course, of our beloved Queen Mikoto. Still, we must move forward. The crisis our world faced is finally at an end. And in this moment, we have done something extraordinary... We have made peace with the kingdom of Nohr! I know some of you here today probably find it hard to swallow. But there can be no light without dark. The two complement each other... And so, too, do the two greatest kingdoms there ever were. They each have something the other lacks and together are made whole. We in Hoshido must share our light and our bounty. We have much to learn from our brothers and sisters at Nohr. Let us live...together. Let us move forward on the same path toward a brighter future.

But I thought Camilla was next in line..."}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Oh, that was supposed to be a surprise! You ruined it, Leo! To answer your question... Yes, I am next in line for the crown. But I begged Leo to take my place, and he has graciously accepted. I have no desire to run a kingdom."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "So there you have it. You should know that I have big plans for Nohr. I think a friendly competition with Hoshido will be good for both of us.

Oh, Azura..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Am I hearing things?! That's her song!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Azura! Maybe I'm just hallucinating due to the exhaustion, but I don't care.
