It would seem he/she successfully captured Notre Sagesse for the glory of Nohr. As for the Rainbow Sage, he/she didn't kill him with his/her own hands... However, as ordered, the Sage is dead."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "So the ancient one has finally passed on... Once more, Corrin has dutifully fulfilled my wishes. Heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha...

Make him/her rue the day he/she was born. But no matter what, no matter how he/she begs for death, do not kill him/her."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "As you wish, sire, but... I'm not entirely sure I understand your aim."}, {"speaker": "Garon", "line": "I do not need you to understand, only to obey. Loyal servant... it is of grave importance that I rule Hoshido. Corrin's life and happiness are a trifling price to pay. Still, he/she must be kept alive for now... the Great Dragon has willed it so. Corrin's body and soul must be tested... primed for what is to come. Like a calf fattened for slaughter, so too shall these trials prepare him/her. My dear son/daughter is not ready, but his/her time is fast approaching. Corrin has faithfully followed my orders thus far, but it's time for a test. He/She must fight those he/she doesn't wish to fight... kill those he/she doesn't wish to kill. His/her sorrow will feed the darkness in his/her soul. And his/her suffering will make him/her a worthy sacrifice upon the altar of Anankos."}, {"speaker": "Iago", "line": "I understand, King Garon. It shall be done, with pleasure. In fact, I have an idea..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Thank the gods - we're finally back in familiar territory. If we keep up this pace, we'll be back at the castle in just a few days."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Th-that's good... I'm at the end of my rope. Can't wait to sleep in my own bed."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Ha ha, poor Elise. You've been through a lot on this journey, haven't you? I've asked so much of you, and you've never complained once. You're an inspiration. Just hang in there a bit longer for me, OK? We'll be back home before you know it."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "You got it, Corrin! I promise I won't let you down!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "*pant... pant...* *cough*"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Elise? Are you OK, little one?"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "I don't... feel so well. Why is... everything... spinning... *gasp*"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "ELISE!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Elise, speak to me! What's wrong?! Please, no... Gods, she's burning up!"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Dizziness, fever... Ah, and a rash, too. Just as I feared..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Azura, what is it?! Have you seen these symptoms before?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Unless I'm mistaken, she is suffering from an illness endemic to the islands. She must have been exposed to it while we were in Notre Sagesse. The illness progresses quickly. If we don't act fast... we may lose her. There's a special plant in Hoshido that I could derive a cure from, however... I'm sorry, but... I don't believe there's anything like it here in Nohr."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "We have to do something, dammit. I won't let her die. I won't!"}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "Corrin! We just received new orders from Iago."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Now?! Are you kidding me? We don't have time for this. What is it Father requires of me?"}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "He apparently wishes to reward you for your success in Notre Sagesse. We are to travel to the royal palace in Macarath for rest and relaxation."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Rest? Can it be? Thank goodness. I was afraid he was going to order me to kill again. Perhaps they can help Elise there... it's our only hope."}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "What do you mean? Is there something wrong with the princess?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "She caught a deadly ailment while we were on our last mission. Azura can cure her with a special plant, but it only grows in Hoshido..."}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "Don't worry, Corrin. Macarath will surely have what she needs."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Will they, Silas? How do you know?"}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "The best doctors in all the land can be found in Macarath. Their stock of medicines is unrivaled."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "We must hurry, Corrin. She doesn't have much time..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Let's move it people! To Macarath! Hang in there, Elise..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "We finally made it to Palace Macarath. There's hope yet. But why is there a crowd at the entrance... Wait... th-that's not just any crowd. It's the Hoshidan army! And they're not alone..."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Hello, Corrin. I've been waiting for you."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Ryoma..."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "It's been a while, brother/sister. I haven't seen you since that fateful day on the border. I see you've become a faithful Nohrian dog since then. Your master must be proud."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I don't wish to argue, Ryoma. How did you know we were coming to Macarath?"}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "That doesn't concern you. All you need to know is how fast you can draw your blade."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Ryoma, please... Let us pass. I beg of you. My sister, Elise, is gravely ill. If we don't treat her right away, she'll die."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "The Nohrian princess is sick, is she? I can tell she means a lot to you. Well then, I believe a trade is in order. Her life for yours. Come back to Hoshido with me, and I shall withdraw my troops immediately."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "You know I can't do that. Please, have mercy."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Your only other option is to fight me, here and now. Ready your blade, Corrin. Show me what you're made of."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Ryoma, stop this! Please! There must be another way. Although I fight for Nohr, I do not wish to be an enemy of Hoshido. I wish for nothing but peace. Please believe me, Brother."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "More empty words. Even if that were true, I doubt that monster you call a father shares the sentiment. They've brainwashed you, brother/sister. You are blind to their evil and cowardly ways. If the sting of my blade is the only way to bring you back to your senses, so be it."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Ryoma! Don't do this!"}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "I won't back down today, brother/sister. You're coming home. Now. Prepare to witness firsthand my blade's true power...

I'm glad to find you unharmed, milord/milady."}, {"speaker": "Peri", "line": "Aw, phooey. I didn't get any stabby-stabby time in. At least we saved you."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Thanks for your help, but who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Laslow", "line": "You may call me Laslow. My liege, Lord Xander, sent us here to watch your back."}, {"speaker": "Peri", "line": "I'm Peri! P for pulverize, E for eviscerate, R for ruin, I for impale! Kee hee! Laslow and I are Lord Xander's retainers. He's really worried about you! That's why he sent us to kill things on his behalf. Best job ever!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "That sounds like Xander. Thank you for your assistance, friends."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Ah, so you're Prince Xander's retainers. That explains a lot. Your master taught you well if you were able to deflect my attacks like that. But my retainers are just as strong, and their cause is much nobler. You may harbor my brother/sister, but I won't make this easy on you, Nohrians. Troops! Prepare for battle!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Ryoma, wait! Listen to me! Ryoma..."}, {"speaker": "Peri", "line": "It's no use. I know that look in his eyes... it's the same one I have! It means he's raring to fight."}, {"speaker": "Laslow", "line": "Please don't look so glum, milord/milady. It's bad for morale. It's always best to smile during times of hardship, even if you don't feel like it. It will make you feel better, I swear it. Give it a try!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I'm sorry, Laslow. I know you're right, but I won't be able to smile until Elise is safe. We need to get her medical attention right away, but-"}, {"speaker": "Laslow", "line": "What are you saying?! Has something happened to Lady Elise?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "She's in bad shape, Laslow. She doesn't have much time."}, {"speaker": "Peri", "line": "Hee hee, then let's gut these fools quickly and save our princess! I'm gonna stabby-stab every last one of them! It'll be SO FUN!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Your enthusiasm has been... noted. But do all you can to avoid taking any lives, OK?"}, {"speaker": "Laslow", "line": "If you wish it so, so it shall be. I agree that it's always best to secure a win without needlessly sacrificing lives."}, {"speaker": "Peri", "line": "Awww, that's not FAIR! I was all ready to get my killface on. Phooey. Whatever, I'll do my best. I guess hitting things will have to suffice."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Thank you, friends. I'm glad to have you on my side. Ryoma, my brother...
