I'm beginning to worry that we made a wrong turn somewhere..."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Believe it or not, I actually remember this part of the tunnel. So I think we're getting close."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "That's reassuring. Thank you, Azura. Although...this looks an awful lot like a dead end."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "No, look. There are stairs on one side. You just can't see them from this angle. The exit must be at the top."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "So. The heart of Nohrian power is just above us. Perhaps a few of us should take a quick look. It might be reckless for all of us to burst into the palace at once..."}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Good idea. We're with you, Corrin."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Here goes nothing..."}, {"speaker": "Nohrian", "line": "Hyaaah!"}, {"speaker": "Nohrian", "line": "Yah! Hyah!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "This isn't the throne room... Where are we?"}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "It looks like a training facility. These soldiers are being put through their paces."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Well, at least we're in the castle."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Yes. But of all the places the tunnel could have led... We're surrounded by Nohr's most elite soldiers!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Gods! Maybe they haven't noticed us yet. We should keep quiet..."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Look, someone's coming!"}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "What are you idiots doing? This is a FULL CONTACT exercise! I want to see real blood!

If I had to guess, he's in charge of this entire group."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I'm not a vengeful person...but he killed Gunter right in front of me.

For King Garon's glory!"}, {"speaker": "Nohrian", "line": "But, Captain..."}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "What was that? Please, speak up, and I'll relay your comments to King Garon! I'm sure he'll be sympathetic to you and your family. Now SHUT UP and KILL THE INTRUDERS!"}, {"speaker": "Nohrian", "line": "Urk!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "*huff* *huff*"}, {"speaker": "Hans", "line": "Bwahaha!
