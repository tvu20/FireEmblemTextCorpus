Sorry about that bump on your head."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "It\u2019s you! From the Flame Tribe, right? Where are we?"}, {"speaker": "Rinkah", "line": "Yes, I am Rinkah. This is a Flame Tribe village within Hoshido\u2019s territory. I\u2019m going to hand you over to the Hoshidan authorities."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I see. I suppose they\u2019ll want to hear an explanation for the unprovoked attack. And then they\u2019ll probably execute me."}, {"speaker": "Rinkah", "line": "Heh. I don\u2019t think so."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Gods\u2026they\u2019re here already, aren\u2019t they?"}, {"speaker": "Rinkah", "line": "Yes. It\u2019s time to go."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "We meet again. Kaze, right?"}, {"speaker": "Kaze", "line": "Yes. I\u2019m glad we found you, Prince/Princess Corrin."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "You are? Wait, am I missing something?"}, {"speaker": "Kaze", "line": "Please come with me.

That\u2019s not possible\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Mikoto", "line": "Oh, my poor Corrin. It\u2019s a sad story. When you were very young, you were abducted by forces from Nohr. I am your mother, Mikoto. All this time, I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever see you again!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "But King Garon is my father! None of what you\u2019re saying makes sense."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "It must be quite a shock, but I assure you that she speaks the truth. I am your elder brother, Ryoma."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "No, no, no\u2026 Xander is my older brother! Leo, Elise, and Camilla are my siblings\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Are those the Nohrian royals? They\u2019re not your real family. I still remember the day you were taken. In those days, there was tension between Hoshido and Nohr, but no full-blown war. Not until King Garon lured King Sumeragi-our father-to Cheve under false pretenses. He said it was for a peace conference. Ha! His real plan was to murder our father in cold blood. And to make matters even worse\u2026he kidnapped you."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "No. That\u2019s just not possible\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "You really don\u2019t remember any of this? Not even a single memory?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "No. Honestly, I have only the vaguest memories from my early childhood\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "These are times when I can sense something beneath the surface\u2026 A blurry image. Like a stone at the bottom of a lake, shimmering and ethereal. But that\u2019s it. Nothing of substance."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Well, I can\u2019t imagine the Nohrian royals would share much of the past with you. I know this is a lot to take in."}, {"speaker": "Hoshidan", "line": "Lord Ryoma! I have an urgent message. We\u2019re under attack from the north!"}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "No! Hinoka and Sakura are in that area right now!"}, {"speaker": "Hoshidan", "line": "Yes, milord. I\u2019ve been told that they\u2019re working to help evacuate the villagers."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Very well. We\u2019ll need to provide support. I\u2019ll leave immediately. Corrin, will you come with me? I want you to see the truth with your own eyes."}, {"speaker": "Sakura", "line": "Sorry I\u2019m slowing us down. Of all the times to sprain an ankle\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "Don\u2019t worried about it, Sis. We\u2019ll be OK.

And you are?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "I\u2019m Azura. A former princess of Nohr."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Former? I don\u2019t understand. If that were true, surely I would have heard of you. I grew up with the Nohrian royal family\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been here a long time. After you were taken by the Nohrians, the Hoshidan forces retaliated. They tried desperately to get you back, but they failed again and again. However, I wasn\u2019t as heavily guarded. Hoshidan ninja easily kidnapped me.

Hmm\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "Did something happen between you and Queen Mikoto?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "No. I just don\u2019t know what to do.

Live a new life among strangers?"}, {"speaker": "Azura", "line": "No. Given a choice, I would prefer to stay here in Hoshido. Queen Mikoto is a peace-loving ruler.
