It's more like a catacomb than a tunnel."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Yeah, there's some spooky stuff down here for sure!"}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "Heh. Thank you for the warning. But I think we'll be all right."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, thank you so much for accompanying us here, Elise. We'll be alright from here. I'd recommend that you stay with Cassita for a while..."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "What? Why?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Because...we're heading to the castle. That means that we'll be facing off against King Garon, and likely Xander too. Things could get ugly, and there's no need for you to be there."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "So what you're saying is...you're going to try to kill Xander and Father. Right?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I...I'm afraid I must do whatever it takes to end this war. Ultimately, I have to do what's right for the people of Hoshido and Nohr. If that means killing King Garon, or even Xander... Well..."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "I see... That settles it. I'm coming with you!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Huh?! No, Elise! It's too dangerous! And I can't let you fight your family! That's a burden I alone must bear."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Oh, don't be silly. I'm not gonna fight with anyone, and neither are you! I'm not siding with or against you, Brother/Sister. I want to help bring both sides together! I want the war to end just as much as you do. So! I'm coming with you to let Xander and Father and everyone else know how I feel. They're still super mad at YOU, but maybe they'll hear me out! Maybe we CAN end the war without any more fighting! Don't we at least have to try to end this without hurting each other more?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Elise... All right. I suppose you won't be in any danger from either side. Just promise me that you won't do anything reckless."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Yep, yep! I promise!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "All right, then. Let's get moving!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "So far, so good. This passage appears fairly well traveled. Although...I see a fork in the road ahead. Which way do we go, Elise?"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "The path on the right leads to an area near my quarters. Camilla said that the other path leads more or less to the throne room."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Right. Left path it is."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "But...she also said the left path is like a maze. She warned me to NEVER take that path, you guys!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Don't worry, Elise. You wouldn't believe what we've had to overcome to get here. I'm confident that we can get through anything together."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "If you say so..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "What's the matter?"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "It's just...you almost seem like a different person now. You're so...commanding. I guess I just have to get used to you being all grown up..."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "It's true...I've done a lot of growing since I left Nohr. But don't worry, Elise. I'm still the same old Corrin. And I'll always do everything I can to protect you, Little Sister."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Aww, thank you. I'm so glad you came back! I love you so much!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Haha! Whoa! Easy with the monster hugs. I almost fell over!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Heehee!"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Ah! Did you hear that? That's Lady Elise's laugh!"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Oh ho! You're right! Let's report this to Lady Camilla posthaste..."}, {"speaker": "Ryoma", "line": "This part of the tunnel seems a bit ominous. Be on guard, everyone!"}, {"speaker": "Takumi", "line": "Yeah, are you seeing all of these traps? Most of 'em have been sprung, but I bet there are even more that haven't."}, {"speaker": "Hinoka", "line": "And the ones that did spring look like they were pretty effective. I'm seeing more corpses than I'd like..."}, {"speaker": "Sakura", "line": "C-corpses? Eek! I thought those were just decorations to make it spooky! I'm scared, Corrin."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "It's OK, Sakura. If you want to close your eyes, I can lead you through this part."}, {"speaker": "Sakura", "line": "Oh...th-thank you so much..."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "What about me? I'm scared too!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Heh. I can help lead you, too. Just come over to this side."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Yay! Heehee! Uh-oh...do you hear that? There's someone behind us!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Elise...have you ever seen any Faceless down here?"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Ah, Elise. There you are! I've been looking all over for you."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Camilla! What are you doing down here?"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Like I said, I was looking for you. Are you hurt, darling? Who are all these people? Are you being kidnapped right now?!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "What? No! These are\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "The Hoshidans! I knew it. Well, I'm so glad we could meet down here. How DARE you bother my baby sister. I shall now make you all dearly regret ever stepping foot in here!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Hold on, Camilla. It's me, Corrin! We're not kidnapping Elise!"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Corrin! How can this be? You're back in Nohr!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "It's...a long story."}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Well, have you come to your senses? Are you returning to Nohr for good?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Oh...um... Sorry, but no. I want Hoshido and Nohr to be at peace, and that can't happen while Garon lives."}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Hmm. I see. So you want to come back, but these awful people are still confusing your little head. Don't worry, darling. Big Sister is here to take care of these monsters for you!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Camilla, no! You don't understand!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Please listen, Sister!"}, {"speaker": "Camilla", "line": "Don't worry, Elise. I promise to save our precious Corrin. Once I've killed all his/her friends, he's/she's sure to remember his/her true family. Right? Right!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Arthur", "line": "Never fear, Lady Elise! Arthur is here to vanquish your captors!"}, {"speaker": "Effie", "line": "This won't be anything more than a light workout..."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Oh, Arthur. I don't need saving! And, Effie...save your energy!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Oh, Arthur and Effie... Those are your retainers, aren't they?"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Yep! They're the best! They seem to think you're kidnapping me... Whoops! This is all my fault for sneaking out and running around with you. If you can get me over to them, I'm sure we can smooth this over."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "OK, I'll give it a shot. But remember...this is still a battlefield. Stay close!"}], "battle-talk": [{"speaker": "Arthur", "line": "Lady Elise! I'm so glad you're safe.

You won't try to stop us?"}, {"speaker": "Selena", "line": "Yeah! You heard what she said, right? We can't go against Lady Camilla's orders just because she's unconscious!
