/***EOF***/
unbelievable 
brother whats wrong
it cant be yet ive gotten word that my son is missing from the deeprealms
what shiros missing
hes left of his own accord but hes never been here before i havent prepared shiro for what he must know about our world
we need to find him ill alert the others at once
thank you shiro has no idea what sort of danger hes in here
hmm  so this is the world that has been kept a secret from me pretty dull if you ask me maybe if i can find this hoshido palace then itll all make sense from what i overheard back home my dad is a bigger deal here than i thought whats he called again big cheese of hoshido which would make me  i dunno little cheese i must be some kind of royalty though i always knew dad was a major deal but royalty i still cant believe it
wait up fancy britches what brings you all the way out here
what none of your business
youre not welcome here now ill forget that i ever saw you long as you hand over your weapons and armor that is refuse and you wont walk outta here alive
you ready for this i doubt it fine then take your best shot
over there thats thats shiro
come on hes surrounded theres no way he can fight them all off
shiro you shouldnt be here
dad or should i say big cheese of hoshido
we can discuss that another time leave here now ill take care of this
ha really when the partys just getting started hey also you big liar where are all the monsters you said were here these guys are just well guys hardly a match for me
dont be a fool shiro i havent prepared you for a place in my world that includes knowing how to handle yourself on the battlefield
hand over whatcha got and i swear that youll walk outta here alive bah who am i kidding im gonna sell all you got right down to your bones
shiro you have disobeyed me for the last time and you will show me respect or i will show you how i deal with utter fools
how can you call me that
i didnt raise you to be this irresponsible
dad want a reality check you didnt raise me at all
what i did what i had to i have the weight of the world on my shoulders son i put you somewhere that was safe from our familys enemies what was all this anyway some sort of adventure had you been slain dont you know that all of hoshido would grieve you
hoshido then its true
tell me who told you your caretakers were under strict orders of secrecy
what no one everyone kept your secret but you really are 
thats right i am the royal head of a kingdom known as hoshido a kingdom that you will rule one day if you survive so long
how could you keep this secret from me didnt you think i have a right to know
im sorry i had my reasons initially and then later  well the truth is that you havent been maturing the role
thats not right if youd only told me i would have taken things more seriously how else was i supposed to turn out being treated like im special for no good reason this battle has been the only moment of truth in my whole damned life i dont mean your confession here i mean seeing all this death i can barely stop my hands from shaking i was trained to fight not to kill you you should have prepared me for this sort of life
i see  yes i suppose i should have but now that were here answer me this from what youve seen of me today what do you think your fathers power is for
huh your power to leave the field bloodied with your enemies
no is that really what you saw here what we all achieved here
no i guess not those guys wanted to bloody the field with us
yes they abused their power you and i had to stop them all lives are sacred even theirs and so taking their lives is a serious decision but it had to be done for the sake of our way of life i falls to me and one day to you to bear that heavy responsibility
still you didnt prepare me for this 
shiro ill prepare you now if youre truly ready to join my side now that you know who i really am you can decide to be who you really are
are you sure you want me around
sure if youre sure but remember that im more than your father ill warn you speak to anyone in our family and theyll tell you about me im as strict as they come some even say im severe but its all for hoshido
ill do my best er not that i have a clue what im up against
we stand together then now i make you this vow son no more secrets i need to prepare you fully to fill my role in due time

/***EOF***/
well this isnt at all how i pictured where your daughter lives i didnt even know that any part of the deeprealms looked so ominous
it wasnt this creepy the last time i visited rhajat something terrible has happened
wed better investigate then
hmm yes lets hurry in
whats going on around here
faceless everywhere they seem to be surrounding that house maybe even coming from it
what but thats where rhajat lives it can mean only one thing  she actually did it
did what
hmm theres something i havent told you about my daughter she dabbles in the dark arts the darker the better last time i came here rhajat was amusing herself with summoning spells but she couldnt get them to work
hmm i just cant believe that your daughter could possibly 
hee hee hee after all my toil the nohrian monstrosities are mine all mine
does that convince you
i guess i shouldnt have been surprised shes got your knack for magic it seems rhajat has succeeded beyond her wildest dreams
more like her weirdest nightmares we have to get in there and clean up this mess
come to me my children come to rhajat your loving mother
seriously that girl shes dabbled herself into a very dark place
hee hee hee father youve arrived meet your grandchildren arent you proud of me ive mastered the art of summoning the faceless just keep on coming its so beautiful
what this is horrifying if you summon any more of them we wont be able to cut them all down
huh but ive only just begun theyre a part of our family father
listen you need to stop this now please father knows best
what how can you say that you know nothing about summoning
rhajat you know thats not what i mean now help us clean up this mess
fine father
hee hee hee you truly want to tangle with me
but why i was only furthering my dark education
well weve cleaned up that mess now daughter ive never discouraged you from dabbling in the dark arts  but do you have to pursue the worst possible spells
i have been working on a spell that makes a person taller and less baby faced
what are you really
no of course not
very funny anyway no more summoning understand
huh no way my next spell is going to be a hundredfold more effective
seriously what possesses you to do such things in that case ive got no choice youre coming with us
what but this is my sanctum
if youre going to keep at these studies then ive got to keep an eye on you i fact im going to take charge of your magical education
i dont have a say in the matter do i all right as long as you give me interesting challenges father
how about you start on that spell to make a person taller that seems respectable
hmpf
pardon the intrusion but ive got some great ideas for research how about a spell that makes a person less afraid of the dark or a cure for crying every time someone botches his battle moves
who would need that you
oh no dont be silly i mean your father here i think he should focus more on being braver not taller
subaki im braver than you are
hee hee hee ill get to working on those spells right away after seeing you in action here father i can see how i can really help i think all your friends need my help too oh this is going to be fun
i suppose its time to take one last look at the inside of my dark sanctum i wont miss it too much its just a home the real darkness is inside me
gurrr 
huh one of my children lived
guuurrr
n n no im your mother
stop abomination get away from her
guurr raaahh
that was a close one are you all right rhajat
  urgh
you are hurt arent you
you whats your name
who me im corrin
youre this corrin that fathers been talking about
er yes
thank you for rescuing me corrin i owe you my life no ones ever been willing to sacrifice themselves for me before i owe you my life all of it every hour every day until the end
huh thats uh not necessary
youve got my full attention ill watch you like a hawk on a mouse forever and ever until one of us is no more and maybe then some your name is branded upon my minds eye corrin
what a strange young woman i guess thats just her way of saying thanks of course she could have just said thanks odd one that rhajat
you summoned me corrin
ack
im here for you should you need me my dark arts are at your disposal i will be close as your shadow actually i will be your shadow
/***EOF***/
here we are at the town known for its selection of great tombs pardon i meant tomes
such are the whims of fate tombs tomes i walk in darkness either way but today its books not graves that ive come to find books open to knowledge books laid on their spines books flapping their wings like the greatest of dragons climb on they say ride with us to the realm of enlightenment oh ewwwgh 
whats wrong touch of gas
my aching blood this town something someone  the very air in this place threatens the even keel of my interior being the shadows within are ascending the dark overtakes me ha it tickles but now sinking into my well of darkness i drown in power soon i can tap into the strongest of all my abilities  eldritch smackdown
ugh sorry i asked huh whos that
ah fair finger of fate pointing me here to this town what power i sense brimming in these quaint lanes power no ophelia contain yourself you mustnt give in to such a swell you alone hold day and night at bay you are the dusk be strong ewwgh such power if only i drank of it i could use the strongest of my abilities 
hey odin she speaks just like you kind of the dark and so on
hmm could it be  ophelia
oh father hi its been too long
whoa whoa no no no you cant just hi me why are you in my world
oh father you know me im always questing after the unknown ive come here searching for a tome the super ultimate tome
what the super ultimate  uh oh
yes clearly you know of it after all it was listed in your own book of supreme fatal divine names you know your encyclopedia of exceedingly dangerous thingamajigs the super ultimate tome was the most forbidden book listed there
what but daughter please dont tell me you read from my book of lists that was private
sorry couldnt help myself now i crave the super ultimate tome i wont stop until i have the book the darkness within me demands it it bangs on the door of my heart i will let it through father just as soon as i have that book
um just one thing ophelia that book 
augh run for your lives ruffians are pillaging the town
what not on my watch
ophelia here to serve townspeople you have nothing to fear i consider this holy ground and i will bring my full vengeance to bear when all is said and done i will have saved the super ultimate tome too
huh how stupid one girl saving this town all by herself
ha ha i am here too
grrah who are you
the chosen hero arrives and what is he called this soldier of darkness  odin dark is his name and he says that if you lay so much as a finger on his daughter  odin dark will deliver his most deadly move  eldritch smackdown
um what
the chosen heroine arrives and what is she called this maiden of darkness ophelia dusk is her name ive got this scene covered odin dark you can exit stage left for ophelia dusk will now deliver her most deadly move  luminary uppercut
two of you freaks what is this a shakedown well you cant scam quality thugs like me and my crew everyone get em
no dont say its true bad times come to our little town id try this spell out on them if i was a little older here you take it
uhh what where ruffians here we dont stand a chance but maybe you can do something especilly if i give you this
ruffians here thank you for helping us i dont have much but here
hmm all this fighting is over books you want to use as weapons i bet youd like me to give you a weapon to help end this fighting over weapons enjoy your vicious cycle
ive come for this towns rare tomes theyre mine all mine
ophelia ive got bad news for you that so called encyclopedia of mine the book of supreme fatal divine names its just my idea book a place to scribble down impressive names for weapons thats all
huh so the super ultimate tome 
yes it doesnt exist
ugh really
sorry to disappoint you ophelia but maybe this will make it up to you
well um  its a tome
i bought it here in town dashed into a store between moves i have a habit of naming my weapons but i havent named this one why dont you name it
i can name this tome myself father whatever should i call it ah i have the perfect name
hmm that was a little quick no whats the name then
ta dah i name this tome  missiletainn
missiletainn why that name
i saw it scribbled in the margins on the very last page of your idea book though it had to be more than just an idea for a name father there were comments there that said it was a pretty crummy weapon as it turned out what was it slips out of the hand cuts dull as a butter knife i dont care i just loved the sound of that name missiletainn
what an ear you have attuned to the slightest intimations of legend missiletainn was the only name in that book i ever gave to a real weapon oh yes how i remember missiletainn the blade to which my hand was wed the blade from which my enemies fled we were quite a pair
father is your hand empty now let us hold hands father and daughter and let our foes flee our wrath after all now i hold missiletainn so we are three
what if i sift through your flair for words 
yes i want to travel with you we are both chosen ones
ha ha then we march together we are the chosen two i can only hope the others wont be too humbled around so much excellence go introduce yourself ophelia
at once father just imagine  ophelia dusk and odin dark together at last
hey did you catch all that dusk and dark  think the rest of us are at risk of being upstaged
no way theyll never  wait what do you mean upstage us well anyway its all harmless fun and ophelia seems pretty nice
so excited daughter i cant believe that weve been united both of us on the eternal stage of battle with missiletainn in a supporting part i can already see it  a thousand foes before us falling before my might
leave some for me at least one hundred no five hundred
i laugh at the odds let our foes come i will smack them down
ill laugh louder and smack them harder i will show you how its done father

hey you chump youre not getting away without paying a toll and by toll i mean all your money hand it over or ill take your hands
someone help
heh sing like that again and i might just let my comrade pluck out your tongue then again my band of malevolent brothers is in dire need of amusement so carry on scream your heart out top of your lungs now 
eeep that stuff over there is just about as super double dupity dangerous as it gets i dont care if i will get in trouble from daddy i have to come to the rescue i bet daddy will even be proud of me steady there avel were gonna head straight for em charge wh wh what avel no youre going the wrong  waaaaaay
finally were here theres the village under attack but were so late looks like those marauders have already torn apart this place oh no a band of villagers is rushing the enemies a sure massacre we must save whomever we can and bring these villains to justice
sophie is that you

good job avel you obeyed my every direction in that battle but why here and not at 
so sophie your steed is more unruly than youve led me to believe im not surprised that he behaved here the difference wasnt him it was you you displayed newfound confidence your directions were assured thats the secret to being a good cavalier living up to your horses expectations
ugh thats all i needed to do this whole time
yes but its no easy feat especially since i gave you avel to ride when you told me long ago that you wanted to ride a horse like me  i knew i had to get you a horse with the highest expectations avel would help you grow into a commanding figure you see sophie this is really about more than your steed if you can ride avel youll command the respect of everyone you meet many who live through these times of war are ready to give up i need my daughter to inspire everyone to pick themselves off the ground

/***EOF***/
all right were just a stones throw from the deeprealm you must be looking forward to seeing your son again saizo
 
hmm id swear you look even surlier than usual saizo whats wrong
ah just concerned about whether my son is getting the training he needs hes sixth in a line of saizos the firstborn men in our family always take the name and with the name saizo comes great expectations if his training has failed him my son will be a subpar saizo i cant have that hes much older since last i saw him i have a fairly severe test in mind hmm people ahead
what you refuse your mission that reeks of treachery reconsider child
not happening you could double my cut and id still refuse im out
what in all the bitter hells are you doing here son
and now you too if this aint the brown sprinkles on my sundae 
what you know this boorish blackguard asugi
yup sorta
did he just call you asugi whats the meaning of this saizo you have the proud honor of taking my name as i took that of my father you were born a saizo you will die a saizo that is our familys custom besides who is this fool
huh as always you dont know your head from a hole in the ground get lost
no no no asugi dont be so rude he and his friends are our guests uninvited yes but they cant leave our little party now they can in fact help you fulfill your obligations at this fine affair
hmm obligations what does he mean by that saizo
this spoiled guttersnipe wants to abandon our happy family and right before were about to break into a manor that will make us fabulously rich tsk youth these days
break into a manor are you a thief now you work for this powdered cretin
ha thats my business
i expect more out of you you shirk your duties as a firstborn saizo sixth in the line and you think i wont make that my business
what a crock saizo this sixth that you can take your name and  well you know
what
i dont take orders not from you not from anyone you care about your dumb name more than youve ever cared about me its my life ill live as i please see ya
see ya no one gets away from me not over my dead 
no no no now that my asugi has fled lets have no more departing bodies at least not until i make you pay for driving off my talented associate
whats my damned son gotten us into
thats it last chance son get back here
whoops sorry cant hear you see ya never old man
damn that kid we have to catch up with him before he gets away
ah one of our guests well then let me extend my invitation to you  an invitation to die
stop chasing me
never now tell me why did you take up with such low creatures
gotta do something to satisfy my sweet tooth besides you got it all wrong or half wrong just before you showed up i told funke that i didnt want any part of this when he hired me he failed to say my job was to sneak in and off the owner ill steal anything thats not nailed down but murder like that nah crosses a line and theres no price he could pay me to do that got my pride i guess
do you
what now genius you gonna lock me up in my deeprealm
  no youre free to go
whats that again
you heard me youre no longer the sixth in a proud succession of saizos  you deserve to be asugi
wasnt expecting that  but wait is this some sort of trick
no trick the whole point of being called saizo is to live up to the honor you have a sense of honor in your own way so go
dad 
oh dad now is it good bye enjoy your life
 whatever i wasnt asking for permission but if it is my life im coming with you
what kid you make my head hurt
yeah i do that but if im off the hook for all this saizo junk  i think id like to tag along with you could learn a thing or two and maybe i can fix that sourpuss face of yours while im at it ever heard of candy
candy dont tell me thats been a sucker in your mouth this whole time i thought you were chewing on a blade of grass like some kind of tough guy
mmm candy yeah no im all about the sweet stuff specially if its on a stick suckers peppermint sticks candy apples but only if theyre really tiny apples you could say im a connoisseur thats why i steal good stuffs expensive youre gonna love it
no i dont eat sweets
ha yeah obviously and thats why your face is stuck that way
but maybe ill try just one i mean since you worked so hard to pay for it all hmm asugi if you manage to not wind up a victim of your own foolishness you might make me half proud of you
huh well if were getting all touchy feely here  im hoping youre half the saizo you think you are dad otherwise i may live to regret this
/***EOF***/

i heard that this village is a fine place to shop for sewing supplies my village has an abominable selection one cannot make fashion from burlap but soon as i arrived brigands came crawling out of the woodwork fortunately for the villagers here i came just in time to heal their wounded
youre a disgrace
oh excuse me since when is saving lives considered a disgrace
you know what i mean forrest you the way you dress ive told you before 
but  never so cruelly why are you being so hateful in front of aunt elise too
leo whats wrong with you embrace our lovely forrest

leo stop being a jerk and help me save your son
 
all right then i guess its up to the rest of us to rescue my nephew
 
hmm  these dastards may intend to keep forrest safe for ransom but if hard pressed such brutal apes wouldnt think twice about killing him we should try to keep the peace as long as possible until we get near forrest

i dont care who you are this village is mine and everyone in it too

oh well father i know it must agonize you to say something nice to me ill take your words with me as a keepsake too
im sorry i truly am i must seem like a stone hearted father to you youre right to say im not worthy that elise was able to see you as a person of sterling qualities  while i couldnt im er im a better person than this so i like to think
father an apology from you dont bother i really dont need 
yes im sure you dont son youre far stronger than i ever could be and im embarrassed to ask  but i wonder if youd want to spend more time with your father i dont mean in the deeprealms i mean here with me
  what a joy i can get to know my aunt elise she and i will be fast friends i might even learn a thing or two about fashion from her or she from me
yay youre actually going to come with us forrest
of course i couldnt say no to my aunt elise
hm hold on you have to stop that right now forrest im not going anywhere with you if you keep on with this “aunt” stuff

phew im just not ready to grow up that much yet
well youre sure about this im giving up a lot to join you father
yes absolutely and i give you my solemn vow forrest  ill learn to be a father worthy of you
/***EOF***/
hmm yes you will do nicely if you are willing to help a band of thieves has been prowling around my manor lately theyve heard that im storing some precious nohrian objects here i consider myself quite a collector of cultural items so you must understand  im losing sleep worrying about those thieves breaking in to steal them i doubt this matters much to great heroes like you but to preserve nohrs culture  would you help
absolutely for nohr anything and we happen to have our best expert on thievery right here
oh who little ol me sure i know a thing or two about manors and how to crackem i know how id break in so im already 10 steps ahead of them
ah then i place my trust in you thank you
the pleasure is mine believe me when i catch petty crooks in the act they never fail to soil their breeches its always good fun to see fools brought low
all right were ready silas those fools wont even know what hit em theyre outside in the shadows and theyll be inside soon off with you or else youll scare these jokers away
i have faith in you niles now be careful
oh sweet faith best i not rely on that im better under cover of darkness now when will they  ah that didnt take long
ooof
you cant hide from me come out come out whoever you are you call yourself a thief blundering in here like that youre a disgrace to your profession come on show your face
 
nina what are you doing here
huh father
hey you should be in your deeprealm where i put you
hmpf you didnt even notice that i broke out of there a ways back i had to pursue my true calling that of chivalrous thievery
huh chivalrous thievery
thats right must i explain it to you i steal from the rich i give to the poor the creep who owns this manor is one of the richest so here i am you wouldnt believe how hes gotten his hoard of treasures not that youd care
wait none of that matters whats the one thing ive told you again and again no stealing and all of your jabber about rich and poor doesnt matter
youre wrong its justified not that i have to justify myself to you now let me go father
no im here to round up a bunch of filthy thieves daughter
hmm fine words from one of the filthiest of them
how dare you nina now come with me
back off im not going anywhere with you im on the side of right out of my way
you strike your father apologize now that might make things right between us though im still going to make sure youre punished
you cant make me and you cant catch me
lookee what we have here  rooms just full of goods to liberate my friends burgle quickly theyre onto us just grab and go
nina stop youve deluded yourself that youre on the side of right
ive dreamed about this father draining the coffers of the wealthy vindicating the poor were getting what we need and then getting out i leave you to your disgrace what do you do these days anyway pfft dont answer i dont care good bye father
let me go let me go
nina its over now youre going to get whats coming to you
we have wildly differing view on justice do your worst villain
huh im not half the villain you think i am why not even a tenth
i spit on your idea of villainy then and you think you know me you rarely visited i made myself into who i am you shouldnt be surprised that were different as night and day so take out your weapon do what you must villain
stop saying that
arghh just do it already
wait this foolishness must end come with me daughter
no never
listen how can you just throw your life away how can you say that i never had a care for you why do you think i hid you in the deeprealms
because i wasnt worth your time
no i would have kept you near as my dearest treasure i didnt want you to get caught up in the fighting of our time i wanted you to be safe my world does terrible things to people i have endured it all but if something happened to you it would have been the end of me
 
i havent convinced you clearly ill let you go free but only as a member of our party i wish you hadnt chosen a thiefs life but i can keep you from the worst of it
you want me to join you i wont abandon my cause youre clueless about what im doing the man who owns this manor  do you know how he got all his money hes destroyed families hes swindled women and men of their life savings one of the people in my group grew up in one such family we demand justice and that leaves you and me only one way out of this
nina please 
father ill admit that i may have misjudged you a little i consider myself a fair woman so ill give you one last chance if you and your friends look into this vile mans dealings  ill join your party
yes well many people misjudge me but ive done the same to you i promise to do better starting now well do what we can here
sorry this all got so damned complicated leave it to me to turn a standard manor mission into a family crisis
no dont worry besides thanks to nina we exposed what was going on she was right as can be about the evil schemes this man was up to we should be thanking your daughter i know corrin feels the same
ah really what a relief i hate airing my dirty laundry in public
  oh what are they muttering about awfully chummy those two the fellow my father is talking to not bad not bad  i guess there is a silver lining in being stuck in my fathers brigade are there more fine gents worthy of my attention maybe a whole smorgasbord of masculine delights
huh daughter what is it silas believes that youre staring do you need something
nope nothing im just fine you two just carry on
yeah fine we uh will
wellity wellity wellity  silas is quite the appetizer i hope there are more tasty sights in store

brother your son lives around here does he not
hmph yes i hope siegbert is well its been too long since my last visit
father is that you by the gods youve returned
siegbert my son youve grown since last i saw you
i just cant believe it youre actually really and truly here sorry father i dont mean to get so carried away its just that  i receive missives that update me on all the important things youre doing every time i get one i wish i could hear it all from you but i know how busy you are
im sorry son i hope you havent been too disappointed in me
no  i mean no i would never think that of you father besides ive been very busy myself my studies of diplomacy politesse etiquette the arts of conversation  practicing my swordsmanship even my penmanship  all of these lessons keep me busy from dawn until dusk i even dream it its in the hopes that you wont be too disappointed in me
i see how impressive may i prove worthy of such a diligent son
father please dont say such a 
who is this approaching
theyre back
what whos back
they return today of all days at this very moment damn them dont worry father ill take care of them immediately
wait siegbert
whats happening there are never this many of them
this invaders seem to be emerging from the waters itself curious perhaps theres a way to close those doors so to speak
siegbert this isnt the first time these enemies have come here is it why didnt you notify me
i i just couldnt bring myself to do that father
hmm i expect you to do your duty son
ah im sorry but ive heard so many tales of what an important leader you are youve got a whole realm to look after countless lives if i cant manage a few incursions here if i couldnt defeat them  i wouldnt be worthy of being called your son so i couldnt tell you
hmpf commendable
father but ive hardly done anything worthy of such praise
siegbert not many people need to learn how to shoulder such burdens alone you do im sorry to say yet ive never had to tell you so you came to that realization on your own and meted out justice by yourself incredible
father you truly think so i worried i was bringing shame on your name
im sorry son while you have grown into your role i have failed in mine i am not just a ruler i am a father and i have a son to look out for too from now on be sure to tell me anything thats on your mind
  um then may i  could i possibly  i want to join you father
what join me
i i know why you placed me here to keep me out of the war but i believe that i will serve our kingdom far better there than here
  listen the war is more brutal than youve read in the missives sent to you battlefields are bloody lives are lost what you see may haunt you are you truly prepared for that theres no dishonor in saying no indeed i will send you back here if you prove unready
yes i am i swear that i am
i see i trust you know yourself better than i do son then you are welcome on our grim march siegbert
th thank you father i wont get in your way
together son we march together not apart but i give you my oath i will defend your life at all costs that is my privilege as your father and your right as my son

is it funny how you think youre just going to hit the hay after being so useful no dear daughter youre going to accompany us
what
all right lets go no complaining as they say those that idle away their lives are looking for trouble
trouble rarely travels alone you see father anyone can spout that stuff and sound smart im not buying it ill surely get into far more misadventures with you oh well  what use is trying  fathers are always prying  daughters complying  far better to sleep  far off in the starry night  far from azama  good night to freedom  good night to aspirations  good night to my dreams huh what do you know three haiku all at once travelling with father might actually be inspiring
/***EOF***/
hup two three four hup two three four keep it going midori one after the other youll get there hup two  but i do hope ill be there soon i wouldnt want to keep father waiting hes going to be so happy that i found the rare herb he wanted got it tucked nice and safe in my little bag here hup two three  aaaagh am i there yet ive marched all the way from my deeprealm to meet him hup two three uh hang on whats that up ahead
help me somebody anybody
shut up now empty your pockets like i told you or ill cut em open and i aint too careful with my knife if ya know what i mean
leave me alone
wh what are you doing pick on someone your own size
what who said that ha aint you a lil tater
nuh uh im midori the biggest herb gatherer around now do the adult thing and put down tour weapons you you  you pocket emptier
whats that aint your parents ever teach you to respect your elders guess ill just have to teach you to shut your yap
huh no
gaaah
midori  im here youre safe
father
urr who  never mind im gone got better pockets to empty
thanks a bunch father i hope you werent too worried i wasnt
is that so then maybe do me a favor next time and be on time ill always worry thats my job well now have you gotten taller again youre growing faster than bamboo
oh yes but its time thats going by so fast in the deeprealms im an adult now or at least more one than that brute was anyway father i found the rare herbs you wanted see ive got them right here er hold on they were right here i had them just a moment ago
huh did you drop the herbs when that bandit approached you
um no im sure i didnt drop them
hmm then where are they lets just retrace your steps they must have slipped through your fingers
no way im sure i didnt misplace them i was just holding the bag it must have been that man he took the herbs from me wait here father ill find that guy and get the bag back
no midori wait
um  hey you yes you with the bag thats mine
eh sharp eye kid people dont usually see me when im tiptoeing around
well the fact is im not a kid im the biggest herb gatherer around and youre running around with some pretty bad guys
well if were comparing facts i am not with these barbarians i travel among them they make for a nice distraction while i do my work no one even sees me walk amid the whole hairy smelly horde of them and who am i you may ask she who locates legendary riches a genius and explorer im none other than candace the notorious treasure hunter
um what does this have something to do with my bag explain yourself
leave it to candace i have explanations for every occasion you see i learned that the rare dragon herbs were hereabouts as ive said i am a treasure hunter you had something i treasured the rest is just math ergo whats yours is now mine
well the fact is that i found those herbs first you stole my bag
facts again then let me drop another fact on you you took the herbs from this forest didnt you wouldnt that make you a thief
nuh uh
then im not a thief either i could stand here and complain about you dragging my name through the mud but candace is going to take the high road and just say good bye you could try to take back your bag but ill warn you im quick as a wink
no wait i need those herbs for my father
oh caught up with candace did you well done but ill warn you im strong as an oak
glad thats over i wasnt sure we were going to get the herbs back
dont scare me like that running off on me i was terrified all of this just for those herbs we could have gathered more theyre not worth the risk of losing you so never do that again
but i just  ugh you dont understand those herbs grow here only once every year and you dont realize the true value of those herbs anyway those herbs can make wishes come true
huh i knew they were useful but they can actually grant wishes
well the fact is the herbs can help make one specific wish come true my wish in fact to prove my usefulness to you father so i can stay here
midori we still could have waited for the herbs to grow back this was risky
dont you realize a year here would be forever in my deeprealm and i just cant wait that long to prove my usefulness again i i hate it there away from you
im sorry that ive put you through all of this midori it was only for your safety but it seems that youre more than old enough to make your own choices forgive me for not realizing what you were going through much earlier of course time is more fleeting in the deeprealms i planned to visit as often as i could since days here would be much longer for you i am dearly sorry for putting you through such loneliness
 
here take my hand midori from now on we walk together in life no more deeprealms for you
youre serious father
of course ill just go let my comrades know that youll be joining us
thank you father now see i was right about the power of these herbs my greatest wish is coming true
lets go midori we have a lot to catch up about i want to know everything about your life in your deeprealm ive missed out on so much tell me about it all and dont leave out a single day
yes father that will surely keep us busy for at least a few years

what howd you get here did you follow me speak villain now or ill cut the answer out of you
 
eh wheres that fiend going no there are more of them and theyre breaking into dwyers house son theyre coming for you
whos that yelling like a maniac outside as if i dont have enough trouble urrr is that my father of course hed have to show up in the middle of all this well forget him ive got enough to worry about keeping us all alive in here everyone stay close ill heal you up if you get hurt
was that dwyer whats that damned fool doing hanging back letting others do the fighting for him its a disgrace
dwyer ive found you
father what a surprise id fetch you a glass of my finest whatever that is if i wasnt busy with my other uninvited guests
of all the  uninvited im your father dwyer and just look at the way youre conducting yourself in your own household i taught you martial arts and youre dillydallying in the background healing not fighting
oh father theres no shame in standing by to help when needed isnt that what a good butler does serve not show up his masters
what was that are you slighting my profession
what not in the slightest but if you expect me to jump into battle  then i think youve got the wrong son im a healer not a fighter
dwyer dwyer  you always did run from a fight go on then let your father do all the work
give me a break you never did see me for who i was perhaps i was a tad idle as a child but now i keep people alive
dont bother ill keep everyone alive  by defending them with my life so unless my little lord lazybones wishes me to fetch his slippers  no or a cup of warm milk then stand aside and watch how its done son
hmm go on then
that was pretty good father you and your friends cleaned this place up
and that my son is why your remaining servants just left
huh they did
hmm even your caretakers too im not surprised the way you run this household its a den of a sloth
oh no  they really are gone now whos going to help me maintain my high standard for squalor who will bring in all the dirt or feed hair balls to the dust bunnies i cant do it all by myself
hmpf 
youll just have to take me with you father
ha we all pull our weight in our group id never vouch for you youre going to stew here for the rest of your days in this mess of a place
 
father you missed one oh never mind ive got it
dwyer what in 
youve got a lot of nerve sneaking up on my father well take this slappyface
 
whew who knew victory
oh well i stand corrected you might not be able to handle a weapon but your slappyface is unparalleled have you been  in training
i guess so wait are you kidding because i dont always laze around here
well how irksome here i had you pegged for a complete loafer but if you could fight even a little why did you make your servants do it for you
hmm wasnt it their job to watch over me i would never rob them of their work
with that sort of attitude im afraid that youll never be good for much do you expect me to find you fresh caretakers to abuse
no im going to turn over a new leaf ill serve your friends
what
if you can buttle i can buttle i bet ill buttle better hey did you bring those coffee beans i wanted hand ‘em over ill brew everyone a cup of the best coffee theyve ever had
but thats my job
whats the matter afraid of a little competition this should be fun en garde father i declare this battle of buttling begun
hmpf you dont stand a chance
