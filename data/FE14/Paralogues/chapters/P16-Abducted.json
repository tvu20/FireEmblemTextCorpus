It's weird to think that I have a nephew. And that he\u2019s all grown up! I haven\u2019t seen Forrest since he was barely out of his crib. What\u2019s he like now? He\u2019s a troubadour, right? Think he wants to join us? The more the merrier!"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "No. And, er, let\u2019s cancel this trip. We can go to this Deeprealm some other day."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "What? Cancel the trip? But I\u2019ve looked forward to seeing Forrest. And you haven\u2019t visited him in forever. Don\u2019t you miss your son?"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Niles", "line": "Milord Leo? Urgent news. The town just ahead is being swarmed by brigands. They also say that a beautiful woman was caught in all the fracas. But she\u2019s apparently a troubadour and is doing her best to treat the wounded."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "No, this can\u2019t be..."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Uh-oh, what now? You\u2019re as pale as a ghost."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "We need to get there, before...before... Let\u2019s just get there...fast!"}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Well, that\u2019s that. I must have healed a dozen villagers. I\u2019d better keep looking for more wounded. Those brigands\u2014mindless beasts!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Ah! That must be the troubadour we heard about. She\u2019s as beautiful as they say. Don\u2019t you agree, Leo?"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Big Brother?

Unless my brother here has been hiding a second child!"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "Don't be crass, Elise."}, {"speaker": "Forrest", "line": "Father? What does she mean?

You're Leo's son?"}, {"speaker": "Forrest", "line": "Of course. The one and only."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Oh, wow! You're...you're... You're better than I could have ever imagined!

What are YOU doing outside of the Deeprealms?"}, {"speaker": "Forrest", "line": "I heard that this village is a fine place to shop for sewing supplies. My village has an abominable selection. One cannot make fashion from burlap. But soon as I arrived, brigands came crawling out of the woodwork. Fortunately for the villagers here, I came just in time to heal their wounded."}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "You\u2019re a disgrace."}, {"speaker": "Forrest", "line": "Oh? Excuse me? Since when is saving lives considered a disgrace?"}, {"speaker": "Leo", "line": "You know what I mean, Forrest. You! The way you dress. I\u2019ve told you before..."}, {"speaker": "Forrest", "line": "But... never so cruelly! Why are you being so hateful? In front of Aunt Elise too!"}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Leo!

I must seem like a stone-hearted father to you. You\u2019re right to say I\u2019m not worthy. That Elise was able to see you as a person of sterling qualities... While I couldn\u2019t? I\u2019m, er, I\u2019m a better person than this. So I like to think."}, {"speaker": "Forrest", "line": "Father? An apology from you? Don\u2019t bother.

I can get to know my Aunt Elise. She and I will be fast friends. I might even learn a thing or two about fashion from her. Or she from me."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Yay! You\u2019re actually going to come with us, Forrest?"}, {"speaker": "Forrest", "line": "Of course. I couldn\u2019t say no to my Aunt Elise."}, {"speaker": "Elise", "line": "Hm? Hold on.
