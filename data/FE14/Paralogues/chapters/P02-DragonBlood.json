What a lovely day! I might just break out in song! And twirl all the day long! Hmm. But Papa/Mama is visiting today, and I haven\u2019t seen him/her in such a long time. I\u2019d better do something special for him/her. Gather some fruit? Fish for fish? Ha, I know! Papa/Mama should have both. So I\u2019d better get going!"}, {"speaker": "Invader", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "Wh-who are you? Y-you look weird! Get away from me!"}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "Umm, what do you all want? You\u2019d better not be here to make trouble. My papa/mama will be here soon! They\u2019re not listening.

Now, off with you. Your papa/mama has everything in hand. YOU! You dare touch my child?! I'll soak these fields with your blood!"}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "Papa/Mama, there are too many of them!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I'll protect you, Kana. But don't worry about me. I told you to run! Now, the rest of you! Prepare to join your comrades in death!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "They\u2019re tough...

How many times do I need to tell you?! Run!"}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "No! I\u2019m not going to leave, Papa/Mama! Not when I\u2019ve waited so long to see you again!

I don't know."}, {"speaker": "Llewelyn", "line": "It's plain as the nose on your face. Can't you see it over there?"}, {"speaker": "Lloyd", "line": "Huh? See what? Where?"}, {"speaker": "Llewelyn", "line": "I dunno, my nearsighted brother. Maybe I mean that dragon yonder?"}, {"speaker": "Lloyd", "line": "Who'd name a dragon Yonder?!"}, {"speaker": "Llewelyn", "line": "No, you addle-brained baboon. I mean that dragon way OVER yonder."}, {"speaker": "Lloyd", "line": "Why didn't you say so? Dragons are like gods! We should catch it!"}, {"speaker": "Llewelyn", "line": "Yes. We'll make it our pet. A god on a leash! But let's proceed sensibly. We must pummel it to the brink of death. But what SHOULD we name it...?"}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Lloyd", "line": "That dragon's mine!

I dreamed that I turned into a dragon!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, well... You did, Kana."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "I did? For real? You look upset, Papa/Mama. I didn\u2019t mean to do it, I only wanted to protect you! But I\u2019m small. And I felt... useless. Then I felt myself get so angry. I heard a roaring in my head... It got louder and louder, until I couldn\u2019t hear myself thinking anymore. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to turn into a dragon. Am I in trouble now?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "No! Far from it. You\u2019ve made me the happiest father/mother in the world. I turn into a dragon too."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "What? Papa/Mama, you\u2013?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Listen, Kana. I\u2019m sorry that I haven\u2019t visited you enough to explain... But I keep my power in control by using very special stones. You must too. Or else the dragon within may take over. Don\u2019t be scared \u2013 you just need a stone. Azura has given me a stone that you can use. Carry this with you always."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "Thank you. It\u2019s such a beautiful stone. I\u2019ll treasure it, Papa/Mama! But now that I can turn into a dragon... can I maybe travel with you?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "I\u2019m so sorry, Kana. But you\u2019re too young. And my world is too dangerous."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "No, Papa/Mama? I guess I can wait longer, but only if you promise to visit more often."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Oh... Of course. I promise. Cross my heart and hope to\u2014 Er, I promise\u2014that\u2019s all. And I\u2019ll be sure to bring you a nice gift next time I come."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "Yeah... All right, Papa/Mama."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "That\u2019s my girl/boy. Be good, Kana, and you keep hanging on to that stone!"}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "...Hmpf. No, Papa/Mama. WAIT!"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Kana, I have to go. A lot of people are depending on your papa/mama."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "I... I know! That\u2019s why I have to go with you! I\u2019m depending on you too... to come back! And I never know if you\u2019ll... if you\u2019ll... If you\u2019ll DIE and never come back! What if I grow old enough to leave here, but by then you\u2019re gone?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Kana, I\u2019m only trying to protect you! But if that\u2019s how you feel... If it\u2019s agony for you being here? That\u2019s the last thing I want. Maybe... All right. You\u2019re coming. With your new powers, you might be safer with me. I need to explain all of this to my friends. You need to say good-bye to yours."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "What, I get to come with you? Really?"}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Yes, really. But, Kana, it\u2019s a different world out there. It\u2019s not a game \u2013 it\u2019s scary. I\u2019ll look after you. Still, are you sure you\u2019re grown-up enough for this?"}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "Well... I\u2019m only a little kid. But I\u2019m old enough to be a dragon. And my papa\u2019s/mama's one too."}, {"speaker": "Corrin", "line": "Like father, like daughter/Like mother, like son. I guess there\u2019s a lot we should catch up about."}, {"speaker": "Kana", "line": "Yes! I can\u2019t wait! Papa/Mama, I have to say one more thing before we leave. Rrrghg rawrgghh rrrh! That's dragon for I love you!"}]}
