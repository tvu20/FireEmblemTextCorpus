We chased off those bandits. Did you see 'em run?! Yipe, yipe, yipe! Tails between their legs?! Dirty dogs. And who's the best town watch in this or any other world? Us! That's who!"}, {"speaker": "Ruffian", "line": "Wait up. What was that about yipe, yipe, yipe?"}, {"speaker": "Soleil", "line": "Hmm? Back for more, eh?"}, {"speaker": "Ruffian", "line": "We didn't run.

No way we can take them all on!"}, {"speaker": "Soleil", "line": "Come on! Turn that frown upside down. Know what you have then? A smile! That's what my father taught me. If you can't smile?

Then we've got to get in there and help!"}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "Yes, let's. The town watch is in way over their heads. Though it's said they have a skilled mercenary leading them.

She's gathered a band of do-gooders around her. She's just like that. But Soleil and her men shouldn't be here. These bandits mean business."}, {"speaker": "Silas", "line": "Wait, Laslow!

But sometimes it's fine to drop it if it feels like an act. Still, you'll have to forgive me if I smile, looking at you here. You've grown into such a hero! Let me share one of my secrets. If battle is turning against me... And I can't smile? I laugh. A lot. It really confuses the enemy.
