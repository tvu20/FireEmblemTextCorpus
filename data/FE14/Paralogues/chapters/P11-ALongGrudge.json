Weeks?"}, {"speaker": "Hisame", "line": "I just... I just want you to leave. You forget how time passes here. I've learned to be just fine on my own. So, good-bye, Father."}, {"speaker": "Hinata", "line": "... Aw, man. I really screwed this up. Last time he was so happy. But, now? There goes my little boy, off and running... Whoa. Wait.

There's no point. You're a hero. I'm not."}, {"speaker": "Hinata", "line": "Hmm. You're being a blockhead, Son. So I'm going to lay it out for you... Did you SEE yourself out there?! That was a HERO on the field! How'd you even do any of that? You were amazing. That's proof enough that you're right. I wasn't here. YOU trained you."}, {"speaker": "Hisame", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Hinata", "line": "Hisame, please. Travel with me? You don't need to go back."}, {"speaker": "Hisame", "line": "Hmm? Go with you?

I mean, Dad... All right. Let's go. Heh. You haven't changed a bit. Just like when you used to show up and I'd come running..."}, {"speaker": "Hinata", "line": "Haha! Yeah! Where's my hug?!
