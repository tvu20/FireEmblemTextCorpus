Hello? Anyone? I\u2019m looking for my son Dwyer! Hmpf. As always, that lazy lout is probably snoring away somewhere. Clearly, his bad attitude has infected this whole village. What a sleepy place. Why do I even bother fetching Dwyer his favorite coffee beans? How did I come to buttle my son, when he should come running to serve me? What\u2019s this? Who\u2019s there? I see you scurrying in the shadows. Get over here! Of all the... My son can\u2019t even have me greeted properly on my arrival?"}, {"speaker": "Invader", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Jakob", "line": "What? How\u2019d you get here? Did you follow me?

Of course he\u2019d have to show up in the middle of all this. Well, forget him. I\u2019ve got enough to worry about, keeping us all alive in here. Everyone! Stay close!

Because I don\u2019t always laze around here."}, {"speaker": "Jakob", "line": "Well, how irksome. Here I had you pegged for a complete loafer.
