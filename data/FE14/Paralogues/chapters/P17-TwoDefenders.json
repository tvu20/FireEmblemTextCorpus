I've been marching along for what seems forever and a day. But it's not much farther until I reach Nohr. I hope Father is glad to see me. But the closer I get, the more enemies I see. Is trouble everywhere here? I hope I'm able to reach him. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Just need to keep telling myself that. I'm not a child anymore."}, {"speaker": "Child", "line": "Help! Help me! Please!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatius", "line": "What's wrong? You look as if devils have been at your back!"}, {"speaker": "Old Woman", "line": "Oh, worse! Far worse! Devils we could fight! Our village is about to be invaded by enemies that go unseen!"}, {"speaker": "Ignatius", "line": "Invisible enemies? Oh, no! What will you do? I mean, what can I do? I am Ignatius, son of Benny, one of Nohr's most formidable knights. You can have...confidence in me.  All right, you two run past. I'll stand my ground here and fight them off.

And then...our village will be wide open to those fiends."}, {"speaker": "Benny", "line": "What's that? Who was he?"}, {"speaker": "Child", "line": "We don't know. He said his name was Ignatius.
