Trying to make me feel better?"}, {"speaker": "Percy", "line": "Golly, thanks a bunch, Ace! You always know just what to roar! You're the best buddy ever. With you as my sidekick, nothing's gonna get me down! I'm done obeying Pop's dumb rules. Which includes staying here in my Deeprealm. Let's get outta here, Ace!"}, {"speaker": "Arthur", "line": "He must be around here somewhere. PERCY? HELLO? PERCY? Oh, my son! My offspring! Oh, sidekick, not yet old enough to kick at my side!

It's got bandit written all over it!"}, {"speaker": "Arthur", "line": "Oh, um, well... I assure you that my chin is not the graffiti wall of evil. Here, fellow, my son comes back. He'll clear this matter up."}, {"speaker": "Percy", "line": "Back, evildoer! Return to whatever dark hole of naughtiness you crawled out of! I think that mercenary has you pegged.
