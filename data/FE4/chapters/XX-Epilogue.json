Where do we begin from there?"}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "There\u2019s only one way to rebuild all the sacred lands. Everyone needs to come together and share the work among you. And for that, you\u2019ll need a good leader. The crusaders\u2019 heirs will be returning home to assume their rightful thrones.

A new world. And your role is the most crucial of all.
