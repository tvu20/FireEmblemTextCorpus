It lies under the watchful guard of the valiant pegasus knights and wind mages, and so for over a century since its foundation, Silesse has maintained itself as a neutral nation and persistent all invaders.", "However, ever since the death of its king several years ago, the royal family has been plagued with strife over its inheritance, and shades of war creep over the peaceful land. The late king and his wife, Queen Rahna, had a single son, Prince Lewyn. The king's greedy younger brother, Duke Daccar, objects to Lewyn being heir to the throne and has confined himself to Zaxon Castle in protest. As if acting in concert, the king's youngest brother, Duke Maios, has set to work raising an army for himself at Thove Castle.", "Out of disgust at his uncles, Prince Lewyn left Silesse to travel the world years ago.

I'm doing all I can to hasten your liberty. I've sent letter after letter to Belhalla to advocate for your innocence. As of yet, however, I've still heard nothing at all from King Azmur."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "This... This has to be Reptor's doing! First he betrays my father, and now he's stopping all of your letters! He must be!"}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "Calm yourself, Lord Sigurd! I know well the pain you're feeling, but you cannot let your grudges rule you. Your anger will not save your father. Hatred will only destroy you from within.

I really appreciate all you've done for me."}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "It's alright, Lord Sigurd. Oh, before I forget... There actually has been some good news from Grannvale of late."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Good news, you say?"}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "Mm. A previously unknown daughter of Prince Kurth has been discovered. All of Grannvale is rejoicing at the news."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Huh?! Is that even possible?"}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "It took King Azmur only a glance to recognize her true heritage. She bears the brand of Naga, the proof of a true heir to House Belhalla. There is no doubt. She is Kurth's child."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "I see... Thank goodness. At the very least, this means the royal lineage won't go extinct."}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "That's not all. The princess and Duke Arvis are in a relationship.

I'll be with you in a moment. Lord Sigurd, one last thing... Beware of Duke Maios of Thove. I regret to say that my brother-in-law has long hungered to claim Sailane for himself. It's only a matter of time till he goes so far as to attack you. I wish I could provide you with reinforcements, but..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "...I know. The capital is under the very same threat from Duke Daccar of Zaxon. You cannot afford to weaken your own guard. Daccar will pounce upon you given even a hint of weakness.

You're still mad at me, then?"}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "Of course I am! Do you have any idea how hard it was without you, and how worried I've been after you? That my own son could be so cold-hearted... I thought I knew you better than this."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "Look, I know you're upset, but I had my reasons for all this. But come on, I'm home safely! Surely that counts for something and you can forgive me? I swear I'll make up for it and be the very picture of a good son. Hey, how about I give you a shoulder massage to start?"}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "Oh! What nerve! Treating me as if I'm an old crone... Look, Lewyn, there are more pressing matters which we need to talk about, and soon. Come to Silesse as soon as possible. Do not forget! Do I make myself clear?"}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "...Sigh. I thought she'd never stop."}, {"speaker": "Annand", "line": "Don't be fooled by your mother's outward behavior, milord. She's actually very happy, now you've returned. Indeed, she hasn't been anything as cheerful as this since before you left."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "Thanks, Annand. Knowing you're at her side is a big relief. Look after her, okay?"}, {"speaker": "Annand", "line": "Yes, sir! Rest assured, I will protect the queen with my life, on my honor as the captain of the Silessian pegasus knights."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "Thanks. Oh, one more thing...

There are things he shouldn't know just yet, of course... Erinys, I'll be leaving with Queen Rahna and returning to Silesse Castle shortly. You'll stay here and keep and eye on Prince Lewyn. Best of luck."}, {"speaker": "Erinys", "line": "Thank you, Annand."}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "Sigurd, we'll now be taking our leave. It's high time we returned to Leonster. Rest assured, we'll be back, this time leading the full military might of Leonster to your aid. May that day come soon, my friend."}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "I'm going with Quan, Sigurd. Don't worry, though. We'll be back before you know it! Take care of yourself."}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "By your leave, sir, I'll be departing with my lord. Thank you for all you've done for us. Don't give up, sir. One day, I know, the charges against you will be cleared and your good name restored. I know you can do this."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Thank you.

D\u00edthorba, I trust your pegasus corps are already briefed on your mission?"}, {"speaker": "D\u00edthorba", "line": "Yes, sir. Our task is clear. My squadron is to raid the enemy from above, disrupting their tactics."}, {"speaker": "Maios", "line": "Good. Now get to work!

Perhaps Lord Sigurd has had quite the positive influence on you after all."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "Oh, come on, Mother! You don't need to act like I'm still a child. Besides, Sigurd is hardly all that much older than I am."}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "Dear, compared to the likes of Lord Sigurd, you may as well still be a screaming infant.

Oh..."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "Annand... I should've been the one to die out there. Not her. If only I'd gotten here sooner! Mother, I'll be here to protect you from now on. I won't let Annand's death go to waste. I swear, I will never, ever leave you again."}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "Oh, Lewyn... I never thought you were capable of saying anything so kind.

What's this... warmth?"}, {"speaker": "Rahna", "line": "Lewyn, never forget: the Wind Crusader flows as the gentlest breeze. His way is to guide all the peoples of the world on the path of peace.

You've given me the most wonderful year here, and you've done so much to put my mind at ease. My mother died when I was still very young, so as I grew up, I never knew the unconditional love of a mother.. But thanks to you, here in Silesse, I've come to know that very same warmth.
