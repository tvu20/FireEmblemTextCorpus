The six states, while still subservient to the royal family, each occupy vast swaths of Grannvale's land and maintain mighty militaries of their own.", "Owing to King Azmur's advanced age, the governance of Grannvale falls to his son, the highly respected Prince Kurth.", "Kurth has two trusted advisors in his rule: Lord Byron of House Chalphy, and Lord Ring of House Jungby. Grannvale's chancellor, Lord Reptor of Friege, has long objected to the thread to his influence posed by Kurth and his advisors, and has allied himself with the avaricious Lord Langobalt of House Dozel to form a faction opposed to Kurth's rule over Grannvale.", "The young duke of House Velthomer, Lord Arvis, leads the Royal Guard in the king's care and so has little time for the circus of politics. Only Father Claude of House Edda, could foresee the oncoming storm. Into the midst of this tense situation, comes dire news from Jugdral's east. Darna, a town in the Aed Desert with deep ties to Grannvale, is now besieged by savage warriors from Isaach. Reports of a brutal massacre abound.", "The news is met by the people of Grannvale with furious cries for retribution, and before long the kingdom declares war on Isaach. Prince Kurth leads Grannvale's charge on his father's behalf, commanding the military might of the kingdom's six houses.", "At Kurth's side as always is none other than Lord Byron, a highly decorated hero of peerless valor in his own right.", "Grannvale has poured its entire military might into the Isaach campaign, and precious few soldiers remain behind. With its neighbors - Agustria to the west and Verdane to the south - bound in alliance with Grannvale, none dare to dream they could ever be threatened.", "It is not long at all, however, before he people's confidence is shattered. As if from nowhere, a vast horde from Verdane led by Prince Gandolf crosses the Grannvale border and lays siege to Jungby Castle. In Lord Ring's absence, his daughter, Lady Aideen, is Jungby's only guardian. Lord Byron has entrusted the defense of Grannvale in his absence to his son, Sigurd, who remains at Chalphy Castle with a mere handful of soldiers. A friend of Aideen since childhood, Sigurd is horrified to hear of the Jungby siege, and even with so few soldiers, is determined to protect Aideen and his fatherland from the savage Verdanite hordes.", "The year is 757, Grann calendar. And thus the threshold of fate is cast open. Nobody could have known then that this simple disturbance was but the first of countless calamities to come."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Midir", "line": "Milady, the castle is completely surrounded! We've failed you... We couldn't do a thing to save you from them..."}, {"speaker": "Aideen", "line": "It's alright, Midir. ...Every one of you did the best you could do. Please, you needn't worry about me. You must ensure that as many of you survive this as possible."}, {"speaker": "Midir", "line": "No, milady. We might not stand a chance, but every last one of us will give our lives to protect you, right to the very end."}, {"speaker": "Aideen", "line": "Thank you, Midir. ...I'm so sorry."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Gandolf's army already has Jungby surrounded. Aideen is in grave danger! Noish, I'm going to help her. I'm leaving Chalphy in your hands."}, {"speaker": "Noish", "line": "Hold, milord. Surely you don't intend to go alone?"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Nearly all of our forces are already on the march to Isaach with Father. There's hardly anybody left to call upon. They may be simple savages, but Verdane's army is still huge. I can't risk your lives by forcing you to face them."}, {"speaker": "Noish", "line": "Perish the thought, milord! I was born a knight, and I will gladly risk dying a knight's death in your name. To allow our lord to die alone in battle would be an unspeakable disgrace. We shall be by your side, every step of the way. Alec, I trust you're of the same mind?"}, {"speaker": "Alec", "line": "Yeah, of course! But there's more than just Jungby at stake. We've got to stop by the nearby villages first. Those thugs'll try to beat us to them, and they'll loot, massacre, and burn them all down if they do. We've gotta get there first, and lend the locals a hand in locking the villages down and fortifying their defenses."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Absolutely. We mustn't neglect our knightly duties to the people, especially not at a time like this. Good point, Alec."}, {"speaker": "Alec", "line": "Actually, that was all Oifey's idea. That kid's every bit the tactician they say he is. Give him a few years and he'll be a match for his old grandpa, Lord Sesar!"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Oifey's still around the castle, huh... Oifey! I know you're here. You can come out now!"}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "My apologies for still being here, sire. Still, if you would allow it, I'd like to join you in battle. I can't just sit back while you risk your lives."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "I don't know... You're still so young. Are you sure you're ready for this?"}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "I'm already fourteen, sire. I may not be battle-ready just yet, but there's still so much I can do to support you. Please, allow me to accompany you. I swear I won't let you down."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Fair enough, Oifey. After all, you've already spent two years training as my squire. Real battlefield experience would be fantastic for your training, but you're still definitely not up to actual combat duty for now. How about you ride with me as my advisor instead?"}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "Y-yes! Thank you, sire! Thank you!"}, {"speaker": "Noish", "line": "Milord, what of the the defense of Chalphy itself in our absence? Leaving the castle unattended is risky. Should the enemy slip past us, an unguarded castle will fall easily and spell us a swift end."}, {"speaker": "Alec", "line": "Noish, I'd say there's only one man who we can depend upon for that... Eh, Arden?"}, {"speaker": "Arden", "line": "Hold on a moment! Why me, Alec?"}, {"speaker": "Alec", "line": "Sturdy as a brick wall! Strong as an ox! Slow as a turtle! Face it, Arden, you were born for guard duty! Haha!"}, {"speaker": "Arden", "line": "Pah... I'm strong and tough, I know, but you really don't need to call me slow!"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "He has a point, Arden. Would you? You're the most apt at guard duty."}, {"speaker": "Arden", "line": "Sigh... Fine, I'll do it. But you have to bring me with you at least once! I don't want to be left out of the action."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Right, men, it's time to set out. Let's start by assisting the villages, and then it's onward to Jungby!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "Sire, might I recommend stopping by the castle town once you're rested? To see you unharmed should help to calm and reassure your citizens."}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "You curs seriously haven't seized this puny castle yet? Useless, the lot of you... Outta my way! I'll do it myself!"}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Kehehe... You! Not bad for being here all on your lonesome, but I've had enough of your struggling!"}, {"speaker": "Midir", "line": "Urgh... Milady, I... Forgive me\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Aideen", "line": "Ah! Midir, I\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Well, well, looks like we have quite the gem here, and Jungby's princess to boot! You're coming home with me, dearie. Listen up, DiMaggio. I'm heading back. You and Gerrard are in charge."}, {"speaker": "Dimaggio", "line": "Er, yes, sir\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Hah, relax! Won't be long, and I'll be bringing Kinbois's lot along for the fun. When I do, all Grannvale's our oyster. Even Belhalla ought to be easy pickings, what with nobody around to stop us! The kingdom's all ours, boys!"}, {"speaker": "Dimaggio", "line": "Leave it to us, sir!"}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Oi, quit your dawdling! We don't have all day, y'know!"}, {"speaker": "Aideen", "line": "\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Cut the bridge! I'll have none of those Grannvale worms crossing over here!"}, {"speaker": "Barbarian", "line": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Oi, Gerrard. I'm going back to Marpha for now. You're in charge of the border. Stay sharp, we clear?"}, {"speaker": "Gerrard", "line": "Yes, sir. But, er, your lordship... Who's that there dame you have?"}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "The spoils of war, m'boy! She's coming back to Marpha to marry me. Whaddya think? A real keeper, eh?"}, {"speaker": "Gerrard", "line": "I'll say! Just looking at her's makin' me mouth water."}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Back off! This one's mine. You'll have your pick of all Grannvale once we're done here. Keep it in your pants a little longer, yeah?"}, {"speaker": "Aideen", "line": "What animals... ...Gods above, I implore you, bestow upon these men a hint of human decency\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Gandolf", "line": "Oi, what're you mumbling about now? We're outta here. No dawdling, y'hear?"}, {"speaker": "Dimaggio", "line": "Get to work, boys! Our next stop's Chalphy. Don't forget to milk the villages for all they got!"}, {"speaker": "Azelle", "line": "It looks like we made it just in time, Lex."}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "Mm. And by the look of it, Sigurd's staring down the entire Verdane army with just a handful of men! Bet he'll be glad for the help! But geez, Azelle, I can't believe I let you drag me into yet another mess like this."}, {"speaker": "Azelle", "line": "With the war in Isaach going on, there's hardly anyone left to defend Grannvale. Sigurd's few knights are all we have, and they're out here risking their lives on behalf of the entire country. I couldn't just leave them to die..."}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "Heh... We both know there's more to it than that. Come on, Azelle. What's the real reason we're here?"}, {"speaker": "Azelle", "line": "Er... I... I have no idea what you mean!"}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "It's that Lady Aideen of Jungby, isn't it? Come on, everybody knows you like her. You just came for her sake, didn't you?"}, {"speaker": "Azelle", "line": "N-no! Of course not, you dolt!"}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "Really? Then why's your face beet-red? Looks like somebody's got a giiiiiiirlfriend!"}, {"speaker": "Azelle", "line": "L-Lex, knock it off! Come on, we've wasted enough time."}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "Hahaha, got it. Time to teach these Verdanite thugs a lesson or two!"}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "Good, we aren't too late. I pray Sigurd is still unhurt."}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "Mm. I'm sure my brother's doing just fine out here, but it won't be easy without a magic user in his ranks. I want to do all I can as a healer to help out and save lives... Quan, I'm sorry I dragged you into this mess as well... I know Chalphy isn't my family anymore, now that we're married, but I couldn't just sit back and do nothing. Thank you so much for coming. Not just from me, but from Sigurd."}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "There's no need for thanks, Ethlyn. Sigurd is every bit as important to me as he is you, remember? He is my brother-in-law now, after all. ...And I couldn't possibly leave you to fight all alone."}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "Thank you, dear... Thank you so much..."}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "Milord, milady, we should hurry. Lord Sigurd still awaits us on the battlefield just ahead."}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "Sire, there's a young knight collapsed over there!"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Oh? ...That's Midir! Midir, hold on! What happened here?"}, {"speaker": "Midir", "line": "Uh... You... ...Lord... Sigurd?"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Are you alright, Midir? Where's Aideen?!"}, {"speaker": "Midir", "line": "I... don't know. But Gandolf..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Gandolf... That's all I need to hear. Midir, I'll do all I can to rescue her. You stay here and rest up."}, {"speaker": "Midir", "line": "I can't, sir. I've got to help! I can't stand staying here, knowing those thugs still have her!"}, {"speaker": "Gerrard", "line": "DiMaggio stuffed up, huh? Shoulda known he was worthless! Prince Gandolf's not gonna like this. Put the bridge back up, boys! We ain't gonna blow it like DiMaggio!"}, {"speaker": "Arvis", "line": "When His Majesty asked me to observe the battle, I hardly expected to see Chalphy struggle so against simple barbarians.

I pledge my undying fealty to His Majesty."}, {"speaker": "Filat", "line": "From here, it is imperative that you hold Evans. We can ill afford to lose such a valuable defensive point to the enemy. You and your men shall be handsomely paid for your service. Provided, of course, that our territory survives unscathed. Best of luck, Lord Sigurd.

I bet they'll be happy to help you our right back."}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "Pay attention, kid! Weapons aren't created equal. See, swords best axes, axes best lances, and lances best swords. This right here's why you've gotta use your head before you blunder into battle. Speaking of battle, if you ever find yourself hurting out there, a chapel is the best place to go. It ain't free, mind. Every bit of health you regain there'll cost five gold pieces. But you can't put a price on your health."}, {"speaker": "Old Woman", "line": "Oh? You came to save us? I was so sure this was the end! Take this little trinket. It's the least I can do.

Your enemies'll be too slow to hit you!"}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "The master archers of House Jungby all bear descent from the archery god, Ulir. Our noble duke, Lord Ring, has twin daughters as well as a younger son. Alas, the duke lost one of the girls to pirates, years and years ago... She was just a little lass...
