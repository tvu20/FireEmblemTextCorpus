A pacifist, King Batur has long worked to build a lasting peace with Grannvale, while also keeping his aggressive sons appeased. Ultimately, however, it was Batur himself who violated the peace he held so dear.", "Batur's three sons have unexpectedly launched an assault on Grannvale. Kinbois, the second son, lord of Genoa...

The Verdanites have abducted Lady Aideen of Jungby. They've made it amply clear that they don't plan on releasing her. Taking her back by force is our only option."}, {"speaker": "Eldigan", "line": "Ah, I see. That makes sense. Well, whatever you do, you cannot afford to leave Evans unattended. My fellow Agustrian lords have been of a rancorous sort of late... Ah, I know.

You're safe now."}, {"speaker": "Shannan", "line": "Really?! Then Ayra doesn\u2019t have to fight anymore! My Aunt Ayra was forced to fight \u2018cause Kinbois had me!

If we're going to harbor its prince, shouldn't we inform the king?"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "He's a child, Oifey. That war has nothing to do with him. I'll find a way to get him home safely, but for now, we need to look after him."}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "Understood, sire."}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "Just as I thought... Lord Sigurd really is such a kind man\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Ayra", "line": "Genoa has fallen to Grannvale?! No! I... I must get to Shannan!"}, {"speaker": "Elliot", "line": "Tch. Does Grannvale really think it can just waltz into Verdane with such a tiny force? How adorable. Men, here's our chance. Evans is ripe for the plucking, then it's straight for the Grannvale border!"}, {"speaker": "Cavalier", "line": "Is that... No! That's the Heirhein army! Lord Eldigan won't like this\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Ayra", "line": "Shannan isn\u2019t here!? No\u2026 The Grannvalians must have him.

I should've known Elliot just couldn't keep his nose out of this. Take care of the castle, Lachesis. Sigurd is in dire need of my help."}, {"speaker": "Lachesis", "line": "Of course, brother. Please, do all you can to help Sir Sigurd."}, {"speaker": "Eldigan", "line": "Right! Cross Knights, move out! Our foe is the Heirhein army. I don't expect a challenge, but stay alert nonetheless!"}, {"speaker": "Eldigan", "line": "Elliot! Ambushing them like a common thief, are you? A cowardly act, ill befitting the honor of a knight! Withdraw immediately, or I will take action. We both know you're no match for me."}, {"speaker": "Elliot", "line": "What's this? Eldigan?! I should've known you would side with Grannvale!"}, {"speaker": "Eldigan", "line": "In doing this you are crossing not just Grannvale, nor me, but your very liege! We bow to the reverent King Imca, who desires only peace with Grannvale. Would you truly cross His Majesty?"}, {"speaker": "Elliot", "line": "You fool! Only you would still seriously heed that senile old fool's word. The lords of Agustria are united against both Grannvale and any peace with them!"}, {"speaker": "Eldigan", "line": "Wrong, for I will not stand with you! Agustria cannot afford the crippling tolls of war, and nor can Grannvale. Our past stands as a testament to this. Learn well, Elliot: we, the nobility, know not the suffering brought by war. War cripples only the powerless, our subjects. I will not abide your lust for glory at the expense of our people!"}, {"speaker": "Elliot", "line": "A pretty little speech, but that won't save you now. I knew all along: you and I were always fated to clash, Eldigan! Today, we settle this, once and for all! Men, the enemy is now House Nordion! I want Eldigan's head on a platter!"}, {"speaker": "Eldigan", "line": "Elliot has fled? Very well. Leave him to lick his wounds. We're done here. Withdraw!"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "N-no! Please, let go of me!"}, {"speaker": "Ruffian", "line": "Heh heh... What's the matter? C'mon, I'm just askin' for a little date."}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "I need to go home, sir. I ask of you, please, pay me no mind!"}, {"speaker": "Ruffian", "line": "Shaddup! Keep up your yappin' and you'll regret it!"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "What's going on here? Let the girl go."}, {"speaker": "Ruffian", "line": "What's your problem!? This ones- ...Urgh! You're not that Grannvale paladin, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "You understand the situation? Then be on your way. There are none I loath more than your kind. The girl has given you her answer. Now, leave her be and get out of my sight!"}, {"speaker": "Ruffian", "line": "Yeah... Yeah, got it... My bad, missy. I was just teasin', is all. Sorry. I'll be off now..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Are you alright?"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "Y-yes... Thank you, Sir Sigurd."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Hm?

I met a woman named Aideen not long ago in this castle, and..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "She spoke of me."}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "She did.

I must go."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Wait! Please, I just want to talk for a little longer--"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "...I am truly sorry.

What's the matter?"}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Oh... You must be the town elder! That woman who ran off just now... Do you know who she is?"}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "Ahh, of course. That woman is called Deirdre. She is a priestess of the Spirit Forest."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Deirdre... She's beautiful..."}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "Ohoho, even a refined man like you can't resist being charmed by her ilk! Could it be love at first sight? Hoho..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Sir, please. Don't tease me. And yet... I've never seen anybody so beautiful before. I... I need to see her again."}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "Alas, sir, for it cannot be so. The folk of the Spirit Forest staunchly refuse to partake in the world beyond their woods. Furthermore, that girl and members of her clan are forbidden from ever liaising with men. Village lore dictates that should this ever happen, calamity would befall the world. You have no choice, sir. Resign yourself of that girl."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "What superstitious nonsense! That poor girl... Deirdre... we must meet again."}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "Ugh, dammit! I dropped my axe!"}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "What you dropped... Was it this golden axe? Or perhaps, this silver axe?"}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "Oh, no. My axe isn't anything as fine as those two. It's just a plain old iron axe."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "Such an honest person... As a reward... I present you with this brave axe... Farewell, Lord Lex..."}, {"speaker": "Lex", "line": "Er\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Jamke", "line": "Father, this is absurd! Why do you still refuse to listen to me? My brothers already have fallen, and it's only a matter of time before they come for the capital as well. The Grannvale commander, Sir Sigurd, is a good man. Please, end the war while you still can!"}, {"speaker": "Batur", "line": "I... allowed Gandolf's raid only because I'd been told that Grannvale would surely come to invade us first. Never did I intend for a war like this."}, {"speaker": "Jamke", "line": "It was that sorcerer, Sandima, who told you that, wasn't it? You, Kinbois, and Gandolf trusted him too readily. You've all been deceived!"}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "Now, now, Prince Jamke. That's enough of that. Your duty as prince is to lead your men into the fray. Dawdling in a place like this would be deeply troublesome of you."}, {"speaker": "Jamke", "line": "Argh! Damn you, Sandima!"}, {"speaker": "Batur", "line": "That's enough, Jamke. Listen to Sandima. Go. Lead your men into the fray."}, {"speaker": "Jamke", "line": "Father! ...Very well. If you won't change your mind, even now, then... I'll see this through as well. But be warned. Should I return victorious, Sandima, I'll allow you to live no longer!"}, {"speaker": "Batur", "line": "Sandima... Perhaps, for all this time, you may not have been entirely forthright with me. You did assure me that Grannvale hungers to claim our land, and yet..."}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "Feh... And just what are you saying now? To think, I believed that your Verdanites would be of use... You truly are naught but savages. You are worthless. Completely and utterly worthless! And from now on, your army is mine to command!"}, {"speaker": "Batur", "line": "What?! No, stay back! Back, I- -Guhh..."}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "Feh... Feeble-minded old fool."}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "So, you've put an end to the king, Sandima... Do you expect that the Verdanite army will still obey your command?"}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "Oh, Archbishop Manfroy! How long have you been here, Your Eminence? The army is of no concern at all. They need only know that the king has fallen ill."}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Hrm, I see... And what of the situation here? Does the plan progress?"}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "My sincerest apologies, Your Excellency. That Grannvalian... Sigurd, or something, has proven to be an unexpected obstacle to the invasion."}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Hrm... And what of the search for the Loptrian scion? Have you found Sigyn's daughter?"}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "Er... No, not yet..."}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Imbecile! After all of the pains I have gone to, to locate the boy... The son of Sigyn is still in Belhalla, but he's worthless without the female. Listen well. Sigyn was an heir of Prince Maira, brother of an emperor of the old Loptyr Empire. Sigyn alone in this era inherited the sacred blood of the dark lord. That woman broke the commandment that Maira placed upon his heirs and bore two children. Do you know what this means?"}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "Yes, Your Eminence. When the blood of the two heir intersects, the second coming of the dark lord, Loptyr, will be upon us."}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Precisely, and so too shall we, descendants of the Loptyr Empire, return to this world. You know as well as I, Sandima, how heavily our fates depend upon the resurrection of the dark lord. You know well our order's centuries of exile, hidden deep within the Aed Desert. You know well the abuses... The famines... How we were sustained only by dreaming of the day when the Empire will rise again. And at long last, that day is upon us."}, {"speaker": "Sandima", "line": "Understood, Your Eminence. If I must surrender my life to ensure that the plan is realized, I will do it gladly!"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "Wait... Lord Sigurd..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Hm? Is that... Deirdre! Ah! So this must be your Spirit Forest. Thank the gods! For a moment I thought that I might never see you again."}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "Milord, listen. The dark priest Sandima guards Castle Verdane with his wicked magic. You must go no further. You would surely be killed. Please, you mustn't go..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "But I mustn't place my men in even greater danger, either. I have no choice but to go."}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "...I see. Then I will go with you."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Excuse me?"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "This is called a Silence staff. So long as my own power is enough to pierce his magical resistances, it will seal his magic away. Trust me, milord. I'll ensure his dark spells never harm anyone ever again."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "I'd never imagined that you'd have such power... But why... Why are you helping me?"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "...I tried to forget you all I could, but it was all in vain. ...I no longer know what I should do..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "What is it you're afraid of, Deirdre? I don't understand. But if you and I feel the same way, then surely we've nothing to fear. I... I love you, Deirdre\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "I heard of Sandima's defeat. I was afraid that he'd find me... He was a dark priest from a shadowy cult, sent to Verdane to find me."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "A... shadowy cult? What in the world do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "I don't know much of it myself. All I know comes from the last words of the old woman who raised me. Somewhere in this world, she said, there lies an ancient order dedicated to the ancient dark god, Loptyr. So devout are they, it is said that they plot to resurrect their once-fallen god."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Yes, I've heard those rumors myself. But why is this cult after you?"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "The dark god slumbers within my very blood... Through me, they have some way of reviving Loptous. This is why she told me on her deathbed: I must never be found, she said. I must never mingle with men..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "I see... So that's why you kept running away from me."}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "I was afraid of falling in love. I did all I could to forget you, but... Love found me still. I couldn't do it... I couldn't bear to lose you. I... no longer know what I should do..."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Deirdre... I know you must fear where your destiny might lead. But nothing will come of living in fear. I will protect you. Come what may, I will protect you. Deirdre, if you and I feel the same way, then we've nothing to fear. O gods above, should our love be a sin, then deliver punishment unto me alone! I swear this day: Even should my body be rendered and rent, no regrets will ever haunt me. All I ask, O gods... Protect my beloved Deirdre in my stead, for all eternity!"}, {"speaker": "Deirdre", "line": "Ahh... Milord\u2026"}], "end": [{"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Deirdre?! Oh, thank the gods!

Please, you mustn't stress yourself further."}, {"speaker": "Batur", "line": "No... It's too late for me... Heed my word, Sigurd, for there is one final thing I must tell you... The misery here... the grief spreading across Jugdral... it is all the will of the dark priesthood... They blight our world from the shadows, all in the name of the revival of their dark god, Loptyr... Sandima... was one of them... He twisted us to war with Grannvale... for the sake of the cult's madness. The... the dark priests... they infect every corner of our world... Sigurd... Stay vigilant, lest you be tricked too! I...

Alas, Sigyn grew weary o' the tedious forest life an' she left it all behind, breaking ancient commandments. A couple o' years later, she came back, 'cept now she was pregnant.
