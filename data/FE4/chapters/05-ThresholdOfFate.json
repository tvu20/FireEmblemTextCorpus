Byron may not be long for this world, but he's determined to get that sword, Tyrfing, to his son with the very last of his strength.

And you're forgetting that the people of Isaach won't exactly be happy to see more Grannvaleans! Oifey alone won't last a minute there, but if I'm there it'll be okay. Who better to protect Seliph in Isaach than the prince of Isaach? Please... I promised her..."}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "Now that he mentions it, sire, I would be a tad more at ease if Shannan was there as well. I know you're reluctant to involve one as young as Shannan in something so dangerous. But I think we can agree he's become a talented warrior. Not to mention, I'll need Shannan to secure the people's support."}, {"speaker": "Sigurd", "line": "Hm... I'm sorry to burden you more, Shannan, but please... Take care of Seliph for me."}, {"speaker": "Shannan", "line": "Okay! Leave it to me! I'm gonna keep getting stronger, and nobody'll ever hurt Seliph! I'll teach him all about Deirdre, but...

You and your father were too generous sparing so many soldiers to help my brother, even though your father is presently so ill... But are you sure you're both willing to risk crossing a nation as all-powerful as Grannvale? The very thought is terrifying..."}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "Ethlyn, you know as well as I that Leonster, a nation built on the legacy of the Crusader Nova, is far stronger than its size suggests. No matter what happens, I could never regret giving my all for a cause as just as Sigurd's. My father feels precisely the same way. There's nothing to worry about, Ethlyn. After all, I'm wielding none other than G\u00e1e Bolg! I'll never fail with it at my side! Sigurd could certainly stand to have my aid."}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "I suppose you're right. He'd appreciate any help at this point..."}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "Ethlyn, we'll be entering hostile territory very shortly. The enemy could ambush us at any moment, so..."}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "Actually, Quan... I've been thinking this over quite a bit, and I'm coming with you after all. I'd like to see my brother again, and I simply can't abandon you now."}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "I can't allow that! I let you come with me solely because you promised to return home partway. To say nothing of Altena's presence! Look at her, a mere babe of three years curled up aslumber in her mother's lap. Should we be attacked, what then?"}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "Why, I'd fight my hardest to protect her. Nobody could possibly seize her from me! I certainly never intended at first to take her with us. But she simply wouldn't stop crying when I tried to leave her behind. You're right, though... You're right. I'll take her home."}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "Ethlyn, I'm sorry. I assure you I do know precisely how you feel, but Leif is barely born and waiting for you at home. Our children need their mother. Please, Ethlyn. Return home. I left Finn to defend the capital. You'll be safe with him."}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "Very well, but... I'd like just a little more time. I want to stay by your side a little longer. Please, Quan..."}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "Ethlyn... Very well. We've a little more time to spare."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Hehehe... Ah, Quan! The poor sod still has no clue we're tailing him. And there's a woman with him? What a clumsy mistake. Why, I daresay this is the long-awaited end of Leonster's famous Lanceritter! Those hooves'll be sinking clean into the sand. They can't so much as flail at us. Men, close in! This is it! Thracia's destiny lies before us, ripe for the grasping!"}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "What? Thracian wyvern knights?! No... You cannot be serious! Travant has been at our heels all along! Ethlyn, run! We've no hope of victory in this blasted desert!"}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "But... What will you do?"}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "They're like wild hyenas, Ethlyn! Children are little more than easy targets for them! Thracia has sought to reconquer our territory for centuries. I thought my absence would be taken as an invitation, so I left Finn behind with half the army in case they made the obvious move. Not once... Not even once did I ever suspect they would pursue US instead! I... This was all a mistake..."}, {"speaker": "Ethlyn", "line": "You can't give up now, Quan! It'll be okay. We're together, aren't we? At the very least, together we'll not go down easily!"}, {"speaker": "Quan", "line": "Ethlyn... Forgive me, please\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Arvis", "line": "I see. Duke Langbalt fell in battle\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Reptor", "line": "A-Arvis! What are we supposed to do now?! It was you who insisted that, even if we left the bulk of our armies on conquests with our sons, Sigurd would pose no threat to me at all! The situation before us is not the outcome you promised me!"}, {"speaker": "Arvis", "line": "Reptor, your overreaction is baseless. The deck is still stacked in our favor. The Velthomer army is already lying in wait for the rebels in the Yied Desert's depths. Furthermore, Thracian sellswords should be arriving to reinforce us at any moment. The enemy will assuredly be exhausted. So long as my army and yours cooperate, Sigurd and his rebels ought to fall with ease."}, {"speaker": "Reptor", "line": "I'm holding you to your word this time, Arvis.

The instant the dust of this war settles, House Friege will be granted the Agustrian throne to govern. House Dozel, meanwhile, will be entrusted with the rule of Isaach. Rest assured, Reptor. I will honor your rights to these territories."}, {"speaker": "Reptor", "line": "Hrm... Very well. Then I, too, will fight with all I have\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Kehehehehe... Greetings, Lord Arvis. The plan proceeds precisely on time, I see\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Arvis", "line": "Manfroy... If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times... You must not show your face here. Until the Grannvale throne is mine, I cannot allow you or your brethren to appear in public. Do you not understand?"}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Oh, we understand. We understand how you indulge the greed of men as vile as Reptor and Langbalt. We understand how even then, you still will not concede the very fact of our existence. The plan was to use those two buffoons until they could be used no further, then cast them aside and use their sons in their stead... Was it not?"}, {"speaker": "Arvis", "line": "Mm, but... Hear me well, Manfroy. I refuse to have any part in the revival of your Loptyr Empire. I've no desire to oppress your cult, but I've even less of a desire to consign the world to your dark lord's rule. Remember this well. Yes, the blood of Loptyr's scions flows in my veins, but there is so much more to me than that. My Loptyrian heritage is that of Saint Maira, a man who fought for the rights of the people. And more importantly, I am the one true heir to the Crusader Vala, Loptyr's sworn enemy. I will change this world for the better. Under my rule, humanity shall be free from the pain of prejudice, tyranny and oppression! What a pity it is, that Sigurd must die, but alas, all things require sacrifice."}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Ohohoho... A sacrifice for the sake of the Lady Deirdre, you mean. You are terrified, Lord Arvis. You fear her memory may someday return\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Arvis", "line": "Don't you dare bring her into this! Need I remind you? We. Are. In. LOVE! Nothing will ever come between us!"}, {"speaker": "Manfroy", "line": "Heh heh heh... I suppose you two need to hasten and make proof of this love of yours. Proof that will one day grow up and rise to be a most magnificent king! Heh heh heh\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Vaha", "line": "The rebels are finally headed this way? Heh, excellent.

So this is where it ends... Travant! You can have G\u00e1e Bolg, but don't you DARE so much as scratch Altena!"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "And so ends Quan... Magorn! You're in charge now. Head north and give Sigurd's army a fair share of grief. Let none of them escape. There's a fine bounty on each traitorous head, after all."}, {"speaker": "Magorn", "line": "Yes, Sir! Er, that said, what are we supposed to do with this child? She's just crying and crying. We don't know how to handle this. Shall I put her out of her misery, sir?"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Certainly not. Hand her over to me.

My apologies for dragging even an oasis town like Phinora into this godforsaken war."}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "Mm, at this point it was unavoidable.

What happened there?"}, {"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "As we understand it, the lance knights of Leonster were on a march north. They were savaged by Thracian wyvern knights en route.
