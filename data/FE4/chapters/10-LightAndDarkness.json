His route to the Empire takes him through the Miletos District, a collective of free cities which was once a vibrant and wealthy hub of commerce for all of Jugdral.", "Now, though, only a dying land choked by the Empire and Loptyrian Order lies before Seliph. At Chronos Castle, the seemingly mad rule of Queen Hilda has condemned countless citizens to savage, merciless deaths. And in the Rados region, Bishop Morrigan, under the command of Archbishop Manfroy, conducts child hunt after child hunt. Wealth. Liberty. Hope. Even life itself... All crumbled through the people's fingers.", "As the evil cult plies its sacrificial rituals and pile the bodies of their victims even higher, Seliph knows he cannot leave Miletos be. Greeted by raucous cheers from the people, the liberation army routed the Empire's men, freeing the city of Perlucos. The hope of Miletos had slowly been rotting away in the Empire's hands, but at long last, the arrival of Seliph and his liberation army breathes new life into the nation's future."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Julius", "line": "Ishtar, what's the status here?"}, {"speaker": "Ishtar", "line": "Everything is moving smoothly according to your plan, Lord Julius."}, {"speaker": "Julius", "line": "Heh...
