I'll strangle Blume himself with my bare hands!"}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "Please calm yourself, milord! This isn't the end quite yet. I've just had a word with King Lewyn.

Besides, if we just let ourselves lose now, wouldn't your men's death's all be in vain?

We may need to make sacrifices."}, {"speaker": "Seliph", "line": "So be it. At this point we've little choice. Not to mention, Shannan is likely still in the desert...
