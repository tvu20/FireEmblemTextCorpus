The peninsula's north, once ruled by several small kingdoms, is graced with rich pastures, while the south, the Kingdom of Thracia, is a harsh wasteland dominated by vast mountains. In ages past, seeking to claim the life-giving northern land as their own, Thracia's infamous wyvern knights have led countless brash attempts to conquer the north, only to be repelled at every turn by the might of House Leonster.", "Thracia looked to have won at last following their slaughter of Leonster's army in the Yied Desert, only to be defeated in turn by Blume of Freege, who claimed the land as his own. And so, the so-called Kingdom of North Thracia was born as yet another servant of the Empire. Over a decade has passed since then. Not even Thracia's King Travant, an ambitious man with a thirst for power and glory, dares to challenge the will of the Empire, and so a strange peace looms over the region.", "Or so it did, until the arrival of Seliph and his liberation army. Blume's defeat at his own castle has abruptly tipped the balance of the Thracian stalemate. Both the Alster and Leonster territories now lie under the liberation army's control, forcing Blume to retreat to Conote and muster the strength to take Alster back. The southern Manster Castle, governed by the \"goddess of lightning\", Princess Ishtar, braces itself for the threat of Thracian invaders.", "Meanwhile, across the border itself, both King Travant and his border watchman, General Maykov of Meath Castle, remain eerily silent. The people are united in their fondest wish: for the entirety of the Thracian Peninsula to return to the rule of House Leonster. And so dawns yet another battle..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Blume", "line": "Nngh... Curses! Never did I imagine that the rebels could pose such a threat. Banba! How could the three of you let yourselves be cowed into fleeing? What a disgrace!"}, {"speaker": "Banba", "line": "A thousand apologies, milord. However, you've nothing to worry about anymore. Even as we speak, General Muhammad prepares his brigade to lay siege to Alster, and General Ovo's cavalry are en route to Leonster. We, too, shall rejoin the fray shortly."}, {"speaker": "Blume", "line": "Hrm... Don't you dare fail me this time. And what of King Travant? Why are the promised Thracian reinforcements nowhere to be seen?"}, {"speaker": "Banba", "line": "We've yet to receive any response to any of our messengers so far."}, {"speaker": "Blume", "line": "Gah...

Even as we speak, Lord Seliph and his liberators are out there fighting for the District. They'll be here before long. Go! Tell your friends and family that your freedom is so very nearly in reach! Please, my friends, believe me. Manster's freedom is fast approaching!"}, {"speaker": "Arion", "line": "Pardon me, Father, but King Blume is requesting our aid yet again.

He wishes to use us to help reclaim them."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "The Isaach rebels are led by that Seliph brat... Sigurd's spawn, correct? Heh... Poor, poor Blume. He's getting so old, even little children are a thorn in his side! Pay Blume no heed, Arion. The Empire and the rebels are best left to break themselves on each other for now. We'll mop up the leftovers once they're nice and weak."}, {"speaker": "Arion", "line": "I should have known, Father... All along, you've been waiting out Blume's little storm, haven't you?"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "But of course! It'd make no sense to bend over backward for the man who snatched our hard-won north out from under our noses, would it? Leonster's downfall should have meant a peninsula unified under our rule...

I can only imagine your frustration, Father."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Thracia's fate depends on a unified peninsula. The verdant northern soils are the perfect cure for the famine and poverty wracking our south. We've been shunned and vilified for centuries, dismissed as ravenous hyenas... Yet what choice did we ever have? If not for our answer to this world's craving for sellswords, Thracia would never have had the funds to barely survive as we do. We've toiled in poverty long enough, Arion. It's high time Thracia carved itself a future!

It almost feels as if each blow is fueled by pure desperation..."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "See, Thracia's always had a bad lot in life. Much of its land is consumed by mountains. Farming its own food is a near impossible task, so they struggle to keep themselves fed. Thracia's men seek mercenary work to find the money to stay alive, while its women are stuck in whatever dreary jobs they can dig up. Don't get me wrong, Seliph. King Travant is still an awful man, but there's far more than his own petty gain at stake in his schemes. The Thracian army is as loyal to Travant as they come. They ardently believe it's Travant who'll guide Thracia out of its endless famine."}, {"speaker": "Seliph", "line": "I see... That does make sense..."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "The thing is, no amount of poverty will ever justify Thracia's aggression. Travant's brand of nobility and justice would never be accepted anywhere else in the world. All the peninsula's north can see are rowdy aggressors, who threaten their peaceful lives. As harsh as it may seem, Seliph, I trust you know you can't afford to stay your hand here. The Thracian royal family is the enemy, and a grave threat to the north's peace. Stripping them of power is the only choice. That task falls to us, and we can't fail now."}, {"speaker": "Altena", "line": "The liberators have seized Meath?! Could I have been wrong about them?
