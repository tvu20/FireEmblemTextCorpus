Beyond Meath and the engulfing maw of its peaks lies the wyvern knights' kingdom, Thracia. This rural nation is ruled by King Travant, who remains bound in coalition to Emperor Arvis. Thracia is the only state anywhere in Jugdral regarded as an ally by the Grannvale Empire.", "Within Thracia, Travant's minions await Seliph: his children, Altena and Arion, at the capital; the legendary General Hannibal, dubbed \"Thracia's Shield\", at Kapathogia Castle; the king's trusted advisor, General Distler, at Luthecia Castle; and a Loptyrian agent from the Empire, Bishop Judah, at Grutia Castle. Travant has fortified his kingdom for one final, full-scale showdown with the liberators.", "Thracia's people hardly offer Seliph an eager welcome. Fearing Seliph as a conqueror, they flock in droves to take up arms themselves. How could any justice lie in this conflict? For whose sake is this war being fought? For the first time, these questions now shake both Seliph and his army's resolve to the core\u2026"], "intro": [{"speaker": "Travant", "line": "ALTENA!! What was that sorry display? Why, pray tell, is Munster still standing?!"}, {"speaker": "Altena", "line": "Father... I..."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "I've no interest in any more excuses! Don't you dare belittle me, Altena. You are a warrior beyond compare, and you and Arion embody my will beyond these walls. I expect no less than for you to do your duty! And what do I find instead? You've ignored my orders, left an entire platoon to the slaughter, and strolled home as if nothing ever happened! I've never been more disappointed..."}, {"speaker": "Altena", "line": "I'm sorry, Father, but at least let me explain! I could never agree with such tactics, which enrich us at the expense of everybody else! How could you ever expect the proud Thracian people to accept prosperity built on the bones of others? Please, Father, rethink your ways!"}, {"speaker": "Arion", "line": "Enough, Altena. There's no place here for such meddling. Still your tongue and obey Father! Father, bear in mind Altena is still young and unseasoned. I suspect she merely found the last battle too overwhelming a prospect. Please do forgive her, even just this once."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "You know, Arion? If you'd just hold back on the coddling, perhaps Altena wouldn't be so stubborn! Look, Altena. I'll give you one last chance. Take a dracoknight platoon and retake Meath! If you so much as slip again, then daughter be damned, I will accept no excuses! Understood?"}, {"speaker": "Altena", "line": "Yes, Father\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Whew... Family resemblance, indeed! It's plainly obvious that she loathes me..."}, {"speaker": "Arion", "line": "Father, you have to remember that she's still a child. Like all children, she has yet to realize her thoughtless words have real effects."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Hmph, I suppose... I'm off to Kapathogia. I hear Hannibal's found himself some funny ideas about my plans. And so it falls to me to ensure he loses those ideas before somebody gets hurt..."}, {"speaker": "Arion", "line": "I've never seen father so fearful... What could possibly have happened\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "General Hannibal! The rebels have seized control of Meath. Altena is en route to counter-attack. Your armored knights will join her at once!"}, {"speaker": "Hannibal", "line": "Your Majesty, I've said it a thousand times and I'll say it again. There is no use fighting this war! We must arrange a truce with the liberators if we wish to recover the strength to endure! Bowing to the Empire was a despicable choice to start, one which now leaves us serving our citizens to the true enemy on a gilded platter!"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "I did not ask for such dopey nonsense! The rebels have slaughtered my soldiers, and now they've stolen our territory! The hour is far too late for a truce!"}, {"speaker": "Hannibal", "line": "I thought as much... Very well. I suppose I have no choice."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "What's this, Hannibal? Do I hear traitorous rumblings coming from that mouth of yours?"}, {"speaker": "Hannibal", "line": "Come now, Your Majesty! Never would a warrior such as I consider turning my cloak. Traitor, indeed!"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Really, now? Then I trust you wouldn't object to a test of your warrior's loyalty.

You have nothing to worry about, so long as you behave yourself. As soon as this war is won, you'll get him back. I don't get it, though. The boy isn't even your real son. How could he have such sway over you?"}, {"speaker": "Hannibal", "line": "Cairpre has brought so much joy into my life. A true family transcends simple blood..."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Ohoho! Could it be? Does Thracia's great statesman have a soft spot for children? Now, then. Thracia depends on you, Hannibal!"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Distler! War is on our horizon. Defense of this castle is in your hands."}, {"speaker": "Distler", "line": "Oh, Your Majesty! To have your presence is a true honor and pleasure! Rest assured, milord. Luthecia is as an impregnable wall! I've seen to it myself."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "I'll hold you to your word. Now, I've reason to doubt the loyalty of Hannibal at Kapathogia. I've taken his son hostage, just in case, and I'm leaving him to your custody."}, {"speaker": "Distler", "line": "Yes, sir! I'll not let him out of my sight. But should Hannibal turn his cloak-"}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Then you'll kill the son.

How soon can I expect the Emperor to honor his end of the treaty?"}, {"speaker": "Judah", "line": "Heh... Even the great King Travant is wary of betrayal, is he? Be at peace. An Imperial unit is on the march to Thracia even as we speak."}, {"speaker": "Travant", "line": "Good. In that case, I think I'll leave the defense of Grutia to your hands. Try not to get too cocky with the rebels, Bishop. They're of a treacherous sort."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "Looks like they're finally sending more wyvern knights our way, Seliph. This must be it. It's time we readied everybody for battle."}, {"speaker": "Seliph", "line": "I don't know, Lewyn. Our foremost enemy is the Empire, is it not? Waging a war here feels... meaningless."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "The point of a battle comes from how you conduct yourself in it, Seliph. And we hardly have much choice at this point! We're already this far into the fight..."}, {"speaker": "Seliph", "line": "But what of that dracoknight who was watching us from the Munster peaks? I've seldom seen such a sad look in anybody's eyes... How could I fight somebody like her...?"}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "That's enough, Seliph! This is a war! If you can't stand it any more, then go on! Run home to Tirnanog!"}, {"speaker": "Seliph", "line": "Lewyn\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Oifey", "line": "I beg your pardon, Lord Lewyn?! His Majesty is tired and stressed. Such harsh words are uncalled for..."}, {"speaker": "Lewyn", "line": "Look, I know... But everyone is just as stressed as he is, yet they all know that we can't afford to stop. With the resurrection of Loptous lurking on the horizon, it's crucial we get to Grannvale and stop the world falling to ruin while we still can."}, {"speaker": "Seliph", "line": "Thank you, Oifey... but Lewyn speaks the truth. An inevitable battle lies ahead, and if we see in it naught by futility, then my duty is to carve my own purpose into it. Come, Oifey! Lewyn! I'll never again flinch or turn away!"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Is something wrong, Finn? You've been awfully quiet since we left Manster... Is something on your mind?"}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "Oh... Yes my lord. I don't suppose you saw a lone dracoknight lurking atop the mountains of Manster?"}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Oh, the woman? I saw her. I don't believe it's every day that you encounter a female dracoknight, is it? Was there something amiss about her?"}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "It was her weapon... She was wielding G\u00e1e Bolg, Leonster's holy lance. And I sensed an aura cloaking her... The holy aura of Nj\u00f6run, like your father."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "What? What are you saying, Finn?!"}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "There is only one explanation, my lord. Your sister, Altena, mustn't have died in the Thracian ambush seventeen years ago. Nor must G\u00e1e Bolg have been lost..."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Altena?! She... She's still alive?! Then... Then what in the blazes was she doing commanding the Thracian army?"}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "I'd surmise that Travant took her back to Thracia as a child, and raised her as his own."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "Huh... Who knew a man as cold as Travant could do something so humane?"}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "It isn't so simple, my lord. Altena is the sole inheritor of your father's holy lineage from the earth goddess, Nj\u00f6run. As such, unlike you, she alone is capable of wielding G\u00e1e Bolg. Power is the only reason a man like Travant would ever be so kind to his enemy's child."}, {"speaker": "Leif", "line": "So he's tricked my sister just so he can use her like a... like a weapon! Travant... What a disgusting man... ...I want to help her, Finn. If we can tell her the truth, then I know we can work together to avenge our parents."}, {"speaker": "Finn", "line": "My lord, I believe you're the only one who could possibly convince her now. Even after all these years, my lord, you are still her brother. I'm certain she will open her heart to you if you try. Please, my lord.
