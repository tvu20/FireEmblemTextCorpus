Duke Brian of Dozel and the axe knights of the Grau Ritter; Duke Scorpio of Jungby and his elite archers, the Beige Ritter; and Freege's Queen Hilda and the war-mages of the Gelb Ritter stand between Seliph and the capital. Belhalla itself lurks under an eerie silence, as Ishtar and the enigmatic twelve Deadlords lie in wait to defend Prince Julius himself.", "Over a year has passed since that fateful first battle in Isaach.
