verdane has fallen to grannvale on orders from belhalla sigurd governs the region from evans castle with his newly wed wife deirdre ever at his side
however grannvales actions in verdane are ill received by neighboring agustria the lords of agustria lead a storm of heated rhetoric denouncing grannvale
to make matters worse the renowned pacifistic agustrian ruler king imca has been slain by an unknown hand imcas successor to the agustrian crown is his firstborn son prince chagall even as the agustrian crisis unfolds the bulk of grannvales army remains in isaach
invade verdane as the sole defender of grannvales front sigurd once again finds himself in battle 
lachesis im leaving for agusty i cant rest until ive convinced king chagall to end his foolish warmongering
please dont do it brother you know as well as i that chagall murdered his father himself youll only be endangering yourself for a lost cause he wont listen to you
you mustnt say such things about your king i too have heard the rumors of king chagalls involvement but they are just that rumors there remains no evidence against him surely his majesty will see reason in this matter if i simply persuade him
but 
enough ill leave three of my finest knights here to defend nordion should the worst come to pass lachesis you neednt look so sad i will be back i promise im not about to abandon you in death
eldie 
please your majesty reconsider your militant ambitions your father before you worked so hard to build an era of peace with grannvale a war will only bring ruin to our people bringing disgrace upon your good name for generations to come i implore you do not start a war
so its you  eldigan of nordion you dastard  my father adored you and you used his trust to undercut me at every turn but now my father is no more  and long live the king of all agustria for years youve made me play the fool and now i will reward you in kind guards throw this man in the dungeon
w wait your majesty please 
pfeh good riddance the eyesore send my orders to bordeaux at heirhein seize nordion castle once that nuisance is dealt with were clear to throw all weve got at grannvale
your majesty king chagall  i see youve made your decision at last
manfroy yes just as we agreed father is dead and by my hand  there is no turning back now even so i still dont know if we stand a chance
remember grannvale still adheres to that tawdry old peace treaty with you and their entire army is distracted in isaach strike now and you could not possibly fail
youre right the downfall of grannvale will mark the rise of agustria as jugdrals new leading power chagall emperor of the world  i like the sound of that
hmhmhm  we can only hope your ambition will be rewarded
milady weve received word that lord eldigan was arrested in agusty
what you must be joking oh  why didnt i try harder  i shouldnt have let him go 
that isnt our only problem milady with lord eldigan gone we need to be aware of heirheins movements knowing of his lordships absence a strike from them is inevitable after the verdane incident theyre most likely out for revenge on us  especially lord elliot
ugh that elliot  i cant believe how many times ive had to tell him im not interested in him smug self absorbed swine like him are the absolute worst if only more men were cut from the same cloth as eldie  its too bad they arent else perhaps someone would stand a chance to marry me perhaps
er  be that as it may lord eldigans cross knights are still dispatched to the north at fort silvail well away from here we three are all who remain nordion is vulnerable and they know it rest assured my brothers and i will do all we can to defend the castle but the odds are against us im sorry milady
very well thank you yves but please look after yourselves dont waste your lives for me be sure to tell eva and alva that im sorry for this
we are not worthy of such kind words milady even so lord eldigan handpicked us to defend you our lord gave us a task and we will see it through as paladins of nordion our lives are yours no matter what to our dying breaths we live to defend you
let me get this straight eldigan ticked off the king and got himself a little prison time for his troubles ahahaha thats perfect elliot lay siege to nordion at once lets see some tears roll down eldigans cheeks
with pleasure father
sire we have trouble it appears that lord eldigan has been taken prisoner and nordion is under attack i bear a message from lady lachesis pleading for aid
theyve taken eldigan why  why in the world would they treat a man so esteemed this way inform everybody to make ready we ride for nordion at once no matter the cost lachesis needs us he might never admit it but lachesis has always been dear to eldigan the loss of lachesis would gravely wound him 
milord  youre preparing for another battle arent you
im sorry deirdre i owe so much to eldigan i could never abandon his sister in a time like this
i thought as much im not about to stop you no  i will accompany you
what no i cant allow that i refuse to endanger you like this
milord do you not remember our vows you swore to never leave my side and  i  i am  uneasy  i have a feeling that if you and i were to part we would never find each other again  please grant me this let me stay by your side 
im sorry  youre right i did promise very well let us ride together but you mustnt leave my side
i wont
hah  heh  nobody heres ever bested me before who in the world are you anyway the way you fought  you were brimming with spirit hm  id wager theres something youre here to fight for right all ive done is chase the money for all these years  but i look at you and suddenly it all feels so meaningless hey i dont suppose youre recruiting maybe using my blade for something real and grander than me is just what i need
sigh  who in their right mind would want to be sent to this blasted outlook to think that even at a time like this i the pride of the agustrian ballisticians am  hm is somebody there
mustve been the wind 
hey you wanna hire my blade 10000 gold take it or leave it  right deal you aint gonna be disappointed
 sigh i dont get it no matter how hard i train or how strong i get im still the butt of every joke round here maybe if i were more like alec with how he can attack twice  thatd be all i need to get a bit of respect methinks  and maybe a cute lass while im at it  hee hee but im still just me  back to the ol grind i suppose  hang on whats this little ring thing ooh maybe its one of those magical ones i keep hearing about thatd be grand wouldnt it lets try her on  hm  hwooooarh w whats this power im feeling is this what alec feels like all the time
lady lachesis of nordion huh  ive been looking forward to this shes been playing cruel games with my heart for years  but look how the tables have turned ive an entire army behind me against her insignificant guard what could she possibly do shes powerless to resist coming back to heirhein with me and who knows  perhaps one day shell admit she wants it
our task is to form a defensive line dont let the enemy lure you from your post stand your ground understood
so heirheins finally made their move  perfect release the brigands on the villages as we arranged under the old king you couldnt even dare to meddle in any of his property  yet it is the easiest thing to cheat chagall strip everything of worth you find and bring it back here leave no stone unturned
heirhein is going for nordions throat hm  who do i side with here lets wait and see how this unfolds instruct the men to remain where they are until the dust settles
heirhein is secure sire what are you thinking for our next move do we pull out
hm the imminent danger has passed nordion should be safe but eldigan is still being held in the capital furthermore 
yes
im hearing that the frontier towns in the central forests are grappling with bandit raids we cant afford to leave them be
agreed it is crucial that we help the locals that we might convince them we arent their enemy in that case we must ride for the north at once theres no time to waste lets go
you imbecile you turned your back on this crisis to line your own pockets and now weve lost heirhein there had better be a good explanation for your behavior macbeth
er um  my humblest apologies your majesty forgive me i beg of you ive already sent out the order for waltzs sellsword unit to move in at once
hrmph theres the order to move in guess we dont ave much of a choice now bet hes gonna send us in then ave his men turn tail right when we need em im stayin put till i see how this all plays out oi beowulf how bout you
yeah i aint up for this at all waltz that macbeth swine really rubs me the wrong way im this close to just walking off the job
youre a free man beowulf if a job isnt right for you youre free to quit it thats the funny thing about mercenaries innit todays pals are tomorrows foes
amen to that hopefully were not gonna end up enemies someday wouldnt have a hope in hell against you would i
heh  aint met anybody in the whole world who can take me
whats going on sir whats that din outside
well well the bards still here are you you oughta get outta here weve got bandits headed our way
bandits isnt the agustrian army doing something about them
the army hah thats rich boy the armys too busy with their little civil war to deal with our problems clearly thats more important than our safety actually thats not all  rumor is the lord of anphony himself is pullin the bandits strings here
oh youve gotta be kidding thats it that guys gotta go ill go sort out the bandits okay now how big a rewardll be waiting here for me when i get back
still full of hot air are you just get outta here wise guy nobody heres got the time to listen to you blowing your own horn
oh come on a little confidence would be nice eh whatever 
oi lewyn runnin off behind my back now are ya
silvia damn er  i mean  you found me
yeah i found ya youve had your fun with me so youre just dumpin me without so much as a goodbye
hey careful with that tongue of yours we barely just met here a week ago weve only been out for dinner for  what two or three times youre a dancer im a bard  theres not much else to it
but  but you called me adorable that  that really meant a lot to me 
er  sometimes i just say things and dont really mean them  oh come on enough with the tears thingsll probably get more than a bit rough out there though think youll be okay
yeah i like it rough
geez  she was crying her eyes out just a few seconds ago its like she never really grew up 
huh
er nothing lets get going
oh that must be agusty castle id say were due for a break hopefully well be able to find a lead on prince lewyns whereabouts in town
right its show time boys you know the drill surrender aint an option lets show em how real men fight
sire we have a visitor lord filat of belhalla seeks an audience
lord filat i presume thank you for coming
lord sigurd the agustrian conflict has escalated into full scale war i see how does this battle look at the moment
were faring well so far somehow but this hasnt been easy by any means
incidentally lord sigurd i regret to say that i come bearing bad news 
whats happened
nasty rumors have emerged of late in the royal court  and they concern you the rumors claim that in concert with quan of leonster and eldigan of nordion you are conspiring against the crown this it is said is why you are harboring the prince of isaach in your ranks
what thats absurd who in the world couldve started such nonsense 
chancellor reptor and duke langobalt
i see  i should have known knowing their disdain for my father yet to take that grudge so far 
those two are ruled by their envy of your fathers immense power as prince kurths advisor id say they likely believe a chalphy controlled prince will strip them of their influence once he takes the throne fear and jealousy dominate their lives  dont let your guard down against them
thank you sir i appreciate the warning by the way sir  pray tell how goes the isaachian campaign is there an end in sight
it seems there is indeed from what weve heard we expect the triumphant return of the prince and your father any day now
thank the gods prince kurth is safe losing him to this war would have dealt such a blow to grannvales future  i know my father worries so about how the belhalla lineage would end with his majestys death unmarried as he is
indeed before the war started we were trying to hasten him to search for a wife
if i may is there a problem
indeed  the story behind this has been well known in the royal court for a long time now regrettable his highness struggles to move on from a long lost love
really why did he never marry this person
well  perhaps i ought to tell you the complete tale this happened some twenty years ago prince kurth had an affair with the duchess of velthomer a truly lovely woman as i recall duke victor of velthomer was  well he was a philanderer of the worst degree and had countless lovers the prince of course is nothing like him he wished only to support the duchess at first but the two soon fell deeply in love victor was distraught needless to say he penned a letter denouncing the pair then he took his own life the duchess could bear to stay no longer she fled grannvale and was never seen again as i recall her name was sigyn
 wow thats horrible  so she was the mother of lord arvis 
indeed i can scarcely imagine what this was like for him  losing both parents at only the age of seven 
mm and yet i feel so sorry for the prince not to mention for sigyn as well 
oh my apologies im sure a soldier of your caliber has better things to worry about than court gossip please dont worry about the story you have a war with agustria to win after all farewell lord sigurd we look forward to the day that you too return to the fatherland in triumph
you cant be serious theyve come as far as anphony are they just going to keep going until all agustria is theirs theyll have to come this way weve no choice but to fight deploy the ballistae were all that stands between the capital and grannvales dogs of war
king chagall with all due respect may we begin already i need to find prince lewyn as quickly as possible you said you know his location thats the only reason im here
apologies for the delay knight but i just received word of a lead for you i trust youve noticed were currently contending with a grannvale invasion they have taken prince lewyn captive my scouts report that their army is arresting and executing anyone and anything which stands in their way your prince is being held in evans castle reports say that he is soon to face the axe
no  i cant allow this thank you for your assistance well leave to rescue him at once our queen rahna cautioned us against clashing with other nations on our mission but we may have no choice should grannvales troops cross our way theyll be confronted without hesitation
oho  this is even better than id hoped best of luck on your hunt
ill be on my way then
shes gone  pah stupid little girl ready the agusty knights to deploy end those pigs in a single strike
good mackily is ours that leaves the capital agusty 
indeed sire but dont get too careless weve been informed that agusty still hosts a sizable defensive force we ought to take the most utmost care
mm youre right who knows what chagall has up his sleeve 
w what mackily has fallen too ugh  zane your units our last line of defense take the field immediately
y yes sir but 
cease your whining get out there
chagall  so quick to panic at the first sign of trouble are we
y you manfroy if it werent for your schemes i wouldnt be in this mess how in the blazes will you fix this
heh heh  you exaggerate my role all i did was advise the removal of the king obstacle to your ambition as he was all else was your choice can you doubt this
i  damn it all how is sigurds little army even this strong this isnt fair manfroy im begging you  help me what am i supposed to do now
as i said this isnt over as a last resort i do believe you have a fellow of use imprisoned here  yes i speak of eldigan eldigan and sigurd have been associates for years sigurd will unquestionably listen to eldigans counsel of course eldigan cant do that while locked up can he go apologize to him
er  y yes of course surely eldigan is the answer now if youll excuse me 
ugh  what a simpleton
your excellency i bear news from the east just now i bore witness to the assassination of prince kurth
is that so excellent this grows more interesting if i do say so myself with kurths death there remains but a single scion to nagas holy lineage and that old fool hardly needs our help to die and then all that will remain is the restoration of the dark one and then the world will belong to us 
what of duke arvis your excellency is he in agreement with your plan
why of course as a bearer of the dark ones blood what choice does he have not even one of arvis stature can afford the wider world learning of his dark heritage lest he be burned at the stake could a man as prideful as arvis bear to meet such an end
so he will betray his king and style himself emperor and 
indeed  but that will not be enough arvis alone cannot restore the dark god we still need one more person  that womans daughter
men move out we may die here today but we shall die in the fatherlands name
milady we three shall return to nordion before we leave however we have something for you this ring will help you fight more like a mounted knight put it on and it will allow you to keep moving after fighting or healing i know it will prove highly useful to you take care milady
deirdre oh thank the gods youre alright
mm the enemy captured and imprisoned me but i knew  i knew you would come for me no matter what
sire king chagall survived the battle but he was badly wounded hes currently being attended to by a royal priest
from what i heard somebody pulled him from the battlefield when he was defeated who in the world wouldve done that 
that was me sigurd i rescued king chagall i preserved the life of the last survivor of the agusty dynasty no matter how unwise his decisions no matter how ill his temper i cannot sit in silence and allow my liege to die
hm eldigan youre safe thank the gods ive been looking everywhere for you since i heard youd been arrested
i suppose i was  but what is the meaning of this sigurd why is your army swarming the capital the first thing i found upon release why are reports saying our castles are now under the rule of grannvale officers as if we are a mere tributary state im indisposed for barely any time at all only to find grannvale has made itself at home in agustria behind my back there had better be a damned good explanation for all of this sigurd or there will be consequences
im so sorry eldigan youre absolutely right none of this makes sense to me either as if out of nowhere the entirety of agustria suddenly turned against us we had no choice ive been ordered to remain here with my army for the time being to maintain peace and order eldigan please i know this is a dreadful situation but one year is all i need i can restore the countrys peace to normal and repair our diplomatic ties but only if im allowed time to do it once our time is through well leave your country with no objections my king and i pledge our word
hm  i suppose ive little choice but to take you at your word very well you have your year i shall relocate the king to the northern madino castle for his own protection ill also leave my cross knights stationed at fort silvail offer even the slightest provocation and your forces will have us to answer to remember im holding you to your word break your promise and we will break you do i make myself clear sigurd
of course you know im not about to betray you please eldigan you have to trust me
anphonys lord macbeth is the foulest most gold obsessed man there is he does nothin but torment us for his own profit i wish i could kill em with my bare hands
hey thanks for saving us i want you to have this one of my favorite things its a pretty little bracelet huh wear it at the shops and the nice man therell be happy to give ya a discount
wars the most dreadful thing and tis always the innocent and helpless who suffer most for it please  go home to your families
we cant thank you enough for helpin us this here swords the best we can do its an unusual sword innit they call it an armorslayer in the right hands itll cleave through the thickest armor if your hands arent the right hands though maybe it can make ya a quick buck at the pawn shop
lord eldigan is a sincere and righteous man but alas his sinceritys never been welcome to the ears of king chagall thats gotta be why he was locked up please for the good of all agustria  help lord eldigan
the great lord eldigan of nordion is a descendant of hezul the brave one of the legendary twelve crusaders he wields hezuls old weapon mystletainn the demon blade they say its as strong as isaachs balmung and chalphys tyrfing  the three mightiest blades in all of creation
the late king imca was truly a great man his sudden passing has been nothin but devastating for us all hes barely been buried for long and his son chagalls already runnin the country into the ground if lord eldigan had a claim to the throne somehow then we wouldnt be in this mess 
psst wanna hear something saucy yknow how lord eldigan has a lil sister right well lookin at ‘em wouldnt ya say theres more to it than that if you know what i mean  ohoho i love me a lil bit of gossip hmm ive better things to do than run me mouth ysay fine then
theres still gotta be descendants of the dark lord loptyr livin somewhere right folk in the big cities like agusty an mackily certainly seem to think so every year they do these huge hunts for loptyrs spawn they arrest a ton of people then burn em all at the stake even if theyre innocent  madness i tell ya
beware of bishop clement the lord of mackily castle that dastard wields a magical staff that they call a sleep staff if youre not careful youll find yourself snoozin and wide open to bein attacked
sir sigurd thank goodness youre here things were looking so bleak for a moment 
im glad to see youre safe lachesis what about eldigan is he still being held
yes hes still in agusty  its as if all the lords of agustria have turned on us please sir sigurd  lend us your might no matter what it takes my brother must be saved
of course ive no fondness for bringing war to foreign lands but in this case weve little choice his majesty king azmur is aware of king imcas assassination and of chagalls hand in it hes received word of chagalls ambitions to invade grannvale itself and has already approved military action his majesty also believes eldigans rescue to be vital if were to put an end to hostilities rest assured lachesis i swear that ill save eldigan 
wait  erinys the hell are you doing here
huh arent you   it cant be prince lewyn  what exactly are you wearing milord
what this im a bard now you know walking the land spreading songs and cheer what do you say perfect or perfect
er  perfect but why milord  arent you supposed to be held captive at evans i got here as fast as i could but 
im imprisoned at evans am i whered you hear that one
king chagall of agustria said so
chagall hah hate to break it to you erinys but youve been tricked its nice and all that youre so ready to trust but you wouldnt last ten seconds out there in the city itd eat you and your innocence alive you might even end up like silvia 
silvia milord 
oh silvias  er its not important point is what are you doing all the way out here
isnt it obvious im here to find and bring you home milord its been two years since you fled silesse her majesty is gravely worried about you please milord come home with me
do you have any idea what thatd do to silesse erinys if i go back ill have no choice but to take the throne its my late fathers will but my uncles would never accept it just one false step and wed have a civil war just like here and its always the common folk who suffer for it if there are people who want to be kings or whatever great out here though im free and i like it that way i dont want a thing to do with that throne for the good of silesse just give it to one of my uncles
i cant allow that milord you know as well as i that the kings of silesse must bear descent from forseti the wind god you milord are the sole living scion of his lineage neither of your uncles bear it you milord are silesses future yourself and your uncles aside all silesse wishes to see you claim the throne and  and your mother the queen was in tears when she sent me  please milord  come back
erinys  ugh dont you start crying too give me a break  i cant stand to see a woman in tears  okay fine ill think about going home just  give me some time to muster the nerve alright
thank you in that case im staying with you until youre ready milord ill send a messenger back to silesse to report that youre safe
wow youre persistent ill grant you that all right i think ill stay with sigurds army for now hes a pretty neat guy to work with not to mention his armys full of beauties hey erinys you could stand to get to know some of the ladies here maybe their stylishness could rub off on you a bit
yes milord 
hey im just kidding erinys relax a bit dont take everything so seriously  heh nobody in the worlds as sweet as you dont you ever change a thing
y yes sir  i mean no milord 
how are you faring so far deirdre i know my brother is worried something fierce about you risking your life like this
ethlyn  thank you for asking but im doing just fine for now everything will be alright i can feel it so long as im at sigurds side our happiness will see us through
i dont think ive ever seen sigurd as happy as hes been since he met you hes practically a changed man
ethlyn  here id like you to have this ive been meaning to give it to you for a while
oh  is  is this a light brand wow  these are so rare and hard to come by are you sure you want to give me this
of course i know that it will serve you well
i cant thank you enough deirdre ill always treasure it
hey lachesis there yare check out this little beauty of a sword thought id give it to ya
oh i cant say ive seen a blade so peculiar before does it have a name
its called a thiefs sword wanna gut the bad guys this things yer best friend
er  thank you although why are you giving this to me im hardly complaining but surely you need a decent sword
nah im not bothered there aint any point in me keeping it lets just say it does a lot more than just stab  heh see ya around
finn these agustrians are proving to be far worthier opponents than the thugs of verdane wouldnt you say for stronger enemies what could be more fitting than a stronger weapon lets see how you fare with this
is that  a brave lance are you sure you want to entrust me with such a rarity
of course you are house leonsters most promising young knight you are our future and id sooner see you live this day arming you properly is the best i can do to help for now so yes take this spear
what an honor milord thank you
lewyn i presume the one whos been helping defend the villages i appreciate the aid as i understand it youre a bard but you also wield magic thats unusual
something like that i guess its a hobby youre that sigurd fellow arent you its obvious what your little hobby is war clearly youve got so much spare time you spend it starting war after war
come again you seem angry but 
dont play dumb think about the people of all the countries that youre flattening you come barging in swords flashing and all you do is ruin the lives of normal folk whore trying to make a living here
youre right my apologies lewyn  i didnt even think about that but i cant stand knowing ive done this to them
words are just words without actions backing them up if you really feel so bad then why not pull your army out
mm youre right  very well ill consult with my troops and arrange a retreat
wait youre serious about this
of course ive been mulling over retreating for a while already and you just gave me the answer to all of this ive had enough of the war approach i think id rather seek a diplomatic answer
yeah no trying to get through to chagall now would be a total waste of everyones time besides if you lot pull out now then nothing stands between a peeved king and all the citizens whove helped you so far are you sure youre okay with leaving them all hanging like that
well no but  er  i

at long last thracia has been unified a region once swamped with countless small nations constantly warring among themselves with the restoration of house leonster and the downfall of the thracian kingdom the thracian peninsula finally knows peace
and as the first ruler of this new thracia the people ardently desired for the throne to be taken by leifaltena
at leifs behest the old thracias former lands were entrusted to his sister altena legends tell of altenas love for and dedication to the very soil that raised her and this love never died so long as she lived
the kingdom of new thracia
the kingdom of isaach may have found its freedom from imperial abuse the quickest yet its people could not rest easy while its heir was absent fighting in the war this changed with the final victory of the liberation army and when shannanscáthachlarcei returned from battle the people greeted their liege with raucous cheers
and others by his side to restore the land they also strove for a new age of diplomacy and trade seeking to build a wealthy nation isaach was once reviled by others as little more than a barbarous eastern land but under the reign of shannanscáthachlarcei isaach will grow like never before and shall one day be reborn as a mighty nation every bit the equal of other realms
the aftermath of agustrias civil war left it to be annexed by grannvale and so the land fell to harsh tyranny after years of abuse its people dearly wished for the rise of a unified nation one led by house nordion heirs of the legendary hero eldigan and so the people eagerly welcomed the homecoming of aresdermottnanna in aresdermottnanna the people saw the very same aura eldigan himself had borne in his youth
under the reign of aresdermottnanna agustria will soon become grannvales most crucial partner and will grow to be greater than ever before
even at its peak the empire had shunned and ignored verdane uninterested in seizing the region within its iron fist it completely abandoned the old kingdom instead verdane was left to the mercy of constantly warring clans and brigands ran rampant nobody had any hope of peace into the fray came jamkes sonjamkes daughter the child and heir of the heroic prince jamke and his wife jamkes sons lover whose long awaited return rallied the peoples spirits youths flocked to join this new battle within a year the fight for verdanes reunification had come to an end and jamkes sonjamkes daughter took their rightful throne with the support of grannvale and agustria jamkes sonjamkes daughter worked ceaselessly to rebuild the peaceful verdane their grandfather batur had once forged verdane is a land of natural beauty its verdant forests are sigurds prayers  its sparkling crystal clear water is deirdres tears  and these are its peoples emblems of hope and faith 
silesse had long dwelt under the empires cruel hand and so lewyns sondaughtercedhawkefeefemina devoted their life to rebuilding the ruined land a breathtaking land  a peaceful people  lewyn had devoted his life to protecting the kingdom of silesse and at long last his decades of work had come to fruition
in the royal capital of belhalla itself with overwhelming support from the public seliph was officially hailed as their king the newly anointed king seliph devoted himself to rebuilding his land and bringing peace to all his goal nothing short of a prosperous world free of oppression and bigotry and by his side one would always find his loving ever smiling wife queen seliphs lover  his sister princess julia regarding his toil with the warmest of eyes

/***EOF***/
king chagall has fled agustys fall and moved his royal court to madino castle in the north honoring his promise to eldigan sigurd allows chagall his freedom and does not interfere
to remain in agusty and to govern its citizens
scarcely six months have passed and yet grannvales ruling administrators have already grown arrogant and have taken to abusing their power over agustria for their own gain day by day the agustrian people grow ever wearier of grannvales actions before long as he feared sigurd finds himself yet again caught in a new conflict
reports abound of chagall raising his army anew at madino castle vying to reclaim his lost capital from sigurd
further north beyond madino the reviled pirates of orgahil prepare themselves to sweep in and profit from the lands chaos belhallas orders demand that sigurd must maintain control of agusty above all else sigurds heart lies heavy in the face of the impending crisis southwest of madino eldigans forces hold the defenses of fort silvail
a showdown fated to shape the course of jugdrals history
is the army ready to move in those fools couldnt possibly see this coming right as arranged move out this is our final chance to return agusty to our control just look at them  lingering in my kingdom oh so carefree  i grow weary of them they will pay dearly for this jacoban wheres that lousy sellsword gotten to this time
need me do you
ive seen just how good a fighter you are youre in charge of the castle defenses
yeah i know  might be a boring job but youre payin awfully well for it lets see em learn to fear my bolt sword
thats what i like to hear dont fail me
now eldigans still at silvail is he hm  how will he take this i wonder 
milord we have a problem the madino army appears to be preparing for battle
what what is his majesty thinking doing something so rash blast  to think we were so close to returning agusty to him gah  i couldnt possibly fight sigurd what in the world can i do now 
oi capn looks like the mainland down souths gettin ready for nother war this is gettin interestin  this is our chance i reckon with nuthin stoppin us from fleecin the villages both them armiesll be at each others throats so therell be nobody interested in gettin between us an th villages
shut it duvall i wont allow any petty thefts under my watch i refuse to let us sink so low dont forget were heroic thieves thats what the name of orgahil now means to the world
bah what self respectin pirate just lets the loot sit there an does nothing the capns gone soft
now now calm down duvall me mate ive got me a lil idea that wench struts aroun like the boss but she aint really the ol capns sprog the capn jus found er lost when she as a tiny thing an raised er as is own she still took over when e died but little she knows she aint really his brat she aint the real boss so theres nuffin tworry bout now lets go elp ourselves to sum treasure
dire news sire king chagalls army has struck and they have the castle surrounded
what that fool  we were so close to finally withdrawing from agustria theres no sense in attacking us now where in blazes is eldigan 
that isnt all sire it appears that pirates from orgahil are attacking amidst the confusion
is that so  i suppose weve no choice then ready everyone for battle
my love  youre about to fight again arent you
im afraid so im sorry deirdre but you mustnt come with me this time seliph is but a newborn and he needs you
yes dear 
you neednt look so anxious deirdre ill be back before long i promise shannan ive a favor to ask of you would you look after deirdre and seliph please
of course dont worry about a thing
ha as spirited as ever shannan at the very least deirdre he ought to keep you in good cheer dont worry about a thing deirdre ill be back for you i promise
milord 
were not involved in this battle on lord eldigans orders move along
king chagall is nowhere to be found sire
i see  he must have fled to castle silvail eldigan is still posted there after all his cross knights are the last remains of agustrias army at this rate all should be well if we can subdue them but 
sire we have a visitor father claud of edda has just arrived
father claud see him in please
its been a long time lord sigurd we need to talk i regret to say that i bring dreadful news from the fatherland
what is it your grace what in the world could have happened
prince kurth is dead somebody murdered him en route from isaach
what this cant be  who could have done this
lord byron was once constantly by his highnesss side  yet ever since his murder he has been nowhere to be found i regret to say this but  as it stands lord byron   your father   is the prime suspect
wh what thats impossible
i regret to say that theres been naught but horrid rumors in grannvale lately among them are those which allege that you and your father worked in concert to assassinate the prince  alas his majestys anguish at the affair has rendered him dreadfully ill
my father was already the princes closest confidant what could he have possible gained from the princes demise surely shouldnt reptor langobalt and the others who opposed the prince be the likely culprits
i am of the same mind but weve no evidence tying either to the crime and reptor and his minions currently hold a great sway over the royal court
what about lord arvis his majestys aide do you know where he stands on this
i cannot say for sure he seems to hold no enmity toward you but i am loath to consider him an ally 
hm  im worried for my father if i could id head home now and do what i can to help but my orders havent changed i still need to hold agustria please your grace  do you have any idea what i should do
i am on my way to the tower of bragi on the island to the north west of here as an heir to the great saint bragi if i pray at our sacred tower then the truth shall be revealed to me alone with this knowledge i can convince his majesty of byrons innocence you neednt worry lord sigurd
claaaaaude cmon lets go stop chewing off the poor mans ear im getting bored here
hm arent you tailtiu of house friege what are you doing with father claud
wouldnt you worry if i left him to wander all on his lonesome somebodys got to protect him
but youre duke reptors daughter so 
i just cant wrap my head around fathers schemes yknow besides i love the priest
gods give me strength to cope with this child  anyway ill rendezvous with your group once ive learned the truth i pray well both return home this day
as do i father claud as do i i cant thank you enough
shannan did you hear the news sigurd has captured madino castle i  i need to see him again
deirdre no i cant let you do that its still too dangerous to go out there now and seliph still needs you
i know i want you to look after seliph while im gone
no way im just a kid i cant look after a baby all by myself
i wont be long i promise please shannan  i implore you 
okay fine ill look after him just be careful out there and get back here as soon as you can okay
thank you shannan im sorry seliph ill be back for you right away
sigyns daughter  ive found you at last 
oh who are you wait  how do you know my mother
kehehehe  the day of your rebirth is upon us through my black magic the slate of your life will be cleansed paving the way for your true husband  your fate was written the day you were born there is no use in fighting destiny
wh what are you doing stop it no  aaaah  sig  u  r 
and just what do you think you are doing eldigan if you hadnt dawdled away your day here then perhaps we wouldnt have lost madino ah but thats part of your plan isnt it youre part of their plot to destroy agustria traitor
your majesty  how could you say that
whats this do you dare to be displeased to think youve forgotten my fathers favor all to idly stall for time  youre a disgrace to the knighthood
theres nothing more i can do to convince you  very well your majesty my men and i will move out post haste i am proud to be a paladin of agustria if i must die it shall be with sword in hand by your leave your majesty
this is it men its time for us to enter the fray  perhaps for the last time i count myself the luckiest commander there is for your years of loyalty to me the fatherlands fate hinges on this final battle do not let agustria down cross knights move out
eldigans finally moved out has he pompous twit  the rest of you fortify the defenses im in command now
eldigan please lay down your sword i dont want to fight you i still have every intention of returning agusty to chagall all i need is a little more time i swear
 sigurd im sorry but i grow weary of these excuses we stand now as two knights on the battlefield sword to an honorable duel draw sigurd so long as i wield the demon blade mystletainn i wont be the one to fall this day
w  why  why did this happen why couldnt we save eldigan has this damned war been in vain all along 
im sorry sire but there was nothing you could have done i know it hurts but  for now the best we can do is work to realize eldigans wishes and give the agustria people the peace they deserve
travant i trust your wyvern rider unit is ready
you can rest assured chagall well deliver on your expectations
hmph i suppose even these common sellswords ought to do a better job for me than all of my worthless servants  dont you dare let me down
pick up the pace agustrias right ahead our targets are the knights of grannvale take your fill of battle sear the name of thracia into the memories of this land
ugh  papillon failed did he that does it its time to withdraw i refuse to fall with this flaming wreck of a country heh farewell king chagall  you fool
eldigan 
sire  i know this is hard but please you mustnt lose heart just yet by the way shannan has just arrived from agusty hed like a word with you sire
shannan

damn it duvall the only reason theyre coming is because you lot all went pillaging against my orders youve got nobody but yourself to blame
keh enough i cant take yer arrogance anymore shut it an open yer ears ya actually aint the daughter o the late capn yknow yer just some lil girl what the boss found cryin alone in this ship we raided thboss jus picked ya up an raised ya imself fore we knew it yad all grown up an were bossin us all round all nonsense like

aye boss
righ raise the bridge agustrias all ours
claaaaaude cmon cmon cmon arent you done praying already just look around therell be pirates all over us if we dont get moving
be at peace tailtiu this was quite the fruitful journey lord bragi has answered my prayers and revealed to me the truth it is precisely as i had thought not to mention i even found house eddas long lost sacred heirloom within the tower the staff of valkyria see this is it
what that grubby little cane
 tailtiu please do try to mind your manners this is a legendary magical staff with the power to restore life to the deceased it is usable only be the direct descendants of saint bragi that is to say me alone
huh so what youre saying is with this rod you could bring my sweet old grandma back to life
alas most likely not valkyria is limited in many particular ways and so cannot be used on just any lost soul you see all of mankind is born bearing a life force called quintessence which 
yaaawn  er whats that you lost me whyre you still talking about this anyway weve still gotta get outta here
ah of course let us go
good weve subdued the pirate castle oifey would you please gather our troops here now that this is all over id like to ensure that everyones alright
at once sire
is the army ready good all units move in apprehend the traitor sigurd and his cohorts seize these vile allies of byron accomplices to his murder of kurth and his bid to take over the kingdom it is the will of his majesty no mercy for enemies of the state
kehehe  oh langobalt such audacity to think he personally put an end to that miserable prince and nearly killed byron for putting up a fight  ive never seen such a bold ploy and with arvis using his majestys trust it all worked flawlessly convincing the king of anything is hardly a challenge but to succeed with a tale of this scale takes quite the storyteller  and here we are the entirety of house chalphy framed for the crime heh heh  our victory is all but assured the throne of grannvale shall be mine one way or another ill leave no pest who dares interfere with me alive 
what in blazes is this im a traitor now and a grannvale legion now waits at our doorstep to arrest me
sire and to think the war here was over at long last and you were about to go and search for deirdre
gah  how could his majesty have fallen for reptors lies how could he possibly believe that my father of all people would kill prince kurth aah  if only father claud had gotten back to the capital before they struck  why why is this happening i fought a pointless war i let eldigan die and now this what have i been fighting for all along
sire 
lord sigurd i presume i am annand a knight in the service of silesse queen rahna bade my corps and i to come and retrieve you we invite you and your subordinates to retreat with us to silesse until your good name has been cleared in grannvale
 queen rahna of silesse you say why is silesse willing to give aid to an alleged traitor like me
please sir time is of the essence the grannvale assault is sure to begin at any moment now my pegasus knights will escort you across the sea to safety in silesse
oh here to help are ya huzzah the village is saved we cant thank ya enough but mayhap this magic staffll help ya out they call it a restore staff if yer alliesve been put tsleep or silenced one cast of this staffll get em back on their feet this oughta be a big help for ya
ah  the cross knights lord eldigans elite knightly battalion their might is legendary and none in jugdral can even compare to them actually  my boyfriend is a cross knight hee hee  amazing isnt it dont be shy drink up well how bout that feel the might swellin in yer muscles oughta make yer work out there so much easier
sniff  i cant believe it my boyfriend died in this blasted war damn the grannvale army  no no  damn king chagall this is all his fault
oho glad to see yave come i got this ere sword for ya in preciation they call it the wingslayer its enchanted to be lethal to sky riders if it flies this swordll bring it down course if ya cant use it sell it
no matter how much i think about it i just dont get why the orgahil pirates have so suddenly turned on us like this we couldve sworn that boss of theirs was a good lass  brigid or something was it
oh its so nice to see visitors how bout a little somethin for yer troubles here take a draught of our secret medicine
hey be careful out there rumor has it that king chagalls got the infamous thracian wyvern riders on his payroll dont think theres been a war lately where someone or other didnt hire em theyre like a pack of hyenas descendin on fresh prey brutal and indiscriminate nothin survives in their wake 
were so glad to see you here have a quick sip of our local special brew for generations its made us all hardier
ugh i cant stand people like you whove nothin better to do than start more wars why are you even here weve absolutely nothin to do with agustria or grannvale look if youve really gotta fight take it somewhere else you thoughtless sod
ayra hey there
sigh  what do you want lex
sheesh courteous as ever arent you
look get to your point whatever it may be ive better things to do than waste time on you
hold on ive got a little gift here i thought of you the moment i saw it
you can foist it on some other woman ive no use for such trinkets
heh  not even something like this
oh  wait thats 
ah good youre well acquainted with the famous brave sword then
i never thought id see a real brave sword never have i seen a blade so beautiful 
glad you like it its yours i guess ill see you around ayra
er lex wait a moment
oh 
hey ayra this is for you here
isnt this a brave sword why me though shouldnt you be wielding this yourself
this things only gonna get harder from here yeah you burn through blades so fast you could do with a spare or two look after yourself out here okay one day i might not be here to watch your back
holyn  thank you i promise ill put it to good use
brother stop its me lachesis this pointlessness has gone on long enough your actions are utterly baffling would you really betray sigurd your friend is this what you call a knights pride please brother believe in sigurd give him even the tiniest amount more time to finish his job we dont need to fight
lachesis  look dont cry fighting is my only choice please dont make this harder than it already is his majestys death will spell the death of agustria too and i cannot allow that
that isnt true everything hinges on chagall laying down his arms sigurd never had any interest in fighting and has even less interest in continuing if you stop brother  please you lead the cross knights chagall simply cannot ignore your counsel
 youre right lachesis ill try and persuade his majesty one more time if i must risk my life id rather risk it to stop this blasted war than to fight my friend any knight would do the same lachesis  here this sword is for you
isnt this an earth sword  brother you cant be 
this is a last memento in case i  im sorry lachesis you must survive
w wait stop dont go eldie
your majesty please order a retreat theres no use in continuing this fight agusty shall be returned to your majesty someday but it must happen peacefully
eldigan how dare you abandon the battle to spout such nonsense you couldnt hide your true colors forever traitor men seize this  this worm off with his head humiliate him parade his shame before the world
i  this was all in vain  this spells agustrias doom 
tch enough accept your death quietly traitor finish him do it right here right now

oh thank the gods you remember that bow is your birthright brigid it is yewfelle the sacred bow of jungby legends tell that the exalted weapons of this land such as this one can only be wielded by a single heir per generation for house jungby and yewfelle that rightful heir is you brigid i trust this proof will suffice
oh aideen  come here  let me get a good look at you  hows our father doing and our brother  andorey right
ive so much to tell you too  brigid  my sister
lord sigurd i apologize for the wait
father claud youre safe we heard about how you ended up amidst all those pirates everyone was so worried
im glad tailtiu was close at hand we may not have survived if not for her magic more importantly lord sigurd my prayers to saint bragi were answered
you have the truth of all this then
that i do as i thought duke reptor is behind all of this on his orders it was duke langobalt who killed prince kurth the two then successfully framed your father lord byron for the crime
just as i thought 
the pairs treachery runs deeper still the murder of isaachs king mananan was also the handiwork of duke reptor he feared a peaceful end to the war would end the sole excuse for the conquest of isaach so he secretly had the king killed
is that so  reptors grubby hands are all over this mess 
not quite in the shade of his avarice theres something else at work  something unsettling and terrifying not even lord bragi could scry this evil presence obscured by its power as it is
an evil presence could it be that dark priesthood  wait what of my father claud
lord byron yet lives but is injured and weak i fear he is not long for this world 
father  this cant be happening 
ill hasten back to the capital his majesty needs to hear the truth lord sigurd for the time being stay here and restrain yourself from rash action
understood i cant thank you enough father claud i beg of you do everything you can save my father and his good name
our fates lie with the mercy of the gods 
oh whoa this is that tower of bragi place isnt it hee hee got a good thiefy feeling about this one lets see what its got

/***EOF***/
word of the first victory of prince seliph and his liberation army quickly spreads far and wide inspiring courage anew in the empires victims still more uprisings erupt across jugdral but once again precious few are properly organized and are easily crushed and the death toll climbs ever higher 
leonster a kingdom in the thracian peninsula  prince leif the son of quan had raised an army with the aid of the knight finn but they have suffered a devastating loss before king blumes vast hordes and are stranded in hostile ground
before seliph lies the yied desert ruled by the loptyrian ctuzof from the yied shrine the oasis city of darna governed by the ex merchant bramsel and the captain of his sellsword army jabarro and fort melgen guarded by prince ishtore and the renowned general liza king blume himself the son of the late duke reptor awaits at the capital city of alster with his niece the mage tine
in rivough seliph and the warriors of his liberation army now prepare themselves to embark on a journey and come to the aid of their allies in far away leonster each warrior sets aside their worries as under seliphs leadership they prepare for the new battle on their horizon
finn whats the situation any word from the other division yet
 weve failed milord every last soldier in the alster raid is dead this is a crippling blow to our army weve lost most of our might in one fell swoop
this cant be happening  i thought this was our big chance  was all of this useless all along damn it all ill strangle blume himself with my bare hands
please calm yourself milord this isnt the end quite yet ive just had a word with king lewyn hes sending prince seliphs liberation army to back us up until then no matter what milord we must endure the siege
prince seliph you say  hes the son of my fathers old friend sigurd and of empress deirdre right i pray we can meet him soon  perhaps if we merge our efforts with his well have a better chance of protecting people from the empire
thats right leif besides if we just let ourselves lose now wouldnt your mens deaths all be in vain i think we should abandon the castle for now and seek refuge near that western church
mm youre right  i suppose we dont have much of a choice now very well our priority now is to play this out defensively for the time being until prince seliph gets here we must endure 
whats your problem now cant you capture even as worthless a castle as this are you worms taking this seriously
y yes milord  the thing is though the enemy is proving to be of a resilient sort were struggling to breach their defenses
buffoons all of you do you really think i want to hear excuses i want leonster seized no more delays if you waste any more time on this then well have to contend with those isaachian mongrels as well
y yes milord we will strike immediately milord
hooboy those rumors werent kidding that place was full to the brim with treasure been a long time since ive had a haul like this but i cant afford to dawdle now still gotta get out of here and quick 
hey excuse me hand that sword over you can keep everything else but i need the sword
where do you think you get off trying to take somebody elses hard earned goods do you have any idea how tough it was to get my hands on this sword if you want it come and get it nincompoop
w wait
what thieves have plundered our treasury and they absconded with balmung you fools go seize them now
y yes your grace  but er your grace  surely a master of dark magics of your caliber could crush common thieves such as these with a single blow even from here
ive misplaced my book of fenrir  my men are scouring the shrine to find it but so far it has yet to emerge 
understood your grace in that case my clan and i will take a few mercenaries and pursue them we swear to you your grace that we will have the treasure back where it belongs post haste
so the route to leonster requires that we cross this vast desert yes
yeah  the yied shrines the real problem here as its controlled by the loptyrian order the orders fell mages infest the desert mercilessly assaulting anyone they find in it peopleve taken to calling the region the desert of death  a fitting name really
i can only imagine how awfully travellers struggle here i wonder  perhaps itd be possible to seize the shrine from the order
heh i thought youd never ask theres always a way but this one wont be easy we may need to make sacrifices
so be it at this point weve little choice not to mention shannan is likely still in the desert  for now lets focus on taking control of yied  all else will begin there
milord weve received word that the isaachian rebels are on the move
isaachian rebels ah the ones led by that brat  celice was it or serlis something like that heh  interesting very interesting indeed the empires put a hefty price on that boys head lets make sure were the ones to rake in that bounty shall we keep our border locked down for the time being the best option is to let them run themselves ragged leaving them wide open to our strike instruct commander jabarro to put his squad on standby his services will be needed in short order
hey whats with all this noise youre not about to go to war are you
no weve not entered such a dire state yet for the time being we are merely preparing for the arrival of the isaachian rebel army
oh thats good i guess im a bit worried about how youre gonna have to go and fight too ares 
what sorry excuse for a mercenary would i be if i refused to join a battle lene never mind one which rumor has it will oppose sigurds son  never would i deny a chance to personally slay the spawn of my fathers mortal foe 
hee hee youre still going on about that are you oh you dolt i mean think about it both your father and that sigurd man were knights werent they and isnt killing part of a knights job its like my job sometimes ive got to dance for foul leering men i hate it but its part of the work i have to just deal with it weve all gotta do what we gotta do to get by in life i dunno  i just dont think its right to hate someone for doing their job
lene  i understand ill have to think it over for a time but i do understand 
good news your grace weve found your book of fenrir
hmm excellent heh heh  this will be the end of the road for the rebels with their dying thoughts they shall marvel in fear at the terrifying power of fenrir 
so this is the yied shrine  it looks so sparse 
the remnants of the loptyrian empire have hidden within the depths of the shrine for generations they had no choice trying to build new lives on the surface would have led to their mass persecution or even being burned at the stake i suspect that at first they werent really bad or unusual people but before long their life here twisted them into what we know them as today
i can hardly believe it  its as if they were all being tortured for the sins of their long dead imperial ancestors  all my life these people have been branded as the dark cult or the devils kin  i can barely imagine their pain  hold a moment this scribble on the wall  is that a childs penmanship its a prayer  and it begs for the return of the dark god   was loptous the only hope these people had
yeah  consider this a lesson seliph good and evil cant be easily reduced to such simple black and white ideals if you must hate hate the evil which lurks in us all not the individual never forget this
yieds fallen has it heh  perfect open our borders well let them proceed through toward fort melgen let them wear themselves out some more then strike their wide open backs kehehe  its almost too easy to be any fun wouldnt you say jabarro
heh just another hard days work for you sir  but hey so long as youre payin the bills my menve got nothin to complain bout bout time we had a good fight anyhow
hmm  the rebels have already taken yied liza what do you make of the situation
i suspect their most likely aim is to come to the aid of the leonster rebels as it stands ishtore your father is still preoccupied besieging them at leonster should they reach alster and strike while hes occupied the results would be disastrous  it is imperative that we intercept them here and now our force will be more than enough
indeed  my lord father could use the aid liza may i place you in command of my army
certainly leave everything to me milord
i confess id rather keep you away from the eye of the storm but theres nobody whom i could ever trust more than you my apologies liza
i  rest assured milord youve nothing to worry about just  please ishtore be careful  now excuse me  men move out assume your positions
ohohohoho lene was it that was quite the dance there come hither i have a little reward for you 
eww how rude you get off your butt and come over here if youve got something to give me
hohoho as cute as that fiery heart is mouthing off to me so violently i cant say i care so much for that bring her to me
w what dyou think youre doing let go let me go you animals
hold take your hands off the girl craven scum
what and who exactly are you how dare you a common sellsword turn your blade on your employer
nobody shall lay a hand on her lest you face severe consequence are we clear
gah  what is this sorry little pantomime seize him end his little life
you all see my sword correct i trust i need not introduce the demon blade beware for mystletainn craves the blood of men who dares to come forth and slake its thirst
m mystletainn thats the one and only demon blade th then you  it cant be 
oh but it can it is indeed i ares the black knight
m my deepest apologies sir i was merely jesting about look ill never lay hands on the little darling ever again you forgive me right right
 very well lene are you unharmed
yeah  thank you ares 
gah  damn them both ill make them suffer  youll see 
at last seliph youve reached melgen leonsters just a stones throw from here
say lewyn  will this war ever end i still doubt that prince ishtore or his general were truly wicked people  must we kill still more like them
that may be so but dont forget they still actively served the will of a brutal tyrant as far as our cause is concerned there is no doubt they were the enemy this is a war seliph theres more to it than only ever fighting the thoroughly evil or those whom we hate
i suppose so 
heh its okay seliph youre a good man through and through you could just stand to worry a bit less now then weve got our goal to focus on coming to the rescue over in leonster
indeed lets move in on leonster everything shall be there
what melgens fallen already blast we were too slow oh well we can still ambush them while they regroup men this is our chance jabarro send in your brigade hit them hard while their backs are turned leave no survivors
at once sir
dyou really have to go ares please dont leave  please
ive little choice in the matter it was jabarro who found me as a lost infant and raised me all these years i owe him dearly 
dont you get it hes just using your loyalty to treat you like a weapon i  i hate him so much
lene  no that isnt 
okay fine whatever go with him if you love him so much its your life to waste after all but you can just go forget we ever met
lene 
hmph  that ares buffoon has gone has he good riddance 
banba fetra eliu deploy at once i want you to show these rebel pigs just what it is that the empire can do
yes milord leave it to us
we will never let you down milord
the rebels shall be destroyed quickly cleanly efficiently and utterly excuse us milord
hmm everything depends on you tine you too will deploy at once
 y yes uncle as you wish 
hmph  one would think i could expect more gratitude from someone i raised out of the goodness of my heart after their mother died or have you forgotten my many kindnesses
no uncle 
good now get moving remember these rebels are responsible for murdering my dear son ishtore and his true love liza avenging them is your mission tine
the rest of you move out at once i dont want a single rebel left breathing
fetra eliu i trust you already understand we must work in absolute perfect unison we will be the ones to claim seliphs head as a trophy this day we mustnt be beaten by tines unit
i dont understand  all the villagers talk of the rebels as if theyre liberating heroes  but why  why did they kill ishtore i  i dont know what to do anymore  oh  mother  what would you do 
there you are girlie how dare you embarrass me like that the other day its about time i thanked you properly
oh and what exactlyre you gonna do about it i see right through you the moment ares is nowhere in sight you think its okay to act all tough again you vile louse dont even think about coming any closer i dont need ares around to stop you
of all the nerve  you little wench throw her in the dungeon youll have plenty of time to think about what youve done there
ahh no  ares 
yknow i dont get you ares why the helld you go and get yourself all cosied up with a broad like that oh well i guess its all in the past youre gonna forget er sooner or later
i beg your pardon what exactly are you trying to say jabarro
heh heh  oh nothing well cept that i bet bramsels right about to 
t this cant be  jabarro how could you know his foul intent yet let your tongue lie still before me
you cant worry bout the fairer sex ares have your fun with em but never stick around for when their sorry lives come crashin down 
how dare you and to think you held my trust for so long  i must return to darna lene needs me
nah that aint gonna happen see nobody and i mean nobody blows off my orders and turns tail on my watch not even you ares
keh  ive come far in your company jabarro but our association ends now if anyone wishes to stop me mystletainn will eagerly welcome your necks
grr  ill show you your place whelp
so this is darna  the legendary city 
long ago at the peak of the old holy war darna was the last bastion of the resistance army  it was the last free land in jugdral in battle after battle the overwhelming might of the loptyrian empire had devastated the resistance ultimately the last of the resistance soldiers barricaded themselves within darnas walls battered and wounded as they were they were nonetheless determined to fight to the bitter end but then suddenly there was a miracle  from the heavens descended twelve gods who bestowed upon twelve young heroes miraculous weapons and immense powers thus were born the twelve crusaders the heroes who led the resistance to victory
that was the legendary miracle of darna yes
yeah the very same and even as we speak seliph another miracle is dawning upon us just as the resurrection of loptous looms on the horizon so too are the crusaders themselves arising in our world once more 
 i beg your pardon
heh  dont worry seliph youll understand soon enough 
i pray that lene is still unharmed i must hasten back to darna 
right leonster is back under our control that leaves only alster  everyone weve only a little further to go we can do this
julia youre safe oh thank heavens 
mm  the enemy seized and imprisoned me here but i knew  i knew you would rescue me no matter what
excellent work seliph thanks to you alster is finally free from the empire
i wouldnt get too excited lewyn king blume yet lives i assume he fled to connaught amidst the flurry of alsters capture
eh these sorts of things cant be helped after all the wars only just beginning were only now starting to carve our foothold in the thracian peninsula
and yet the citizens are already all so eager to support us ive seldom seen such joy 
for the first time theyve got hope for a future free from the empires abuse youre the peoples last hope seliph but the worst of the war still lies ahead huh
mm and yet ive so much incredible talent fighting by my side with such amazing men and women with me i know no challenge will be too great
yeah  youll all do just fine seliph
darna is lorded over by count bramsel whos as revolting as they come if he isnt playing the slimy sycophant to some visiting grannvale noble or other hes prancin around like hes the gods gift to kings ugh  the sooner somebody sticks a sword through that pig of a man the better
it aint that simple though standing between you lot and bramsel is the best mercenary force his money can buy one of em ares is the strongest of em all hes still just a kid really but hes frightfully strong cause hes got this magic blade called mystletainn from what i heard the mercenary captain jabarro found ares as a wee little kid and took him in the twore real close i hear you aint got much of a chance against ares sorry to rain on your parade like that kid here take this shield ring as an apology you oughta be able to get some use out of this
blumes got some terrifying warriors on his side theres banba fetra and eliu a trio of powerful sorceress sisters then theres tine a young mage  blumes niece she may be but that girls still got a kind heart on her shes come to our aid and the aid of our neighbor villages time and again  shes nothing like her family 
king blume and his queen hilda have got two children between em ishtar and ishtore ishtars ruling over munster right now and ishtores posted at fort melgen both doing blumes dirty work unlike their folks theyre fine youths youll be sure to face em sooner or later  be on your guard stranger
near the end of the war all those years ago this entire region was conquered by king blume the son of duke reptor his rules been one tragedy after another  just when we thought he couldnt get any worse now hes just letting those child hunts happen we cant take this anymore 
the empires brutal rule has broken us so  we cant live like this much longer please i beg of you  save us all 
youre fighting in the war right i bet theres someone you care about who youre fighting for my boyfriend set off to fight in the war too im not exactly a fighter myself not much i can do but wait for people like you to finish it  oh i know here this charmed bladell boost your resistance go on this ones on the house be sure to make some nice deep cuts in some imperials for me wont you sweetie
thanks miss ill take good care of it hey whats your name anyway

oh larcei sorry i wasnt around to see all this begin from what ive heard youve all had quite the tough time so far
dont worry about it the important part is that youre safe i er 
hows your sword arm doing any stronger
yeah but still far below your prowess sir
how about a quick lesson to patch that up see raw power isnt quite enough here try putting a bit more spirit into it  and swing
nnn yah like this sir 
excuse me you wouldnt happen to be nanna would you
i am and you are
perfect ive finally found you im your brother dermott
huh what  are you talking about
i didnt know until just now either king lewyn told me everything in the war seventeen years ago i was with the kids who fled to isaach but you were born after our mother lachesis went to leonster instead
you  youre my brother then wheres mother now
er  wheres mother what exactly are you getting at here nanna
i havent seen her in so long  when i was around three years old she left us and travelled alone to isaach to try and find you she never came back ive waited to see her again for years 
she did but  but i never saw her
you  didnt then where is she 
the yied desert  its a very treacherous place very few lone travellers survive it 
 no oh mother 
excuse me you wouldnt happen to be jeanne would you
i am and you are
perfect ive finally found you im your brother tristan
huh what  you cant be serious
im being completely serious see our father was a knight of house nordion when we were both still little he was killed in the agustrian civil war and we were adopted by lord sgiurds army we later fled to isaach with sir oifey but we somehow lost you along the way 
huh  that actually fits i was adopted by a travelling merchant who once said he found me in isaach
yeah  sir oifeys always said he wondered if something like that happened
but then when i was just seven years old some imperial thug murdered him  thats when finn found and adopted me
wow  that sounds just awful im sorry you had to deal with that jeanne
no its okay i mean now i have you im so happy i finally have a brother  thank you tristan lets never be parted again 
say dermott you have a sister in leonster dont you
yes sir we were separated when we were very young from what ive heard she grew up with sir finn a knight of leonster
sir finn you say  youre eager to have the chance to see her again arent you
yes sir i can hardly wait
heh youll have to give this battle your all first then how about a quick swordplay lesson
yes sir id appreciate that
kyaaaaaaa stop get your hands off of me
ugh  look i dont want to hurt you could you just give me that sword back
wait  give it back is it yours
yes it is its my familys ancestral blade balmung im the only person capable of using it youve nothing at all to gain from keeping it
wait so howd this thing end up in yied anyway
it belonged to my father who died in grannvales war with isaach someone mustve stolen it from him after he died i only recently learned that it was being kept at yied so i came to retrieve it
hang on hang on hang on could it be  are you isaachs prince shannan
i am 
really its really really you wow oh my gosh this is incredible
er 
no really ive heard all the stories about you all of them ive been a huge fan of yours for so long but i never thought id actually meet you
 
but youre here youre really here talking to me right now its like all of my dreamsve come true
 yeah i think i get the idea my sword please
oh right sorry here ya go
balmung  my holy sword  its finally mine  hm ahh what is this power 
wooow this is incredible 
lord seliph what an honor it is to meet you at last im leif the son of king quan of leonster
the honor is all mine prince leif im glad to see youve made it thus far unharmed
my parents both died in the battle of belhallas prelude  they were felled by a thracian ambush my homeland leonster soon found itself in the clutches of an imperial occupation and fell under the reign of its duke blume if not for my knight finn i wouldnt be here today he raised me in hiding in nearby villages and we awaited the day leonster would rise again we thought that day had finally come but then 
 we both took to the battlefield around the same time did we not by now practically all of jugdral knows of king blumes brutality i sorely wish my army had made it here sooner and couldve properly aided you you have my deepest apologies prince leif
no lord seliph im the one who should be apologizing our failure was squarely my fault however this isnt over i am the son of quan a man worthy of being dubbed a knight of njörun i refuse to put to shame his legacy and so ill live on ill fight on no matter the cost to that end lord seliph my comrades and i would like to join your army i may not have much of an army left but what i do have is yours may we serve you well in restoring honor to grannvale
thank you prince leif often i have heard it said that our fathers were inseparable friends bound together to the bitter end in both life and death not to mention your mother queen ethlyn is also my aunt  both of your parents gave their lives to support my fathers cause  prince leif you have my deepest most heartfelt apologies for their sacrifice 
thank you but that isnt necessary i am proud of my parents sacrifice and ive the utmost respect for lord sigurd the only hatred i bear is for the true villains emperor arvis and king travant
as do i  prince leif in the name of our late fathers last wishes i seek to restore peace and light to all of jugdral please join me in my cause
yes sir you have my blade as your own
lord bramsel has decreed that none shall pass this point for the time being move along

whoops  okay you caught me im actually a thief well i used to be ive had enough of all that now now i want to pitch in with your army instead
er  you arent serious are you military life is dangerous theres no place for your ilk here
oh you sound so sure you barely have a coin to your name but if youre gonna win this war then nothings more important than money but with me around youre not gonna have to worry about money ever again
ive no use for money obtained by theft
 you really have no idea do you sir for every last coin carried by an imperial soldier theres a poor villager who they took it from you cant look at all this and say that its wrong for us to take that gold back the people of this landve already lost so much  i  i just want to give something back

seliph  at long last its you 
hm and who would you be
they call me the black knight ares  perhaps you would recognize me better however as the son of eldigan
huh it cannot be  you dont mean the legendary lord eldigan of nordion do you
the very same i am the son of eldigan the lionheart the man whom your father killed in coldest blood my noble mother the lady grainne died wracked with grief and rage at sigurd it is high time you knew my familys pain
thats  i dont understand ares as i understood it your father and mine were the closest of friends as tragic as their end was i dont believe our fathers could ever have begrudged each other
thats impossible  sigurd was my fathers mortal foe this  this is all ive know my entire life 
please listen ares would you consider joining my army i know we can resolve this misunderstanding if we just give it some time i hold the late lord eldigan in the utmost respect just as my own father did please ares please understand this
seliph  very well i suppose i can stay my hand for now however be warned should i learn that even a single word of your claims is false your life is forfeit in your fathers place do i make myself clear seliph
if that happens then do as you must ares  i wish you could know just how ecstatic our fathers would be to know weve met at last if only wed met under better circumstances 
excuse me but  that pendant of yours 
huh its  its a memento of my mother 
really then youre tine oh ive finally found you
er  who are you
here maybe thisll clear things up this pendant of mines exactly the same as yours and ive had it my whole life
y youre right but  what are you saying
see decades ago my mother was a warrior fighting in sigurds liberation army and after the war she fled to silesse with her children when i was little my mother and my newborn sister disappeared  i was left behind with nothing but this pendant i only recently learned what really happened it was king blume of alster he abducted them he took my family from me the rumors ive heard all said mother had died a while ago but they also said my sister is still alive  thats you tine ive finally found you after all these years i came all this way just to see you again 
i  i never even knew blume did that to mother  it makes sense though  i cant remember much of mother but i know i never saw her smile or laugh  youre my brother  oh  sniff 
i dont suppose youd like to lay down your arms and join our army tine weve still got so much to talk about
mm thank you brother i never did want to fight 
um  pardon me sir 
hm and who are you maam
i am tine  arthurs sister 
ah of course ive been told your story tine
um  im sorry
youve nothing to apologize for tine with the likes of king blume for an uncle i completely understand you had no choice
are  are you forgiving me sir
certainly theres no question that youre not our enemy and it would be an honor to have you with us

/***EOF***/
the unthinkable has come to pass sigurd is now a traitor in the eyes of his beloved grannvale in desperation his army flees to find refuge in the northern kingdom of silesse
silesse was founded by the wind crusader ced it lies under the watchful guard of the valiant pegasus knights and wind mages and so for over a century since its foundation silesse has maintained itself as a neutral nation and persistent all invaders
however ever since the death of its king several years ago the royal family has been plagued with strife over its inheritance and shades of war creep over the peaceful land the late king and his wife queen rahna had a single son prince lewyn the kings greedy younger brother duke daccar objects to lewyn being heir to the throne and has confined himself to zaxon castle in protest as if acting in concert the kings youngest brother duke maios has set to work raising an army for himself at thove castle
out of disgust at his uncles prince lewyn left silesse to travel the world years ago is there no end to the dukes avarice their lust for power will condemn silesse a beautiful and majestic land to the searing ravages of a brutal war
sire queen rahna is here to see you
queen rahna
good evening lord sigurd are you comfortable settling into sailane yet is there anything at all that you need
as much as i appreciate the offer were fine i cant thank you enough for your hospitality your highness
i know sailane is perhaps too small to house all of you adequately and im sorry but please bear with me for a while longer  im doing all i can to hasten your liberty ive sent letter after letter to belhalla to advocate for your innocence as of yet however ive still heard nothing at all from king azmur
this  this has to be reptors doing first he betrays my father and now hes stopping all of your letters he must be
calm yourself lord sigurd i know well the pain youre feeling but you cannot let your grudges rule you your anger will not save your father hatred will only destroy you from within i swear to you i can and i will find a way to set this to rights but you must be patient
youre right  im sorry your highness i really appreciate all youve done for me
its alright lord sigurd oh before i forget  there actually has been some good news from grannvale of late
good news you say
mm a previously unknown daughter of prince kurth has been discovered all of grannvale is rejoicing at the news
huh is that even possible
it took king azmur only a glance to recognize her true heritage she bears the brand of naga the proof of a true heir to house belhalla there is no doubt she is kurths child
i see  thank goodness at the very least this means the royal lineage wont go extinct
thats not all the princess and duke arvis are in a relationship king azmur has given his blessing and a magnificent wedding will soon be held
arvis really
all whove seen the happy couple eagerly attest that this beautiful princess and duke arvis are perfectly matched together to say nothing of how happy the couple is said to be young love is wonderful isnt it  oh lord sigurd im so sorry i forgot your wife is still 
deirdre  my wifes still gone yes  its been over a year since she vanished shes missed an entire year of watching seliph grow up
im so sorry lord sigurd but cheer up i know youll reunite someday
youre right i feel it too i cant give in to sorry just yet i cant give up on finding her
pardon me milady but the hour is late we should be on our way soon
ah of course ill be with you in a moment lord sigurd one last thing  beware of duke maios of thove i regret to say that my brother in law has long hungered to claim sailane for himself its only a matter of time till he goes so far as to attack you i wish i could provide you with reinforcements but 
 i know the capital is under the very same threat from duke daccar of zaxon you cannot afford to weaken your own guard daccar will pounce upon you given even a hint of weakness dont worry about it your highness theres nothing the thove army can throw at us that we cant handle
ah of course i should be more confident in such veteran heroes as yourselves oh ive been talking for so long i lost track of the time take care lord sigurd
you too your highness thank you
mother arent you forgetting somebody youve just chatted for hours and hours with sigurd yet you cant even acknowledge your own son
my son the one who abandoned me two years ago going gods know where how do i talk to someone whos clearly not here
heh heh  so this is how its going to be is it youre still mad at me then
of course i am do you have any idea how hard it was without you and how worried ive been after you that my own son could be so cold hearted  i thought i knew you better than this
look i know youre upset but i had my reasons for all this but come on im home safely surely that counts for something and you can forgive me i swear ill make up for it and be the very picture of a good son hey how about i give you a shoulder massage to start
oh what nerve treating me as if im an old crone  look lewyn there are more pressing matters which we need to talk about and soon come to silesse as soon as possible do not forget do i make myself clear
 sigh i thought shed never stop
dont be fooled by your mothers outward behavior milord shes actually very happy now youve returned indeed she hasnt been anything as cheerful as this since before you left
thanks annand knowing youre at her side is a big relief look after her okay
yes sir rest assured i will protect the queen with my life on my honor as the captain of the silessian pegasus knights
thanks oh one more thing  are you gonna leave erinys here with sigurd
i am  milord id like you to keep my sister at your side she 
annand
oh eavesdropping were you erinys
you were about to tell him too much so 
ah my apologies erinys there are things he shouldnt know just yet of course  erinys ill be leaving with queen rahna and returning to silesse castle shortly youll stay here and keep and eye on prince lewyn best of luck
thank you annand
sigurd well now be taking our leave its high time we returned to leonster rest assured well be back this time leading the full military might of leonster to your aid may that day come soon my friend
im going with quan sigurd dont worry though well be back before you know it take care of yourself
by your leave sir ill be departing with my lord thank you for all youve done for us dont give up sir one day i know the charges against you will be cleared and your good name restored i know you can do this
thank you youve got quite the journey back to leonster ahead of you i wish i could do more to help you on your way may your journey be a safe one
díthorba is the army ready to deploy yet
yes sir bishop cuvulis wind mage unit has infiltrated the forests near sailane they await your command sir
very well relay my orders to cuvuli move in on sailane díthorba i trust your pegasus corps are already briefed on your mission
yes sir our task is clear my squadron is to raid the enemy from above disrupting their tactics
good now get to work grannvale will owe us a handsome reward for bringing them the heads of their infamous traitors heh heh heh 
theres the signal to assault sailane as planned i trust youre all ready move in teach the traitorous scum the terror of a wind mages wrath
the thove armys attacking looks like maios has finally made his move heh heh  why this little drama is finally getting interesting wouldnt you say pamela
indeed sir however as i recall we didnt account for sigurds fugitives being here their strength poses a real risk to the plan if maios at least succeeds in weakening them perhaps silesses fall will still go smoothly
even if he fails i still have my private deal with grannvale in my favor their lord andré should arrive shortly with a battalion of reinforcements heh heh  my victory is certain pamela ill be sitting on the silessian throne by the end of the week
without a doubt sir
hm id say those traitors are drawing perhaps a bit too close for comfort you there raise the thove river drawbridge without this key theres no way theyll ever get over here heh heh  i almost wish i could see the looks on their faces
what just one of these locks cmon at least gimme a challenge  ta da
sire the thove village elder would like a word with you
of course actually id imagine we need to talk this situation over bring him in
lord sigurd i presume we cant thank you enough for getting rid of lord maios the entire population of thove is rejoicing at his downfall
hm are you sure i mean i just conquered you am i not the enemy here
lord maios was nothing but a tyrant all he ever did was bleed us dry you fight in the name of queen rahna and there isnt a silessian alive who doesnt bear the utmost adoration for our queen
is that so thank you anyway in the interim i think ill leave governing thove to you sir once the crisis has settled the queen will be in touch to arrange a proper successor until then im sure youll be a just governor to help heal thoves wounds
very well please lord sigurd do all you can to protect the queen she is a treasure to us and a beacon of peace and kindness
rest assured my good man so long as i live i swear that ill let no harm come to queen rahna you have my word
thove has fallen has it  i almost feel bad for my brother little more than a pawn in my dreams whod outlived his usefulness pamela its your turn lead your pegasus knights into battle at once sigurd is well clear of the capital seize it while he has no chance of aiding them
yes sir
dire news milady zaxon has deployed pamelas pegasus unit and theyre closing in on the capital
what this cant be happening  so at long last daccar has put to rest his tired old façade of innocence
be at ease milady my squad will keep pamelas at bay
annand are you sure you can do this ive heard stories of the sheer terror of pamelas might as a warrior
of course  i know better than to take lightly such a formidable foe but remember i am one of the four falcon knights of silesse i never enter a battle ill prepared
ah  im so sorry annand i already know well how you feel about all this but  i 
to fight in your name is the only life i know  milady please dont worry about me so much if thats all then ill be going knights to me move out
ah duke andré i presume you certainly took your time getting here  and  oh how magnificent so this is jungbys renowned bow knight legion
hmhmhm  alas my father is dead and my sister is a fugitive among the traitors this leaves me and me alone as the duke of jungby and the leader of our legion against the might of the beige ritter these winged ponies stand no chance at all now sit back and watch them drop like flies
its been a while pamela  ive known you for years ever since we trained side by side to become knights but not once did i ever suspect we would someday find ourselves as enemies
annand  only you would be so foolish as to insist on following your queen to her inevitable grave why should i complain though after all once youre out of the way that leaves me as the greatest knight of silesse
the only fool here is you pamela no  its too late to change your mind youre so set on your fate  very well all i can do for you now is give you a last honorable duel befitting a silessian knight
heh  saccharine as ever arent you
annand has been killed ahh  how could this happen  im so sorry annand  forgive me 
what annands dead  y youre joking
huh annand was  no th  this cant be happening how  how could anyone have killed her this cant be 
heh  i expected so much more from silesses famous pegasus knights  no matter i suppose we might as well bring down the capital while were here pamela your unit will cross the mountains besiege and capture thove immediately
very well
the capital is under our control good mission accomplished we ride for grannvale at once
heh  at long last the capital is mine and mine alone now i want a wind mage unit deployed south of silesse river fortify our defensive line there furthermore  donovan you and your axemen are to occupy the capital and maintain its defenses but dont even think about killing the queen we cant waste a hostage of such high value
got it sir
hurry you need to flee as fast as you can
but your highness 
ill be okay look after yourselves please
people please the queen wants us to run so come on run
huh where the hell are all the townsfolk ugh  they scarpered didnt they damn it they took all the fun outta this boys its up to you now get out there and butcher those little pigs no survivors understand
no please stop my citizens are as innocent as they come it matters not what happens to me but please dont harm my people
i dont think so youve been screwin up lord daccars will long enough missy bout time you learned your lesson
ahh 
heh  it appears leaving this to donovan was a good idea after all
well now its been a long time since ive seen such darling villainy anywhere its almost enough to turn a weaker stomach
coming from someone like you willing to kill anyone anywhere anytime so long as youre handsomely paid thats quite a claim high praise indeed if its from the infamous lamia the infernal
ohoho quite the flatterer arent you now where do we begin with our mayhem
for now your group will guard the castle be ready to roll out your traditional welcome in case sigurds thugs try causing us grief
guard duty really wheres the fun in that eh no matter its your money oi ladies listen up were on guard duty stick to the castle and pick off the enemys leftovers if they come
huh so the sailane armys finally comin good its bout time i gave those damned rebels the axe boys get off yer sorry hinds guard the castle no matter what dont let em get anywhere near it
your highness im so glad youre unharmed my sincerest apologies for not coming to your aid sooner
its fine lord sigurd that youve made it here is more than enough i  im sorry i couldnt do more too many people have died and i could only stand by and watch  i cant bear it and  and annand 
dont worry your highness annands killers will die this day by my hand daccars crimes are beyond forgiveness i promise you he will not escape me with this in mind i humbly request your authorization to assault zaxon castle
lord daccars petty greed has condemned my people to utter agony long enough he is a murderer nothing more nothing less you may visit justice upon him lord sigurd
understood ill mobilize my army to capture zaxon immediately for now your highness please get some rest
do take care of yourself lord sigurd as soon as zaxon is under your control ill be coming by for a word with you
dont worry your highness weve already put an end to annands killers that said in our haste we neglected to get your consent to do so my apologies
its alright lord sigurd i couldnt possibly thank you enough for all of your help today ill come by zaxon castle later once everything has settled here may we meet again then lord sigurd
oh you must be joking those accursed rebels have already re captured silesse what in the blazes is donovan even doing out there
instruct pamela to lead her squad in pursuit of sigurds army throw everything we have at him
blast  weve no choice instruct lamia to move out and attack at once they mustnt be allowed near my castle
wow even something so tiny gets daccar panicking  no matter lets go ladies weve got quite the feast ahead of us
sire queen rahna has arrived
lord sigurd that was quite the fierce battle wasnt it are you unharmed
yeah somehow im okay
i know ive asked so much of you already lord sigurd but would you and your army please station yourselves here at zaxon grannvales lord langbalt has already swept in with an immense army and conquered lubeck castle to our east the people of silesse are terrified that this will prove to be but a prelude to a full scale war with grannvale
your highness i believe langbalts army is here only for me ive no desire to needlessly endanger you or your citizens after all youve done for us my men and i are leaving now i have a score to settle with langbalt
what recklessness how could you possibly prevail like this
theyre coming for me no matter what if we remain here then theyll just invade we cant afford to waste time debating this
is that so  how sad 
your highness  thank you so much youve given me the most wonderful year here and youve done so much to put my mind at ease my mother died when i was still very young so as i grew up i never knew the unconditional love of a mother but thanks to you here in silesse ive come to know that very same warmth youre like a second mother to me now  take care of yourself your highness i hope that someday once this is all over well have a chance to meet again
as do i lord sigurd please stay vigilant out there and keep yourself safe from the bottom of my heart i pray that you and deirdre will soon be reunited
magic is governed by a hierarchy of power just like weapons fire magic bests wind wind bests thunder and thunder bests fire however dark and light magic have an advantage over all of the others think your strategies through with care
bein of holy ancestry can bestow a number of powers onto ya divine heirs can wield even the most advanced weapons with ease andll have an easier time growin stronger course its not every day you meet someone blessed with that sorta blood
the silesse royal family wields the power of wind as bestowed by the wind god forseti house velthomer wields the power of fire as bestowed by the fire goddess vala and house friege wields thunder powers as bestowed by the thunder god tordo
the sinister powers of the dark god loptyr can be fought only with the glorious powers of naga our great god only grannvales house belhalla the heirs to saint heim inherit nagas power
only a direct holy descendant can inherit the full breadth of the power of the gods and only theyll be able to wield their familys divine heirlooms however if kin intersect their offspringll have their exalted blood enriched andll reap almighty powers needless to say mind doin that is condemned and forbidden 
should prince kurths daughter bear a son that son would be heir to grannvales throne i daresay this makes lord arvis husband to the princess quite the influential figure
legend has it that all direct heirs to the crusaders bear exalted brands on their bodies which appear on them in their infancy prince kurths daughter has her naga brand on her forehead actually that was how they recognized her as a direct heiress to saint heim
oh lord sigurds army is here to save us all hang on  arent you a dancer miss if you dont mind perhaps you could do a little dance for us its been so long since weve had time for respite or fun 
yep not a problem if you think itll help everyone cheer up a bit then im gonna dance my feet off  okay heeeere we go
hah
yeah
hyaaah
whew  well how bout that everyone feelin a little better
oh what fantastic dancin i dunno how but now i feel like im ready to give life my all i cant thank you enough miss here perhaps this magic swordll help ya out it oughta do a fine job of keeping ya safe
yknow how theres a drawbridge over the thove river yeah thats under the control of duke maios too if its still drawn and you dont have the key youre not getting across mind you if you have a thiefs sticky fingers at your service that might not be a problem 
whats that you got the drawbridge lowered howd ya know to do that
im so sorry i dragged you into this mess as well father claud
its fine if anything im sorry that my efforts to aid you simply werent enough i did return to grannvale and i was about to relate the truth to his majesty but reptor interfered before i could do anything and now i too am branded a traitor to the motherland
ugh ive had enough of just sitting here and letting reptor have his sorry way i swear ive half a mind to storm straight into grannvale and end this once and for all
no you know better than to rely on brute force or risk the common folks safety for now lord sigurd we must endure
but father claud 
make no mistake i feel your pain too but this crisiss end now lies in fates hands there is nothing any of us can do to save ourselves anymore
hey azelle wait up a sec
tailtiu is something wrong
i need to ask you something quick
hm me
yeah that okay i mean weve been friends for years and i dont think theres anyone else who i can ask about this
huh you look downright grim and serious  if you really think i can help then sure what seems to be the problem
well  i er  im only with you lot because i was just following claud around but im starting to think i shouldnt have done that 
what makes you think so
its because people are acting kinda like theyre treading carefully round me and when im around people stop talking about my father 
ah  that certainly doesnt sound fun but id say people really do like you its more that they honestly arent sure how they should treat you and that theyre worried theyll cause you grief dont worry too much itll all be fine once they get to know you better
yeah  guess youre right thanks azelle think i might be feeling a bit better bout this now
hah glad youre back to normal tailtiu if youre ever feeling like this again ill always be here to help you through it no matter what happens
okay thanks
take care of yourself out here azelle
right and you as well aideen
this still feels so odd  not once did i ever think that one day we would be together like this
its because im younger than you right
oh no im still not sure why 
i still cant quite believe it either that youre now my wife  it all still feels like im living in some kind of dream
hm how so dont you believe our marriage feels right
its not that its because er  well youre so beautiful  even though i was still very young when i saw you for the first time years ago my heart just wouldnt stop pounding ever since that day you were the only one for whom ive ever felt this way
oh azelle 
its still pretty embarrassing to admit  oh i almost forgot this is for you this is a rescue staff you can use it to bring people far away back to your side instantly i know youll put it to good use
im so happy to be with you azelle ill always treasure having such a kind and gentle soul as you by my side 
midir please accept this bow
isnt this a brave bow are you sure you want to give away something so rare
i am i bought it for you after all silesses pegasus knights are a formidable foe to face with a bow of this caliber in hand i know youll be better prepared to fight them
milady  i still cant believe this isnt a dream i cant believe were actually married  ive dreamed of this for so long
ive long dreamt of the same myself i wanted to act upon it for many years but i couldnt even at my loneliest  but i think by now you can just call me aideen ill always look out for you midir ill always pray for your safety
jamke id like for you to have this bow
this is a brave bow isnt it  you sure its okay for me to take it
yes please accept it as formidable as the silessian pegasus knights are so long as you have this bow i know youll have the upper hand
thanks aideen i know ill be able to keep you safe with a bow like this i guess ill see you later once this is all over
jamke  ill be praying for your safety
hey hey erinys you totally like lewyn dont ya like do ya really like him
huh i  thats  er no prince lewyn is beloved and respected by all the people of silesse myself included
oh okay then then i guess youd be okay with me and lewyn getting together right
er  yes i wouldnt really mind 
reeeeally that wouldnt but ya at all
no im sure id have no issue why do you ask am i supposed to object
i dunno but if its all fine by ya then i guess its time for me to go work my magic on lewyn 
er  the thing is a prospective queen of silesse ought to possess the same grace and dignity as our queen rahna
oh so youre sayin im not cut out for it how rude
er no  that isnt 
hrmph fine then ill show you
 
hello there mister father
hm and who are you
im silviiiiiiiia
well then miss silvia how can i help have you perchance recently run afoul of bandits
whats that
well er  im not sure how to put this  youre wearing nothing but smallclothes
eh watch your mouth mister father havent you seen dancers like me before this is just a dancers clothes its just like you wearin your churchy cloak
is that so  hm surely youre chilled to the bone wearing as little as you are though
oh no even round here im never cold cause my hearts ablaze
is dancing truly so fun for you
yeah i just love it
is that so  what of your parents do they agree with this career of yours
actually im an orphan when i was really little my master took me in and helped me become a dancer but he  he was an awful awful man hed always beat me outta nowhere bout a year ago i couldnt stand any more of it all so i ran away
i see  what a horrible tale i believe i know your pain i once had a sister who would likely be around your age if shes still alive
a sister
yes alas she was abducted while she was still an infant ive searched for her ever since but to this day ive yet to find any sign of her
ohh  i bet shes just like a princess shes gotta be all pretty and classy  and nothin like me 
i disagree i assure you i do find you to be utterly charming in your own way you possess a unique grace and beauty
oh  mister father  really
of course i could never lie
th thank you  nobodys ever told me somethin like that  this feels kinda funny somehow  oh  oh great now im cryin  what is this 
hey sigurd could i have a word
ah lewyn im so sorry about what happened to annand i had no idea jungbys bow knights would get involved in this mess
no its not your fault just mine  i just havent been thinking right lately i shouldve been here all along looking after mother and the country but nope i just ran away thats why annand died  she just took my place in all this
theres no need to blame yourself the best you can do now is care for the queen and ensure that annand didnt die in vain
yeah i know no use pointing out the obvious huh
very well oh lewyn before i forget  dont forget to go see your mother at the capital as soon as possible she said its of the utmost importance
lord lewyn 
 oh erinys im so sorry forgive me please 
oh you mean about annand 
 yeah
oh so she  you really did  im so sorry i had no idea
whoa erinys youve got it all wrong i guess when i was younger i did sorta have a thing for annand  but that was then this is now and the now is you
c come again
erinys i  i love you 
mother youre not hurt are you when i heard that silesse had fallen i  i was pretty worried there
thank you so much for coming lewyn perhaps at last youve matured into a young man who honors his promises perhaps lord sigurd has had quite the positive influence on you after all
oh come on mother you dont need to act like im still a child besides sigurd is hardly all that much older than i am
dear compared to the likes of lord sigurd you may as well still be a screaming infant youve still much to learn from him and quickly nothing would be more reassuring than having a son as fine as he by my side especially now that annand is  oh 
annand  i shouldve been the one to die out there not her if only id gotten here sooner mother ill be here to protect you from now on i wont let annands death go to waste i swear i will never ever leave you again
oh lewyn  i never thought you were capable of saying anything so kind but your word is more than enough for now at least i believe you should remain at lord sigurds side he has a greater need of your strength
but if i do that what about you 
theres nothing to worry about lewyn you are the heir of the wind crusader your place is with the rest of the world to lead and guide it on its true path the time has come for me to confer upon you your true birthright  the exalted wind tome forseti here lewyn its yours
this  so this is the royal familys ancestral tome  the book of forseti  oh this power  whats this  warmth
lewyn never forget the wind crusader flows as the gentlest breeze his way is to guide all the peoples of the world on the path of peace hate and violence is never his answer
yes of course i dont think i could live my life any other way
indeed perhaps you truly are a child of the wind  lewyn  its time for you to go take care out there and  and dont do anything too rash
mother 
go on  for heavens sake go 
okay mother please take care of yourself
oh  lewyn 
ah are you here to help me i couldnt possibly thank you enough
oh youre here to save me thank you so so much
hmhmhm  im surprised youve made it this far
díthorba  the rest  is up to you 
behold you now face díthorba one of the four falcon knights of silesse this is where your journey ends
ohohoho erinys is it fancy seeing you here your head will make a fine gift for lord maios mantelpiece
ill never let you win here díthorba ive come a long way from the erinys you once knew
pfeh dont make me laugh once a weakling always a weakling some things will never change

/***EOF***/
the two faces of the thracian peninsula are as distinct as night and day the peninsulas north once ruled by several small kingdoms is graced with rich pastures while the south the kingdom of thracia is a harsh wasteland dominated by vast mountains in ages past seeking to claim the life giving northern land as their own thracias infamous wyvern knights have led countless brash attempts to conquer the north only to be repelled at every turn by the might of house leonster
thracia looked to have won at last following their slaughter of leonsters army in the yied desert only to be defeated in turn by blume of freege who claimed the land as his own and so the so called kingdom of north thracia was born as yet another servant of the empire over a decade has passed since then not even thracias king travant an ambitious man with a thirst for power and glory dares to challenge the will of the empire and so a strange peace looms over the region
or so it did until the arrival of seliph and his liberation army blumes defeat at his own castle has abruptly tipped the balance of the thracian stalemate both the alster and leonster territories now lie under the liberation armys control forcing blume to retreat to conote and muster the strength to take alster back the southern manster castle governed by the goddess of lightning princess ishtar braces itself for the threat of thracian invaders
for the entirety of the thracian peninsula to return to the rule of house leonster and so dawns yet another battle 
nngh  curses never did i imagine that the rebels could pose such a threat banba how could the three of you let yourselves be cowed into fleeing what a disgrace
a thousand apologies milord however youve nothing to worry about anymore even as we speak general muhammad prepares his brigade to lay siege to alster and general ovos cavalry are en route to leonster we too shall rejoin the fray shortly
hrm  dont you dare fail me this time and what of king travant why are the promised thracian reinforcements nowhere to be seen
weve yet to receive any response to any of our messengers so far
gah  what in blazes is that snake thinking
king travant is an ambitious man to blindly trust him would be foolish
no matter even without his forces weve more than enough power to stop the rebels cold banba fotla eriu move out at once this time leave not a single rebel alive
yes milord we will not fail
sir ced please we all cant take much more of king blumes abuses how long  how long will it be until manster is free from the empire
dont lose hope now even as we speak lord seliph and his liberators are out there fighting for the district theyll be here before long go tell your friends and family that your freedom is so very nearly in reach please my friends believe me mansters freedom is fast approaching
pardon me father but king blume is requesting our aid yet again the empire has already lost both alster and leonster to the isaach rebels he wishes to use us to help reclaim them
the isaach rebels are led by that seliph brat  sigurds spawn correct heh  poor poor blume hes getting so old even little children are a thorn in his side pay blume no heed arion the empire and the rebels are best left to break themselves on each other for now well mop up the leftovers once theyre nice and weak
i should have known father  all along youve been waiting out blumes little storm havent you
but of course itd make no sense to bend over backward for the man who snatched our hard won north out from under our noses would it leonsters downfall should have meant a peninsula unified under our rule  ill neither forgive nor forget blumes craven conquest
even now we still lack the power to truly match grannvale on an even battlefield  i can only imagine your frustration father
thracias fate depends on a unified peninsula the verdant northern soils are the perfect cure for the famine and poverty wracking our south weve been shunned and vilified for centuries dismissed as ravenous hyenas  yet what choice did we ever have if not for our answer to this worlds craving for sellswords thracia would never have had the funds to barely survive as we do weve toiled in poverty long enough arion its high time thracia carved itself a future a future i might add which depends on the outcome of the game laid before us 
mm
i have a bad feeling about this seliph  is leonster well guarded
i believe so but then again reinforcing it further certainly wouldnt hurt should i send them some support
do it with blume still on the loose in conote theres no sense in skimping on the defenses oh and also weve received a plea for help from the people of manster castle the sooner our forces reach them the better
very well we shall make the first move
move in on alster castle weve nothing to fear from these rebels if anyone dares to question my command come forth and allow me to relieve your neck of your head  no volunteers good attack
good everythings ready men we tear through leonsters defenses in one fell swoop well not let muhammads men put us to shame
it is time then  fotla eriu shall we proceed weve no room for error this time
what do you want blume
ah faval so you came after all ive been waiting for you
look blume im a busy man tell me what you want or im leaving
tch  listen carefully ive an employment opportunity for you
 an employment opportunity
yes faval i require your services in putting down the rebel army
pass i might be a mercenary but im certainly not about to do your dirty work
oh really then what will become of all those orphans in your care rumor has it your dear sister has taken to stealing the money you need to take care of them are you content with such a life
i guess youre right  i dunno if i can take patty risking her life like this much longer and we do sorely need the gold 
bring me seliphs head faval and youll have all the gold your orphans will ever need and more your dear sister would approve
 deal i know thisll come back to bite me but if it means saving the kids  you have my bow  just this once
you summoned me father how might i be of assistance
ishtar what kept you so long the rebels are preparing to launch another attack on me any moment now i i need you to protect me
whats happened father how could a pack of simple rebels get to you of all people this is so very unlike you 
these are no mere rebels theyve already slaughtered ishtore and tine is lost to us as well because of them  theyve already defeated banba and her sister  i cant leave this task to them again youre all i have left to depend upon
understood but i have one condition i need the book of mjölnir if im wielding mjölnir i wont need an army with me i alone will be more than enough
w what you  want me to hand it over  fine very well  you can take mjölnir  but dont you dare fail me now
you can trust me father by your leave
ishtar return with me to belhalla youve no business dying in a place like this
oh lord julius   but why are you 
come ishtar i need you
y yes milord anything you wish
looks like we just dealt a critical blow to the empires control of the area seliph their survivors are fleeing in droves
excellent i suspect liberating manster has become far simpler than wed hoped
dont get too excited just yet the real problem here is still thracia
what makes you think so what would cause thracia to break neutrality now of all times
youve never had to deal with king travant before have you just ask prince leif if not for travant he would still have his parents travants murder of them was a cruel ambush an insult to the honor of a knight like quan who knows what dirty game hes planning now 
blumes gone and died has he heh heh  at last thracia has been scrubbed clean of the imperial taint nows our chance to help ourselves to the north starting with manster altena i leave the capture of manster to you ill send general coulter with you if anyone stands in your way suppress them without a second thought i dont care if its a little kid with a wooden stick cut them down
hold on a moment father im as eager to challenge the empire as you are but killing innocents makes no sense at all wed be much better served forging an alliance with the liberators were already surrounded by enemies why make more
altena i have no interest in one of your little lectures keep your mouth shut and do as youre told
but father 
please altena just listen to him father and i must return to the capital weve some further preparations to make best of luck holding our border altena
arion  very well ill do it 
then dont waste your time dawdling go
shes finally gone good  stubborn little thing isnt she i havent seen a woman so brash since her mother  quite the family resemblance there
father surely you must realize that altena means you no ill will you neednt be so harsh on her
yes that much is obvious thank you  lets head back to the capital arion we need to ready the army to claim this peninsula as ours once and for all maykov meath castle is in your hands work with altenas unit and defend the border no matter what happens
understood milord
dire news sir ced thracias dispatched a dracoknight unit from meath and theyre coming our way
just our luck  weve only just finally cleared the empire out of manster and now weve got thracia to grapple with as well i suppose it was only a matter of time before travant showed his true colors 
the liberation armys sure to want to aid us but they still havent crossed the river what do we do
everyone get out of here and run for connaught ill stay here and fend off the wyvern knights for as long as i can
b but thats impossible sir ced not even you could survive a dracoknight assault by yourself
i know but i wont risk any lives but my own dont worry i wont go down without bringing a few thracians with me go on please weve no time to waste
sir ced 
the rebels have made it to manster what in the blazes is princess altena doing men bolster our defensive line until his majesty the king returns we must protect the border at all costs
is everything ready my liege well be closing in on manster shortly lets waste no time in besieging them
hold coulter those are nothing more than common citizens standing in our way killing them would be the foulest of crimes wait here with the squad ill see if i can negotiate a surrender
you know i cant do that my orders come from over your head you may spout all the lovely nonsense you wish but the king forbids me to stay my hand
are you questioning a direct order from your commander and your princess general
these are my men princess if you dont wish to partake yourself then stand aside make yourself useful and watch our backs now then  is everyone ready all hands prepare to strike manster leave no survivors
c coulter get back here at once
hold on a moment over there  is that a dracoknight dame she has such a sad look in her eyes 
julia youre safe oh thank heavens 
mm  the enemy seized and imprisoned me here but i knew  i knew you would rescue me no matter what
the thracians are on such a different level to anybody weve fought before lewyn it almost feels as if each blow is fueled by pure desperation 
see thracias always had a bad lot in life much of its land is consumed by mountains farming its own food is a near impossible task so they struggle to keep themselves fed thracias men seek mercenary work to find the money to stay alive while its women are stuck in whatever dreary jobs they can dig up dont get me wrong seliph king travant is still an awful man but theres far more than his own petty gain at stake in his schemes the thracian army is as loyal to travant as they come they ardently believe its travant wholl guide thracia out of its endless famine
i see  that does make sense 
the thing is no amount of poverty will ever justify thracias aggression travants brand of nobility and justice would never be accepted anywhere else in the world all the peninsulas north can see are rowdy aggressors who threaten their peaceful lives as harsh as it may seem seliph i trust you know you cant afford to stay your hand here the thracian royal family is the enemy and a grave threat to the norths peace stripping them of power is the only choice that task falls to us and we cant fail now
the liberators have seized meath could i have been wrong about them oh arion
ohh thank you so much ive heard all the stories about your army and ive been praying that youd come someday lord seliph is our beacon of hope here take this power ring its not much but its all we have to show our gratitude
long ago thracia and the states of the manster district were a single nation course youd never know that from how theyve hated each other so for as long as anyone can recall i wish they could just try to make peace 
gaah i i dont believe it  the connaught hitmans back for more blood run everyone run for it
 
 
er  shouldnt you be running too
but you look so sad mister 
 i do
take these we picked up all these fruits in the woods eat em theyll make you grow up big and strong i hope you feel better soon
thanks kid 
ive heard tell that over in manster peoplere planning a revolt against the imperial rule apparently the ringleader theres some silessian mage called ced  the people there are so sure that hes the man for the job of course the real problem for manster is that thracias got their grubby eyes on the city  i hope theyll be alright
for as long as anyone can recall thracias wanted to claim this region as their own and for just as long house leonster always stood in their way wielding their holy lance gáe bolg to defend our lands at least until gáe bolg was lost a decade ago in the yied desert  the thracians ambushed and murdered prince quan his wife ethlyn and their daughter altena as they crossed yied and the lance vanished 
it was the legendary dracoknight dain who founded thracia all those years ago  with his heavenly lance gungnir in hand he dared to challenge the king of demons himself rumor has it that nova of the crusaders ancestor of the lords of house leonster was in fact a sister to lord dain 
hoo hoo what brings you all the way out here you must be quite the curious one either way i want to thank you for coming all this way for such a small and remote town this here trinkets a thiefs band shes an odd little thing slip her on and youll soon find yourself stealing like youve done it all your life hoo hoo hoo take care of yourself dearie
lord seliph 
oh julia is something the matter
i  im scared  i sense an evil presence  something dark  and its closing in 
what do you mean
slowly  seliph  be on your guard  ishtar is a fierce foe  you cannot fight her  you must not 
julia whats happening to you
ahh  i  w what in the world just 
julia  youre 
you need to be careful fee i know you can fly and all but that doesnt mean you should just take off by yourself
oh are my ears playing tricks on me could it be youre actually worried about me arthur
er  yeah i suppose so
hmmm who knew you had it in you i never wouldve guessed that youre even able to worry about anyone but yourself i might have to rethink everything just a bit
well er youre something of a special case 
huh
er never mind anyway just dont do anything too rash alright see you 
arthur 
lord leif the protection of the peninsula realm is our duty as house leonsters remnants we arent in for an easy battle but no matter what happens we must persevere
i know finn ive always dreamed that this day the day of leonsters freedom would come  ill do all i can to bring peace to the peninsula and save the people from king blumes tyranny to fulfill fathers final wishes at last  and if i need to lay down my life to make our dream a reality then so be it 
please my lord it ill befits a future king to do something so rash you mustnt say such things
er youre right  sorry finn i know how hard you had to work to protect me from the empires pursuit in my youth i recall how often youd let yourself starve just so i wouldnt have to go without food  all my life youve made sacrifice after sacrifice for my sake and only now do i understand this  ill always be grateful for all youve done finn
my lord the thracian region has been plagued by strife for generations but your father dared to dream of uniting it under a lasting peace he may be gone but you still yet live and so too does the hope of fulfilling his dream only you stand a chance of uniting thracia
hang on  faval what dyou think youre doing ugh  dont tell me you actually let blume buy out your bow arm
patty wait  why are you with the rebels
to protect people of course weve come this far working together and i know were gonna stop blume for good i dont get it did you just go and forget everything that if it wasnt for the empires cruelty none of the kids would be orphans but no here you are kissing up to the very same man who ruined all our friends lives what the heck were you thinking faval
youre absolutely right  im so sorry patty i guess i just wasnt thinking at all
any scumbag can apologize till their blue in the face if youre really sorry then get over here come help us fight for peace
alright patty im with you youve certainly come a long way lately 
hee hee  i guess i have
prince seliph please sir forgive my foolishness
faval yes patty has already told me your story relax i understand why you did what you did youve nothing to worry about
i dont think so sir letting myself work for the very same empire ive supposedly been opposing that was shamefully half witted of me  sir i swear ill make up for my bad choices ill do everything i can to aid you
thank you faval im glad to have you
pardon me tine i dont suppose youre acquainted with princess ishtar
i am  when i was growing up ishtar was like a sister to me she was one of the few who treated me well 
would you have any idea who the man who came to collect her was then
that  was most likely prince julius
the crown prince himself are you certain
i think so yes the two are a couple that would be why he 
have you met prince julius before then
once or twice when i visited belhalla he  how can i put this  he has this odd charm which draws people to him  only for them to find that hes colder than ice hes terrifying if i didnt know better i would swear he isnt even human 
hey youre ares right
i am what do you want
ive been hearing how youre the son of eldigan is there any truth to that
there is of what concern is it yours
oh i knew it was true im nanna im the daughter of lachesis lord eldigans sister
c can this be are you truly my aunts child
of course i am you know my mother was really worried about what happened to you it mustve been her search for you that brought us to leonster all those years ago
my father knew well that the stormclouds of a brutal civil war lurked over agustria i was a mere infant and my mother was in poor health so he bade her to seek refuge with her parents in leonster alas leonster too fell afoul of a war of its own and my mother lost her life to the empires invasion
thats where jabarro comes in right
indeed jabarro found me and took me in as his own and with his mercenary corps i travelled the world and learned the art of war
so thats why ive never found you before  listen ares my mother left me something to give to you if we ever met
oh  what is this is this  is this fathers
it is its a letter from lord eldigan and its addressed to you ares
i cant believe it 
this should sort everything out it says your father and sigurd were the closest of friends and held each others deepest trust this never changed no matter what 
so it says  wow i  ive been so so wrong for all this time 
i hope youll look after lord seliph ares he really is depending on you
i will i promise you  say nanna how would you like a quick lesson in swordplay here pay close attention 
milord 
ah mana is something the matter
er see  im scared milord i mean when we first left isaach i was excited as anybody but now  i watch everyone risking their lives over and over and i i know that sooner or later itll be one of us who dies next
mana 
you saw what the thunder mage did when we defeated her didnt you milord she just vanished in the blink of an eye theres something else at work here  an evil power beyond anything we know
 you arent alone mana ive tried to hide it but to be frank im terrified as well often i find myself too fearful to sleep  sometimes the fear is so overwhelming that i wish i could run away  just leave jugdral and its troubles behind me but i cannot  i will not you saw the faces of the people when we freed alster and connaught did you not the very instant that wed won they were so overjoyed that they burst into tears thats how much freedom from the empire means to them we are the ones with the power to save jugdral mana and we must not shirk from that duty
 im so sorry milord i shouldnt have made you worry like that ill always give your cause all i have i promise but please milord  please be careful i dont know what wed do without you 
thank you mana and i  i dont know what id do without you
oh  milord 
ced the brave i presume i couldnt possibly thank you enough for all youve done for the people of manster
lord seliph  im so glad youre here at last sire i implore you save this world too many of us have already given into despair  the city of manster has been robbed by the empire of countless young children all were sent to the shrines in miletos  i  i couldnt save even a single child me brave hah i hardly deserve such a lofty label im just another coward 
that isnt true ced if i were to fight alone i know that thered be precious little that i could do it was uniting the strength of my friends a team effort which brought us this far and i believe that your strength could be a valuable part of our cause please ced the brave grant us your power
thank you sire  youll have my loyalty no matter what
huh er pardon me lord seliph but   that man standing by your side 
ah ced id like you to meet lewyn my tactician
lewyn i knew it thats my father 
oh ced i guess youve found me been a while huh hows things
hows things hows things father dont you realize ive been searching for you for all this time do you even realize how long its been since you ran away from home
oh yeah i guess it has been a few years  hey hows erinys doing these days
how dare you  mother is dead all we ever wanted was for her to see you one last time before she died  thats why ive been looking for you
huh  erinys  such a shame too 
are you capable of any emotion at all father you just heard your wifes dead and you wont so much as shed a tear  and what about fee youve hurt her so much it still pains her  shes adamant that she wont speak to you youve known she was here all along father why didnt you try to fix this

/***EOF***/
at the heart of the continent of jugdral lies grannvale a kingdom founded by saint heim of the twelve crusaders
supporting the royal family the heirs of heim are six noble houses each also descended from a crusader of old the six states while still subservient to the royal family each occupy vast swaths of grannvales land and maintain mighty militaries of their own
owing to king azmurs advanced age the governance of grannvale falls to his son the highly respected prince kurth
lord byron of house chalphy and lord ring of house jungby grannvales chancellor lord reptor of friege has long objected to the thread to his influence posed by kurth and his advisors and has allied himself with the avaricious lord langobalt of house dozel to form a faction opposed to kurths rule over grannvale
the young duke of house velthomer lord arvis leads the royal guard in the kings care and so has little time for the circus of politics only father claude of house edda could foresee the oncoming storm into the midst of this tense situation comes dire news from jugdrals east darna a town in the aed desert with deep ties to grannvale is now besieged by savage warriors from isaach reports of a brutal massacre abound
the news is met by the people of grannvale with furious cries for retribution and before long the kingdom declares war on isaach prince kurth leads grannvales charge on his fathers behalf commanding the military might of the kingdoms six houses
at kurths side as always is none other than lord byron a highly decorated hero of peerless valor in his own right
grannvale has poured its entire military might into the isaach campaign and precious few soldiers remain behind with its neighbors   agustria to the west and verdane to the south   bound in alliance with grannvale none dare to dream they could ever be threatened
it is not long at all however before he peoples confidence is shattered as if from nowhere a vast horde from verdane led by prince gandolf crosses the grannvale border and lays siege to jungby castle in lord rings absence his daughter lady aideen is jungbys only guardian lord byron has entrusted the defense of grannvale in his absence to his son sigurd who remains at chalphy castle with a mere handful of soldiers a friend of aideen since childhood sigurd is horrified to hear of the jungby siege and even with so few soldiers is determined to protect aideen and his fatherland from the savage verdanite hordes
the year is 757 grann calendar and thus the threshold of fate is cast open nobody could have known then that this simple disturbance was but the first of countless calamities to come
milady the castle is completely surrounded weve failed you  we couldnt do a thing to save you from them 
its alright midir  every one of you did the best you could do please you neednt worry about me you must ensure that as many of you survive this as possible
no milady we might not stand a chance but every last one of us will give our lives to protect you right to the very end
thank you midir  im so sorry
gandolfs army already has jungby surrounded aideen is in grave danger noish im going to help her im leaving chalphy in your hands
hold milord surely you dont intend to go alone
nearly all of our forces are already on the march to isaach with father theres hardly anybody left to call upon they may be simple savages but verdanes army is still huge i cant risk your lives by forcing you to face them
perish the thought milord i was born a knight and i will gladly risk dying a knights death in your name to allow our lord to die alone in battle would be an unspeakable disgrace we shall be by your side every step of the way alec i trust youre of the same mind
yeah of course but theres more than just jungby at stake weve got to stop by the nearby villages first those thugsll try to beat us to them and theyll loot massacre and burn them all down if they do weve gotta get there first and lend the locals a hand in locking the villages down and fortifying their defenses
absolutely we mustnt neglect our knightly duties to the people especially not at a time like this good point alec
actually that was all oifeys idea that kids every bit the tactician they say he is give him a few years and hell be a match for his old grandpa lord sesar
oifeys still around the castle huh  oifey i know youre here you can come out now
my apologies for still being here sire still if you would allow it id like to join you in battle i cant just sit back while you risk your lives
i dont know  youre still so young are you sure youre ready for this
im already fourteen sire i may not be battle ready just yet but theres still so much i can do to support you please allow me to accompany you i swear i wont let you down
fair enough oifey after all youve already spent two years training as my squire real battlefield experience would be fantastic for your training but youre still definitely not up to actual combat duty for now how about you ride with me as my advisor instead
y yes thank you sire thank you
milord what of the the defense of chalphy itself in our absence leaving the castle unattended is risky should the enemy slip past us an unguarded castle will fall easily and spell us a swift end

mm and by the look of it sigurds staring down the entire verdane army with just a handful of men bet hell be glad for the help but geez azelle i cant believe i let you drag me into yet another mess like this
with the war in isaach going on theres hardly anyone left to defend grannvale sigurds few knights are all we have and theyre out here risking their lives on behalf of the entire country i couldnt just leave them to die 
heh  we both know theres more to it than that come on azelle whats the real reason were here
er  i  i have no idea what you mean
its that lady aideen of jungby isnt it come on everybody knows you like her you just came for her sake didnt you
n no of course not you dolt
really then whys your face beet red looks like somebodys got a giiiiiiirlfriend
l lex knock it off come on weve wasted enough time
hahaha got it time to teach these verdanite thugs a lesson or two
good we arent too late i pray sigurd is still unhurt
mm im sure my brothers doing just fine out here but it wont be easy without a magic user in his ranks i want to do all i can as a healer to help out and save lives  quan im sorry i dragged you into this mess as well  i know chalphy isnt my family anymore now that were married but i couldnt just sit back and do nothing thank you so much for coming not just from me but from sigurd
theres no need for thanks ethlyn sigurd is every bit as important to me as he is you remember he is my brother in law now after all  and i couldnt possibly leave you to fight all alone
thank you dear  thank you so much 
milord milady we should hurry lord sigurd still awaits us on the battlefield just ahead
sire theres a young knight collapsed over there
oh  thats midir midir hold on what happened here
uh  you   lord  sigurd
are you alright midir wheres aideen
i  dont know but gandolf 
gandolf  thats all i need to hear midir ill do all i can to rescue her you stay here and rest up
i cant sir ive got to help i cant stand staying here knowing those thugs still have her
dimaggio stuffed up huh shoulda known he was worthless prince gandolfs not gonna like this put the bridge back up boys we aint gonna blow it like dimaggio
when his majesty asked me to observe the battle i hardly expected to see chalphy struggle so against simple barbarians sigurd  so this is all youve amounted to 
sire weve completed our search of the castle lady aideen is nowhere to be found
blast  where could she be
she was most likely taken deeper into verdane before we arrived  i hope shes alright
gah  i wont let them get away with this  they can run but until they surrender aideen they wont escape me
sire an envoy from his majesty is seeking an audience with you
lord sigurd your performance in this battle was outstanding his majesty is highly pleased and has thus proclaimed your ordination as a paladin of the realm
i hardly deserve such an honor sir i pledge my undying fealty to his majesty
from here it is imperative that you hold evans we can ill afford to lose such a valuable defensive point to the enemy you and your men shall be handsomely paid for your service provided of course that our territory survives unscathed best of luck lord sigurd grannvale expects every man to do his duty
oh thank the gods were saved we cant thank you enough here   the whole village did their bit to raise some money for you its not much but we hope it helps out there be sure to lend the other villagese a hand too i bet theyll be happy to help you our right back
pay attention kid weapons arent created equal see swords best axes axes best lances and lances best swords this right heres why youve gotta use your head before you blunder into battle speaking of battle if you ever find yourself hurting out there a chapel is the best place to go it aint free mind every bit of health you regain therell cost five gold pieces but you cant put a price on your health
oh you came to save us i was so sure this was the end take this little trinket its the least i can do they call it a speed ring slip this magic band on and youll be as nimble as a feather go on try her out your enemiesll be too slow to hit you
the master archers of house jungby all bear descent from the archery god ulir our noble duke lord ring has twin daughters as well as a younger son alas the duke lost one of the girls to pirates years and years ago  she was just a little lass  lady aideens still here but the son lord andorey is away with his lord father on the isaach campaign rumor has it though that the two arent getting along well now that the boys grown 
the lords of this land house chalphy have been revered as most magnificent swordsmen for generations its no wonder being that they bear the bloodline of baldr the god of light of old those verdane thugs are lucky lord byron isnt around with his holy sword tyrfing they wouldnt stand a chance
lord sigurd im so relieved to see youre unharmed
azelle azelle of velthomer what are you doing here
im here with lex we want to do whatever we can to fight the verdanite invasion please allow us to fight by your side we wont let you down
of course i couldnt ask for better help but what of your brother lord arvis is he alright with you helping out
no  hes been tasked with command of the royal guard he made it clear that i wasnt supposed to leave belhalla at all
did he now i can only imagine the scolding that youll be in for later
i know this is a dreadful thing to say but to be honest im terrified of arvis  sometimes when im around him i  i feel as if im only a nuisance to him
is that right  well whatever your reasons im just glad that youre here azelle youre more than welcome to stay for as long as you want
thank you sir
wow hes just like all the rumors say hes nothing like arvis 
its been a while huh lord sigurd
lex i take it youre here to help as well
yeah azelle dragged me into it i swear i cant say no to that twerp
hahaha  you havent changed a bit have you lex but what about your father lord langobalt does he know youve come here
oh hell no you know as well as i how much my father loathes yours theres no way hed ever let me help house chalphy even if his life depended on it i had to slip out behind his back just so were clear sigurd im not here for you azelles my best friend and he really wanted to help thats all
heh a bit harsh but thanks for coming all the same any help is greatly appreciated
well ill do what i can those verdane dogs have had their run of our land for long enough
sigurd glad to see you in one piece
quan what are you 
we heard about the verdane attack and couldnt just leave you be were here to do what we can
but what about leonster arent your hands full there keeping an eye on thracia
indeed thats why finn is the only knight here with me the lanceritter are all back at home under fathers command
is that so  quan im sorry for pulling you into this mess too i know youre 
sorry surely you jest sigurd dont you recall our old pledge
hm
come now how could you forget all those years ago when we were students at the belhalla academy you me and eldigan dear friends and fierce rivals in equal measure surely you recall that night talking late about our hopes and dreams and pledging our aid to one another in times of need
ah of course i remember it well
excellent now shall we with both of us here what hope could those verdanite savages possibly have never forget sigurd im here for you now and forever ill not let you lose to these lowlives
sigurd oh youre unharmed
its great to see you too ethlyn thanks so much for coming
i just couldnt stay away when i heard of verdanes attacks  its such a relief to know youre okay
oh come now did you really think i was about to lose to verdane
id heard that chalphy barely has any soldiers left behind given that most of the army is away in isaach and lets face it i cant remember the last time you didnt just leap straight into a crisis without thinking with father away at war  i knew i had to come someone has to save you from yourself after all
heh heh wow it feels as if i was getting this very lecture only yesterday i swear after mother passed away it was you who single handedly kept us in check once you went off to marry quan we couldve sworn that father finally had a proper little lady for a daughter  but no nothings changed at all i feel so sorry for quan  ahahaha
sigurd im only what you and father made me if im a fusspot then its squarely your fault perhaps if the two of you hadnt been so unkempt 
heh perhaps youre right listen ethlyn  we might not act like it but everything youve done means the world to us im so sorry for all the trouble ive always caused you  and thank you so much for coming
sigurd 
it has been too long master sigurd
lord arvis why are you 
his majesty is concerned and he bade me to come and observe he also entrusted me with this   a gift for you
this is  a silver sword a gift from his majesty oh what an honor lord arvis be sure to pass my deepest gratitude for this onto the king
very well incidentally sigurd rumor has it that my brother azelle is among your forces i presume this is true
mm sorry about that it sounded as if he came behind your back but i couldnt turn him away if at all possible would you mind if he remained with me for a while longer
i see  so long as you keep him safe then he and i may have different mothers but azelle is still my only brother id prefer if he remained by my side but perhaps this is how it must be  ill entrust azelle to you sigurd be sure that he learns from this experience
you can leave it to me lord arvis once were done here ill do what i can to convince him to go home
good to hear it now i must return to his majestys side in the capital im entrusting this crisis to you sigurd
oh gods  azelle  he 
hes dead isnt he
im so sorry arvis  i couldnt do a thing to save him 
oh azelle  you careless fool 
cmon you grannvale cowards come at me ill crush the lot of you
no  this aint right 
go to hell you grannvale dogs
oi wait a sec no bows you coward that aint a fair fight
oh shut up let lady aideen go now
ahahaha  too bad for you  killing me aint gonna free your dame  prince gandolfs already  urgh 
/***EOF***/
the final battle for control of grannvale sent its most powerful figures to the grave just as he had planned this left arvis as the sole ruling power of the kingdom
opposition from silesse and leonster was swiftly crushed and so arvis unified all jugdral under grannvales rule with overwhelming support from his subjects arvis thus became the first emperor of the grannvale empire
seventeen years have passed since the battle of belhalla  the adoring public who once welcomed the rise of emperor arvis now struggle under his oppressive dictatorial rule and across jugdral in the other realms now dominated by grannvale their people have been reduced to living as little more than slaves to the empires whims
in the former kingdom of isaach grannvales harsh rule tortures the isaachian people king dannan the appointed king of isaach is a brutal and unforgiving tyrant just like his late father duke langobalt while dannan himself lives an indulgent life at the rivough palace the people remain little more than slaves to the empire his second son johan rules isaach castle while his youngest johalvier rules sophara and the remote ganeishire region is governed by dannans trusted confidant general harold under their rule isaach knows no freedom 
however one last hope remains for isaach tirnanog an isolated village in isaachs far north  there prince shannan works to raise a liberation army whose strength grows with each passing day among these proud young warriors is a young man dubbed the heir of light by the people of isaach and revered as the rightful prince of the grannvale empire he is the brave young leader of the liberation army his name is seliph
harold have you ferreted out the rebels yet or are you content to leave them unchecked for the rest of their days shannan and his rebel ilk are growing stronger by the day now they hamper us at every turn and as if that wasnt enough they harbor the spawn of sigurd the traitor the very existence of this scum utterly defiles the authority of the isaachian throne how do you expect me to explain this sorry state to his imperial majesty
a thousand apologies your highness but everything is already under control the rebel hideout has been found and even as we speak an army is on its way to crush them those vile mice have nowhere else to run by sundown not a single rebel will still be breathing
hm very well but be warned harold dont even think of underestimating them most of the rebels are too young to pose a threat but they still have oifey and shannan those two alone are extremely dangerous dismissing them would be a fatal mistake
yes sir im aware but ive already had tirnanog the rebel hideout surveyed in secret and it appears that neither are anywhere in sight its safe to assume them to be currently absent sir
what then why are we still talking about this send the order to move in on tirnanog immediately the people of isaach are treating these rebels like some kind of heroes of freedom  but its high time they learned the error of their ways kill them all of them ill be waiting back at rivough i expect nothing but good news
we have a problem lord seliph looks like the empires finally caught onto our whereabouts  a brigades set out from ganeishire and they seem to be headed our way
ugh scáthach why so surprised did you really think our little hideout wouldnt be found out sooner or later let them come i say it only makes the battle easier for us its the easiest thing to just walk right over ganeishire and pick them off as we go
youve gotta be kidding prince shannans still off trying to find the yied shrine and oifey and the others arent back yet its just us two against an entire army surely even you cant think thisll end well
i dont care you can sit here and be as scared witless as you want but im not letting a chance like this pass the prince still treats us like helpless children but come on weve had more than enough training were ready for real action
but 
im  im not gonna run away anymore im sick to death of sitting here while those monsters butcher our friends or worse  the empires thugs are still out there snagging any girl they see  if prince shannan hadnt come for me that day id be just another one of em dead or wishing i was  i wont forgive or forget their plan
no thats not it larcei  youre right its horrible and all but 
youre wary of engaging the enemy out of concern for my safety arent you scáthach most likely i presume shannan would have given you strict orders to keep me safe after all if shannan had not given such an order youd already be out there in the fray to not be thirsting for a good battle just isnt the scáthach i know
oh  thats  thats right sorry sir i was hoping we didnt have to involve you 
im no child anymore either larcei if you two plan to fight then i plan to fight by your side theres more at stake today than only the resistance what of tirnanog we owe so much to its people i refuse to abandon them at such a critical hour
but 
weve no time to waste debating this lana stay behind and help the citizens well engage the foe in the western gully
wait milord im coming too
i cannot permit that lana a cleric such as yourself is ill suited for such a battlefield
this is my fight too you wont convince me any more than you could convince larcei every day i think the empire cant get any more cruel and every day im proven wrong they prey on the weak and vulnerable as if snuffing out their lives is a sport to them  i cant sit quietly and accept this i may not be able to fight but ive my own way of defending everyone
hm  my apologies lana you are absolutely right the battle for isaachs freedom rests upon all of us very well we shall all go together how this will turn out i cannot say  but we owe it to all of isaach to give this battle no less than our best
yes milord and er  sorry i shouldnt have spoken so brashly
ha youve nothing to apologize for now scáthach larcei lana  the time has come move out
were too late the battle has already begun 
i guess news of tirnanog seliph and all that mustve leaked while we were off scouting i hope everyones doing alright 
most of themll be fine lester but what about your sister what if lanas gone and gotten herself mixed up in the fighting she cant defend herself at all if shes out in the open like this sir we should hurry back the sooner get back to lord seliphs side the better
indeed come dermott lester the battlefield awaits us
by the gods ive never seen such ruin its as if ganeishire never even existed 
been a while hasnt it seliph
hm oh lewyn er pardon me  your majesty king lewyn of silesse 
just lewyn seliph  like ive always been silesse is just another imperial conquest now  thats all its been since the mess in belhalla and meanwhile here i am still living a pathetic shameful life for all to see at least my mother faced silesses demise and her own with pride and dignity but me nope im still just an idiot bard  dont listen to what oifey says of me seliph just please  dont call me a king ever again
i  my apologies lewyn 
heh its fine dont worry about it more importantly looks like youve finally got this revolution thing started theres no place more fitting than isaach to start fighting back against the empire
indeed the courage of isaachs people is matched only by the pain and anger the empire has inflicted upon them all were missing now is for prince shannan to return and join the fray himself
he ran off to follow some rumor didnt he
mm rumor has it his birthright as heir to the isaach throne the holy sword balmung is being kept in a shrine in the aed desert as i understand it the entire desert region is ruled by an evil priest i trust shannans might but i cannot help but worry for his safety 
eh if anyone can do it itll be shannan actually seliph ive a favor to ask of you
oh if it is within my power ill gladly help what is it
julia could you come over here
see i found her years ago in belhalla when she was just a little girl hurt pretty badly since then ive been looking after her in a hidden little corner of silesse at least until we had to get out a while back as the empire set about tightening its grip the thing is ive got things that need doing over in leonster and at this point shes just slowing me down
i hate to impose on you seliph but i dont have much of a choice could i just leave her with your group for a while i still dont know what happened to her but it mustve been pretty awful poor thing back when i first found her she couldnt remember a thing about what happened it looks like she still cant 
i see  very well you can trust me with her lewyn however i must ask that you return for her as soon as possible she likely wont feel too comfortable in an army of strangers
deal heh ill probably be back here by the time youve finished freeing isaach good luck seliph
may the gods be with you as well lewyn
listen julia  i know itll be hard for you without lewyn here but i promise youll be alright until lewyn returns i swear ill let no harm come to you  i know ive still much to learn and as yet im not all that strong  but one day  someday i know ill be strong enough to protect us all someday ill have the strength to defend all the worlds people from the empires wrath someday ill be strong as my father once was 
seliph 
the rebels have taken over ganeishire gah harold you moron what in the blazes are my sons doing somebody tell them to take the rebels down now
dads ordering us to attack huh isnt larcei in that army damn  what do i do how can i fight her 
were to strike ganeisire are we my my  fathers got quite the temper but i could never lay so much as a finger on larcei even if she is among my foes  ahh  what a dilemma standing before me 
phew sorry mahnya i know a load like this isnt easy on you
hah mahnya is that really what you call your pegasus
oh pipe down arthur i dont care if were nearly there cause ill still just dump you if you dont shut it
er right sorry about that say fee i dont have too far to go if you want i can just walk from here
where are you off to anyway
oh just alster
a alster geez youre dumber than i thought alsters waaay south of here theres an entire sea in the way for crying out loud i dunno what youre thinking but you havent got a hope in heck of walking the rest of the way there
eh its fine im hardly in a hurry
so er why do you need to go to alster
oh see ive got a sister i havent seen in years who might be there she and my mom were taken away when i was just a kid i was sort of left alone in some far corner of silesse or another i just heard a rumor but at this point even a rumors enough if it means i might find her
huh really yknow just what thats like my big brothers been missing for ages
did you get separated from him as well
oh no nothing that bad weve always lived together in silesse but a while back he ran off to try and find our dad
your father huh
yeah hes been missing for years mom spent the rest of her life waiting for him to come back but he never did 
what happened to her
she  shes dead illness 
oh er  sorry about that i shouldnt have brought it up 
its okay i mean youve already brought up lots of things that you shouldnt have heh kidding youre actually not that bad
heh heh thanks and thanks for giving me a chance and letting me come along
no problem so was the sister thing real is that actually why youre travelling
yeah its real but what about you whats your deal
actually i kinda want to join that isaachian rebel army when i was little mom told me stories about the paladin sigurd and his brave allies and those have always meant a lot to me lately ive been hearing about how sigurds sons somewhere in isaach raising a revolution and it all just sort of clicked yknow i knew thats where i need to be so i just ran right out of home to try and find him
wow  thats pretty great of you yknow i think ill help you out here for a while its the least i can do for you putting up with me
okay partners it is then good luck out there  partner
heh upbeat as ever arent you
what in the blazes was that just when i thought my son cant get any more useless he goes and forgets how to fight schmidt get out there take back my castles now
yes sir you can depend on me
oh gods bless you lord seliph sophara is free once more thanks to you
is everyone unharmed sir
indeed and overjoyed to see you to boot
thank you i swear to you before this day is done king dannan will be no more and isaach shall belong to its rightful people
freedom  oh the word is tonic to my ears please take care of yourself out there lord seliph you are the last and greatest hope for the future of this world and all its people only you lord seliph possess the power to free this world from the grip of darkness 
ohh lord seliph sir glad to see youre okay
is everyone unharmed sir
indeed and ecstatic to see you to boot thanks to you lord seliph we know that at long last isaach shall have its freedom
thank you sir but the effort isnt mine alone i could never have come so far without the support of the common man youve all supported me from the beginning i likely wouldnt be here if not for you
fate is a funny thing isnt it sir just twenty years ago our late king had the utmost trust in your grandfathers wisdom then your father came to protect prince shannan and now the prince has guided you to adulthood perhaps fate has bound isaach and chalphy as one 
mm isaach is the only home ive ever known and prince shannan is like a brother to me i pray our friendship lasts the rest of our lives
lord seliph you are the rightful heir to house belhalla and the throne of grannvale not a soul alive in isaach nor in the rest of the world can doubt this we beg of you raise the banner of justice high march on belhalla and reclaim your true throne
lord johalvier has some weird tastes lusting after such a fierce broad really heh  i prefer my women a little more  wait why am i telling you this
ugh  i dont get lord johan he bends over backwards to please every last bit of skirt yet here hes so bloody harsh on us
is that a morsel of gossip i hear soldier
n no sir nothing to report here sir
julia youre safe oh thank heavens 
mm  the enemy seized and imprisoned me here but i knew  i knew you would rescue me no matter what
a job well done seliph thanks to you isaach is free from the empires grip
lewyn are you already finished in leonster
yeah  i only just got back now look seliph are you aware that right now this worlds at a critical turning point
hm no  im afraid not
its been fifteen years since arvis conquered all of jugdral and united it as the grannvale empire honestly for a while at first it wasnt all that bad in the empires dawn emperor arvis sought to bind his nation using only the strictures of law sure it was strict and constraining but we still got a good few years of peace out of it but obviously he changed his mind a few years back as if by magic the empire turned into that oppressive force we all know and love today even worse  the ancient heretics of the loptr church have arisen from the shadows once more and raised influence across the land their murderous rituals have returned with them and all across jugdral they abduct children to sacrifice in droves to resurrect their fell god all attempts to resist the empire are crushed and met with brutal executions or enslavement it couldnt be plainer that they seek to return jugdral to the days of brutal control by that ancient abomination the loptyrian empire
this cannot be happening ive heard all the rumors saying the same but  never did i think they could be more than rumors 
by the look of it isaach hasnt had it quite as bad as most dannans two sons at least refused to follow through on the child hunts
 
of course theres always been people trying to rebel against the empire left right and center but they were all scattered and disorganized before you none have ever posed a proper threat to the empire they were all swiftly crushed before they could so much as blink jugdral desperately needs a savior it needs a man to unite behind in the name of liberty and im pretty sure that man is you seliph youre the only one who stands a chance
hold on a moment are you sure of this a savior would require power i sorely lack 
chalk it up to duty seliph youre the eldest child of empress deirdre  that makes you the elder brother to the crown prince julius youre the one true heir to saint heim your destiny is to unite the power of the crusaders of this era and free the world from this evil grip
but 
trust me you really do have what it takes your true power and potential sleeps within you that is the sacred blood of the crusader baldr once you get your holy blade tyrfing not even the heavens will be able to stand in your way
but i 
sorry seliph but thats how the gods will it youre sigurds son the son of a man who fate led to a brutal end the fulfillment of his dying wishes and his final quest falls to you you cant afford to go doubting yourself now you understand seliph
y yes  yes i do if this is fate and the will of the gods then so be it i will do my duty
there actually isnt a single absolute fate nor is there just one person it all hinges upon as obtuse as that sounds trust me one day itll make sense sigurd left behind so much to help you on your quest most importantly the many friendships he forged in his life  me for instance brave youths from all over are already lining up to join your cause all guided by sigurds kindness
mm my father won the love and trust of so many people from all walks of life i can only pray that in time ill prove my worthiness to his legacy
youll be fine anyway to business our immediate goal now is to reach leonster the son of quan your fathers closest friend raised his own rebellion only to suffer severe losses hes in pretty urgent need of backup i know youve had no time to rest but we need to get going as soon as possible for now at least we can leave isaach in the care of its citizens odds are well run into prince shannan on our way
understood
king dannans got three sons the oldest brian lives at the old family home in grannvale the younger two serve him here in isaach johan controls isaach castle while johalvier controls sophara castle theyre both kind of an odd sort and theyve both got this obsession with someone in your army called larcei always squabbling they are  i dunno though neither of them are all that bad really heck i bet theyd want to join forces with you
prince shannan is our beacon of hope for isaachs future once he returns with his divine blade balmung in hand  well those imperial sods wont stand a chance at all every last one of them will be run right out of our great land
every last citizen of isaach believes in and trusts lord seliph we owe his family dearly for how his father long ago rescued and helped raise our prince shannan
yknow the liberation armys leader seliph they say hes the rightful heir to grannvale i bet wed all have a much better time with him on the throne if that were true huh here take this here skill ring go on do your best were all behind you
ooh arent ya from that liberators army glad ta see yer makin a stand now this is great news with yall around weve finally got a shot at makin them imperial cowards run outta here with their tails between their legs
ohhh if it isnt lord seliph himself we cant thank you enough for all your help here allow me to give you my granddaughters hand in marriage we raised her as well as well can be and shes the kindest sweetest little thing oh i remember that even as a kid she 
grandpa knock it off ugh this is so embarrassing  im sorry lord seliph i wouldnt wish seeing that sorry display upon anyone but er  if you do like me milord 
er  wait a moment  that isnt why im here 
ahahahaha cmon lord seliph its just a joke a j o k e look youve gone bright red how adorable
er 
im completely serious though
oh oh dear 
ive been hearing a lot about how the empires been hunting kids in all those other countries  thanks to you lot isaachs free from the empire at last but the rest of the worlds still in a really dark place  all across jugdral theyre all waiting for lord seliph to rise up and defeat the empire please im begging you  youve gotta make it to grannvale soon
you holding up okay so far larcei
yeah im getting by fine 
just be careful out here okay your usual brazen anticsll only get you in trouble now
i know i know i know what do you think im still a child
heh  man that iron will of yours guess youre just like mom was if what prince shannans told us is true
yeah  ayra  i cant remember a thing about her you
no of course not were twins remember if you were too young to remember then so was i we werent even two years old yet back then  it was oifey who took us with him when he fled to isaach with seliph we waited and waited but mom never followed  i guess she didnt make it out of the battle of belhalla alive 
scáthach you swore youd never say awful things like that mom is alive alive im sure of it dont you dare say otherwise ever again
 er sorry larcei  youre right  im sorry
you holding up okay so far radney
yeah im getting by fine 
just be careful out here okay your usual brazen anticsll only get you in trouble now
i know i know i know what do you think im still a child
so er  how about johan and johalvier then i just dont get either of ‘em
ugh  them theyre driving me mad creeps like them are why men are the absolute worst they make me feel sick
hey easy there not all men are like that youve let the imperial soldiers treatment of you make you hate all mean for no reason
wow you dont say i know its irrational but for crying out loud just being near a mans enough to turn my stomach now
every man
er i guess you and lord seliph are okay
heh heh  what about shannan then
ugh rodolbahn
lana dont tell me youre fighting too
i am lester i simply couldnt bear to leave lord seliph to fight alone 
why am i not surprised  look i know i cant get you to leave but just be careful okay itd break mothers heart if something happened to you out here
i know but actually there was something mother told me  she told me that we owe the greatest of debts to the people of isaach and that if we can help them in any way we owe it to them to do all we can
yeah i guess shes right i mean we wouldnt even be here now if not for the help of the locals   so er where is mother anyway
shes back in tirnanogs abbey working like always
right  listen lana weve got to give this battle our all both in mothers name and in the name of our lost father  someday i know well finally be able to help mother return to her home jungby 
youre right lester
mana dont tell me youre fighting too
i am dimna i simply couldnt bear to leave lord seliph to fight alone 
heh  why am i not surprised 
w what do you mean
oh nothing  just er dont get too invested in him you know lord seliphs a grannvale prince right hes as lofty a noble as they come lets face it peasants like usd ordinarily have no business being anywhere near him i just dont want to see you get hurt 
you  youve got the wrong idea dimna all i want is to protect lord seliph and to make sure he survives this war okay
oh er thats fine then sorry mana im just really concerned for you 
yes i know  thank you dimna
oh thank the gods sire youre safe
oifey glad to see you made it back what news of the rest of the world
the empires grip is tightening still further as if trying to choke life from the people its inciting doomed revolts all across jugdral
so its as i thought  it isnt as if the empires tyranny would ever be limited to only isaach  oifey is it feasible to assist them
not as we presently stand sire we still lack the strength to properly challenge the empire
then what of our present battle the war for isaachs freedom has already begun turning back now would be impossible 
mm theres certainly no chance of returning you to hiding sire now that your whereabouts have been leaked starting the fight now was reckless but weve no choice but to continue 
oifey im sorry i let all of this happen behind your back but we had no choice even so i dont think i could have stood letting isaach suffer under dannans thumb any longer i trust you understand oifey 
i do sire now our priority is to lay siege to dannans capital rivough with all due haste dannan must fall before the empire can send him reinforcements we cannot afford to wait
julia right hello there are you doing okay without lewyn

/***EOF***/
seliphs long journey is drawing to a close his armys victories are a beacon of hope to the empires victims and a wave of further rebellions sweeps across jugdral first silesse was wrestled back from imperial control by its citizens and soon after agustrias people flocked to arms burning to fight for their country
but grannvale itself yet stands duke brian of dozel and the axe knights of the grau ritter duke scorpio of jungby and his elite archers the beige ritter and freeges queen hilda and the war mages of the gelb ritter stand between seliph and the capital belhalla itself lurks under an eerie silence as ishtar and the enigmatic twelve deadlords lie in wait to defend prince julius himself
over a year has passed since that fateful first battle in isaach the tragic struggle pitting kin versus kin wears on splitting the twelve crusaders between the light and the dark  so begins the final holy war 
father died you say 
the emperor had long served his purpose your majesty he was little more than an obstacle to your ambitions he had to die
pfeh i almost feel sorry for him all his life he was your tool manfroy only to be thrown away so casually 
all in your empires name your majesty arvis was a lost cause to think he a man of loptouss blood dared to challenge the revival of the empire the righteous heart of the crusader vala burned too fiercely within him it was only a matter of time until he turned on you
i know i know  now then i hear those rebels have stumbled as far as chalphy are our defenses really that pathetic
rest assured ive already tasked eddas bishop rodan and brian of dozel with purging chalphy of those vermin youve no need to worry your majesty
dont i now  wheres julia
she awaits her end in the dungeon  you there bring us princess julia
 
ah julia its been a while hasnt it tell me do you know who i am
julius  my brother julius 
oho so you do still remember i can hardly believe seven long years have passed since you slipped away
i  that night is seared into my memory clear as if it were only yesterday 
fehehe  good i trust you remember your mothers final kindness as well
who  no what are you that night  the night manfroy came with that eerie black tome  nothing was ever the same again my real brother the kind and caring boy i once knew and loved so died that night in his place stood a demon of terrifying power  my brother in name only you  you monster  youve taken my mother and my brother from me who are you what are you why  why must you torment us all so
i am the heir of loptouss kin and the inheritor of his limitless power this world belongs rightfully to me and you julia you are the heiress to the power of naga my eternal foe i cannot allow you to live any longer
hold a moment your majesty i believe i have a use for this girls power if i may spare her and leave her to me
using nagas power to serve me interesting  very interesting very well i must return to belhalla julia is yours manfroy but be warned be extremely careful even a single mistake with her could cost me dearly
his majesty has issued his command priest and sellsword units defend edda itself with your very lives cavalry unit move in on chalphy reclaim our land from the rebels
this is it seliph the final holy war begins now
a holy war
yeah thats what this is julius is descended from loptyrian royalty and hes been working to revive the dark empire no matter what it takes we must stop him
it feels as if you know everything lewyn im beginning to feel left out  please what in the world are you talking about
yeah sorry about that seliph i know theres a lot ive not been telling you ive spent over a decade on a journey to figure out the truth behind all this and im finally onto a hidden bigger picture here
 the bigger picture
it seems the old loptyrian empires founder the bishop galle dedicated his youth to a world exploring voyage across the seas he desired nothing less than to drink the blood of a legendary beast even a single drop he believed would bestow upon any human limitless power
do  do you mean the dragonkin of old it couldnt be  is that not a myth
youd think so but  when galle returned to jugdral he bore bizarre powers nobody else understood with these powers he set to work swaying youths across the land to aid his ambitions before anyone else realized hed raised a fell legion unflinchingly loyal to his cause
where then does loptous enter the tale
odds are loptous was a dragon himself every last one of galles heirs has borne the blood of the dragonkin the dark powers loptouss kin command are nothing more than the dragonkins powers
and what of the crusaders
im sure you know how the legend goes the gods descended upon twelve warriors of the old liberators at the fortress of darna but 
but
sorry seliph but thisll have to wait the enemys just about on our doorstep
edda huh  father claude would be so happy to know his homeland is finally free 
mm  father claude gave his life for my fathers cause but his children 
oh of course claudes son and claudes daughter theyre going to be great rulers for edda and after all theyve been through i know thatll bring a smile to the peoples faces
its time fisher your unit will move in on edda at once ill lead the assault on chalphy personally against the full force of dozels legendary axe knights the grau ritter the rebels stand no chance theyll drop like leaves
at once milord
what a bloody disgrace  how could a pack of idiots like house dozel be of crusader heritage if it werent for langbalt the world wouldnt be in such a mess 
lewyn i cannot wait much longer just where did the crusaders power come from what in the world are these gods
i cant say for sure  but whatever they were they realized that our lands misery was caused by the power of the dragonkin and so they came to jugdral from some other world to save the human race it was they who suddenly appeared at darna just as its doom seemed certain
that would be the legendary descent of naga and the eleven gods found in scripture yes
yeah they say the gods took human shapes naga the light god appeared as a little girl while the fire god salamand was an old man with twelve chosen warriors the gods bound themselves in a blood covenant
a blood covenant
basically the gods drew their own blood with a scratch to the fingertip and presented it to the warriors
 i beg your pardon
long story short they were dragons the gods we know only from scripture they were all of the dragonkin just like loptous with a single taste of the blood of dragons these once humble warriors of the liberation army were reborn as the twelve crusaders each dragon presented to their crusader a weapon steeped in their own power and then with some final parting words of wisdom to the crusaders the dragonkin departed jugdral
i see  so our power is in truth that of dragons 
now loptous himself is actually from a dragon clan whose fell power is amongst the mightiest of all dragonkin the great dragon naga strongest of them all bestowed their own blood upon the leader of the liberation army the priest heim naga knew only their power could possibly hope to stand against that of loptous
so nobody else among the dragonkin would be able to prevail against loptous
it certainly wouldnt be easy i think even if you had every last dragon fighting together theyd still need nagas power this of course means that if were to win today well need the surviving heir to saint heim in other words one of deirdres three children of those three you didnt inherit the full breadth of nagas blood and its pretty obvious that julius didnt actually i only recently learned who it is the inheritor of nagas power is julius twin sister  princess julia
e excuse me
yeah that was more or less my reaction too at first julia is julius twin sister  which also makes her your sister seliph
so all this time  julia was my sister 
i guess now we know why manfroy took her to begin with needless to say seliph weve got to rescue her no matter what we absolutely need julias powers if we want any hope of stopping julius
dozels fallen to the rebels what the hell were my men doing out there feh whyd i ever expect any better worthless cowards the lot of them its time i took this into my own hands all i need is to lure these flies into my web then i can crush them once and for all send scorpius of jungby a messenger pass on to him this plan the gelb ritter will coax the rebels our way leaving them wide open to a deluge of the beige ritters arrows from behind theyll have nowhere to run or hide kill them all no survivors this time
heh the rebels marched right into the trap all too easy men cut through the forest and swarm them from the rear with freege at their front well choke them like a snake on a rat
freege is ours lewyn weve finally made it this far but  i cant help but wonder  are the children at belhalla still unharmed i pray they are 
funny you should say that weve got a visitor whos got a bit of news on that front seliph
and who are you
my name is felipe sire i was once an aide to the late emperor arvis on secret orders from his majesty the abducted children were moved here to freege for safe keeping
what is this true youve saved all of the children
rest easy sire theyre all hiding in the citys abbey and theyre all in good health
and all under hildas nose at that that youve kept every last child safe in hildas own city  color me impressed
actually sire  princess ishtar deserves your thanks without her generous aid given in secret we could never have done this no imperial soldiers dared come even close to the abbey on pain of the princess wrath
princess ishtar but why  why would she 
few people in this land are as kind and caring as princess ishtar all along the princess has toiled behind the scenes to aid our cause it was princess ishtar herself who ensured that every last child escaped from the bowels of belhalla
i see  at any rate thank the gods for their safety im certain everyone will be glad to know the children are in good hands you have my deepest thanks lord felipe
well seliph thats one job done good to see were finally getting some results out of this mess
mm and yet julia still eludes us  where could she possibly be
the only options left now are belhalla and velthomer its got to be one of those two
and belhalla is where julius awaits 
yeah well have to find julia first if we want to go anywhere near belhalla without julias power on our side we wont have a hope in hell against julius
but no matter whats happened julius is still her brother will she even want to fight him 
 youll have to convince her
if i may lord julius id like to lead the weissritter to bolster the capitals defense this will require that i leave your side even for a while i beg your forgiveness
feh why the rush to get out there so suddenly ishtar all the soldiers they could ever throw at us could never so much as scratch me why even bother with those maggots
yes i know  but for me there is no greater pride than being one of frieges great mages my parents and brother lie dead and i cannot stand to leave their murderers to run amok  please  all i ask is a chance for vengeance
it sounds as if what you really want is to join your family in death on a rebels blade are you so desperate to escape me ishtar
no  nothing like that lord julius i love you nothing will ever change that
hmhmhmhmhm  i know very well fight if you must i wont stop you
thank you  now i beg your pardon meng bleg mabel we sortie at once
yes milady
now then i think its time we put an end to this sorry show deadlords move out and someone order arions unit to attack the time for games is over every last rebel dies here and now
heh heh  the rebels have come to play at last i hear julia why dont you join them purge all those who dare oppose the empire
yes  my lord  your excellency 
we have no home to return to men  but we must keep going nonetheless chalphys fall to our blades shall be the first step to winning back our fatherland now move in show these liberators one final defiance from the wyvern knights of thracia
are we quite certain the book of naga is in fact hidden in velthomer lewyn
yep all the evidence we have points to arvis taking it from belhalla and keeping it hidden here thats right isnt it felipe
indeed sir it should still lie in the treasury that said it is likely sealed in a locked case
huh any idea where its key is
my liege concealed the key within his most treasured memento  the circlet once worn by empress deirdre if we can find that circlet sir then the book of naga is yours
deirdres circlet huh 
oh heirs to the courageous hear my ode to the crusaders of old
hear me brave heirs to the crusaders in your hands lies the task of proving this war to be a holy war of its own if wisdom courage and power be your allies summon them now and give all you have should you wish to prevail this day trust in yourselves to bring forth our destiny one born where the two trails of light meet
this is it tine were getting awfully close to freege  mothers old home
mm but  i have a bad feeling about this how about you
yes i suppose  ive had nothing but hatred for freege ever since they took you and mother all ive ever wanted is to crush them all for all theyve done 
but  what about uncle blume ishtar and ishtore havent i told you about them before they were all decent people at the very least they were always nice to mother and i 
oh right it was hilda who drove mother to her death wasnt it
it was  even after all this time i still hate her so much all i want is to be the one to put an end to her myself 
dont worry tine as long as i live you wont have to deal with anything like that ever again ill protect you no matter what
this is it linda were getting awfully close to freege  mothers old home
mm but  i have a bad feeling about this how about you
yes i suppose  ive had nothing but hatred for freege ever since they took you and mother all ive ever wanted is to crush them all for all theyve done 
say amid  mother betrayed her homeland to ally with sigurd right you wouldnt know why would you
apparently she was really close to her sister who died for sigurds cause thats why she joined the army too
that would be our aunt right
yeah that was aunt tailtiu
wow  she died fighting for her life  thats  thats so sad

gah  were hopeless arent we 
shannaaaaaaaan

er yeah nice to see you too look its lunchtime made it all myself
 what are you doing this is a battlefield not a place for a picnic
but ive got nothing else to do its not like theres anything around here that needs my er light touch
so you thought getting in everyones way in the middle of a war was a good idea
oh  well that was uncalled for  you cant just throw me aside like some old bag and to think i spent all day slaving away in a hot kitchen just to make you lunch  well i guess i wont be doing that again
oh patty  look im sorry i went too far forgive me 
then youll be eating my lunch really oh thats a huge relief  i love you sooooo much shannan
lord seliph 
tine stay back please you are ill suited for the front lines
all i want is to help you lord seliph please  my power is yours
but i  i couldnt bear to lose you 
i wont leave your side lord seliph  the thought of meeting the same fate as lady deirdre  its too painful  please lord seliph ill fight at your side till the very end
youre right  my apologies how could we not be better off fighting as one come tine we ride together your power will bring us victory i know it
lord seliph  thank you
are you alright milord
i am youve no need to worry about me tine but you ought to take care yourself our foes are as fierce as weve ever seen

heh sorry about that i just wanted to say it while i still can id hate to leave it unsaid should something happen 
ced  please be careful 
are you alright asaello listen i know how frustrated you are right now but please you mustnt do anything too rash
gah  if only i had a bit of crusader power too i wouldnt be so bloody useless i cant take this
i know  ive often thought the same but crusader blood wouldnt be the answer to everything think of it this way weve made it so far with them with nothing but our best work we might be common folk but were bold and determined and thats what matters
commoners  and to think everyone around us is lord this or lady that or king the other lifes so unfair
i suppose  but come on cheer up lord or not theres a whole orphanage eagerly awaiting your triumphant return
yeah youre right things really arent all that bad how could they be with you around
heh  oh asaello 
lord seliph 
nanna the battle before us is as brutal as they come please do take extra care

then ill do everything i can to protect you lord seliph ill pray for you just as i always have 
thank you nanna  im so grateful to have you always watching over me  i admit i can even feel your power
youre welcome lord seliph 
say lord leif  how soon do you think this fight will be over
i cannot say for sure  and yet i cannot help but feel our triumph is drawing ever closer
and once this is over i take it well be headed for leonster
indeed we are the thracian peninsula has known naught but strife for decades and to unify it was my fathers dream ill pledge my life to fulfill his grand vision and id have nothing more than to have you by my side every step of the way nanna
of course lord leif ill be by your side forevermore wherever your path leads even to the very ends of the earth 
lord leif
jeanne didnt i ask you to remain in the castle
but 
im sorry but this battle is far too dangerous for anybody whos not of crusader descent i dont want you fighting today
i know id be a burden if i fought but ive still got my staves remember surely having a cleric would be a good idea
i suppose  but stay clear of any danger do i make myself clear new thracia still needs you  i still need you i couldnt live with myself if i let you die 
yes lord leif 
you need to be careful ares with a task as great as agustrias restoration awaiting you you cant afford to die now
trust me i know ill never let this battle claim my life so long as i still draw breath ill toil till fathers dying dream of a glorious agustria is at last realized
thats the ares i know and love both lord eldigan and my mother would be so very of you im sure of it
but even one such as i could never do it alone ill always need you nanna
and ill always be with you ares i refuse to make the same mistake mother made all those years ago 
mistake was  was aunt lachesis in love with my father
she was then again i suppose he was only her half brother
and come to think of it we are only cousins are we not
heh  its no wonder were together

thats enough arion why why in the world do you still refuse to see reason
altena
how could you be so craven how dare you place your own vanity and pride over what truly matters
what do you want from me then
take a good hard look at prince seliph ask yourself this why is he still fighting for whom is he out here day after day setting his own suffering to the side
so seliph fights for justice and i somehow do not is that what youre trying to say 
very well arion  if you wont see reason so be it come on kill me end this my  my life is in your hands arion  i die with no regrets
a altena  very well you can rest easy now i get it i was wrong  my mercenary days are at an end and my final task is with seliph  wait no  with you i now fight for you altena
say lord seliph ive got an idea how about i go scout out the enemy
no that would be too great a risk this battle is nothing like anything weve yet seen i dont want you leaving my side
fine 
er  are you worried about silesse fee
just a little i guess ive heard rumors about how theres some fighting there
indeed its citizens have staged their own revolt against the empire from what i hear theyve already made impressive progress
really oh thats such a relief 
would you like to return to silesse fee
thanks but no thanks the best place for me is to be by your side lord seliph
really well thank you fee its an honor and a pleasure to hear it
i dont ever want to leave you lord seliph  this is like a dream come true 
say oifey ive got an idea how about i go scout out the enemy
sorry fee but i must object their lines are crawling with archers willing to shoot down any pegasi
so er oifey 
 yes
yknow i actually think its really great i mean how all your life youve lived just for lord seliph always putting yourself second
mm  i confess that in a way those of us who survived the old war never truly wished to survive  but we had our own mission painful as it was to leave our friends to their doom  your parents among them
yknow thanks to this war im starting to get my mom and dad a bit and what they had to deal with  i never really knew them much  and im really glad i had you to tell me more about them oifey
thank you  i feel ive always been indebted to lady erin for all the help she gave me back then it is a privilege to help her daughter
um  yknow oifey i kinda wish i knew how to act a bit more er adulty i think theres a lot i could learn from you
all in good time fee little by little life itself will teach you what adulthood is
oh come on i cant just let you get all old on me before i can catch up
whoa whoa settle down fee 
whatcha doing arthur
well for one im fighting the big hint here is the tome im holding  and youre still as flighty as ever i see
well hello to you too
and there you go people are busy and you just sulk this sort of things why nobody 
 will ever like me at all thats what youre saying right well i dont have to stand here and listen to this garbage
no wait what im trying to say is you sort of give people the wrong impression but i like you  youre really important to me
a arthur  stop kidding around 
fee i always want to be with you you know that as soon as this wars over well go back to silesse  together

/***EOF***/
with the liberation of the peninsulas north seliphs liberation army aoccupies meath castle as their headquarters uncertain of how to next act beyond meath and the engulfing maw of its peaks lies the wyvern knights kingdom thracia this rural nation is ruled by king travant who remains bound in coalition to emperor arvis thracia is the only state anywhere in jugdral regarded as an ally by the grannvale empire
his children altena and arion at the capital the legendary general hannibal dubbed thracias shield at kapathogia castle the kings trusted advisor general distler at luthecia castle and a loptyrian agent from the empire bishop judah at grutia castle travant has fortified his kingdom for one final full scale showdown with the liberators
thracias people hardly offer seliph an eager welcome fearing seliph as a conqueror they flock in droves to take up arms themselves how could any justice lie in this conflict for whose sake is this war being fought for the first time these questions now shake both seliph and his armys resolve to the core 
altena what was that sorry display why pray tell is munster still standing
father  i 
ive no interest in any more excuses dont you dare belittle me altena you are a warrior beyond compare and you and arion embody my will beyond these walls i expect no less than for you to do your duty and what do i find instead youve ignored my orders left an entire platoon to the slaughter and strolled home as if nothing ever happened ive never been more disappointed 
im sorry father but at least let me explain i could never agree with such tactics which enrich us at the expense of everybody else how could you ever expect the proud thracian people to accept prosperity built on the bones of others please father rethink your ways
enough altena theres no place here for such meddling still your tongue and obey father father bear in mind altena is still young and unseasoned i suspect she merely found the last battle too overwhelming a prospect please do forgive her even just this once
you know arion if youd just hold back on the coddling perhaps altena wouldnt be so stubborn look altena ill give you one last chance take a dracoknight platoon and retake meath if you so much as slip again then daughter be damned i will accept no excuses understood
yes father 
whew  family resemblance indeed its plainly obvious that she loathes me 
father you have to remember that shes still a child like all children she has yet to realize her thoughtless words have real effects
hmph i suppose  im off to kapathogia i hear hannibals found himself some funny ideas about my plans and so it falls to me to ensure he loses those ideas before somebody gets hurt 
ive never seen father so fearful  what could possibly have happened 
general hannibal the rebels have seized control of meath altena is en route to counter attack your armored knights will join her at once
your majesty ive said it a thousand times and ill say it again there is no use fighting this war we must arrange a truce with the liberators if we wish to recover the strength to endure bowing to the empire was a despicable choice to start one which now leaves us serving our citizens to the true enemy on a gilded platter
i did not ask for such dopey nonsense the rebels have slaughtered my soldiers and now theyve stolen our territory the hour is far too late for a truce
i thought as much  very well i suppose i have no choice
whats this hannibal do i hear traitorous rumblings coming from that mouth of yours
come now your majesty never would a warrior such as i consider turning my cloak traitor indeed
really now then i trust you wouldnt object to a test of your warriors loyalty until the war reaches its victorious end hannibal ill be taking care of your son
i beg your pardon your majesty do you have such little faith in me
you have nothing to worry about hannibal if you dont intend to betray me then i dont intend to so much as scratch the boy
why 
men bring me hannibals son
p papa 
oh cairpre  i am so sorry 
remember hannibal you have nothing to worry about so long as you behave yourself as soon as this war is won youll get him back i dont get it though the boy isnt even your real son how could he have such sway over you
cairpre has brought so much joy into my life a true family transcends simple blood 
ohoho could it be does thracias great statesman have a soft spot for children now then thracia depends on you hannibal
distler war is on our horizon defense of this castle is in your hands
oh your majesty to have your presence is a true honor and pleasure rest assured milord luthecia is as an impregnable wall ive seen to it myself
ill hold you to your word now ive reason to doubt the loyalty of hannibal at kapathogia ive taken his son hostage just in case and im leaving him to your custody
yes sir ill not let him out of my sight but should hannibal turn his cloak 
then youll kill the son dont be lulled into offering even a child such as he any mercy
understood milord
bishop judah we may be in need of reinforcements how soon can i expect the emperor to honor his end of the treaty
heh  even the great king travant is wary of betrayal is he be at peace an imperial unit is on the march to thracia even as we speak
good in that case i think ill leave the defense of grutia to your hands try not to get too cocky with the rebels bishop theyre of a treacherous sort
looks like theyre finally sending more wyvern knights our way seliph this must be it its time we readied everybody for battle
i dont know lewyn our foremost enemy is the empire is it not waging a war here feels  meaningless
the point of a battle comes from how you conduct yourself in it seliph and we hardly have much choice at this point were already this far into the fight 
but what of that dracoknight who was watching us from the munster peaks ive seldom seen such a sad look in anybodys eyes  how could i fight somebody like her 
thats enough seliph this is a war if you cant stand it any more then go on run home to tirnanog
lewyn 
i beg your pardon lord lewyn his majesty is tired and stressed such harsh words are uncalled for 
look i know  but everyone is just as stressed as he is yet they all know that we cant afford to stop with the resurrection of loptous lurking on the horizon its crucial we get to grannvale and stop the world falling to ruin while we still can
thank you oifey  but lewyn speaks the truth an inevitable battle lies ahead and if we see in it naught by futility then my duty is to carve my own purpose into it come oifey lewyn ill never again flinch or turn away
is something wrong finn youve been awfully quiet since we left manster  is something on your mind
oh  yes my lord i dont suppose you saw a lone dracoknight lurking atop the mountains of manster
oh the woman i saw her i dont believe its every day that you encounter a female dracoknight is it was there something amiss about her
it was her weapon  she was wielding gáe bolg leonsters holy lance and i sensed an aura cloaking her  the holy aura of njörun like your father
what what are you saying finn
there is only one explanation my lord your sister altena mustnt have died in the thracian ambush seventeen years ago nor must gáe bolg have been lost 
altena she  shes still alive then  then what in the blazes was she doing commanding the thracian army
id surmise that travant took her back to thracia as a child and raised her as his own
huh  who knew a man as cold as travant could do something so humane
it isnt so simple my lord altena is the sole inheritor of your fathers holy lineage from the earth goddess njörun as such unlike you she alone is capable of wielding gáe bolg power is the only reason a man like travant would ever be so kind to his enemys child
so hes tricked my sister just so he can use her like a  like a weapon travant  what a disgusting man   i want to help her finn if we can tell her the truth then i know we can work together to avenge our parents
my lord i believe youre the only one who could possibly convince her now even after all these years my lord you are still her brother im certain she will open her heart to you if you try please my lord please save lady altena 
hm  the rebels are on the move are they
lord hannibal were ready to attack at any moment we await your command
wait for the time being we should remain on the defensive id prefer to avoid any needless skirmishes with the enemy
but sire what about 
 my son i know  i know but  for now i would rather hold back and let the battle unfold on its own first my apologies kanatz but id like you to take charge of defending the castle
as you will sire
all units move in and engage the rebels we will return meath to thracian control
what a sorry joke  me a distinguished general stuck babysitting some brat
excuse me mister distler but  let me go papa doesnt want to fight hes out there risking his life all because of me
silence boy if thracias legendary shield refuses to ply his warriors craft of his own will then we will force him to by any means necessary
oh papa  sorry 
father ive received grave news its altena  she has fallen in battle
i see  very well then i suppose theres little choice now  im going to join the fray arion youre in charge of defending the castle ill entrust this spear to you  and with it the future of thracia
hold on a moment father  this is gungnir what is the meaning of this how do you intend to fight without it unless  father you cant be 
i am frankly arion ive had enough thracia is yours to do with as you see fit but we dont need to be hated by their kind 
are you seriously suggesting i should seek a truce father no never to comply with the rebels now would be unthinkable
as i said thracia is yours do as you see fit all i ask is for you to find a way to liberate thracias people from their suffering  farewell arion
father 
king travant has joined the battle has he hrm  i suppose ive no choice my duty as a warrior demands it  move in on the invaders well let them proceed no further
altena are you alright
nngh  oh  arion 
my apologies altena i had to give father a convincing show that i might ensure your survival i had no choice but to deal such a powerful blow
dont worry arion i understand but where is fath  er king travant now
you wont see him again  father has died in battle
he has  how did it happen
youd be better off not knowing fathers heart was an enigma at the best of times 
 listen arion what do you think i should do now
join prince leif your true brother im certain he is still waiting for you
then what will you 
altena  this is my fate theres no helping it
no you can call for a truce arion now that travants dead theres nothing at all to stop you from seeking peace and i  i could never fight you
i wish i could and i would were it not for fathers final words to me  please altena  go however be prepared our next meeting shall be on the battlefield and i will not stay my hand
oh  arion 
bad news seliph looks like general hannibal only opposed us because theyre holding his son hostage he never wanted to fight 
this cannot be  ive made a horrid mistake oh general hannibal  please forgive me 
it looks like theyve been holding a child in the dungeon seliph
who are you whats the matter
im cairpre  im general hannibals son and  wait  arent you lord seliph the liberator
indeed i am if i may ask cairpre why would thracia imprison one of their own generals sons
king travant took me hostage papa didnt want to fight your army at all sir the king threatened my life to force papa to fight  please sir  please take me to papa if papa knows im safe then he wont have to keep fighting please weve gotta save him
i see  dont worry i promise well find him move out everyone i pray well still be in time to save general hannibal
bad news seliph by the sound of it they were holding general hannibals son hostage here
hannibal must have been forced to fight solely to protect his son how appalling 
the son cairpre seems to have vanished he mustve heard of his fathers death he probably couldnt stand to see any of us right now
blast 
the enemy has got their grubby paws on kapathogia i shouldve known better than to trust those worthless thracians  i suppose it was unavoidable  fortify our defensive line until reinforcements arrive we must defend the castle at all costs
so this is the infamous thracia  ive never seen such a bleak wasteland heh no matter the rebels little rampage ends here ready men were going in the emperor himselfs put a handsome bounty on each rebel head we mustnt waste a chance to claim it for ourselves
lewyn do you think arion still intends to fight us
looks like it ive sent envoy after envoy offering a truce but hes not responding i guess his stubborn dracoknight pride compels him to fight to the bitter end and here i was hoping the legendary arion of thraciad be a wiser man than this  seliph i hope you understand we cant turn back now this last battle needs to be fought
i dont understand him  why why must arion insist on fighting such a futile battle 
arion  how can he be so callous does he not understand the grief he is inflicting on altena
the enemy has come as far as grutia  very well all hands deploy at once engage them in the dragon trinity strike formation this is our final chance thracias destiny hangs in the balance of this final assault
theyve come at last  move out whether we win or die well have fought in our fatherlands name wyvern knights descend upon the enemy
julia youre safe oh thank heavens 
mm  the enemy seized and imprisoned me here but i knew  i knew you would rescue me no matter what
say lewyn  did my eyes deceive me or did arion really vanish like that
yeah he did witnesses to the fight are saying prince julius appeared and took arion
the emperors son himself
mm  and your half brother at that 
i can hardly believe we share a mother 
and yet you do empress deirdre was a talented priestess and it looks like he inherited her skill with white magic for prince julius common warping and healing spells are the merest of trifles he doesnt even need staves but thats not the whole story seliph prince juliuss true power comes from something else entirely 
how do you mean
loptous  its the power of the dark lord 
i heard tell that the empires gonna send reinforcements to come after ya sounds like sir musars leading the charge legend has it his father fell at the hands of a silessian knight whos now among ya you best take care odds are hes lustin for a bit of revenge
oh hey youve gone and sorted out them imperial reinforcements already wow  im pretty dang impressed
thracia has many generals in its service but lord hannibal is the most revered of em all the man has devoted nigh on his entire life to the battlefield so he never found a wife mind twelve years ago or so he did take in an orphan he treats the boy as if hes his own flesh and blood what a wonderful guy
they say a priest from a dark cult has got his foul hands on grutia could it be true make no mistake i know well the life king travant is trying to crawl free of  but to allow a fell agent of the loptyrian order free run of his country  how could he make such a foolish choice accept this here barrier ring  and with it please save our beloved nation
king travants as heartless as men come he is but oddly enough his two kids arion and altena are the kindest souls youll ever meet like peas in a pod those two are always have been oh i pray nothing ever changes that 
general distler of luthecias nothing more than a slimy toady to the king useless as he is he still acts all like hes some almighty tyrant  what a foul little man
wow what a beauty 
 excuse me
oh how rude of me ysee im the prince of the great state of isaach call me shannan and youre just too pretty miss i had to meet you yknow if i may be so bold howd you like to go get a nice hot meal with me i know the most charming little tavern 
 
something wrong miss oh i see youre all nervous cause you stand before me the great prince shannan arent you dont worry about it how i look doesnt matter cause to me stayin close with the peasants is the most important thing there is
huh  so youre  alright then show me balmung ive always wanted to see it for myself
huh b balmung oh yeah the balmung  oh er  here you go look its the balmung the great dracoshield how about that huh now where were we dinner right
oh you imbecile everybody knows that balmung isnt a shield youre nothing like the real prince shannan
oh geez  youre part of that liberation army arent you look im real sorry its just  womenve been fawnin over me left and right ever since i took to callin myself shannan here take the bloody shield lets pretend this never happened alright
honestly  what a pig oh well i guess this shieldll help me to toughen up a bit
it wasnt all that long ago that the region here was under house leonsters rule oh what a peaceful time that was  as soon as the last war was over though the thracians pounced on us like a starving cat 
patty hey patty dont tell me youve been stealing again
oh er  yep just a bit though
ugh look i dont care if youre just stealing from the enemy i dont like you stealing at all knock it off okay
what dyou think i like doing this that im stealing for the fun of it this army needs to eat yknow and we need gold for that we dont exactly have many options here
yeah but havent you heard what people are saying about you i caught this guy mocking you like being a thiefs a walking punch line  “what else didja expect from being a pirates brat like mother like child” he kept saying of course i wiped the floor with him for that 
it doesnt matter what people think faval let them say whatever they want doesnt change a thing about mom  and it doesnt change that she was an heir of ullur the crusader i was in tears when lewyn told me about her  ive never been so happy
yeah me too yknow we havent exactly had the best lives poor orphans and all that  but i never even dreamed that our mother could be a noblewoman i dont suppose you remember anything about her patty
nope not a thing  you
yeah but  only just a little  she was a kind and beautiful woman 
so is she  do you think moms dead
i cant say for sure  but as soon as the wars done patty were gonna go look for her well find our mother  bridget  and even though we dont know his name maybe well find our father too 
daisy hey daisy dont tell me youve been stealing again
oh er  yep just a bit though
ugh look i dont care if youre just stealing from the enemy i dont like you stealing at all knock it off okay
what dyou think i like doing this that im stealing for the fun of it this army needs to eat yknow and we need gold for that we dont exactly have many options here
but 
and what about the kids back in connaught huh they need money to get by as well and i cant just leave them to starve
yeah i guess youre right  i hope theyre doing okay
dont act like you dont have to help too asaello youre sitting on a tidy little fortune from arena prizes youd better not waste it
gah i knew thatd come back to bite me 
waaaaait please my sister stop it
your sister  who are you and why do you think calling me your sister is a good idea
i  i am leif of house leonster
leif oh i see  the famous prince leif is it in case it wasnt obvious  and evidently it wasnt  i am altena daughter of travant
listen to me altena your true parents are quan and ethlyn whom travant slew seventeen years ago you vanished in travants attack and so too did gáe bolg the sacred earth lance of leonster which i might add is the very lance resting in your hand as we speak only a true heir of house leonster can wield gáe bolg
what are you talking about are you seriously trying to claim my real father is my fathers arch enemy that could never be  it mustnt 
look into my eyes if anything can prove the truth of my words to you it will be my eyes please sister 
fine   what is this i know youre lying but i  i cant bring myself to doubt you anymore
 altena
wait i  i must speak with father i need to confirm this 
altena oh you have got to be joking why why why why did you abandon your post for the second time in as many days
my apologies father  but i have an urgent question to ask of you are you my father or was my father really king quan
feh  i see youve found out at last well i suppose it was only a matter of time before this day came its true quan did indeed sire you but what difference does it make now it doesnt change that it is i who raised you
so you  you murdered my parents father 
heh heh  i suppose i did quan and ethlyn died at my hand do you take issue with that war is hell altena war claims lives worrying now wont change a thing
gah  how dare you how dare you mislead me all these years father er no  travant
thats enough altena
get out of my way arion this man dies here and now and nobody can stop me not even you
i cannot allow this if you dare to turn on father then youll have to contend with me first
w wait i cant fight you arion i could never 
its too late for you to stand down now  farewell altena
nngh  arion 
 you didnt just kill her did you arion you know you didnt need to go quite so far  eh no matter im going to join the fray arion i suppose theres little choice now  youre in charge of defending the castle
understood father
ill entrust this spear to you  and with it the future of thracia
hold on a moment father  this is gungnir what is the meaning of this how do you intend to fight without it unless  father you cant be 
i am frankly arion ive had enough thracia is yours to do with as you see fit but we dont need to be hated by their kind 
are you seriously suggesting i should seek a truce father no never to comply with the rebels now would be unthinkable
as i said thracia is yours do as you see fit all i ask is for you to find a way to liberate thracias people from their suffering  farewell arion

pardon me lord seliph my name is altena  daughter of quan of leonster my brother prince leif has explained the truth to me and i can no longer oppose you if you please id like to join your ranks
princess altena  ah yes thats right prince leif has told me everything and weve both prayed you would come  hell be so glad to know youve joined us youve made a difficult but wise decision
 i can still scarcely believe this has all happened and yet the moment i gazed into my brothers eyes i understood everything his eyes revealed my fathers warm gaze  and as clear as if it were only yesterday i felt for a split second as if i were a mere baby once more swaddled in my mothers gentle arms 
i admit im still not entirely sure what king travant was trying to do with you i still cannot see what would have led him to spare you and bring you home after murdering your parents 
ive heard he once told my brother arion that he sought to use the might of leonsters holy lance gáe bolg as his own for that alone he needed me 
you were a little more than a tool to him
i  im still not entirely sure for all his cruelty he still treated me as if i were his true daughter he was still a father to me
did he now  i suppose ive never known much of his ways
i must ask a favor of you milord its about arion  we need to help prince arion
certainly im hardly eager to fight a man of his fine caliber if what ive heard is true the only question is can we convince him
ill do my best to persuade him again all i ask is a little time please milord
hmph  so youre that cairpre guy here i thought the son of the great general hannibald be this amazingly hot guy but youre just some snotty kid 
youre not any better yourself you know
oh excuse you are you really trying to say i just look like a child
yeah i really am because you really do
nrrrgh  y you little  you jerk
papa stop its me you dont have to fight now the liberators have gone and captured luthecia
cairpre you  youre safe
yep listen papa  i want to join lord seliphs army thracias changed so much lately  i want to fight to help all its people and bring back the old thracia
youve grown into such a splendid young man cairpre  very well i too shall serve lord seliph
yes thank you papa first well help free thracia and then together well challenge the empire
general hannibal it is an honor to meet you at last please accept my apologies for engaging you in such a pointless battle
lord seliph  it is i who need apologize not you you have my deepest gratitude for all youve done to rescue my son 
your reputation precedes you general weve all heard of thracias great shield that a warrior of your caliber was coerced onto the battlefield by use of hostages  king travant is an utterly sickening man
indeed  and a pitiful man at that all he has accomplished is shattering any trust his subjects once held in him the peoples hearts can only endure so much abuse before they break 
if i may general would you join us to have the power and wisdom of a great general like you would be the finest boon
very well if you have a use even for these old bones lord seliph then you have my fealty
youre cairpre right
oh y yes  i am
i hear youre an orphan too right dyou remember anything at all from being a kid
no sorry nothing at all i think i was still just a baby when papa came to darna and took me in 
wait youre from darna too
are you familiar with darna lene
yep i grew up in the darna abbey they told me my mom who i think was a dancer as well left me there when i was just about two years old and thats why im a dancer now see what i was thinking was that maybe if i did the same thing as her one day i might find my mom again its a bit embarrassing but i taught myself everything i know about dancing
huh thats really great of you lene i er guess i thought wrong about you

lord seliph  close your eyes please
hm why do you ask
i wish to cast a ward spell upon you  it will help you better resist enemy magic

everything will be alright  ive done naught but take and take so far all i want is to give something back
julia 
oh lords in the heavens above  i implore you confer your blessings upon lord seliph 
pardon me my lady  i am finn a knight of house leonster it is an honor to meet you once more
so youre sir finn then leifs told me about you already i cant thank you enough for all youve done to protect him all these years
thank you my lady but it is i who owes you an apology not once in the past seventeen years did i ever suspect that you yet lived on let alone just across the border my failure to search for you is  is inexcusable 
sir finn  are those tears i see why  why are you crying
i  my apologies my lady you shouldnt have to see me in such a state as this 
hold a moment  i remember something  yes i  i was incredibly fond of you  and i always sought your attention didnt i thats right  sir finn 
my lady i 
princess altena ive been filled in on your situation you have my deepest condolences
general hannibal  youve chosen to ally with lord seliph as well have you thank goodness  i was dreading the very idea of considering you an enemy as well
hm pray tell milady what has become of prince arion
my broth  er no  arion simply refused to listen to anything i said perhaps you would have better luck persuading him sir
if you couldnt convince him milady then nothing has a chance i would surmise that prince arion is resolving to die a warriors death not giving in to the indignity of a truce weve no choice left
but sir 
i know how you feel milady  but some men like arion are stubborner than mules most likely prince arion would never wish to reveal such perceived weakness before you please understand this at lest milady 
sharlow 
hm is something wrong papa
son  i feel as if i am in some way responsible for all of your misfortunes  if youd been raised by a normal family rather than a soldier such as myself you would have never been abducted

/***EOF***/
grannvale his route to the empire takes him through the miletos district a collective of free cities which was once a vibrant and wealthy hub of commerce for all of jugdral
now though only a dying land choked by the empire and loptyrian order lies before seliph at chronos castle the seemingly mad rule of queen hilda has condemned countless citizens to savage merciless deaths and in the rados region bishop morrigan under the command of archbishop manfroy conducts child hunt after child hunt wealth liberty hope even life itself  all crumbled through the peoples fingers
as the evil cult plies its sacrificial rituals and pile the bodies of their victims even higher seliph knows he cannot leave miletos be greeted by raucous cheers from the people the liberation army routed the empires men freeing the city of perlucos the hope of miletos had slowly been rotting away in the empires hands but at long last the arrival of seliph and his liberation army breathes new life into the nations future
ishtar whats the status here
everything is moving smoothly according to your plan lord julius
heh  i wonder what it must be like to be as terrified of our sacrifices to the dark lord as the peasants must be
ive seen it myself knowing their children are doomed to the stake nigh drives them mad with grief  particularly the mothers 
hmhmhm  magnificent let them learn now the true meaning of despair let their will to live erode and crumble let them become little more than ragdolls let them become the ideal slaves for the rise of the loptous empire
also it seems weve captured far too many children this castle simply doesnt have the room for them all how shall i handle this
send them to belhalla at once i will groom them personally i think friends family  it matters not by the end they will despise each other ready to kill their own in powers name only the fittest will survive and these fittest will become the ideal citizens of loptouss new world
but lord julius  what of your father what of emperor arvis the emperor refuses to allow any child hunts under his watch
my father heh  my father is not worth fretting over ishtar i will persuade him easily 
lord julius 
ishtar where is his highness
oh mother  the prince just departed for belhalla
he did did he  you know ishtar i daresay the prince has quite the love for you hell im already hearing the wedding bells ring
i  i dont 
open your ears ishtar freege is by far the most esteemed of grannvales noble houses and i like the emperor himself am of house velthomer there is nobody in this land who could ever be worthier to the princes hand than you
a as you say 
now then we have more pressing matters ahead those rebels murderers of my dear husband and son are coming our way ishtar not only that they dared to steal alster from us never has history given freege a more dire enemy than seliph his father and all of his kin i shall await them here at chronos that i may give them the welcome they deserve you run along to miletos after all those brats wont arrange their own journey to belhalla
yes mother 
your majesty the mages are in position however er  we have a slight problem a small few children escaped our hold amidst the cover of confusion from our deployment what are your orders
excuse me how dare anyone under my command be so incompetent  no matter kill them all teach them all a lesson relay this command to general riddell at rados he is to put them all down at once
er  where do we run now
sorry i dunno
but  but if we get 
dont cry it  itll all be fine dont ya know the crusaders are coming theyll save us all i know it
sniff  i guess youre right the crusadersll come they will  they will 
ah general riddell weve got orders for you from queen hilda she wants you to move out at once
excellent its high time that we had work which better befits knights i am absolutely fed up with hunting children i swear if i have to hunt even one more child 
oh what a pity that is you see weve a handful of escaped brats who are all in sore need of an execution
oh for the love of 
whats this are you a loyal imperial general dissatisfied with your orders do i smell a filthy traitor to the trust of his imperial majesty emperor arvis
 no sir i could  i could never consider betraying his majesty  very well i suppose i have no choice 
hmph  honor of a knight how quaint
princess julia at last ive found you 
huh who are you
heh  the shock stripped you of your memory all those years ago did it perfect now come
n no take your hands off me
heh heh  you cannot resist fate my dear now cease your struggle and come along 
no ahh  lord seliph  help  me 
seliph im hearing that a couple of children have just fled chronos unless we step in now theyre sure to meet a grisly end
children very well well move out at once i wont rest until every last one is safe
weve got another problem too its julia  shes gone ive searched high and low but shes nowhere in sight
no oh no  how could this be 
i cant believe it either but thats how it is  my guess is the enemy seized her but why  why would they only target julia this doesnt make any sense 
gah  hold on julia wherever you are  no matter what happens well find you
well weve no need to make haste here men move out  but at a leisurely pace
any luck finding the children lewyn
nope no luck looks like theyve already been sent to miletos lets move theres no time to lose while theyre still in danger
but it looks like well need to capture rados as well if were going to get the gates to miletos open
understood castle rados is our next challenge then
this is  its like a ghost town 
the handiwork of morrigans mages i hear any who dared to resist met a grisly end 
how could they  how could anyone be so savage 
and thats why weve got to fight this war to the end seliph this is something youve got to understand this is the way of the loptous empire they have no place at all for the good hearted 
now it shouldnt be too long before the gate through to miletos opens for us whats your next move seliph
needless to say we must march on miletos we cant afford to rest while those children are still at risk  or julia for that matter
good and after that grannvale awaits
it has been a long time ishtar how fare you of late
oh your majesty what brings you here
listen ishtar release the captive children i know you care no more for these foul deeds than i do
my apologies sir but im on prince juliuss 
pay juliuss orders no mind ill be having a word with him soon
but 
this is an order from your emperor ishtar has julius bent you such that you will no longer listen to the word of your liege
no  never your highness 
i think not father ishtar is mine your selfish ways are so bothersome
julius how dare you 
why father it almost sounds as if you still dont know any better old age must already be dulling that once brilliant mind of yours why not retire before it grows still feebler unless  ohoho dont tell me you still seriously believe that you can banish me
no  i know better than to try something so futile again  i  i have no further objection
thats better now then begone return to your post and haunt my sight no more defending chalphy is crucial dont fail me for once in your sorry life father
y yes julius at once 
hmhmhm  how the mighty have fallen never would you think this wretch now clinging only to the ghost of a crown was once the most powerful man in jugdral
ah manfroy wheres julia have you restored her memory yet
your dear little sister is in chalphy burdened once more by her old memories never have i seen such horror as when she recalled how you her brother almost killed her or how her dearly departed mother spirited her clear of the castle and your clutches 
indeed  near everyone puts up some defiance to death by my hand yet deirdre never so much as flinched in the end she accepted her own demise all to save julia with what little strength she still had  julia possesses the foul powers of that ghoul naga just as deirdre once did nothing is more crucial than killing her now manfroy lest we lose the chance
you overestimate her threat milord after all the book of naga remains under the strictest lock and key in belhalla without it i cannot fathom how nagas soul could ever come to dwell within that girl 
how many times must i explain manfroy every last one of the avatars of naga the heirs of heim must be purged from existence
understood milord ill have my men see to it that julia is dead by sundown
do not fail me manfroy now then i suppose im needed in the capital i shall ensure that holding the miletos territory is the orders highest priority
before the week is done your majesty the corpse of seliph will lie before you
seliph  ah of course the one the peasants call the scion of light  feh just as they call me the scion of darkness the alleged eldest son of deirdre and the alleged true heir of grannvale  a fairy tale told to inspire hope amongst fools
he poses a threat to us nonetheless milord the sooner we dispose of him the better
surely he doesnt truly bear the power of the crusader baldr  he couldnt possibly  i might not care about him manfroy but youre welcome to do with him as you will
very good milord 
lord julius 
ishtar shall we be off then ive tasked the order to defend miletos say  i have a better idea i want to play a game rumor has it that a small army of fresh sacrificial meat is headed our way lets see who can claim the life of a rebel first
yes lord julius id love to
heh thats the end of it lord julius ive won
hrm  not bad at all ishtar
heh  such an easy win ishtar
masterfully done lord julius i expected no less of you
looks like were too late seliph the kids are already gone im guessing theyre well on their way to grannvale
blast  not again 
i hate to admit it but i doubt we couldve gotten here soon enough either way now then it sounds like theyre just finishing up repairs on the miletos strait bridge ready to move in on chalphy
chalphy  my fathers homeland 
so it is im betting the citizens there will be even happier to see you than usual lets not let them wait any longer
indeed everyone move out onward to chalphy
i grow weary of this game ishtar we leave at once
yes lord julius
ah bishop palmarch  your grace i need you to escort these children to safety
come again are you setting them free
indeed more of julius minions from belhalla will be here at any moment you need to move and quickly
y yes of course thank you your majesty  thank you so much 
i  i also wish to entrust you with this
hold on a moment  isnt this 
once long ago you were a confidante to sigurd were you not  you already know what you must do
y yes sire 
now go protect the children with your life
father 
julia i  i beg your forgiveness for all the misery ive wrought you must hate me so 
thats not true it doesnt matter what happened father not even for a moment have i hated you to me youve always been one of the kindest men ive ever known
no  i am a fool ive been a fool from the outset all this time ive been manfroys puppet when i finally saw the strings he was pulling it was too late i was powerless to do a thing i had already given the empire to julius  the embodiment of loptous the dark god he  he took the love of my life from me  and you are next 
mother sacrificed herself for me  she gave the last of her strength to ensure i made it as far away from julius as possible i think the trauma must have wiped my memory  and if lewyn hadnt found me  but just knowing that julius did that to his own mother  now i remember i almost wish i didnt  it hurts so much 
oh julia  we have so much more to talk about i wish we could but time is short you are in grave danger so long as you stay here run run with bishop palmarch please 
tsk tsk  i think not arvis the only place lady julia is going is back with me to velthomer now i do believe his imperial majesty should keep to prince julius orders that is unless you want your dear daughter to meet the axe
how dare you manfroy you address your emperor how dare you seek to use my daughter as a common bargaining chip
hmhmhm  so you still feebly cling to your titles and thrones do you your time has long passed arvis you and this world now belong to prince julius unless you wish to know pain beyond the ken of mortal men still your tongue and obey your new liege without question it is almost a pity your heroics are for naught every last child you freed shall be a festering corpse before this day is done hee hee hee 
f father
julia  i am so sorry  julius thugs are too powerful i cannot protect you  all i can do now is give you this  this circlet once belonged to deirdre this  only it could possibly save you n 
enough we leave at once julia
father oh 
come along children hurry
but theres nowhere for us to go sir 
the dark priests are right behind us were gonna die arent we
be at peace all will be well lord seliph will be here at any moment to rescue us have faith in the crusaders my children
a job well done indeed seliph and would you just look at that the locals are so happy to see you look theyre already pouring into the streets to rejoice at your return
mm im home at long last im home  nothing has ever felt this good but  i mustnt celebrate just yet 
julia right you must be worried something fierce heh  got a little thing for her do you
oh er  no nothing of the sort 
ive had a word with some locals whove seen her archbishop manfroys got his grubby hands on her by the sound of it its a pretty safe bet that julias still somewhere in grannvale
say lewyn  something feels amiss weve defeated arvis and avenged my father and yet i still feel  empty
thatd be because we still have a while to go until we reach the end of all this if anything the real battle heres only just about to get started trust me by the time this holy war has come to a close seliph the truth behind it all will be clear as day
ohh oh noble crusader we beg of you save our children the children  the dark priests want to sacrifice them to their god
few folk livin today are as vile as that queen hilda of chronos shes real cozy with them dark cultists she goes round stealin kids then if they so much as cry she kill the mams so calm like youd think she was just swattin flies theres no way that womans human its a fiend thats rulin us now 
long ago the twelve crusaders waged holy war against the loptous empire for fifteen years nary a single corner of the land of jugdral escaped the wars clutches it was saint heim who smote the dark gods avatar emperor galle xvii restoring light to this land at long last and yet  the dark god is upon us once more oh great crusaders protect us all
tis only been lately that weve had tdeal with these rites of sacrifice not so long ago from what i hear emperor arvis himself forbade em entirely what the devil couldve changed his mind please im beggin you youve gotta save our children here this magic ring oughta help you out
a terrifying man that prince julius is  just a single glance into those eyes of his and youre gone  you lose yourself so many of my friends and others my ageve all left for belhalla to serve him ive heard nothing from any of em since 
none of yeh come even close tbeing strong enough tfight prince julius hate tsay it but sometimes yeh need tmake sacrifices if yeh wanna keep goin 
hey hey patty looking good as ever i see
oh its you lester look just go away okay
oh come on youre always so harsh and mouthy what gives
youre one to talk youve never said anything that isnt teasing me in the most mind numbing ways imaginable
wait i havent
of course you havent how cant you see that you dont treat any other girls like this
hang on what do you mean youre a girl patty
oh you  you twit
hey i was joking im sorry  cmon calm down okay look i guess i kinda care about you that sort of turned into  er sorry
care about me whats that supposed to mean
it means that i sort of like you okay you cant be that thick can you
is everything alright altena you look rather weary
oh leif  no its nothing dont worry about it
well if you say so  listen altena dont be afraid to ask for my help if you ever need anything ill gladly do all i can
thanks leif er actually  i was thinking of arion
i thought as much  is it true that someone came to spirit him away after we brought him down
it is and from what i hear that someone was prince julius 
the empires crown prince himself but why  why in the world would he do that
perhaps hes trying to win himself a new ally by appealing to arion
that makes sense  and i suppose it means well be crossing blades with thracias wyvern knights again
mm im afraid so so long as this war continues 
to be honest altena i believe this is actually good news
huh how so
think about it so long as arion is still alive there is still hope that we can help him never give up altena so long as we keep moving forward surely everything will be fine in the end
thank you leif  i think im feeling better already
oh thank the gods i couldnt bear knowing that my sister was in such grief im here for you altena all i want is to ensure your happiness and ill do whatever it takes to help you
say lord leif  all my life ive been hearing how miletos cities are so fabulously rich but look at it now  look at all these ruins 
mm  no matter how awful the empire is i never thought them to be quite so brutal to think just two decades ago one could buy almost anything one could ever desire from this regions many merchants  i suppose that nothing can thrive so long as the empire remains in power
ever since i was little ive always wanted to wander the beautiful cities of miletos and sample all the rare goods on sale  it must have been so lovely once 
nanna  the instant this war is over and weve restored peace to the world lets come back here  just the two of us
why
i once heard a story about my parents  on a visit to miletos my father gifted my mother with the most stunning pearl tiara
did he
he did indeed and someday  someday id love to do the same for you nanna
oh lord leif 
heh i suppose im getting a bit ahead of myself we still have an empire to bring down before we do anything else after all the end of this blasted war is in sight nanna now shall we
of course lord leif
youve grown so strong of late seliph you really are your parents son theres nothing left for me to teach you
thank you shannan  for everything any might i have springs from your teachings to me swordplay is every bit as natural as breathing and i owe it all to you
heh  you think so do you 
you look awfully weary shannan  is something amiss if only i could lend you my strength 
hey come on you neednt treat me like some old man im as young and spry as ever you know
oh my apologies shannan  that wasnt what i was 
heh its fine  thanks anyway seliph it heartens me to know that you care
wait a minute  ive never seen someone so frail hold their own out here like this arent you scared at all
i wont lie to you  i am i really am but i could never sit back and do nothing knowing all those children are still in peril
huh so youre fond of kids then
oh certainly i love children and from what i hear you do as well youve been looking after orphans havent you faval i think thats just wonderful
er dont get too excited there  patty dragged me into the whole “look after orphans” thing not the biggest fan myself
hee hee hee  you sound so sure im not blind you know how then do you explain all the sobbing children who begged you to stay just as you left to join us why they must all see you as some sort of father figure
h hey stop it will you i  its just that  look ive got some things to go do okay
heh oh faval 
look sire the territory of chalphy awaits us just across the miletos strait
chalphy  my fathers fatherland  i can only imagine all the memories you must have of it oifey
mm of course i dont think theres a single corner of chalphy which i dont recall fondly  lord sigurd and lady ethlyn  noish alec and all of my other peers among the young knights of chalphy  every last face there was a friendly one 
hm  i can only imagine oifey ive never so much as set foot in chalphy have i
indeed sire you were born in agustria and raised in silesse and isaach come to think of it sire youve never been anywhere near grannvale till now
quite the sorry excuse for a prince of grannvale i make wouldnt you say it almost feels as if ive tricked the world
i know sire but i pray you understand this is the will of your citizens all long abused and stripped of power by the empire theyve endured decades of suffering beyond compare at the empires hands all in the hope of one day seeing the coming of their savior
this savior  do they believe it to be me
they do the common folk have long prayed for the second coming for the hero sigurd the folklore claims he comes once more in the form of a legendary child whom sigurd begat with empress deirdre
a legendary child  its terrifying to know that people have taken to seeing me as some sort of god oifey
think of it as a product of the sheer brutality of the empires regime sire look around you we stand in a realm where children are snatched from their parents in droves and all who resist are put to slaughter no mere human could ever wreak such madness a great evil lurks behind it all 
say oifey  ive been hearing tales that emperor arvis is the dark god itself where do you stand
ive heard the same from countless others in our travels sire but i doubt it
then who could it be manfroy perhaps
sire  whoever it may be the dark gods return is fast approaching we must hurry your people have come to revere you as a crusader destined to save them the time to heed their call is upon us
pardon me fee lewyn would like a word with you if you need me ill be waiting over there
geez fee i havent seen anyone as stubborn as you since i last saw erinys
 
cmon theres no need to get angry im here to apologize okay ignoring you clearly wasnt the best idea ive ever had
what kind of monster are you dad i  i couldve sworn i was seeing things when you first popped up in rivough i hadnt been that happy in years and  and seeing you again had me in tears  but then when i tried talking to you you wouldnt so much as blink at me do you have any idea how it feels to be shunned by your own father dad
so you went about pretending you didnt notice me either is that it
i figured why should i bother if youre not gonna bother i told myself id only talk to you if you took the initiative here
heh  bratty little thing arent you 
excuse me ohh that does it im not listening to another word of this maybe if she hadnt married such an awful man momd still be with us 
look fee i get it i really messed things up with erinys but what happened is my business and hers nobody elses you and ced have no right to meddle

sigurds capture of evans castle comes too late aideen is not there instead already well within verdanes borders
verdanes territory is blanketed in a thick sweep of forest the nation is widely dubbed a barbarian kingdom by grannvales people owing to their constant raids on grannvalian soil
however the reign of king batur has seen an end to verdanes infamous border raids a pacifist king batur has long worked to build a lasting peace with grannvale while also keeping his aggressive sons appeased ultimately however it was batur himself who violated the peace he held so dear
baturs three sons have unexpectedly launched an assault on grannvale kinbois the second son lord of genoa  gandolf the eldest lord of marpha  and jamke the youngest of the three lurking deep within verdane territory the three now await the arrival of sigurd
aideens fate  baturs sudden belligerence  sprawling before sigurd lie the great forests of verdane   and within them the answers he seeks he prepares to take his first steps into the spirit forest of folklore 
youre doing a fine job soldier i leave the borders defenses to you
yes milord
sigurd its been a long time pray tell why do i find you suddenly occupying evans you couldnt possibly be declaring war on verdane could you
eldigan am i glad to see you listen the verdanites have abducted lady aideen of jungby theyve made it amply clear that they dont plan on releasing her taking her back by force is our only option

ayra ayra ill be alright dont give in to these thugs dont let em boss you around
shannan  look kinbois you have my word so long as you leave shannan alone youll have no trouble but i do wonder if once this battle is over you actually plan to return him to me
ahahahaha you got nothing to worry about if we get evans back you get him back
i understand but be warned kinbois if you break your promise youll deeply regret it cross me and i will pursue you to the very depths of the inferno itself till i take your head remember this well
wh whoa settle down there i dont believe it  such a cute face but you only use it to spew bile like that im not about to make an enemy outta someone with a sword arm as fine as yours i can promise you that
shannan sit tight be patient for just a bit longer
ayra no dont do it dont go ayra
feh  right boys were moving out were taking back evans
come on aideen take the brat and get out of here and quickly you need to get as far away as you can before gandolf finds out
pardon me prince jamke but are you not joining us
no i wont stand for my brothers vile ways but i just wont betray my father either im going back to the capital im going to try one more time to convince my father
youre right  we must do all we can to end this war as soon as possible prince jamke i would sooner not burden you alone but you are our only hope to persuade king batur to end this
aideeeeeeen cmon hurry up were still in serious danger here if they catch me this time then gandolfll rip my tongue out for sure
dew youre a thief you got caught in the act any tongue rippings you get are your own fault if aideen hadnt insisted on letting you go too youd still be sitting in chains now what did you promise to do
i know i know i promised aideen too im washin my hands of thievin from now on can i go now
ill take your word for it now go already
aideen  may we meet again

so its finally time  woe be to all who cross me
sire weve found this young boy in the dungeon

im so sorry shannan  if i had known i wouldve done all i could to help her 
ayra 
oifey could you take care of shannan for a while try to help him calm down a bit
pardon me sire but were currently at war with isaach if were going to harbor its prince shouldnt we inform the king
hes a child oifey that war has nothing to do with him ill find a way to get him home safely but for now we need to look after him
understood sire
just as i thought  lord sigurd really is such a kind man 
genoa has fallen to grannvale no i  i must get to shannan
tch does grannvale really think it can just waltz into verdane with such a tiny force how adorable men heres our chance evans is ripe for the plucking then its straight for the grannvale border
is that  no thats the heirhein army lord eldigan wont like this 
shannan isnt here no  the grannvalians must have him those fiends they wont live to regret it
whats this heirheins army is marching on evans ugh  i shouldve known elliot just couldnt keep his nose out of this take care of the castle lachesis sigurd is in dire need of my help
of course brother please do all you can to help sir sigurd
right cross knights move out our foe is the heirhein army i dont expect a challenge but stay alert nonetheless
elliot ambushing them like a common thief are you a cowardly act ill befitting the honor of a knight withdraw immediately or i will take action we both know youre no match for me
whats this eldigan i shouldve known you would side with grannvale
in doing this you are crossing not just grannvale nor me but your very liege we bow to the reverent king imca who desires only peace with grannvale would you truly cross his majesty
you fool only you would still seriously heed that senile old fools word the lords of agustria are united against both grannvale and any peace with them
wrong for i will not stand with you agustria cannot afford the crippling tolls of war and nor can grannvale our past stands as a testament to this learn well elliot we the nobility know not the suffering brought by war war cripples only the powerless our subjects i will not abide your lust for glory at the expense of our people
a pretty little speech but that wont save you now i knew all along you and i were always fated to clash eldigan today we settle this once and for all men the enemy is now house nordion i want eldigans head on a platter
elliot has fled very well leave him to lick his wounds were done here withdraw
n no please let go of me
heh heh  whats the matter cmon im just askin for a little date
i need to go home sir i ask of you please pay me no mind
shaddup keep up your yappin and youll regret it
whats going on here let the girl go
whats your problem this ones   urgh youre not that grannvale paladin are you
you understand the situation then be on your way there are none i loath more than your kind the girl has given you her answer now leave her be and get out of my sight
yeah  yeah got it  my bad missy i was just teasin is all sorry ill be off now 
are you alright
y yes  thank you sir sigurd
hm you know of me
yes i met a woman named aideen not long ago in this castle and 
she spoke of me
she did i knew from the moment i laid eyes on you you are in every way the man i had imagined 
may i  ask for your name
 im sorry but   i  i must go
wait please i just want to talk for a little longer  
 i am truly sorry i am glad we could meet even once 
what what do you mean please wait  ah
lord sigurd is it whats the matter
oh  you must be the town elder that woman who ran off just now  do you know who she is
ahh of course that woman is called deirdre she is a priestess of the spirit forest
deirdre  shes beautiful 
ohoho even a refined man like you cant resist being charmed by her ilk could it be love at first sight hoho 
sir please dont tease me and yet  ive never seen anybody so beautiful before i  i need to see her again
alas sir for it cannot be so the folk of the spirit forest staunchly refuse to partake in the world beyond their woods furthermore that girl and members of her clan are forbidden from ever liaising with men village lore dictates that should this ever happen calamity would befall the world you have no choice sir resign yourself of that girl
what superstitious nonsense that poor girl  deirdre  we must meet again
ugh dammit i dropped my axe
what you dropped  was it this golden axe or perhaps this silver axe
oh no my axe isnt anything as fine as those two its just a plain old iron axe
such an honest person  as a reward  i present you with this brave axe  farewell lord lex 
er 
father this is absurd why do you still refuse to listen to me my brothers already have fallen and its only a matter of time before they come for the capital as well the grannvale commander sir sigurd is a good man please end the war while you still can
i  allowed gandolfs raid only because id been told that grannvale would surely come to invade us first never did i intend for a war like this
it was that sorcerer sandima who told you that wasnt it you kinbois and gandolf trusted him too readily youve all been deceived
now now prince jamke thats enough of that your duty as prince is to lead your men into the fray dawdling in a place like this would be deeply troublesome of you
argh damn you sandima
thats enough jamke listen to sandima go lead your men into the fray
father  very well if you wont change your mind even now then  ill see this through as well but be warned should i return victorious sandima ill allow you to live no longer
sandima  perhaps for all this time you may not have been entirely forthright with me you did assure me that grannvale hungers to claim our land and yet 
feh  and just what are you saying now to think i believed that your verdanites would be of use  you truly are naught but savages you are worthless completely and utterly worthless and from now on your army is mine to command
what no stay back back i   guhh 
feh  feeble minded old fool
so youve put an end to the king sandima  do you expect that the verdanite army will still obey your command
oh archbishop manfroy how long have you been here your eminence the army is of no concern at all they need only know that the king has fallen ill
hrm i see  and what of the situation here does the plan progress
my sincerest apologies your excellency that grannvalian  sigurd or something has proven to be an unexpected obstacle to the invasion
hrm  and what of the search for the loptrian scion have you found sigyns daughter
er  no not yet 
imbecile after all of the pains i have gone to to locate the boy  the son of sigyn is still in belhalla but hes worthless without the female listen well sigyn was an heir of prince maira brother of an emperor of the old loptyr empire sigyn alone in this era inherited the sacred blood of the dark lord that woman broke the commandment that maira placed upon his heirs and bore two children do you know what this means
yes your eminence when the blood of the two heir intersects the second coming of the dark lord loptyr will be upon us
precisely and so too shall we descendants of the loptyr empire return to this world you know as well as i sandima how heavily our fates depend upon the resurrection of the dark lord you know well our orders centuries of exile hidden deep within the aed desert you know well the abuses  the famines  how we were sustained only by dreaming of the day when the empire will rise again and at long last that day is upon us
understood your eminence if i must surrender my life to ensure that the plan is realized i will do it gladly
wait  lord sigurd 
hm is that  deirdre ah so this must be your spirit forest thank the gods for a moment i thought that i might never see you again
milord listen the dark priest sandima guards castle verdane with his wicked magic you must go no further you would surely be killed please you mustnt go 
but i mustnt place my men in even greater danger either i have no choice but to go
 i see then i will go with you
excuse me
this is called a silence staff so long as my own power is enough to pierce his magical resistances it will seal his magic away trust me milord ill ensure his dark spells never harm anyone ever again
id never imagined that youd have such power  but why  why are you helping me
 i tried to forget you all i could but it was all in vain  i no longer know what i should do 
what is it youre afraid of deirdre i dont understand but if you and i feel the same way then surely weve nothing to fear i  i love you deirdre 
i heard of sandimas defeat i was afraid that hed find me  he was a dark priest from a shadowy cult sent to verdane to find me
a  shadowy cult what in the world do you mean
i dont know much of it myself all i know comes from the last words of the old woman who raised me somewhere in this world she said there lies an ancient order dedicated to the ancient dark god loptyr so devout are they it is said that they plot to resurrect their once fallen god
yes ive heard those rumors myself but why is this cult after you
the dark god slumbers within my very blood  through me they have some way of reviving loptous this is why she told me on her deathbed i must never be found she said i must never mingle with men 
i see  so thats why you kept running away from me
i was afraid of falling in love i did all i could to forget you but  love found me still i couldnt do it  i couldnt bear to lose you i  no longer know what i should do 
deirdre  i know you must fear where your destiny might lead but nothing will come of living in fear i will protect you come what may i will protect you deirdre if you and i feel the same way then weve nothing to fear o gods above should our love be a sin then deliver punishment unto me alone i swear this day even should my body be rendered and rent no regrets will ever haunt me all i ask o gods  protect my beloved deirdre in my stead for all eternity
ahh  milord 
deirdre oh thank the gods youre alright
mm the enemy captured and imprisoned me but i knew  i knew you would come for me no matter what
sire weve found a casualty in the palace its  its king batur himself by the look of it hes well beyond help
king batur are you alright please come on  you can make it
hnnh  lord  sigurd i am so sorry for doing all this to you  i let sandima  lead me astray  he  he abused my trust  and won over my sons  all to seize control of verdane for himself 
i understand your highness but you need to rest now please you mustnt stress yourself further
no  its too late for me  heed my word sigurd for there is one final thing i must tell you  the misery here  the grief spreading across jugdral  it is all the will of the dark priesthood  they blight our world from the shadows all in the name of the revival of their dark god loptyr  sandima  was one of them  he twisted us to war with grannvale  for the sake of the cults madness the  the dark priests  they infect every corner of our world  sigurd  stay vigilant lest you be tricked too i  i failed the people of verdane  sigurd i beg you  make this right  protect  my  people 
oh  your highness  the dark priesthood what in the blazes is happening 
this village is part of the holdings of prince kinbois lord of genoa hes as dreadful as they come barely a month goes by without him settin his army on us its terrifyin king batur his father used to do such a fine job of keepin him in check i can hardly imagine whats goin on  anyway glad you stopped by
king batur is as gentle as they come normally at least leading a war like this is the last thing hed ever do mark my words this is all the doing of sandima his sorcerous advisor i can just feel it eking out a living heres grown tougher and tougher since the day that man arrived and save for the youngest son jamke both king and country are at his very whim please i beg you  save our country bring back the verdane that once was
just tthe north a here is this mighty woodland scalled the spirit forest once upon a time i lived there too in this lil hamlet deep within th village is home to the last kin o the dark one of old loptyr they say it all started with saint maira exiled by the empire for darin to sympathize with mortal men in my day there was this gorgeous girl livin there called sigyn the last heir o loptyrs bloodline she was she lived er life under close guard the villagers wary o lettin the blood o loptyr loose into th world alas sigyn grew weary o the tedious forest life an she left it all behind breaking ancient commandments a couple o years later she came back cept now she was pregnant never said who the father was mind before long sigyn died even as she gave birth t her daughter from what i eard the hamlets old prophet took er in and raised the girl as er own if the little girls still alive shed ave to be bout seventeen or eighteen by now 
finn this will likely be a very long battle my apologies for bringing you into it
i am but your humble servant milord i would go anywhere should my master will it
thank you finn
even so i am but a page  it honors me to have your confidence but i doubt ill be of much use to you
is that so in that case what better time than now is there for a spot of hands on training draw finn
yes sir
aideen thank goodness youre okay
lord sigurd so you came to my aid did you please accept my apologies ive put the people of chalphy through nothing but danger 
dont worry about it everyone will be glad to know that youre safe youve nothing to worry about anymore the road back to jungby is secure for you when youre ready
no i wish to remain here injuries are inevitable in war as a humble servant to the gods it is my duty to stay here and aid your wounded
say aideen  as i recall you declined to pursue a knighthood and instead joined the clergy am i right i shouldnt be surprised knowing how easily people warm to you and you them id do well to learn from your example
thank you lord sigurd but that isnt entirely true initially i sought priesthood in a bid to help me find my sister even now i still believe this is the answer i seek
you mean bridget  id heard that she went missing as a child so all this time aideen youve been praying for her sake havent you
yes i know well meet someday no matter what happens i must give her this her sacred birthright the bow yewfelle
ah lady aideen youre safe  thank the gods 
lord azelle have you been fighting for jungby as well
when the news of your abduction reached us the thought of you in danger while i just sat at home was unbearable i came to jungby as quickly as i could
hold on you are the younger brother of lord arvis of velthomer are you not did he allow you to come
no i  i came without his consent and he certainly wont be pleased
why would you do something so reckless then i thought you abhorred violence
because i  er well 
oh what is it azelle
its  its nothing  never mind
milady you  youre safe ahh  thank the gods im so sorry i failed to protect you please forgive me 
the important part is that youre safe as well midir please dont worry about it you gave your all to protect me and i couldnt thank you enough for that even if you didnt succeed for now id like you to remain with sigurd he could use your strength
certainly milady hes done so much for me for you and for all of jungby ill do all i can to return his kindness
aideen are you okay when i heard youd been abducted i was so worried
you came to fight for me as well ethlyn thank you  im sorry for your trouble its difficult to convey my thanks but please accept this staff i think youll have more use for it than me
is this  a return staff oh thank you aideen ill put it to good use to help us all
hey miss aideen i got something good to give you look i picked up this odd cane it wont do much good if i just hold onto it will it
oh this is a warp staff where did you find it dew
oh  er  i  i found it just over there yeah thats right weird isnt it i betcha one of the gods left it over there juuuuust for you
oh dew  having a staff like this ought to be a great help for everybody thank you ill cherish it
princess ayra of isaach i presume i heard your story from sigurd i am quan of leonster
a pleasure
id hate to press you for information so soon but theres something id like to know why did isaach attack darna in the first place surely you knew doing so would invoke the wrath of grannvale that king mananan would commit such a reckless act  the very idea defies belief
you knew my father sir quan
im afraid i never had the chance to meet him however my father knows him well he always had only the utmost praise for him he also speaks fondly of your brother prince mariccle hes always said he is a fine young man
is that so it heartens me to hear it without a doubt my father and mariccle were admirable men never would they condone such an assault on a defenseless city in the matter of darna the patriarch of rivough acted alone and without our consent 
i beg your pardon why havent the grannvalians heard this surely if prince kurth knew the truth he would refuse to continue the war
so too thought my father once he executed the rivough patriarch he departed for the grannvale front head in tow to negotiate with them but 
 yes
my father the king  he was assassinated on the way once word of this returned to isaach the people were utterly incensed mariccle set out leading our entire army seeking vengeance against grannvale
something is amiss here the murder of a king who seeks peace talks certainly isnt like prince kurth either have you told sigurd of this as well
no lord sigurd carries enough of a burden as it is its too late for my brother 
prince mariccle was resigned to his death when he engaged grannvale wasnt he 
my brother believed to the last that isaachs hope for the future rests in shannan his son my role is to protect shannan and with him the promise of isaachs liberty 
i see thank you for telling me princess ayra someday the world will know this truth and till that day comes you mustnt give in i will do all i can to help you
thank you sir quan
hold lady ayra prince shannan is safe with us you neednt keep fighting
what you saved shannan do you speak the truth
i do prince shannan told me everything that youre the daughter of the late isaachian king listen you detest grannvalians youve made your hostility perfectly clear but you cant neglect your duty to the prince you cant afford to waste your life now not on a battle as senseless as this
my brother the crown prince entrusted shannan to my care knowing that his death was inevitable youre right after all this time i refuse to die for verdanes sake until ive seen shannan rise to the isaachian throne my life is not mine to forfeit to such dogs
i will aid you all i can if you lower your sword on my honor as the heir of baldr the crusader i swear i will not betray you
very well ill place my trust in you as well  such is the way of the warriors of isaach for now i pledge my blade in your service however this does not change that grannvale is my foe beware for if one day that includes you  i will not hesitate
mm war can be truly cruel ayra isaachian warrior  i pray that day never comes
hold prince jamke
aideen what are you doing here
you said you would persuade your father yet instead youve taken to the field yourself what is the matter with you
my father is a changed man my words can no longer reach him   it all started when that sorcerer sandima arrived my entire family now obeys his every word
this is why i ask  why have you taken to the field please jamke join us lets go to verdane together we can reason with the king one more time we can put an end to this war lord sigurd has no interest in invading verdane he fought only to rescue me please listen jamke please  i beg of you
fine  if youre willing to go so far then ill stain my name with treason but it must be understood that i wont let anyone lay a finger on my father
yes i will promise you that thank you jamke you truly are a good person
aideen 
pointing your little stick at me thats precious that is ill cave your head right in
no  urgh 
oh come on first my woman flees and now this damn my rotten luck
and what are you supposed to be youve got nerve brat
so youre gandolf  how dare you harm aideen
youre that knight from earlier ugh i dont believe this  what are you doing still alive
prepare yourself gandolf ill never forgive you
n no  this cant be  guh 
kehehehehe  learn to fear my dark magic
archbishop manfroy  f forgive me 
damn you eldigan and your little good guy act your grudge against me ends here and now
oof  men retreat mark my words eldigan this isnt over
you are too late jamke your father has already passed on
what sandima you  youre mine
whats this a priestess are you could it be  might you be deirdre  the cursed maiden 
you stand between me and shannans future  farewell
shannan  ive failed you 
i dont want to hurt you begone from this land at once
no  father

the grannvale commander duke langbalt is a longtime enemy of sigurds father for sigurd to challenge langbalt is an opportunity to avenge his father byron framed by langbalt for his crimes
beyond lubeck in the desert town phinora lord arviss elite warriors stand guard under the command of the war mage vaha velthomer castle on grannvales border with the aed desert is defended by lord arvis trusted aide general aida and in belhalla the royal capital of grannvale lord arvis serves to aid the bedridden king azmur while chancellor reptor of friege maintains peace and order in the city
a long road to belhalla awaits sigurd  a clash with grannvale en route is inevitable sigurd refuses to endanger the people of silesse any further in this conflict he is determined to fight to the end
the year is grann 760 early spring the fields of silesse peacefully rest beneath a deep blanket of snow 
nngh  sigurd   no i mustnt die yet  no  not until the exalted blade is in your hands 
milord weve sighted the fugitive duke byron we caught him resting but he slipped away it seems as if he plans to escape to silesse
what you simpleton get out there and hunt him down immediately my ambush may have put an end to chalphys paladin brigade the grünritter but the survival of byron alone leaves that utterly meaningless
y yes sir  but you see milord byron is still gravely wounded surely he has very little time left 
ive never heard such naïve drivel byron may not be long for this world but hes determined to get that sword tyrfing to his son with the very last of his strength do you not understand the threat that sigurd would pose to us should he get his hands on that damnable sword move out and kill byron immediately
y yes sir consider it done
for that matter where in blazes is danan with those reinforcements for the gods sake hes leading the elite grau ritter brigade how could it take him so long to put down that isaachian resistance first lex and now danan  why must both of my sons be so worthless
come now lord langbalt sir dont worry about a thing after all youve still got the beige ritter and i on your side
i suppose youre right andré be sure that your men are ready to join the fray at a moments notice
heh it would be my pleasure sir 
damn that insolent worm to think he isnt even the slightest bit remorseful for slaying his own father duke ring  may you be at peace 
sire weve sighted a lone knight to our east who appears to be headed our way
hm is he an enemy
i dont believe so the lubeck occupation seems to be pursuing him so theyre most likely not with them
i see lets give them a hand well be clashing with langbalts army sooner or later so why not make the first move move out our target is their front lines todays victory hinges on this first strike
heh who knew even ive got myself a wife and kids certainly cant go dying now not without leaving anything behind for them  hm whats this tatty little book doing here thats odd  nothing in this thing but complete gibberish wh  ack  mnnnurraaaaagh whoa whats this feeling everythings looking feeling and sounding so much clearer now
lord arvis  are sigurd and his party truly on the march to our holy capital
indeed but weve no cause for alarm duke langbalt and his army stands ready at lubeck it is only a matter of time before their insurrection is suppressed
even so  even now it is almost beyond belief is it not that lord byron would slay kurth  or that sigurd would incite a rebellion 
your majesty if i may explain once more  lord byron was plotting against the crown in concert with the late lord ring of jungby his highness fell afoul of their assault an act to which our very own dukes reptor and langbalt bore witness his highness learned of their schemes to seize the throne from the royal family too late and pair for it with his life naturally lord sigurd had a hand in his fathers revolt what clearer proof is there than how he still harbors an enemy the isaachian prince there is no question their treason against the state is grave i too feel this pain as my own having lost not only a prince but a father in law  and in the name of my beloved wife princess deirdre i will never allow sigurds traitorous rampage to stand even if duke langbalt fails to defeat him that is not the end the elite fire mages of house velthomer the rot ritter stand ready to suppress this rebellion once and for all
i see  if you say it is so then perhaps  perhaps this could never have been avoided  arvis about  cough about deirdre 
oh grandfather are you sure you feel all right please you mustnt stress yourself come lie down
ah  deirdre bless you  you truly are a sweet child even if i have little time left you give me hope for grannvales future  i can scarcely imagine when kurth would have had as fine a daughter as you  but there is no doubt in my mind none outside the royal house belhalla possess the same brand that graces your brow whence did you come my dear where in the world have you been all along 
im so sorry grandfather  i simply dont remember try as i may i cannot recall even a single thing 
ah forgive me my dear  i know you have suffered more and long than any of us
from the moment i found her lost in the castle grounds it was clear she had no memory of her past all she knew was her own name the rest of her past is lost to her at first i sought only to aid her out of sympathy as any decent man would do but before long love took root within me  with all due respect deirdre not once did i suspect that you could possibly be the daughter of our late prince kurth
i remember well the day you introduce her as the woman you wished to marry  i simply could not believe what i saw at first sight  i knew perhaps as only family can precisely as i thought beneath your circlet lies the brand of naga lord arvis i trust you understand only a full blooded heir to saint heim can rightfully wield the book of naga and release its true holy power and the power of naga is the only power able to oppose the dark lord loptyr
i am well aware of the legend sire
the holy lineage of our lord naga and saint heim must never perish deirdre  you must bear a son with all due haste and should your son be so fortunate as to inherit nagas power  he shall be the prince of grannvale and shall claim the throne once i am no more lord arvis  until your son has grown into a man you shall be his regent guide him well to adulthood i trust you understand  cough cough 
i suppose its our turn  move out carve the terror of the beige ritter into the traitors hearts
n no  no sigurd and to think i was so close  o gods  why  why have you forsaken me 
that was quite the fierce bout sire
mm and to think none of them were grannvales elite listen oifey i need to ask something of you
of course sire what is it
as i recall the territory of isaach should be very close to the north east of lubeck from what ive heard ever since grannvale won the war isaach has been governed by dannan langbalts eldest son but id wager his influence has yet to reach much of the countrys span so 
i beg your pardon sire are you seriously asking me to abandon you for safety now of all times no i refuse i will not leave you sire im here for you no matter what till i draw my last breath
oifey listen  i know this is a huge imposition but please just hear me out i  i dont want to lose seliph he isnt even two years old yet i can hardly fight with an infant in tow please oifey take care of seliph take him and find refuge from this blasted war i know i can trust you oifey you are my only hope
sire  i  very well ill take lord seliph ill protect him no matter what happens that said you have to promise me promise me that youll come for us as soon as this war is over i wont leave you if you cant promise that
of course i swear ill come for the two of you
thank you 
hold it i promised deirdre that ill look after seliph no matter what i wont hand him over to anyone not even oifey until deirdre says i can
calm down shannan  i know youre still hurt about losing deirdre but this isnt helping its okay hell be fine with oifey
no i need to protect seliph and youre forgetting that the people of isaach wont exactly be happy to see more grannvaleans oifey alone wont last a minute there but if im there itll be okay who better to protect seliph in isaach than the prince of isaach please  i promised her 
now that he mentions it sire i would be a tad more at ease if shannan was there as well i know youre reluctant to involve one as young as shannan in something so dangerous but i think we can agree hes become a talented warrior not to mention ill need shannan to secure the peoples support
hm  im sorry to burden you more shannan but please  take care of seliph for me
okay leave it to me im gonna keep getting stronger and nobodyll ever hurt seliph ill teach him all about deirdre but  i wonder how hell take what happened 
i suppose we should get going then farewell sire take care of yourself i pray victory and clemency find you as soon possible
thank you oifey be careful out there
yes sir
seliph  im so sorry please grow up safe and strong 
gentlemen weve not much further to go keep giving it your best rumor has it that sigurds army should be moving south through the yied desert if we keep this pace north we should be able to rendezvous with them sooner or later
quan im so sorry i dragged you into this you and your father were too generous sparing so many soldiers to help my brother even though your father is presently so ill  but are you sure youre both willing to risk crossing a nation as all powerful as grannvale the very thought is terrifying 
ethlyn you know as well as i that leonster a nation built on the legacy of the crusader nova is far stronger than its size suggests no matter what happens i could never regret giving my all for a cause as just as sigurds my father feels precisely the same way theres nothing to worry about ethlyn after all im wielding none other than gáe bolg ill never fail with it at my side sigurd could certainly stand to have my aid
i suppose youre right hed appreciate any help at this point 
ethlyn well be entering hostile territory very shortly the enemy could ambush us at any moment so 
actually quan  ive been thinking this over quite a bit and im coming with you after all id like to see my brother again and i simply cant abandon you now
i cant allow that i let you come with me solely because you promised to return home partway to say nothing of altenas presence look at her a mere babe of three years curled up aslumber in her mothers lap should we be attacked what then
why id fight my hardest to protect her nobody could possibly seize her from me i certainly never intended at first to take her with us but she simply wouldnt stop crying when i tried to leave her behind youre right though  youre right ill take her home
ethlyn im sorry i assure you i do know precisely how you feel but leif is barely born and waiting for you at home our children need their mother please ethlyn return home i left finn to defend the capital youll be safe with him
very well but  id like just a little more time i want to stay by your side a little longer please quan 
ethlyn  very well weve a little more time to spare
hehehe  ah quan the poor sod still has no clue were tailing him and theres a woman with him what a clumsy mistake why i daresay this is the long awaited end of leonsters famous lanceritter those hoovesll be sinking clean into the sand they cant so much as flail at us men close in this is it thracias destiny lies before us ripe for the grasping
what thracian wyvern knights no  you cannot be serious travant has been at our heels all along ethlyn run weve no hope of victory in this blasted desert
but  what will you do
theyre like wild hyenas ethlyn children are little more than easy targets for them thracia has sought to reconquer our territory for centuries i thought my absence would be taken as an invitation so i left finn behind with half the army in case they made the obvious move not once  not even once did i ever suspect they would pursue us instead i  this was all a mistake 
you cant give up now quan itll be okay were together arent we at the very least together well not go down easily
ethlyn  forgive me please 
i see duke langbalt fell in battle 
a arvis what are we supposed to do now it was you who insisted that even if we left the bulk of our armies on conquests with our sons sigurd would pose no threat to me at all the situation before us is not the outcome you promised me
reptor your overreaction is baseless the deck is still stacked in our favor the velthomer army is already lying in wait for the rebels in the yied deserts depths furthermore thracian sellswords should be arriving to reinforce us at any moment the enemy will assuredly be exhausted so long as my army and yours cooperate sigurd and his rebels ought to fall with ease
im holding you to your word this time arvis remember ive no objection to you alone claiming the throne once azmur finally dies but dont you dare forget your allies 
of course must i remind you the instant the dust of this war settles house friege will be granted the agustrian throne to govern house dozel meanwhile will be entrusted with the rule of isaach rest assured reptor i will honor your rights to these territories
hrm  very well then i too will fight with all i have 
kehehehehe  greetings lord arvis the plan proceeds precisely on time i see 
manfroy  if ive told you once ive told you a thousand times  you must not show your face here until the grannvale throne is mine i cannot allow you or your brethren to appear in public do you not understand
oh we understand we understand how you indulge the greed of men as vile as reptor and langbalt we understand how even then you still will not concede the very fact of our existence the plan was to use those two buffoons until they could be used no further then cast them aside and use their sons in their stead  was it not
mm but  hear me well manfroy i refuse to have any part in the revival of your loptyr empire ive no desire to oppress your cult but ive even less of a desire to consign the world to your dark lords rule remember this well yes the blood of loptyrs scions flows in my veins but there is so much more to me than that my loptyrian heritage is that of saint maira a man who fought for the rights of the people and more importantly i am the one true heir to the crusader vala loptyrs sworn enemy i will change this world for the better under my rule humanity shall be free from the pain of prejudice tyranny and oppression what a pity it is that sigurd must die but alas all things require sacrifice
ohohoho  a sacrifice for the sake of the lady deirdre you mean you are terrified lord arvis you fear her memory may someday return 
dont you dare bring her into this need i remind you we are in love nothing will ever come between us
heh heh heh  i suppose you two need to hasten and make proof of this love of yours proof that will one day grow up and rise to be a most magnificent king heh heh heh 
the rebels are finally headed this way heh excellent let them walk right into the range of my welcoming gift meteor spells the desert will gladly claim their bodies
whats this the woman was fool enough to have a child with her ah i see  quans daughter interesting  you there tell quan this if he doesnt surrender gáe bolg his daughter will meet an untimely end heh heh heh  your move quan your move
n no altena  ethlyn  so this is where it ends  travant you can have gáe bolg but dont you dare so much as scratch altena
and so ends quan  magorn youre in charge now head north and give sigurds army a fair share of grief let none of them escape theres a fine bounty on each traitorous head after all
yes sir er that said what are we supposed to do with this child shes just crying and crying we dont know how to handle this shall i put her out of her misery sir
certainly not hand her over to me she and gáe bolg are coming with me back to thracia
cant say i expected this sir if i may why exactly are you taking her home with you
moron youve no need to know keep that mouth of yours out of business that isnt yours
y yes sir i beg your forgiveness sir by your leave sir we will pursue sigurds rebels
good dont fail me
whats this the woman was fool enough to have a child with her ah i see  quans daughter interesting hand her over to me hand her over to me she and gáe bolg are coming with me back to thracia
cant say i expected this sir if i may why exactly are you taking her home with you
moron youve no need to know keep that mouth of yours out of business that isnt yours
y yes sir i beg your forgiveness sir by your leave sir we will pursue sigurds rebels
good dont fail me
good weve finally claimed phinora the fatherland is finally within our reach oifey and shannan  i pray they and seliph are faring well 
lord sigurd i presume welcome to phinora
ah you must be the local elder my apologies for dragging even an oasis town like phinora into this godforsaken war
mm at this point it was unavoidable actually weve just received word of yet another skirmish in the deserts southern depths alas we find ourselves in dangerous times 
in the south you say  what happened there
as we understand it the lance knights of leonster were on a march north they were savaged by thracian wyvern knights en route there were no survivors it seems
w what you cant be serious
im sorry to say i am by the sound of it there was a young girl in the leonster party our hearts all break for the poor dear 
thats  that was ethlyn and quan  forgive  forgive me 
and so ends quan  magorn youre in charge now head north and give sigurds army a fair share of grief let none of them escape theres a fine bounty on each traitorous head after all
yes sir er that said what are we supposed to do with this child shes just crying and crying we dont know how to handle this shall i put her out of her misery sir
certainly not hand her over to me she and gáe bolg are coming with me back to thracia
cant say i expected this sir if i may why exactly are you taking her home with you
moron youve no need to know keep that mouth of yours out of business that isnt yours
y yes sir i beg your forgiveness sir by your leave sir we will pursue sigurds rebels
good dont fail me
lord reptor were depending upon you
of course even so  i cannot help but wonder if arvis will honor his word perhaps  perhaps we are nothing more but sacrifices to him
lord arvis is hard at working making the final adjustments to his velthomer battle plan youve no need to worry sire
very well ill take you at your word then
now if youll excuse me sire i must return to the helm of the velthomer barricades
heh  he hasnt a clue has he wretched fool 
this is it until arvis is ready to move out this battle is ours and ours alone hold to your positions until the enemy stumbles into our range do not move otherwise
this is it the time to strike is upon us with the fire mages of velthomer at our side we shall crush the rebels in one fell swoop
execute the plan concentrate all of your fire on reptor and his army there will be no survivors under any circumstance am i clear
w what velthomer has turned on us argh  so this is what arvis planned all along 
ah lord sigurd im glad to see youre safe
whats going on whats caused velthomers change of loyalties
lord arvis has long been aware of your innocence and was on your side all along this affair in its entirety was dictated by the whims of reptor and langbalt architects of the conspiracy against you lord arvis was unable to act until now as the dukes control of the royal court was simply too powerful to contravene
is that so  alls well that ends well then i can restore my fathers good name in the court and thatll be the end of it
indeed lord arvis and his majesty await your return in belhalla lord sigurd please make your way to the royal city as soon as possible
really very well ill be going then
i hear that lord arvis arranged a ceremonial reception for you with the entirety of the belhalla royal guard quite the magnificent celebration of your glorious return is in order today it seems
thank you after all thats happened the past few years this ought to be a fitting conclusion once were done i should look into getting my allies some compensation for their help they certainly deserve it after all this
indeed sir 
ah lord sigurd truly this is quite the auspicious day congratulations on your triumphant return to the fatherland
its good to see you too lord arvis and thank you for such a lavish greeting if i may ask where is his majesty
alas his majesty is taken severely ill he has become permanently bedridden as such i am administering all affairs of state on his behalf for the time being
is that so im sorry to hear that i bet my misadventures didnt help his majesty feel any better once were finished here i should visit the palace and give him my sincerest apologies
 i think not
hm
sigurd of chalphy i hereby sentence you to death for your crimes of treason his majesty will not be seeing you today or ever
w what what are you talking about lord arvis
heh  you are only realizing now you are far too naïve sigurd need i remind you that you and your father still sought to usurp the throne and plotted against the crown nothing has changed it is my duty to exact justice upon you in the name of my wife princess deirdre i trust you understand sigurd
p princess deirdre that  no it cant be 
ah of course youve never met correct very well i suppose an introduction would be a fair parting gift before your demise come deirdre greet our guests
deirdre allow me to introduce you to sigurd the spawn of your fathers murderer byron i trust you have some choice words for him
so  so this is  sir sigurd
deirdre no  this cant be happening 
why  why are you speaking like this 
deirdre it really is you no  no no no 
do  do you know me sir
of course i do youre my 
enough deirdre stand clear this is an extremely dangerous man rest assured this traitor will be punished
but  he  hes  cant we have even a little more time
unacceptable guards escort the princess to the castle
wait arvis please  just a little more time 
w wait deirdre arvis please i beg of you she  shes my 
enough i grow weary of your ravings attention men we no longer have any use for keeping the traitors alive move in on sigurd and his party the time to serve them their punishment has come
 d  damn you arvis
and thus comes the end of an era
the path of grannvales great unrest arising from the conflict with isaach has led one young man to his grim fate his sorrowful tale and those of countless other valiants are not lost to the world
many heroes lost their lives on this path 
quan the prince of leonster 
ethlyn his wife 
and sigurd the young heir of chalphy 
and the names of those heroes who fought alongside sigurd to the bitter end at belhalla whose fates remain unknown 
these brave youths fought to change the world for the better yet now their unfulfilled dreams lie dead with them on the battlefield 
was their sacrifice in vain what were they fighting for all along
and what of the light 
heard the news grannvales army just swept in and seized lubeck castle oh  i fear for silesses future 
to think silesse remained such a peaceful place for generations and generations argh how did this world turn into such a savage place 
it seems that strengths and abilities are passed down from parents to children youll often find that boysll take up their fathers traits more dominantly while girlsll be more strongly influenced by their mothers
that langbalts got his thugs going around and clearing out every village they can find good thing we somehow kept a little bit of gold hidden away from those brutes go on take it we know you need it more than us
did ya know the famous lord eldigan of nordion and his wife had themselves a little son before he died a while back his names er  ares something like that i feel pretty bad for the poor boy  hes gotta be just three or four years old 
s been a while since grannvale beat isaach in the war but theyre strugglin to put down resistance out in its farthest corners but the people of isaach aint givin up hope prince shannans still out there an they know someday hell lead em to freedom
its terrifying just how far grannvale has fallen from the peaceful nation it used to be all they ever do these days is set their army on every country they can get their hands on prince kurthd be utterly ashamed to know whats become of his beloved grannvale  you have to do something im begging you  go to grannvale take the country back from the wicked folk who are perverting all it holds dear
it cant be  f father thank the gods youre alive
sigurd  what a splendid young man youve become  cough c cough 
father come on you mustnt give in now
no  theres no hope left for me now  listen well my son langbalt was prince kurths true killer and reptor is the one holding his leash  his majesty must know the truth i  death holds no fear for me but i cannot die in peace not knowing if our honor shall be cleansed of these lies
its just as i thought all along  rest assured father our good name will be cleared i promise
sigurd i  i beg your forgiveness  tis my negligence which condemned you to these torments  sigurd  take this it is tyrfing  our exalted blade 
tyrfing  but father surely youll still need this 
take it sigurd use it to  restore our  honor 
f father hold on  please father 
sire 
why  why in the world did he have to  gah  reptor langbalt mark my words you will pay dearly for all youve done
is something wrong brigid
oh aideen you heard about what andrés been up to lately right
i did ive heard of how he murdered our father and later mahnya died in silesse as well  i can barely imagine the evil which would have possessed him to do such monstrous things
 im going to kill andré theres no other way whatever the evil is he has to be stopped right here right now you get what im saying right aideen
brigid 
andrés crimes are house jungbys crimes theyre our crimes too they reflect badly on us even though they really shouldnt i know ill have his blood on my hands for the rest of my life but  aideen i want you to understand
of course i do brigid 
this is the end aideen our final battle
indeed
i have a little gift for you here use this to aid our young comrades
this is a rescue staff is it not thank you but  why me
well  ive yet to speak a word of this to anyone but as my wife  you should know listen well aideen we cannot prevail this war today will end with our defeat everything we hold dear will be lost
 i beg your pardon
such is the decree of the gods that i received at the tower of bragi i too struggled to accept it at first however this is our fate it is inevitable i know i am destined to die in this battle thus i entrust you with this staff
that  you must be lying i cannot believe any of it i cannot please  please tell me this is just a cruel joke 
aideen there is no need to grieve our deaths are not the end but rather a new beginning for us all life is fated to fade into death and with it so too does mortal form die and yet never shall life fade into total nothingness death is but the herald for the next step to a perfect state of being it holds no fear for mankind
but  but claude 
even as i greet death a rebirth awaits  why look no further than yourself for proof within you grows a new life waiting to be born and i too am a part of it this aideen is why you must live on
do  do you realize what youre saying claud asking me to live on while i accept your death  it isnt fair 
aideen   i am richly blessed to have known you and been your husband even so briefly please forgive me 
claude 
hold on  ayra why are you still here didnt i task you with accompanying shannan and oifey to isaach
you did but i feel id always regret abandoning your army at such a crucial hour im with you until the end sigurd
i dont believe this  if youre not going how are you supposed to protect shannan
ah of course my pledge to my late brother  shannan has grown into a strong young man capable of leading his own life my work is done he no longer needs my protection
but 
once ive seen this war through ill return to his side in isaach until then sigurd i wont run away for better or worse im with you
geez azelle you look awful whats going on
oh lex  why are you looking so happy

oh  you know ive always admired you for your resilience lex just thinking about my brother is enough to make me tremble
yeah arvis has always struck me as quite an odd one but hes always been a decent fellow i still cant see him as our enemy 
i know  arvis has always been like a father to me and i never knew my real father the problem is sometimes he just  he just changes its as if he becomes a whole different man thats why i 
thats why you up and left him behind at home right theres nothing wrong with that azelle hes got his life and youve got yours dont beat yourself up about it okay
