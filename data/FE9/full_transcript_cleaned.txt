you have done excellent work ike thanks to you the wound that has scarred begnion for many long years can finally begin to heal as promised begnion now offers its support to crimeas restoration however prime minister sephiran has yet to return which limits the reinforcements i can provide be that as it may what troops i can spare await your command use them as you see fit
i understand thank you thats good news isnt it princess elincia
yes yes it is
this has taught me a valuable lesson our land needs the laguz i also believe that beorc and laguz need each other to survive the previous apostle my grandmother was desirous of such a world as were my own parents princess elincia your father king ramon of crimea was a true pioneer in the area of beorc laguz relations in the very near future i will give the imperial senate a few suggestions on achieving a fully integrated society i doubt the road will be easily traveled but i can no longer turn a blind eye to these issues princess elincia you must rebuild crimea if you are sucessful we will join forces and change the world
empress sanaki your vision surpasses even my own  my father would be so pleased to hear your words
looks like youre through with me ill wait outside until youre finished talking
hold i am most definitely not through with you
huh what did i do now
youre as impudent and impatient as ever heed me ike if you are to help lead the crimean liberation army you must be given a more appropriate title
if youre talking about making me a noble ill decline thanks thats not my kind of thing
you are not in a position to refuse giving some nameless mercenary control of begnions troops would be problematic and more importantly it would affect the troops you will resign yourself to this and receive peerage from princess elincia
what no wait this is absurd blast of all the foolish 
im sorry about this if youre absolutely opposed to it i wont force you
no i have to do whats necessary what am i supposed to do now  put on a funny hat or something
um will you lend me your sword thank you now may i ask you to kneel before me
th thank you all right  let me begin in the name of house crimea i hereby grant you the title and rank of lord and all the honors it conveys rise lord ike
it is done
what an odd feeling
aha your new rank suits you
i completely agree
yes it truly does 
hmm  i suppose not that it matters to me
western begnion is home to a great forest
as the first snow of the season falls the newly commissioned general ike takes control of the crimean liberation army he leads it toward the knife edged mountains that mark the border between begnion and daein
at one time these woods were home to the kingdom of serenes and ruled by the heron clan of the bird tribes
following the serenes massacre the forest lost its color and vitality some said it was the sorrow of the goddess made real for twenty long years the devout citizens of begnion trembled in shame and loathing over the crime they had committed
the begnion empress apostle sanaki stepped forward as representative of her countrymen
kneeling before the surviving heron prince and princess she gave voice to the apology of her people
she spoke not as one nation to another but as neighbors on the same continent the massacre was unforgivable however hatred breeds hatred and if the cycle of grief and anger is not broken it will continue for time without end it was with this in mind that the herons accepted the apostles apology
and so it was that serenes forest was returned to its former glory
afterward as payment for ikes service princess elincia gained the services of a regiment of begnion army regulars
though of common birth ike receives peerage from the princess and is given command of the army
so theyve left begnion have they
according to our spy they march with a regiment of begnions army they plan to take a land route through daein and then into crimea
hah they plan to cut across daein with nothing more than a single regiment at whose core is a tattered band of ragtag mercenaries gawains son leads this rabble yes how does he stand up to his fathers legacy
he doesnt hes just a boy not yet worthy of his fathers name
hmph disappointing
though his skill with the blade is rough there is something uncanny about him people seem drawn to him and not just begnions apostle either hes also gained the trust of the serenes survivors and of king phoenicis as well
the herons are alive
it appears that two members of the royal family survived
heh heh  look how nicely the tables been set for us bring one of them to me  i care not which one and i want the medallion as well
 as you wish
once we cross that great wall well be in daein look there atop that building daein wyvern riders on patrol they wont be happy to see us
tell me general ike have you faced wyvern riders in combat
only a few times i got the impression that the kilvas ravens were the more dangerous foe
if thats your impression then you have yet to fight true wyvern riders
what do you mean
i have no way of judging the ones we see here but i know another unit one that was attached to begnions temple guard they had their reasons for leaving  but the important thing to remember is that they are exceedingly powerful
which explains why the apostle sent you to accompany us
thats right pegasus knights fare better than most against wyvern riders we know the skies as well as they do
yeah i prefer to keep my feet on the ground thank you can i entrust the flying business to you
of course well bring honor to the name of the apostles sacred guards
my lord ike are preparations complete
yes the enemy should not yet be aware that weve come this far were going to launch a surprise attack and try to capture the wall on our first charge please wait for us at the base camp
very well 
theres no need to look so worried were well prepared and weve got you as our good luck charm
thank you for that but do be careful my lord ike
hey dont worry this may be our first battle as an official army but weve fought daein many times were going to win after all i cant lose my very first battle as a snooty noble now can i
i believe in you and i know that you will be victorious come back safe
it appears the crimean army has arrived its time to put our plan into action
the main body of the kilvas army will wait atop the western summit a small unit will remain here and cooperate with you this is correct is it not
mm it is
what could his majesty be thinking why does daein ally herself with some backwater sub human nation
 i dont know theres no way we can expect to understand the supreme thoughts of the king all we can do is perform the tasks set before us by his highness that is everything
yes of course
the crimean army has no idea were aware of their every move bah what vermin  what does that untrained group of vagabonds think they can do i dont care how talented he is their commander is nothing more than a young mercenary with delusions of grandeur weve nothing to fear
well show them what real war is like and the kilvas ravens how should we deal with them
those sub human freaks lets use them as bait we can sacrifice them and reduce our own human casualties
a fantastic idea
make sure that the men are thoroughly instructed
yes sir
you there halt mmm youre an unfamiliar face
youll know it soon enough
y you filthy piece of offal you will bow your head to a superior officer
 
hes got a lot of nerve hasnt he is he one of yours
yes sir hes a new recruit who was only assigned to me today please accept my apologies for his lack of any training or manners whatsoever
if hes good i can overlook almost any character flaw go and kill as many crimeans as you can help my name be remembered with honor and glory
yes sir
 pah
come to me dregs of crimea i will teach what it means to oppose the might of daein
is everyone ready lets move out
hold a moment my lord ike in the sky somethings coming
whos that
ah ike well met it appears that youre getting ready for your first battle as crimeas army
and youre escorting the heron siblings back to phoenicis right
that was the original plan but someone here insisted that we follow you quite unreasonably i might add
you treated us with courtesy beorc we must act accordingly isnt that so leanne
yes yes brother
you said your name was ike correct
yes
you aided my sister and me during a time of danger we herons hold courtesy in high esteem we must repay our debt to you
thats really not necessary
we are practitioners of seid magic we cannot fight but we can imbue our allies with strength if you so wish it i will travel with you in this way i will repay you for what you have done
 
you were lucky to find your sister shouldnt you stay by her side
leanne understands what i do
i see in that case welcome
thank you i swear on the honor of my clan to do all i can to strengthen your cause
its settled then and youll get aid from me as well janaff
right here your majesty
youll go with the crimean army and protect reyson
leave it to me
you too ulki all right
of course
tibarn its too much i cannot accept this youre already watching over leanne and my father as well
these past twenty years  i know what its been like for you living in phoenicis im only sorry i cant do more
tibarn  i thank you from the bottom of my heart
king phoenicis i will guard reyson well when crimea is retaken i will see him safely returned to you
i will take you at your word your actions have created a bond of trust between yourselves and the hawk and heron clans if you find yourself in a dire position you can call on me no matter what i will fly to your aid
we gained a strong ally where we had not thought to look for one didnt we
yes beorc and laguz beast tribe and bird tribe theres no difference between us we finally understand one another

pah its enough you beat me now you gotta talk me to death
ill say it once more come back to the company i acknowledge your abilities as commander i want you with us
 lets have another go around i win and im commander agreed
i win and you fall in line agreed
dont worry boy ill make it quick
lets go
general weve seized control of the surrounding area and the remaining daein troops are retreating  general
oh right understood
i beg your leave
general eh weird
you know you never look relaxed
nasir whats going on we havent seen much of you lately
ive been a bit busy in order to leave begnion i had to sell my ship and dismiss the crew there was a lot to take care of
is that so heh it looks like youve been caught up in our struggle after all are you all right with that i mean i know youve got a lot of your own matters to handle
its not like ive abandoned my own interests to join up with the crimean army for me ive judged that theres value in traveling with you so dont worry about it overly much
if you say so youre a fairly knowledgable fellow so its nice having you around
ha i think thats mutual now then ive got some good news
what is it
senior officials in gallia are moving to action until now theyve been content to take a defensive stance and wait it out but  it appears this neverending stalemate has exhausted their patience ike this victory here today was a very important thing it may prove to be a decisive first step in breaking daeins power news of it will spread like wildfire over the entire continent and give countries confidence to speak out against daein with crimea as a rallying point gallia may well be moved to join this war you just need to keep winning if you can do that the road will open before you
history will be made could daein truly fall at our hands can i make that happen me
use what youve been given and great things will happen you have it in you to lead ike for now its merely one portion of the bird tribes but your relationship is established its because you resolved to gain their trust and then made it happen
its all due to my father if my actions prove to be the right ones it will be due to the way my father raised me if you treat others in good faith they will follow you of their own volition thats what he taught me
he was a magnificent man wasnt he
when i was younger i wanted nothing more than to be as strong as my father and then i wanted to surpass him now that is a goal ill never achieve
 
whats that the borders been breached
everyone was defeated not only the daein troops but our brigade as well cut down like wheat in a field
huh well that was impressively done er for a band of sellswords that is theres nothing else to do send a message to the daein command and tell them the enemy is stronger than expected
at once
wait hold a moment
yes
send a daein human instead i dont care which one just dont use any of our troops
but a wingless human will take such a long time to  
general petrine commands the next front shes a very temperamental woman  but go if you like tell her that the kilvas ravens have been defeated  shell roast you like a chicken and use your bones for stock
un understood i will find a human
whos there
 
soren what are you doing here
what are you planning
where did that come from ive no idea what youre talking about
dont play dumb with me were past that gallias decision to join in this war was based on some new information they received wasnt it
 
cat got your tongue fine ill tell you what youve been doing here  you were to deliver princess crimea to begnion to see if she could garner any support for her cause and  regardless of whether she got that assistance or not  to judge if she was worthy of laguz support am i wrong
if youve figured all of this out why remain silent
because your actions were beneficial to princess crimea i determined that even if left to your own devices you would not harm the princess
it sounds like you dont think thats the case anymore
you accomplished both missions but youve come back anyway to what end
i dont have to explain myself to you
thats true only until i reveal your purpose to ike
everyone has a secret or two that he wants to bury somewhere deep including you soren
 i dont know what you mean
oh i trust that we understand each other the army rises early tomorrow i suggest we turn in
the enemy knew we were coming today
and you think im responsible
yes i do
my oh my  you really are suspicious arent you good night soren
 
general ike all troops are ready to move out
all right can you have them wait
do you want them to fall out and wait in their tents or would you rather they form up and stand at attention
go ahead and have them stand down ill call them when im ready
yes sir
 
begging your pardon sir all troops have been ordered to stand down however general tanith requests her orders are her pegasus knights to stand down as well
am i supposed to decide that too
general ike  youve been given command of the entire army sir we will not move without your orders sir
general taniths troops are to follow general taniths orders
understood sir general taniths pegasus knights will not be deployed unless there is a request for reinforcements those are the orders of general tanith by your leave sir
 
tanith do you have a moment
general ike what is it is there a problem
i thought you might be able to provide me with some information
yes
what can you tell me about king daein id like to know something of him before i have to face him in battle
truth be told ive never fought him either i cannot give you any specifics but i will tell you what little i do know
please whatever you can tell me would be appreciated
ashnards coronation let me see  yes it was eighteen years ago you see a plague had struck the capital spreading out to affect the surrounding region of nevassa and beyond ashnard was crowned the year after that great tragedy finally subsided in the entire history of tellius no calamity has claimed the lives of so many beorc and laguz  not since the great flood two years before it struck begnion and the entire population of serenes was nearly obliterated the year after that close to a thousand beorc  nobles and peasants alike  perished in daein
nobles you say so the royal family fell victim to this plague as well
yes the reigning king and queen and some twenty or so princes and princesses fell ill and everyone who fell ill perished for a time the people despaired of losing the entire royal bloodline of daein it seemed that none would survive
and yet ashnard survived
he did it is quite interesting in a sense you see his name was never mentioned in any talk of succession before that time he was of such a distant bloodline that he was unlikely to be king in another place though his name was already well known
where was that
on the battlefield as you know daein is home to many brave warriors at the time then prince ashnard was said to have been a match for an entire troop of pegasus knights begnion and daein both keep close watch over their borders and their patrols fought in many skirmishes although there was no war to speak of these land disputes did end with daein claiming a small portion of begnion soil it would be no exaggeration to say this was soley due to the strength of one man ashnard
 
forgive me i have spoken longer than i intended its about time we get back to the business of marching preparations
no thank you for telling me so much if we have another chance please share more of your stories
understood
ike which troop should we fall in with we have received no orders yet
tormod muarim i know ive asked you many times but are you sure you want to be here
you keep asking that maybe you dont want us here  is that it i dont know what to think
no its not that at all to be honest the battle ahead is going to be hard  it looks bleak id rather that those without direct ties to crimea not get involved
a bleak battle what about trying to free all the slaves in begnion now those were bleak battles bleak battles are our specialty right muarim
yes you are yet thanks to ikes time in begnion things have changed completely
thats right the apostle has promised to press her investigation until theres not a single laguz slave left in the entire nation so theres no reason for you two to continue fighting is there you dont owe me anything  
were going to fight with you ike we want to help
it is our right to join you in this just as it is your right to refuse us
to be perfectly frank i would be willing to beg to get you to join us both of you all right
all right
ha ha you can count on us
/***EOF***/
well were here welcome to toha crimeas westernmost port city
whats with this place the people are going about their business why arent they worried about daein about the war
its because this area is fairly isolated daeins army hasnt come this far and so life goes on as before daeins plan is to seize the capital then slowly and steadily expand its sphere of influence until it controls everything
surely these people have some idea of whats happening
ignorance is a form of bliss is it not these people dont know what its like to lose a war they dont want to know crimea as a nation has always been blessed by peace perhaps this is due to the temperament of its rulers but the country hasnt seen serious warfare for centuries while minor skirmishes with the kingdom of daein have been legion only the eastern borderlands have taken damage
and yet even i know this peace will not last when we met daein forces on our scouting mission they attacked us merely for being within the crimean border
humans are shameless creatures that carelessly ignore any misfortune which does not befall them directly they can  and often do  turn a blind eye to all manner of wickedness so long as it does not touch them or their kin they will bow their heads condemning those victims for bringing calamity upon themselves and then they will cast their eyes toward heaven in thanks while their neighbors lay dying around them
but the war is happening here this is their home not someone elses
when the daein army darkens their doorsteps perhaps they will understand when the peace they take for granted is shattered and their sons and daughters slaughtered in the streets perhaps then will they comprehend the misfortunes they so long pretended not to see i have no sympathy for them
 
my goodness the nastier the truth the blunter he gets quite a delightful staff officer you have there
he um he has an undeniable streak of severity in him but but this somethings bothering him thats for sure
its to be expected even im a bit shocked by this place can they truly be as placid as they appear sorens a very empathetic young man the emotions of this place may have proven to be too much for him
ignoring impending doom because you cannot prevent it fatalism is by nature a disheartening beast well for all those born with nothing there are those born with everything perhaps those who never notice the difference are the ones we should envy
whats that supposed to mean
huh oh i was talking to myself pay me no mind
hmm 
now then ive got to see a man about a ship while im gone why dont you get your supplies squared away im sure that the journey ahead will require a lot of packing
ranulf ill go with you
no no thats all right you should supervise the supply acquisition youre going to be at sea for months you know
i know that but 
what is it titania
shes worried about me she doesnt want to leave a solitary laguz wandering around a beorc city
but i thought crimea and gallia were allied nations why would a wandering laguz be cause for concern
well it shouldnt be but 
do you remember what king caineghis told you the friendship between crimea and gallia exists only between the ruling classes it hasnt taken root in the minds of the common citizenry at all
that being said things have improved quite a bit since king ramon ascended to the throne the reports of hunts and such other horrors have all but disappeared oh dont worry ill be fine ive got connections see its not like ill be roaming the docks begging for passage
all right then the job is yours lease be careful
you too dont mess anything up
we should be leaving but looks like everyones going to be a while yet
my lord ike are you ready to go
me as long as ive got my sword im always ready
a sword thats it
if ive got my cape i can sleep just about anywhere and as for food well something always turns up
hee hee thats delightful
it is
yes very much so tee hee hee
princesses i dont think ill ever understand them
whats going on why all the excitement
my lord ike theres a crowd gathering at the town entrance 
thats  
attention citizens weve received reports of crimean army stragglers hiding in this town from this point forth the daein army will blockade all points of entry no one comes or goes without our leave the harbor is also closed no ships will be allowed to sail
ike daein troops have  
i know all we can do is move toward the docks and try not to be discovered
have you seen ranulf
not yet
wait here he comes now ranulf over here
hoo things sure are heating up arent they
how are things on your end
everythings set all you need to do is sneak down to the harbor youll be met there by a man with a dusky pallor his name is nasir nasir is a man you can trust ive explained your situation to him and hes willing to help if you can reach his ship safely hell take care of everything and deliver you to begnion
ranulf arent you coming too
i was planning on it but daeins movements have me concerned ill stay behind and see whats going on
oh im sorry i wasnt watching where i was going 
no pardon me  
ah eeeeeeek su sub human
blast
i its true a sub human how dare you come prowling around here
beast ya stinking sub humans need to learn yer place human towns are too good for ya
eww its so hairy go on scat
get out of here monster
dang
mordecai
ike we must leave
what no we have to help ranulf 
all of this noise will attract the attention of the daein troops
thats why we have to hurry up and help  
hell be fine leave him
ranulf is strong even stronger than me its all right
ranulf has no intention of defending himself look hes not even changing forms i cant just stand by and watch as he gets murdered
ike wait
 idiot human 
stop get out of my way keep your hands off him
who do ya think ya are why would a human want to protect some sub human
hes a friend to this monster i saw them talking earlier
whats that to you
hey the crimean royals had sub human companions didnt they maybe youre one of those army guys the daein troops are searching for
you there daein soldier ho there are some suspicious folk over here
huh that way hurry
are you mad your king was murdered by daein and now youre going to cooperate with them
well um 
i heard the king was teamin up with those sub humans thats what got him killed
yeah thats right if we need allies ill take flesh and blood daein humans over some fanged sub human freak
yeah yeah at least we know what were getting trust your own kind
you people are insane
wheres the sub human everyones screaming about
huzzah the toha vigilantes are here grab those guys and turn them over to the daein army that will prove our allegiance and gain our village favor
har har if you want sub humans hunted down im your man
ranulf are you all right
why did you come back
because some fool was going to lay here and get beaten to death instead of defending himself
ah ike what would you have me do gallia and crimea have formed an alliance i cannot jeopardize that by harming these people no matter what ill they may bear me
even if none of them care two figs for their own country
even if theyre citizens of crimea after all
well im not gallian so theres no reason for me to hold anything back
ike listen to me they think that you and i are allies if you attack its no different than if i do so myself so 
let me guess youre telling me to avoid the daein pursuit leave the town vigilantes alone get to the docks as soon as possible find a man named nasir and get everyone on his boat is that it
exactly i dont care what anyone else says i think youre pretty bright
all right ill play along but mark my words if they attack heads will roll
what hey thats not going to do us any good
titania soren get everyone together were getting out of here
listen to me do not let a single crimean soldier escape our grasp sweep the entire town arrest anyone suspicious
general mackoya sir theres a group of vigilantes who want to help us what shall i tell them
hmm very well let them do as they please
yes sir
pardon me are you the commander of these forces
i am and who are you
im captain of the boat you see moored here my name is nasir i stopped by to accomplish some brief piece of business but your soldiers are now preventing me from setting sail i need to leave this place
i apologize for the inconvenience however we are trying to stop some crimean soldiers from escaping to that end we need the cooperation of all citizens ship captains included
my ship is a simple merchant vessel sailing under the flag of the begnion empire if i present such documentation surely it will prove i have no ties whatsoever with crimea
under daein rule such begnion papers are nothing more than fishwrap
yet  
you called yourself nasir correct protest too loudly nasir and we may think you a crimean sympathizer if that were to happen who knows what unfortunate fate might your simple merchant ship 
 i see so be it
you there soldier
sir
strengthen the watch on this ship that man is up to something i can feel it no matter what happens that ship must not be allowed to set sail burn her and sink her first
yes sir
now then where is our special guest
im right here general mackoya
oh sir black knight i hope i didnt keep you waiting
no i just arrived let us proceed i would hear your report
there are no problems whatsoever ive nothing to report save the tedium of it all the farther west we travel the weaker the crimean fighting spirit becomes each town displays less and less resistance  now they literally throw wide the gates at first sign of our approach with duty as humdrum as this i worry that my troops may become sloppy and lose their edge
as a fellow warrior i can sympathize with your plight
i thank you for your understanding
this town was not scheduled for subjugation until much later tell me why are you here now
yes as to that mere days ago a castle that held crimean prisoners of war was attacked and the captives freed the perpetrators were crimean soldiers accompanied by sub humans according to our intelligence reports their trail led here 
i see
the princess of crimea is said to have fled to gallia if we can capture this band we may gain information on her location
do you require my assistance
i thank you for the generous offer however if you were to enter the fray it would be over in a twinkling my men are starved for combat i would beg your restraint so that they may be allowed some entertainment
as you will the field is yours turn your soldiers loose and may their blades run red with glory
your graciousness is greatly appreciated
good luck ike youll be fine as for me i think ill play a little game of cat and mouse with these daein fools
the gallian sub human after him dont let him get away
everyone move out for the harbor try to avoid conflict with the local vigilante group if you can lets go
hey are there really sub humans about
oh yeah no mistake about it and theyll as soon kill you as look at you
where are they
theyre over there cunning beast were just about to start flushing them out of hiding
i see if you find one be sure to give me a call
har har i like that guy he came to our little town just for the chance to hunt sub humans
ah
grrr flee youre crimean i cannot fight you
hold on please i am not an enemy to laguz
l laguz  how do you  
i joined this vigilante group because i knew it would afford me a chance to help you flee listen ill distract the townspeople while theyre worried about me you can make good your escape
i cannot trust the word of a human
 i see well if i cut down these vigilantes will you believe me
huh
one two all of them how many do you want just give the word and ill start the cutting
hsss quiet why why would you 
i want to help you thats all
 i see  youre not an enemy that much ill believe 
thank you now you must hurry away from this place
no i cannot flee i have fr friends with whom i must board a ship
will you not desist its much too dangerous the vigilantes and daeins want nothing  more than to kill laguz
im not leaving
i see if thats your stance then ive no choice
hm
i will join your group
dont dont be ridiculous
whats your name
i am lethe but  
thats a good name
thats beside the point you  
i am zihark well met lethe whoops i dont think we have time for formal introductions lets hurry
h hold it i have not agreed to this
ah
you are a vigilante we must avoid vigilantes you should flee
you would speak so to the vigilante group thats hunting you youre a kind laguz arent you
hm my words are not good you must go quickly
no you are the one who should flee leave the rest to me ill confuse the townsfolk and give you time to run
what why

ohmygosh are you are you really fighting daein ooo thats so brave weve heard so many rumors about crimeas defeat thats why everyone in town acts like they do no one has the courage to stand up to these fierce daein forces everyone believes that if they just cooperate life here will go on as it always has please take this magic scroll it was my brothers he was murdered by the daein army fight for him too
h h heavens please dont kill me ill give you whatever you want here have some yarn uh  dried fish
 
 the mercenaries boarded the ship safely now how to proceed 
youre not impeding that ship i wont allow it
one of gallias beast warriors ive met you once before yes at the castle near the sea of trees
from where im standing weve actually met twice
oh
i saw you that night standing in the light of the full moon the night you murdered sir greil
ha ha so you were the one traveling with the beast king eh interesting by measuring his aides strength i will naturally learn more of the kings true power
hate to tell you this but my king is not to be measured against the likes of me he is far beyond that
all the better now then let us begin
 
 ugh why why do my attacks do nothing
you fight impressively however you are no match for me
huh
hm
rise leave this to me
you you were one of the prisoners 
this knight will not raise his hand to me correct
 
go now quickly
if you insist ill give proper thanks when next we meet
commander haar let us pursue the enemy ship theyre friends of the sub humans we cannot allow them to escape
uwaaaaaahhh that was a good nap well looks like the fightings over form upits time to withdraw
listen to me jill were scheduled to return home tomorrow if you were injured in a place like this your lord father would not be pleased
its because of my father that i must not return home empty handed i must have something to show him please  
simmer down girl the black knight has ordered us to withdraw would you ignore his word
th that 
would be suicide correct so lets move out
blast
m my lord black knight a ship is departing if we ready our own ship and set sail without delay we can overtake it immediately
 
listen to me daein general you will withdraw from this place i will not allow you to pursue that ship
who are you to speak to me so do you have any idea who i am
gather your men withdraw
yet we  
i will not repeat myself do it now
yes yes at once
are you sure thats true
yes you can ask these two for more details
the two of us were here representing the townsfolk
you say that a green haired lass boarded that ship
y yes she had a very noble bearing about her and she was beautiful
her name was ellie ellen they called her something like that
its true princess elincia ha ha  my luck has changed
all of us all the townsfolk are ready to cooperate in any way we can if you would keep that in mind um 
believe me i understand your loyalty
well then 
you there come here
yes sir right here
get these two worms out of here find the hardest physical labor in this town and get these fools started work em from dusk to dawn without stopping work em until they can no longer move you got that
yes sir understood sir
b but thats 
why why would you 
stop your whining how else am i to reward worms vile enough to sell their own princess to the enemy enjoy your payment you greedy dastards ha ha ha ha ha ha
our own princess thats not it cant be it cant
no nooooooo
my lord ike how wonderful i didnt think you were going to make it 
im sorry to have worried you
oh no im just happy to see you well so very happy
brother you stupid fool fighting a knight as strong as that you idiot i was so scared 
im sorry mist
who cares 
you really were frightened im sorry i truly am
 all right 
huff huff whew i doubt the enemy will pursue me this far
a warrior such as you wounded did a beorc give you that bruise
master giffca owwwww
the king told me to come and check on you dont move hm youre plenty banged up but nothing appears to be broken
theres one among the daein army whose power is overwhelming to move with such speed with all that armor i tell you its not right and now the kings forced to use you his shadow warrior to check up on me our ministers are as obstinate as ever no matter what happens they will not approve of an alliance with the beorc
nothing to be done about that every one of the older retainers has memories of laguz subordination even the king if princess elincia were not king ramons orphan i doubt he would be willing to aid her
perhaps youre right at any rate the princess and the others are now safely at sea
and the watchdog no signs of carelessness i presume
of course noteven the elders will bend their ears to hear what that one says  that one is special after all
and how do you see this princess elincias drive for the reconstruction of crimea does she have a chance
eh who can say which way the wheel turns depends on ike and his mercenaries success and failure are but a hair removed
so this company which has done nothing but flee controls the fate of the kingdom thats a dangerous gamble isnt it
all gambles are dangerous master giffca but no mistake about it daeins next target is gallia we must go home and prepare
 princess crimea did she board the ship to begnion with the remainder of gawains mercenaries
yes
the hindrance that was gawain is dead the location of the medallion will soon be known has our worm worked itself into the group
it appears that our worm has been accepted as a trusted member of the company
heh heh heh all is going as planned now we let them swim as they please
 there is one thing i met someone unexpected at the harbor
who
the prime minister of the begnion empire 
what is that true if he is nosing about we must not make any mistakes did he give any indication he had caught on to our plans
that i do not know he did tell me to deliver a message to you overreaching ambition invites disaster
pah nonsense our only concern is the princess of crimea and the medallion we must wait and watch until such time as we can strike
 
in the interim i want you to take charge of the invasion of gallia be smart you must not allow gallia to bring their full might to bear understood
 as you will
hey there traveler do you have everything you need if you stop by my humble shop youll find the best deals in town whattya say interested
yeah that sounds great listen can i ask you a question
no problem you can ask me anythingespecially if its about my low low prices
what do the townspeople think of daein you knew that they were coming didnt anyone think to flee crimea
flee dont be absurd
but crimea lost the war
yeah i know and honestly that doesnt really affect us common folk ya know the truth is we dont care who sitson the throne to us theyre all just faceless beings who rule from on high if they tried to raise taxes or something you better believe wed protest but otherwise 
i mean take the king of daein hes just another man right if we keep working he can keep living the high life so its not like hes going to treat us poorly or anything as long as we can live our lives and have a little happiness we arent going to worry about it all too much
oh but if we were invaded by gallia well thats a different story altogether if our country were overrun by those savage beasts who knows what could happen now that scares me
 
what the hey wait come back what about my low low prices now what was that all about
pardon me buddy i havent seen you around town before you a traveling mercenary
yes i suppose you could say that
nice sword you look like a man who knows his business if youre looking for work ive a proposition for you
a proposition
i run a vigilante group that helps keep our fair town safe a strong man like you would be most welcome
thanks but ive got something lined up
oh really thats too bad heading out to sea
maybe
har har cautious to the end i like that well just in case you are i want you to have this
hm whats this
its a special sword itll come in handy if you ever find yourself at sea not that you would har har
really youre giving me a sword are you sure
well there is one condition once youve finished your job you come back and see me id like you to reconsider that vigilante position
understood thanks again for the blade
 
princess
my lord ike 
why are you here all by yourself thats not very safe
i was looking at the town im unfamiliar with the world outside the imperial villa where i was raised this is the first time ive been able to see how other people live everything is so new and different to my eyes this is a town isnt it theres so much energy and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves
with all the boats coming in and out of the harbor this towns livelier than most thats for sure
its like nothing has happened all the death and destruction weve seen feels like horrible dream 
mmm 
haa yaaa hiiii yaaaa
what are you doing
im trying to regain the superb physique i lost when i was being held prisoner
are you ready to board the ship
i was born ready hoooo ha i dont need anything even as we speak many of my fellow crimeans are suffering at the hands of daein if i cannot rush to their aid today then i can at least prepare myself for the day when i can
i see well when were ready ill let you know
understood
sorry to have interrupted you
my lord ike
what is it
you rescued and cared for princes elincia you have my heartfelt thanks she for us she is our one solitary hope
yeah
right enough talking
until we make our triumphant return to melior all i can do is keep training haaa nyaaa whaaaaaaaaaaa
careful dont pull anything 
 
what are you looking at
oh just this its sort of a good luck charm my family gave it to me when i left home we never had much money so my parents gathered some stones from our farm back home and put them in this leather pouch its not much to look at but it means a lot to me every day i take them out and talk to them like theyre my family how is everyone im out here doing the best i can dont worry ill be home soon just stuff like that i know it sounds foolish but if i dont do this i wont i wont have the courage to fight
 
dont worry about my feelings you can laugh acting like this at my age what a silly man i am
its not silly brom youre a strong man who has decided to fight for the sake of his family i know that your family is very proud of you
 sniff s s sniff mm thank you ike sniff  thank you
well thats that
are you ready to go nephenee
ah ike 
what is it
 um nope nothin im fine
are you sure
yeah sure im sure
you know its hard being a prisoner its physically and mentally demanding i need to know can you fight
not a problem
its easy for you to say but you sound like youre about to fall over
that aw no thats a habit its just the way i talk just talkin sorry
no need to apologize as long as youre not feeling ill everythings fine all right ill see you later
right then 
/***EOF***/
during the battle for talrega ike and the rest of his company come to a bleak realization wherever the crimean army marches the land becomes a battlefield the damage is immense warfare and floodwaters claim homes crops and hope villagers seeking shelter and safety stumble blindly through the snow to them there is no doubt that the crimeans are an invasion force
however the crimeans have their own homeland to save focused as they are on that overriding goal they cannot stop even to help the innocent victims of war the only way they can help the people of daein is to keep marching the faster they reach daeins capital of nevassa and put an end to the war the better for everyone
what are you telling me that his majesty has not yet returned
yes sir weve sent many messengers but we have yet to receive any sort of official response
the crimean army is on our doorstep what is his highness thinking if we want to protect the capital we need a leader equal to one of the four riders just in case 
im sure the king has considered this
lady ena i dont understand how youre able to remain so calm
daein soldiers are the most elite warriors on the continent in addition our numbers are far superior to the crimeans
and and yet they march on nevassa this is the daein capital if theres any danger of it falling into enemy hands we can let nothing stop us from protecting it no offense lady ena but as a general i do not feel youre ready for such a vital command
i i think you are exactly right
th then  when this command was given to you why did you not firmly refuse
do you really think that wise general would you refuse a direct order from the king
um 
 let me tell you something that ive discovered if we are unable to hold the capital i do not believe the king will be all that upset ashnard does not hold a strong attachment to the country of daein
what are you talking about do you do you understand exactly what it is you are saying
yes
ridiculous there isnt a monarch in the world who would not be moved by the loss of his own country such a preposterous notion is beyond comprehension
general kasatai do not avert your eyes from reality
reality ha what reality is that all i see is your guesswork
then tell me why did the king suddenly order the invasion of crimea
as as sanctions for that nation choosing to ally itself with those evil and treacherous sub humans
on the surface that would seem to be so but doesnt the action strike you as odd to apply sanctions properly it would be necessary to speak with begnion first begnion is the suzerain state and crimea answers to her we needed begnions leave to make a formal declaration of war daeins disregard for that process made us a pariah in the eyes of our neighbors and opened us to attack from all sides and yet not only did the king not do this but he chose to invade without warning it was the worst possible strategy furthermore once the king conquered crimea through strength of arms he seized the castle and set up residence and now he uses it as a stepping stone for an invasion of gallia which means the kings goal was never to apply sanctions or even to defeat crimea if ashnard moves against gallia its easy to envision phoenicis kilvas and goldoa joining the conflict and if that happens begnion would be forced to ally itself with daein rather than side with the sub humans look where that leads us a continent embroiled in war is that not the true desire of the king
if  if you consider it in that way your words do begin to make sense yet to accomplish that the citizens of crimea would have to be sacrificed that would be an act of madness
lets return to the topic at hand the king has gained himself a new castle and i believe he considers whatever land he occupies to be his kingdom daein and its people are already behind him he need not look back
pah if the king wished to rule the world he would want as much military strength as possible to forsake even a portion of the strength he currently possesses willingly why it would be sheer folly 
that doesnt matter whats important is that we recognize the chance which daein has been given we must stop the crimeans here if we do not show the king our value we are doomed make no mistake about it
this is complete lunacy 
we will receive no reinforcements we must hold nothing back it is our only chance of survival
this i cannot  why is this  
be strong the king has provided us and the capital with one final measure we will use it to weather this storm however to use it i need you general kasatai your cooperation is imperative if you want to win you must trust me
 understood in this time let us cling to any hope we can find lady  no  general ena i place my trust in you
so this is the daein capital eh if we can just defeat king ashnard this war will be over
ike  here you are
what is it nasir
are you sure that you have enough soldiers to lay siege to the capital your opponent is called mad king ashnard after all who knows what sort of traps he has in store for you
he may indeed have something planned surely theyve received reports of our advancement yet its so quiet 
it looks like every able bodied man has been conscripted into the army while women and children have evacuated the area
were not invaders we wouldnt lay a hand on the citizenry 
theres no way for them to know that they do know what their army did to the people of crimea however if they fear they will be punished for that im sure they decided to err on the side of caution
what what happened to the crimean people surely only the soldiers were imprisoned or killed 
 you truly have no idea how to rule a nation do you know what happens to a country that loses a war everything is destroyed homes land crops everything and the citizens  theyre not even treated as human crimeans especially those near the capital where daeins presence is strongest are treated worse than sub hum than laguz
thats  why would they thats horrible 
the people understand this which is why they pay for protection in the form of taxes for the royals and nobles who are charged with protecting the people there is no greater sin than to be defeated in war it is the ultimate betrayal of the peoples trust
sniff  ah by the goddess i am a fool  sniff 
soren enough
 
princess be that as it may the majority of people want to see the royal family restored to power they believe that you will help them reclaim their old lives and restore peace
now its time for us to throw down ashnard and drive his army from crimean soil youre the only one who can do that do you understand
yes yes i do i  i will save the people of crimea this i swear
as ive said before i wont be turned away if there are traps we just fight our way through this war ends here
yes im with you all the way
i hope it all goes as planned i will do my best to make it so
 
general ike sir the castle gates are open
thats not good what are they planning
it must be a trap
this is unexpected making us lay siege would be far and away to their advantage i have no idea what theyre playing at
even so we will not back down right ike
right if we cant tell what theyre planning it matters not how we proceed lets just fight as we go move out keep your guard up everyone
enemy troops have entered the castle
theyre moving already such recklessness dont they suspect a trap i cant believe theyve fallen for it
crimea follows a general named ike perhaps he follows no procedure perhaps he relies solely on instinct
i dont know if hes brave or merely reckless its unbelievable 
regardless we continue as planned close the gate and seal off their escape route this contest will be decided here
n now then its time for the final measure you spoke of earlier will you show us what his majesty left for us what could possibly allow us to destroy an army in one fell swoop provided we can herd them here
general kasatai no matter what i show you do not be shocked you must continue to trust me without question
i swear it on my name as a royal knight of daein i will not betray you general ena
thank you 
ge general ena youre 
 
aaaaaaah
general kasatai have you forgotten your vow no matter what happens we will protect the capital yes
ah  ah  yes of course i understand this is his majestys  why he left you here 
yes
we will win this battle a legendary dragon of goldoa is on our side it is a powerful omen daein cannot lose the daein army is indestructible we will crush the dogs of crimea and use their skulls as goblets
stop all of you get ahold of yourselves you must not panic no one has attacked
ike
titania where is princess elincia
shes fine shes with the supply convoy theyre all under very close guard
soren is this the enemy trap
 it could be 
if so to what end
well the goal obviously isnt to divide our troops and reduce our fighting strength were all packed in here together whatever they are planning it appears that they want us all to experience it at the same time
daein must have something which they believe gives them an insurmountable advantage some kind of ultimate weapon
so theyre absolutely sure theyll win is that it king ashnard of daein youll regret underestimating us
no matter what we must be cautious we can spare no efforts to protect the princess we should put together an elite team and head for the throne room choose the members of this team with care everything will rest on their shoulders
understood
glory to daein
sir the gates have just closed behind us look out
were trapped in this castle run ruuuun
attack were under attack theyre going to kill us
for us there is no tomorrow we cannot be beaten nor can we withdraw we must defeat the crimean army and bring his majesty back to us
i cannot stop your march but we are not yet defeated general ena protect the capital 
ah ha ha i will cut you down with ease and leave your corpse for the rats
combat was my life now it is my death ah how fitting 
ashnard show yourself
ive been waiting for you you are general ike are you not
how did  who are you
my name is ena by the orders of the king i am the protector of this capital
withdraw ive no desire to fight a useless battle with you its ashnard im after
i regret to inform you that the king is not here
what
the king and the main body of the daein army remain in crimea where they have been since it fell
what are you saying the kings abandoned the capital
 i share your desire to see this conflict end so rather than see you travel to crimea to fight ashnard i felt it would be much faster for me to defeat you and your army here dont you agree
thats one way to look at it the problem is that ill never let you do as you please with crimea
we cannot have it both ways we both want what is in our own interest and that is why we have conflict if neither one of us will yield our conflict will continue until only the stronger of us remains i have my own reasons for fighting and i will see you fall
hi yaaaah
if you had wished to extend your short life span then you should not have appeared before me
 
you are strong i have lost
then calm yourself and surrender theres no reason for you to die
that i cannot do
what
i  i must go to him 
no wait
nasir good timing grab her will you
 
im sorry
nasir
urgh
ike
nasir what are you doing
go now hurry
 
so you were the traitor
 
someones been giving information to the enemy was that you too and mists medallion
 
are you telling me youve been working for daein this whole time but youre a laguz why talk to me ah this is useless get him out of here his traitorous face is making me ill
 
blast
 
until this has been cleared up youll be held in custody
i wont question you anymore when you decide to talk let me know
 
 
 go to palmeni temple
what did you say
 
 
so the capitals fallen eh ha i knew it would come to this still how disappointing it doesnt matter how well you train an army  if they dont fight they become weak whats the life of a soldier without a steady diet of war blood and pain are the foods of a true warrior
suh speaking of soldiers your highness the majority of our forces have been moved here  
i left more than enough soldiers and yet they could not prevail  i may have overestimated ena even if she is a dragon i suppose that was the best she could do
i suppose 
but the important thing is the black knight wheres he gotten to did you see him in the capital
i did he bid me present this to your majesty 
ah its found its way back to my hands at long last unwrap it quickly unwrap it and show it to me 
v very well  
do be careful not to touch it petrine it wouldnt do to have you go mad id hate to have to kill you aha ha ha
h here it is y your majesty 
behold  ah how wonderful see how it reacts to the war i have brought to this pathetic land
th this is lehrans medallion
yes and inside inside is a dark god of immeasurable power and cruelty it once caused a flood so great that all continents save tellius were submerged in a watery tomb
that blue light 
you  me  even this very castle itself we all radiate various forms of chaotic energy and the dark god is pure chaos the light you see is that energy calling out to the chaos around us that is why some scholars refer to it as the fire emblem
 
heee heee har har look how you tremble this light has the power to bewitch the human soul you know it calls to our chaotic impulses  like the urge to slaughter every living thing in sight  do you feel its invitation the permission to act on any base emotion that resides in your heart no matter how unspeakable
i  my report is not finished 
heee har har ah petrine guard
yes your highness
wrap the medallion and place it in the vault
at once
 go on the report
o of course  yes as your majesty ordered the black knight moves to capture princess serenes at last report he was on his way to phoenicis
i see so hes decided on the princess and not the prince eh did he give any reasons
yes your highness it was based on the findings of a group of scholars because the princess was isolated for over twenty years they feel her magic will be stronger than her brothers
yet  can the black knight outwit the hawk king of phoenicis and steal her away
the hawk king is not always at her side plus as you know the black knight is in possession of warp powder if someone of his might has the ability to appear and disappear at will it may be that he is without equal w with the exception of your majesty of course i  i mean 
ha ha i will have to test that someday but not today its not often that one finds a tool as useful as he is
well spoken your majesty
now then petrine my dear petrine you have made one blunder after another how will you prove your worth to me  if you wish to remain in my service you must show me results unless you too wish to become food for rajaion here
y your majesty i will redouble my efforts i wont  i wont let you down again
you can be a general or you can be dinner i dont really care which  but do try to show a little initiative wont you
yes your highness  b by your leave 
hold i forgot one thing what happened to ena when the capital fell
according to all reports she escaped her current location is unknown however  this is ena were speaking of she will return to your majesty will she not
kill her
what
ive no further use for her oh but if its too much for you to kill her outright  use her trust and stab her in the back
as as you wish 
um general thank you
hm
the people of talrega were the enemy yet you treated them with kindness i dont know how to thank you
oh the provisions it wasnt enough but i wanted to do whatever i could its nothing for you to worry about though
general ike 
my my lady is that you lady fizzart
huh
oh it is you lord shiharams lovely daughter thank heavens youre still alive
youre from talrega
thats right im sophie from the village of luma i cant live there anymore so i brought my two sisters here to the capital after that battle i was sure that youd been claimed by the dark angel just like lord shiharam but here you are
 
 
is this your bodyguard ooo so strong you watch out for milady you hear shes lord shiharams precious little girl you keep an eye on her and dont let those nasty crimeans get near her
um 
actually  were 
please listen to me milady we understand all about those floodgates lord shiharam wouldve never done such a thing if he had any other choice we know it was those crimeans that did it why when he wasnt on duty lord shiharam and his men used to help us with the plowing and the planting and once when my sister got sick he loaded her up onto his own wyvern and brought her to the capital to see a doctor hes the only one who ever cared about us country folk he opened his heart to each and every one of us
he  he was a good man 
those dirty crimeans are to blame if theyd never come to daein that battle wouldnt have happened and lord shiharam would still be with us
sister  im hungry 
youre going to be all right ill find you something to eat in a little while just be patient
that soldier over there gave me this can i eat it
dont be stupid throw that away right now well starve to death before we take charity from crimean killers
waaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaa
milady the crimean army is nearby run you must escape and survive were gonna live even if we have to eat mud and weeds well do it and one day well have our revenge on those bloodthirsty crimeans if i cant do it my children will and if they cant then my grandchildren will well get them someday i swear it i have to go promise me milady you must go on for lord shiharams sake you mustnt get yourself killed
um 
 
 s sorry oh im so sorry 
dont be 
 ike
 are you all right
 weve come a long way havent we do you think we can beat king ashnard
of course we can we have to if we lose crimea may never be rebuilt
 what are we going to do brother im frightened  the medallion was my protection now that its gone my confidence has vanished
mist 
for as long as i can remember i would talk to the medallion like i was talking to mother after father died i felt like i was talking to them both where could it have gone
well find it and even though its gone father and mother are looking down on us and protecting us
  youre right  im sorry father and mother are in my heart and ive got you and everyone else at my side so even without the medallion im all right everythings going to turn out fine i know it
thats the spirit
ike mist if youre going to chat why not go inside even if the snows are beginning to melt its still cold out here
oh hi nasir
youre right i do feel a bit cold shall we go back to the tent
uh huh lets go ike  you too nasir
 forgive me
nasir whats wrong hurry up
oh  of course
/***EOF***/
overcoming many hardhsips  ike and company finally arrive in thedaein capital of nevassa however much to their dismay king ashnard is nowhere to be found according to intellegence reports  the king is in crimeas capital of melior preparing to wage war against gallia in addition at least half of the daein army including its most elite forces remain unharmed and at his side the crimean army is again forced to march this time however the battlefield will be their own homeland eagerly awaiting their arrival is a daein army more powerful than anything they have faced so far this fact coupled with nasirs act of betrayal has filled ike with apprehension and disappointment yet it is then when all hope seems faint that unexpected good news arrives
general ike sir reinforcements have arrived from begnion
reinforcements i havent heard anything about this
have you princess elincia
no not a word
are you sure theyre begnion troops
yes sir they fly begnions insignia there can be no doubt of their authenticity and the man in command is one of begnions most beloved heroes general zelgius theres no mistaking him sir
allow me to meet with him first
i beg your pardon are you general ike
i am and you are
i am zelgius earl of kadohl ive been dispatched from begnion with a battalion to support your army
your assistance is much appreciated but this is very unexpected
i understand your surprise for begnions imperial senate this decision was made with unusual haste
i imagine so it took forever just to get the soldiers i have now
well theres a reason behind this expedited decision duke persis has returned home
do you mean sephiran
correct duke persis is also senior statesman of the imperial senate the duke returned from his travels and began working immediately to settle pressing affairs of state first he met with the apostle and they exchanged reports on both foreign and domestic matters then they discussed begnions position in relation to the current conflict and possible courses of action in less than half a day they brought the entire imperial senate into line and sent us here to you
 so youre saying that begnion has allied itself with crimea is that it
thats it exactly i am at your service general ike
oh  um wow thank you
now then please tell me what you would have my men do im ordered to help in any way possible
um  youve caught me off guard i cant think of anything right now
in that case do i have permission to make camp around the palace and rest my troops
yes please do thats no problem
thank you please do not hesitate to call if you have need of us we are at your disposal
begnion reinforcements  that was unexpected wasnt it
it certainly was it seems the apostle and sephiran did the impossible by getting them to us
all for our little army  its hard to believe they would go to all this trouble
first we take daeins capital and now this things are looking up
youre right even if we dont receive help from gallia we still may be able to defeat ashnard
thats true its like a dream
i have to disagree
oh look soren is upset again who knew what is it this time
if the crimean army is not the crux of daeins defeat this war means nothing
what does that have to do with the arrival of these reinforcements
the battalion that just arrived is greater in numbers than the one we originally received not only that but all of these soldiers are marching under begnions name
so
so  if these reinforcements are responsible for defeating king daein what do you think will happen that achievement the very victory itself will belong to the begnion empire not to crimea if that happens crimea will be rebuilt however begnion sees fit and princess elincia will be a mere figurehead and then the deeds of an unknown mercenary company will be expertly covered up well receive some paltry sum of money and be swept under a rug somewhere mark my words
soren youre being so rude surely the apostle of all people would never do such a thing
and this general zelgius seems sincere enough to me
come soren i have heard of situations like that which you describe but whether this is such a case  weve been fortunate to receive this good will must we always search for such ulterior motives
yes we must have you forgotten nasir its that sort of naive attitude that allowed him to remain undetected for so long you people dont seem to get it we are at war all doubts no matter how small must be extinguished if they arent we could well be ignoring something that will lead to our defeat or to our death
 
 
lets take sorens comments under consideration and discuss this at length we meet in one hour
so youre going to lead a small unit out on a survey mission
yes thats the plan however though weve taken the castle there are still pockets of daein resistance its possible they may try to mount an attack and retake the palace i want you to be in charge of the watch
that is of course not a problem however youre taking the princess along dont you think it would be safer to take more troops even if we split our battalion we have enough men to handle both tasks
im just not used to moving around with such a large group and for this mission  id like to keep the number of people involved as low as possible
its not that i dont understand how you feel but we will compromise
you know for someone from begnion youre pretty flexible it speeds things up considerably
to be a soldier one must be able to quickly adapt to circumstances around him
all right well be back later
take care
this is the place nasir mentioned palmeni temple i hope whatever he was trying to tell me will become clear once we get inside and look around
i still cant believe nasir was on daeins side  i just cant and he let that dragon girl get away  although im sure he had reasons for that as well
i wonder  was it really nasir although besides my family the only people i showed the medallion to were titania princess elincia and nasir  i thought i could trust him  i really did why why did he do it
mist 
thinking about the past isnt going to help lets take a look at this temple
here we are this is palmeni temple
what did you say the crimean army is here
they want to investigate the temple what should i tell them
crud this aint good i dont know what theyre after but if they find us mercenaries who sided with daein theyll wipe us out
it is all the will of the goddess resign yourself to your fate  accept it
bat dung no ones gonna roll over and die dyings for sissies so tell me how many are there
there appears to be ten or so including the women
gahar har har thats good news
it is
if thats the lot of them we can take care of this on our own itll be like stealin a baby from the cradle right then heres the plan pretend like you wanna help em then lead em inside and listen good youd best not whisper a word about us being here or else kkkkccchhhhh
b but i couldnt  what you ask is beyond me  
kkkkcccchhhhh dont forget weve got all the other priests under our control unless you want em to meet the goddess early do as youre told
all right wed like to take a look around please show us each room
um very well  th th this is er  a v very large room  um 
are you all right why are you shaking like that
oh goddess  please forgive me 
its a trap
gahar har har har you did it
please forgive me 
i thought something like this might happen
i dont know how you got wind of us but showing up in such a small group means youre outta luck none of ya are gettin outta here alive
weve just fought our way to the daein capital youre not even going to slow us down
cocky aint ya but who said this was gonna be a fair fight
eh
what what are you doing
hey bring out the others
you fools are gonna be our shields
what
gahar har har gahar har har har see you aint so useless after all
you filthy dogs those are innocent people you cant 
oh mercy  please help me 
hey if ya dont want them perty robes of yours to turn red youll attack these scum if ya even think about betraying us ill kill every one of ya
b but you cant  crimeans please  forgive us we cannot allow our brothers to die
this cowardice will not stand these priests are being made to fight against their will weve got to try and save as many of them as possible lets go
hey robes if i get so much as scratched you better get to healing
 gwaar  haaaarr  haaaaaa shoulda brought more priests or some babies  dang 
thank you very much i never imagined that we would be rescued by soldiers of an enemy nation
there was no way wed cut down innocent priests being forced to fight against their wills and yet we were not able to save everyone 
peace my lord we were expecting to be killed at once yet somehow you rescued so many of us im sure that even our departed bishop tomenami is grateful for your aid
father we bear no ill will toward the kingdom of daein itself we wish only to reclaim the homeland which was unjustly taken from us that is the reason we fight we had no desire to invade this land if nothing else please believe that
i beg your pardon may i have the favor of your name
elincia ridell crimea im the sole survivor of the crimean royal family
oh you  let us give thanks that you are alive and well and please i beg your understanding as well there are many daeins who do not support the kings actions
i understand

i understand
 
my young general this is for you
huh
as thanks for saving our lives
now its time to search this place
my lord ike may i join you
sure why not everyones lending a  
ike ike where are you
mist im over here
ike this way quickly reysons in trouble
what
reyson what is it
 
hes been like this from the moment he set foot in this room hes just staring at the walls
what is all this
every wall has the same pattern on it
its not a pattern its an ancient language all chants and spells in magic scrolls are written thusly
can you read it soren
some but not all spells are simple whereas this is a complex narrative i think prince reyson could read it
i bet this is the same language that leanne was speaking
it is its the serenes language their chants are all in this language too
so reyson is reading whats written on the walls
it appears that way 
shall we leave him be theres a lot of writing here this could take hours
i think thats a good idea
ike
what is it
from what i could gather i think a person was locked in this room sometime in the past
 you dont know who it was do you
i wasnt able to read enough of the writing but  i found this under the bed
is this 
i think it may have belonged to whoever was imprisoned in this room
 
i apologize i took up much of your time
reyson you dont look so good why dont you rest for a bit
no im fine its more important that we talk
about the owner of this feather
 was it in that room
soren found it whose was it
lillia  my older sister the writing on the walls is hers
 you have an older sister too
will you tell us about it
she was kidnapped twenty years ago on the night of the serenes massacre i i thought that lillia had been murdered along with my other brothers and sisters i believed that until today 
who took her
the walls say only that he was a large human she probably never knew who it was he thrust a clan treasure at her and demanded that she use her magic to revive the thing sealed inside it he exhorted her again and again but to no avail lillia refused his request every time because she did not possess that power
someone wanted to revive the dark god 
shortly after she was brought here lillia fell ill and collapsed im not surprised it was a terrible time  she was imprisoned in that tiny room with no view of earth or sky 
oh thats awf sniff   sniff 
mist 
im sorry i just feel so sad for lillia and for for reyson too 
i beg your pardon let me continue a young beorc began coming to the room to care for lillia she had bluish hair and blue eyes and her heart was unusually pure for a beorc in time lillia and she came to be friends and shared a mutual trust
ah
 
lillia decided to entrust her hopes to the woman they shared no common language so it took some time but eventually the beorc woman understood what it was lillia wanted  which was to take the treasure and the song and flee this temple
b brother
was there anything else written about this beorc woman a name perhaps 
elena  translated into our language it was probably elena
i knew it mother it was our mother
what
are are you sure
our mothers name was elena like me her hair was blue as were her eyes reyson the object you refer to as your clan treasure was an aged bronze medallion wasnt it
how  how did you know that
the medallion became my mothers keepsake the song too  my parents both gave their lives to protect it
ike you and mist are elenas children then lehrans medallion is here
um 
the medallion was stolen probably by daein
it cant  this is unbelievable can a thing like this be chance
to be honest i dont fully understand all thats happened but it all makes sense it all comes together 
ah
mist thats the song that  but the melodys a little different isnt it
its similar to the song reyson and leanne sang in the forest my mother used to sing it as a lullaby
it is the song of release the one lillia entrusted to elena
b but i wore the medallion and sang that song almost every single night and nothing ever happened
the magical effect of the song is awakened by the power of the singer  it cant be unleashed by just anyone the true song of release can only be sung by a girl named altina lillia wanted your mother to take the melody to altina and return the medallion to its rightful place in serenes forest
the storys becoming clearer and clearer my father fled daein to protect my mother who was carrying the amulet
ike how did you know  
volke told me he told me about my fathers past and the amulet and the dark god too
so you know everything 
king ashnard took lillia didnt he
that would be the final piece of the puzzle after all the man who found my father was the kings henchman
ike are you saying you know who killed commander greil you never said anything about that we all thought his murderer was unknown  why didnt you say anything
 i dont know i never felt like talking about it
he was a daein soldier wasnt he who was it who was the man who killed commander greil
 
ike tell me
can we discuss this later
 
 oh  yes  yes of course
up to this point weve all been fighting for the liberation of crimea even if we now add to that stopping the dark god from being released and punishing commander greils killer  our enemy remains unchanged king daein and his henchman are the ones we must defeat
its mysterious isnt it i mean reyson said the same thing earlier but  could all of this really be mere coincidence the fall of crimea  ikes parents  the death of reysons sister  the fact that everything leads back to daein 
 
hey ike er  general ike wait up say if theres an enemy in my way but i dont want to kill him what do you think i should do
 is this about that stupid game again
well its all your fault you had to go and tutor daniel and now ive been on this losing streak
tutor you mean back when we were onboard the ship it was just one hint
daniel isnt like me hes smart im the one who thought up this game but hes the one whos getting better and better i hardly ever win anymore
instead of playing that game why dont you try some real combat
stop joking around were happy go lucky traveling merchants we dont know anything about fighting
give me a break its nice youre having fun and all but please  can you save your stupid game for someone whos not fighting for their life day in and day out
well what do you expect everythings war war war and theres no place for us all we can do is play this game sorry  ill just go lose again 
oh for heavens sake look if theres an opponent you dont want to kill just shove him out of the way then you dont have to fight him
huh oh t thanks  um you know we are what we are but well be with you till the end i hope we can continue to be of service all right
yeah thanks sorry for being so irritable
thats all right i know how much stress youve been under
 
 
something on your mind
oh commander ike oops i guess im supposed to call you general now huh
commanders fine so whats going on are you thinking about that person you were looking for
thats all settled actually no  its not really settled its just i figured that worrying about it all the time wasnt doing me any good i turned over every rock in begnion during my search but  its just easier to assume that everythings going well somewhere 
well as long as youre happy i wont say a word so what were you thinking about then
i i didnt say anything before but daein is my homeland
is that so sothe yeah until a few years back i lived in the slums of nevassa and stole for a living
 
so anyway i went back to my old stomping grounds and saw some friends the rest of the citys empty but theyre still here theyve got no other place to go you know
and what did they have to say
every one was mad that crimea had won they said if the king had been here theres no way they wouldve been defeated its so weird until now all they had ever done was complain about this place
i see
you know ashnard wasnt such a bad king at least as far as we could see if you were strong enough you could rise up and become a knight one day you could escape the filthy slums he was the only king who ever gave us that chance that hope
 
dont get me wrong i dont mind fighting with all of you but still seeing your homeland scarred and trampled like this is tough im sorry i know crimea is suffering in the same way but  i cant change how i feel
 
/***EOF***/
is that it
wait theres more it seems that prince reyson was able to escape duke tanass villa and make his way safely to serenes forest however we have word that tanass men have entered the forest in hopes of recapturing the prince weve not a moment to waste please o king of hawks reach out your mighty talons strike down these wretched humans and rescue prince reyson i implore you your majesty take wing at once
why is naesala not here
that er  his highness must not be seen here at this time  its  
whats going on you old buzzard king kilvas is the white princes friend isnt he
well how do i put this hm its all very complicated 
i care not for excuses if anything happens to reyson blood will be spilled
oh no please theres no cause for worry duke tanas treats his works of art with a delicacy so extreme that it could best be called abnormal he would never let any harm befall prince reyson he probably cant even bring himself to touch him the king himself told me so that is the only reason he accepted this proposal  
proposal
ah um  what i mean is er 
hold it you crows set the prince up
s set up set up oh no no well not exactly um please dont hurt me
so thats the truth of it eh naesala treated reyson like a piece of merchandise and sold him to a human 
no thats not  the only one who referred to him as merchandise was duke tanas we never  
it doesnt matter claiming ignorance does not grant you innocence you treated reyson like a trinket in a public market
oooh dear 
if reyson hadnt escaped on his own perhaps the crow king would have rescued him when things cooled down regardless reyson trusted in his friend and followed him into the trap  and naesala spit on that friendship that i cannot forgive
your assessment of this old bird is correct i am a worm nothing more but please i beg of you  temper your outrage let it cool
youre unbelievable what is it with you crows anyway everything you do is so dirty and deceptive we will never understand your ways do you hear me greywings
i hear you well young hawk but our nation  our nation has  it has its own issues
please this is not the time to yell at a tired old man you must hurry to prince reysons side once he is safe you can punish me in any way that you see fit 
tear me limb from limb if you wish but please go to prince reyson i beg of you
this begging is unseemly and unwanted we would rescue reyson regardless of this pathetic show of tears return to kilvas and report these events to your accursed king tell him that when this is over king tibarn of phoenicis will be paying him a visit
 y yes your highness
sigh  i know he deserves it but i still feel bad for badgering the old coot
your majesty what will we do now
ulki use your ears to pick out the sound of reysons wings then tell me the direction from which it comes
at once
janaff use your eyes to peer between the trees and find me a road
you got it
human scum if you think to replay that night from twenty years ago youll get no quarter from me
hm is that you soren youre up early
actually im always awake at this time
really
yes youre the one whos up earlier than normal
i want to finish our mission today i think my nervous energy woke me up
i understand  the last two days spent searching serenes forest for that heronhave been frustrating and fruitless im sure hes in there somewhere but 
i agree and duke tanass men are still hunting away they must think the heron is there as well
the only place left is the forests heart thats where we should go today with luck we may finally locate our target
i get the feeling its going to be a long day
i believe this is the place where we ended our search yesterday
i realized something a couple of days ago even in this forest you always know exactly where you are dont you
hm
how do you do that i think its the lack of color but these woods are starting to look the same to me
yes thats a problem 
ike were approaching a large clearing i think we should have the apostle and some of the others wait there
good idea even if we find the heron today theres no need for them to tramp through the forest with us
mmm 
were going to head deeper into the forest and continue the search please wait here if we find the heron well send for you immediately
i understand my lord ike everyone please be careful
 were counting on you
sigrun tanith may i entrust the princess to your care
of course
youve no need to worry we will protect her with our lives
very well until later
all right greil mercenaries move out
gah havent you fools found my precious little bird yet ive no doubt the poor thing is even now quivering with loneliness and cold
duke tanas ive just received word that the mercenaries who invaded your villa are in this forest
blast those wretches  theyre here to steal my bird their souls are black with greed and jealousy i have found beauty incarnate and i will not relinquish it only i duke tanas can appreciate its worth
um im sure thats true your grace but what about the mercenaries what should we do about them
hunt them down like dogs let none leave this forest alive they will not rob me of my prize
but your grace they serve at the pleasure of the apostle herself striking them would be  
leave the apostle to me i can deal with her once this is finished all i need from you is silence and obedience is that clear
yes your grace i beg your pardon
there they are do as duke oliver commanded slay them where they stand let none leave the forest alive not man woman or child
oh not the dukes soldiers again i think its about time we put an end to these fools listen up everyone lets end this here
what was that sound
i heard something too
it came from the northeast its unlike anything ive ever heard
to the northeast  aha there are ruins over there perhaps the white prince found them to be a good hiding place
lets check it out maybe we can find him and escape while the humans fight amongst themselves
what are those humans thinking why would they be trying to lop each others heads off
shall i make an inquiry
leave them theyre nothing but trouble
i second that now if we want to avoid the human skirmish we should head thataway through these trees
lets go
yes sir
curses they just keep coming how many soldiers does he have
theres no telling he is a bishop and a senator and he holds peerage and that means he could command many men
all right lets figure out where to go next
brother
what is it mist
did you hear a sound just now
huh no i didnt
really i guess it was just me then
that sound you heard was it high pitched like the chiming of a bell
ah yes it was thats it exactly
i heard it too it was very beautiful
i didnt hear a thing
it created only a slight disturbance in the air it could only be heard by those possessed of extraordinary hearing  so your sisters hearing is on par with that of the laguz
wow did you hear that neat
dont let it go to your head a sound that beorc cant hear hmm  thats interesting
it is said that those of the heron clan all practice the art of seid magic perhaps this sound is related to that
seid magic whats that
it involves arcane songs known as galdrar the effects of galdrar on the listener depend on the lyrics and melody for example a galdr can restore lost strength and vitality to those who hear it and if the singer is of royal blood the galdr may be powerful enough to move its listener to extraordinary feats ive even heard tales of a galdr that could give one the speed to do the work of two men the galdrar grant many powers
wow  that sounds incredible doesnt it ike
yeah but even with all that power they were still wiped out by the beorc
right 
herons are highly attuned to the forces of balance even if they had the means to resist i doubt they would have used them
 we leave as soon as our reinforcements arrive duke tanas must not succeed lets rescue the heron while theres time
all right
we should head toward the ruins in the northeast i sense something odd there
got it thanks for the information
it is nothing it is only natural to aid ones companions
i couldnt agree more
 
cursed humans  how dare they defile this forest again i will brook their savagery no more the forest whispered earlier but i must drive these wretches out before i can speak to it further i will go to the altar i will give voice to the forbidden magic and destroy the humans utterly
listen everyone we must make our way to the ruins in the northeast fight if you must but keep up
ike what about the reinforcements
theyll have to catch up we cant wait any longer
understood
there they are the crimean mercenaries surround them they must all die
whew we finally made it lets split up and search the surrounding area
commander do you think we should call more reinforcements
the dukes army seems nearly limitless and im worried about our weapon situation lets do it
hey whats this
what is it commander
look here this is the only place in these ruins where ive seen healthy grass growing
youre right i wonder why
and i found this 
a white feather so we were right the heron is around here somewhere
its possible but 
ike over here
what now
nasir what have you found
 a heron
whatever is this 
 um  thats a girl nasir you said that the male heron we met was the only surviving member of the race
i believed it to be true to find another survivor its a miracle
who are you
hey wait please i must speak  
yaaaa stay away human
come on wake up
  
shes fainted dead away
i guess theres nothing i can do but wait for her to come around i wasnt trying to frighten her
oh oh oh ive found you at last my beautiful treasure
its about time you showed your bloated face duke tanas
oh oh  no mistake about it that is the spectacular work of art i paid so much to obtain 
you still claim ownership do you
no wait  somethings different this is a female you mean to tell me that yet another lives how spectacular men bring me that heron but do her no harm
youll never have her
again will this corpulent windbag never learn form up troops we must protect the heron
aaa aaarrrrrgggghhhh what vexatious wretches i am overmatched i cant believe im saying this but  theres another white heron re retreat leave them their prize
blast duke tanas has escaped
ike perhaps trying to fight with that heron on your back is not the wisest of ideas why dont we take her to the apostle before moving on
weve finally got duke tanas on the run i dont intend to stop until weve captured or killed that monster
i understand but shouldnt we at least let someone else carry the heron
truth be told shes unbelievably light i barely know shes there
is  is that so
i think she weighs  oh id say about half as much as mist
wow im surprised
ill bet you are 
what are you grinning about boyd
oh nothing  im just amazed did you know youre two times heavier than she is im glad i dont have to carry you around itd be like wearing an extra suit of armor
you  you pig youre the worst
gaaa
all right maybe i exaggerated a bit but shes still lighter than you
well what do you expect shes a bird
commander if this battle is going to continue i think we should get more reinforcements
reyson are you well
tibarn how did you  
nealuchi told us everything
oh  allow me to apologize i left on my own without a word to you and this is what happened
as long as youre unharmed all is well lets go home
please give me a little time i cannot allow these humans to remain in the forest
i understand how you feel but were completely outnumbered let us wait for another day  
once i stand at the altar i can take care of them every one of them
you cant mean  are you thinking of using the forbidden magic
 yes i will sing those monsters the dirge of ruin
are you mad you mustnt i cant allow it
with permission or without i do what i must it is retribution for genocide retribution for this forest
reyson you must not let yourself be ruled by despair each member of the heron tribe is an embodiment of balance do this and you warp your very existence
thats what they all said my family my tribe and then they died the humans were drunk with joy they laughed they sang  and then they slaughtered us like livestock my mother my brother my elder sisters  even my infant sister leanne all killed in a single night
reyson 
i know this thing i intend to do brings dishonor to my house and yet i cannot forgive and their past actions werent enough now they violate the sanctity of the forest without a trace of regret accursed humans i will never forgive them
dont you think we understand that
 
thats right prince reyson theres no need for you to reject your honor based on the likes of them
the tragedy of the herons the horror and pain of that night lives on in all of us
lets return to phoenicis and think of a plan you are right this will not stand the full power of the hawk nation is behind you the humans will pay
 as you wish 
enough already lay down your arms and surrender we will let you live
grrrrrr  no never im not giving up im not finished yet out of my way penniless wretches your very existence is an insult to all that is beautiful all you really want is my wealth and beauty miserable curs  you reek of poverty and envy oh but i understand your emotions yes i do how could you sad vagabonds not want to be me
 thats the last thing in the world  
silence i am not one to be daunted by mean beggars such as you oh ho ho ho in the name of the goddess i oliver duke of tanas will smite your hideous evil
um 
to arms to arms defend me with all the strength you possess oh and bring me the little bird that blue haired lout is carrying while youre at it 
 oh please
here they come combat formation everyone
uh oh theyre still going at it over here shall we go around
i suppose so two human armies bashing one anothers brains out i wonder what theyre after
ah
theres that sound again reyson are you doing that
 
no i suppose not
 the forest is whispering something what is it what are you trying to tell me
king tibarn prince reyson look there
eh
ah
the blue haired human is carrying something on his back no it cant be 
is that another heron
 but thats not 
i think some of the humans might be fighting to protect the heron grr  its against my nature but we shall aid them janaff ulki to me
right
yes sir
tibarn please  allow me to go with you
if you forswear the forbidden magic you may come
agreed
listen to me you boors you cannot possibly understand the pursuit of beauty you are savages you are a blight on the world and you must die
ohhh ahhh i cannot fall here it cannot be such a loss to beauty 
its you
on your back  who is it you carry
oh the girl i think she may be somebody you know but 
leanne
reyson my brother  brother
is it really you leanne this is no dream how is this possible how did you survive all this time
leanne do you know who i am
tibarn of the hawk tribe yes
thats right you remember my name have you been here by yourself for all these years
i dont know that night  my sisters took me and hid me in the small shrine im sure they sang a galdr to me and then i became so sleepy 
the forest protected her it kept her asleep for so long theres no way to express my gratitude thank you for with all that i am  i thank you
you there beorc
me
i am tibarn king of phoenicis since the loss of their homeland the serenes royal family has been under my guardianship who are you and why do you aid the herons
my name is ike i am commander of the greil mercenaries i am under orders of the empress the apostle sanaki to protect the herons
the empress of this country wants to protect the herons ha that is an interesting tale the herons were blamed for the assassination of the last empress they were massacred on hearsay and now her ancestor wants to help them touching
the empress sanaki knows that the herons are not murderers and now she is trying to atone for the crimes of her people
 no i cannot believe that
 
pathetic apologies and half baked platitudes are easily spoken humans burned serenes forest they killed my family i cannot trust one who allies himself with them
please withhold judgment until you speak with the apostle shes waiting at the forests edge
the apostle is here
so you are the apostle
i am
 
 im sorry i am ignorant as to what words of contrition will be appropriate to one of the heron tribe yet i stand before you as a representative of my people  from the depths of my heart i apologize to you  i am sorry  so truly sorry 
emp empress sanaki what are you doing you are the apostle you cannot bend your knee to another
peace let her speak her heart
i um 
 
im sorry im sorry 
that is enough 
 
leanne
please rise apostle sanaki
you  what is it you want are you telling me to stand
you 
it is enough it was not your fault
leanne
brotherit is enough is it not forgive this child her apology is so sincere
leanne you cannot ask me to forgive them you were asleep  you dont know what these humans did to us 
 i do know  the forests told me everything
you know
everyone is gone arent they
thats right  everyone is gone thats why i cannot release my hatred
brother  my loving brother reyson the pain and sadness is in you brother it clouds your very soul to see you like this to watch you it hurts me please do not lose yourself to hate
leanne my sister i understand if that is how you feel 
 
apostle sanaki  we accept your apology we may not be able to release our hatred of hum   of beorc but you need not let the fate of serenes forest trouble you any longer you are absolved of that guilt  
th thank  you 
that was well done
yes 
my lord ike what will happen now
the heron siblings said there would be some sort of ceremony but i dont know what that entails
you there beorc mercenaries prince reyson wants all of you to come to the serenes altar the presence of princess crimea and the apostle is also requested
altar
just come with me its this way
empress sanaki commander sigrun let us go
very well
lets hurry ike
right
ah excellent the gap between laguz and beorc has been bridged i think this may be enough 
 
whats wrong soren you look so grim what are you looking at
its nothing nothing at all
wait soren what in the world is wrong with him
that was excellent
its so beautiful 
the serenes forest beloved of the goddess is alive once more
you spoke so well earlier empress sanaki you fill my heart with pride  sniff 
here now none of that this is no place for tears
im sorry  im just so happy 
commander ike a priest from duke tanass villa insists on speaking with you
yes what is it
um  master mercenary it is my understanding that you you pursue duke tanas i hear that youre searching serenes forest in hopes of capturing him
and if i am
duke tanass property borders the forest and he knows much about its layout for quite some time now hes been sending men into the forest to look for any herons who may still live there
i see  so youre saying that his troops know the forest well
i too have been taken into the forest
you why take a priest
he thought that herons would make themselves known if a priest called to them hes also taken dozens of chaste maidens and tried having them call to the herons as well
but he didnt find any did he
no and yet this time the joy he expressed after paying such an exorbitant price for the serenes royal was aberrant it was not natural the duke has gone mad to think that he would dare to defy the apostle he is damned
and here you stand youre going to tell me what you remember about the forest even though it means youre betraying tanas right
hmm  you read me well to begin with the heart of the forest was divided into three large sections maybe more it was nearly colorless and difficult to see far the muddy floor pulled at our feet and progress was slow many of the soldiers around me were afraid that they didnt bring enough supplies they said a person would need them if he got lost because getting out again would be no easy task
what can you tell me about duke tanass forces
there were a lot of them he had soldiers of every type it was said that his mounted units and magic users were especially powerful so at the very least you should be prepared to deal with those two groups
thank you
 my parents  they both participated in the serenes massacre theyre nearing the ends of their lives but even now they lie awake at night and beg the goddess for forgiveness i became a priest in order to help my parents but then i was assigned to work at duke tanass villa i knew of his terrible deeds but his position as an imperial senator frightened me i have been silent for far too long master mercenary  you must rescue that serenes youth i beg of you may the goddess guide your hand
dont worry i have no intention of letting that villain steal him from before my very eyes
here you are
 
weve been in begnion for a while now so tell me something why are you still here are you pretending to be our friend so you can lance us in the back
 you have to understand i i didnt know anything i was born and raised in the talrega region of daein its a very remote area my father was a soldier and i grew up thinking that i too would one day be a soldier a soldier to make my father proud my life was simple  i questioned nothing doubted nothing
 
do you know the first thing were taught in daein schools sub humans are evil sub humans are the enemy sub humans must be eradicated the army stages periodic sub human hunts wed find refugees from begnion hiding in our mountains and forests 
you participated
you dont get it thats just how things are in daein no one taught me the word laguz no one taught me that sub humans could be  could be like this no one cared
 
when i saw the bird tribes at sea i was convinced that the teachings were true they were inhuman monsters but later i saw the dragons push your ship off of the reef and it confused me what if i had been raised to believe a lie my heart pounded at the thought of it and my doubts only grew with time
so you decided to remain aboard in order to ascertain the truth thats your true motive isnt it
how did you know
ive known a lot of soldiers and none would ever accept charity from an enemy it would wound their pride you obviously have pride to spare so i knew there was some other factor at play
oh 
well have you reached a conclusion what will you do
i want to stay here at first i thought i could protect my old life that i could prove the sub humans were monsters but i was wrong and now things are different the sub hu   im sorry the laguz  i want to know the truth about them and i need to base that on what i see not what i am told by others
in that case you can stay as long as you like
i appreciate it i think meeting all of you  was a very good thing
la la la la la laaaaaa hmmmm la laaaa hmmmmmlaaaaaala de di da de laaaaaa 
 um  hey there you have a minute
oh captain how are you today
its commander not captain well you seem to be enjoying yourself
thats because this garden is so pretty devdan loves all plants and flowers how about you commander
theyre all right i suppose
that makes devdan rather sad all right is not a very strong feeling it is boring you should be a more emotional commander even things youre used to will show you something new if you look hard enough and discoveries are exciting thats what life is all about at least thats what devdan thinks some disagree and that makes devdan upset
 you may be on to something in crimea when my father was still alive i think i was more open to such things but now i just dont have the time honestly all i can think about is defeating daein ive no energy left to spend on flowers
 if you talk like that you will never defeat daein
what did you say
the war is new if you are already so focused on preparations youll wear out before the fighting begins
hold on a minute 
/***EOF***/
having narrowly escaped daeins grasp the greil mercenaries are pleased to feel the ocean beneath their feet as they set sail according to captain nasir the voyage to begnion will take roughly two months
blessed with temperate weather the ships journey southward is smooth and steady as it passes the midpoint of its trip the  ship sets a course along the coastline and begins to head east
these seas belong to phoenicis and kilvas the kingdoms of the bird tribesboth nations prey on human vessels for supplies and wealth and their flying corsairs are feared across the seas
the monarchy of goldoa
this country remained isolated founding centuries past preserving its closed culture behind a veil of mystery
it is these laguz controlled waters that ike and company must now cross
 
ike
 
whats bothering you youve been moping around ever since we came aboard
im just a little seasick
seasick youre such a bad liar you never even get regular sick youre not the type to get seasick
really its nothing
come on talk to me youve been doing so much lately i just want the chance to help you for a change
well all right ill tell you whats been bothering me its that incident back in toha
go on
when everyone discovered ranulf was a laguz all those people  they changed just like that up until that instant theyd seemed like such kind and decent people i just i had no idea beorc prejudice against the laguz was so strong why do they hate them so much how are we so different ranulf and i
i have to say at first i was scared too when i saw how they could change they can do things that we hu  i mean we beorc cant do theyre not like us 
mist you cant honestly feel 
its different now everyones so very nice but you know thats because of all the time weve spent together ive seen how they are ive gotten to know them thats why ive changed im not scared or nervous around them but other people dont get that chance i think thats why theyre frightened
maybe youre right maybe people like me are the odd ones the people who accept others as they are
i wish more people were like that i mean no one really wants to fight do they doesnt everyone want peace i guess its just hard to put all of those fears behind us
youre right it is very hard
nasir whats the big idea eavesdropping on us like that
how do you find sailing have you gotten sick at all
were fine but answer a question for me would you why are you here why do you associate with the laguz
why besides the obvious financial benefits i suppose i do so because i am one
what no youre not a laguz i dont see any tail or anything
because ive chosen to live among beorc ive taken certain steps to make sure im not recognized ive had to change my attire my feeding habits ive done many things
why would you do that
laguz cannot survive in isolation nor can beorc if both races are to thrive they must learn to coexist i have spent many years searching for a way to make this happen
you think that laguz and beorc can live together after everything you must have seen im impressed
ike you will never truly understand a matter unless you look at it from each partys perspective as you say the laguz are indeed now persecuted by the beorc but long ago these roles were reversed
 whatever happened in the past does not justify what we do to the laguz now
that is the thinking of an honest man keep things simple and pure i like that still the strength of your conviction comes from your youth and your innocence trust me it will be tested when your journey is over how will you be changed i pray your conviction is not lost to despair
talking to you is hard work
someday youll understand for now my role is simply to deliver you safely to begnion ranulf has paid me quite handsomely with money from the king of gallia himselfand i will not let him down
were out of our element here at sea so youre all we have to depend on thank you for your help
i will do what i am able
nasir what is it
nothing nothing we can do anything about at any rate were being followed by pirates
really i dont see any ships 
not by sea by air look up
are those birds if they are they must be huge 
those are laguz ike
ravens from kilvas their black wings are an ill omen for all who see them
titania soren you noticed them coming as well
yes soren and i saw them when we were discussing our plans from the aft decks
id heard stories but theyre really flying wow
were still out of their range but airborne foes can be especially troublesome id prefer to avoid them altogether lets see if we can outrun them
from what ive been told the flying corsairs of kilvas and phoenicis are far more cruel than any beast laguz
winged pirates how am i supposed to fight against that wha what was that
oof it felt like we hit something
blast weve run aground we must be caught on a reef or something move it ladsget the ship free
predictable humans sailed right into our trap without fail
lets finish this quickly it wont be long before phoenicis or goldoa takes an interest in whats happening here
ike the crows are coming
pull everyone together looks like were in for a fight
soren do you have a plan
ive done research in the past all members of the bird tribes are vulnerable to wind magic i think its safe to assume that they are also as susceptible to arrows as any other flyer
wind magic and bows all right everyone gather your weapons and prepare to meetthe enemy on the deck i want a small group to remain belowdecks to protect princess elincia and the crew weve never faced an enemy like this i want everyone to stay together lets go
caught up at last ill do this on my own i will not let them escape huh what are those things giant birds disgusting could they be are they bird half breeds
you why are you lollygagging about
who are 
i am jill fizzart wyvern rider of daein attached to commander haars battalion i offer a truce i cannot sit by  and allow a human vessel to be attacked by sub human degenerates i will fight with you
we will accept no help from daein
this is no place for foolish pride at this rate the sub humans will devour you  
i will not accept aid from anyone who thinks laguz are sub human
what are you babbling about im on your side well talk after i chase off these crows bleed the half breed
hold it what what in the world is going on
plunder away king naesala has given us his blessings
argg im falling 
is everyone all right
ill check on injuries
those crows make fierce opponents
nasir hows the ship
completely immobilized we cant shake free of this reef
i feel useless just waiting around here there has to be something i can do to help
hey ike where are you going should you be leaving the ship
nothings getting done sitting around here i just want to go ashore and see what i can see
what hold on ike you cant thats  
ah ike behind you
you there what are you doing
huh
this could be trouble 
this is goldoan territory outsiders are not permitted
no wait you dont understand our ship has run aground theres nothing we can do were stuck here
then return to your ship what happens to beorc is none of our affair
thats ridiculous youre a complete  
you have been warned you will not be warned a second time hey
cease this at once what do you think youre doing
my my lord prince
man of the beorc my countrymen were discourteous i ask that you forgive them
who are you i am kurthnaga prince of goldoa
the prince now were getting somewhere thanks to some kilvas pirates our ships run aground can you lend us any help
 
what is it you cant help us can you
i am not used to being addressed in such a direct manner i was taken off guard my apologies
no i didnt  if anyone should apologize here its me my father had a great deal to say about my lack of etiquette im sorry i didnt mean to offend you
please pay it no mind i am more concerned with the misfortune your journey has metof late the ravens have grown ever more barbarous and this cannot stand my father will lodge a formal protest with kilvas i assure you in the meantime we shall help you with your ship gareth direct the others to push their ship free
at once
dragons theyre all dragons theyre huge and so strong its incredible
its overwhelming 
yeah it is
goldoa is the land of the dragons more than any other laguz tribe they are known for their longevity ive heard tales of goldoans still living who flew the skies when the goddess herself still walked the land
how is it you know so much about goldoa
everything ive learned comes from books goldoa itself no longer has any contact with the outside world seeing them now its like a dream 
so this is good fortune is that what youre saying
shes saying we got lucky for once your recklessness actually got us out of trouble
whats that supposed to mean
we have moved your ship safely and without harm to you or your vessel
my subjects tell me your ship was indeed lodged against a reef however there was no structural damage to your ship you need not interrupt your journey
thats good news thank you
is there anything else you require if you need food or fresh water we can replenish your supplies
that would be most appreciated we are beginning to run low on water as for food anyfruit meat fish anything fresh would be wonderful
it shall be done gareth will you see to it
yes at once
i know that goldoa does not engage in trade with other nations but will you accept gold in payment
do not worry about payment
but youve done so much for us when you could have left us to die out there we must repay you somehow
sweet courtesy is ever the herald of hospitality will this suffice to explain my actions
hospitality isnt that for guests
as you know goldoa prefers isolation we rarely see foreigners especially beorc and even more rarely do we treat with them chance has brought us together and i am grateful for this opportunity in fact i wish we could feast a while and converse however my father would never allow it
you cant expect us to accept so generous a gift  
but i do i insist that you consider it a personal gift from goldoas prince however i have made you uncomfortable so if you feel you must decline 
no of course not we will be happy to accept your gift we appreciate it
im so pleased you understand
ike captain nasir wants to depart as soon as possible
understood
well then i beg your leave prince kurthnaga i wont forget your kindness thank you
it was my pleasure take care
farewell beorc may your journey be safe
my lord ike is something amiss
first those ravens attack us and then a band of goldoan dragons rescues us i cant understand how they are all considered laguz is that strange
no i see what youre saying just as there are both good and evil beorc there must be good and evil laguz as well but they are so distinct in appearance it is tempting to assume each race is as a whole intrinsically good or evil
aye that it is the beast tribes of gallia and the dragons of goldoa seem sohonorable and the birds of kilvas and phoenicis seem so cruel it seems so easy to reduce them all to good or evil
im sure it cant be as simple as that 
look at us beorc daeins are evil and crimeans are not its as simple as thatwell wait there were those prejudiced fools we met in port they werent all that honorable maybe youre right
much of what seems good and evil is simply a matter of perspective ike many conditions affect our judgment drawing a definitive line is nigh impossible
nasir where have you been you vanished without a trace
i am uncomfortable around dragons i thought it would be better if i stayed below in my cabin my apologies
now that you mention it soren seems to have disappeared as well have you seen him
perhaps hes feeling nauseated for one unaccustomed to sea travel its not uncommon
right i think ill check up on him later
the wind is picking up i believe i will go and check on the condition of our sails keep yourselves warm up here its a chill wind that blows in these waters
princess elincia you should be returning to your cabin
what about you my lord ike
ill stay on deck a while longer i have a lot to think about
would you mind if i stayed here with you i wont be any bother
hm its all right with me 
oh thank you
 
ah ike grab that boy
whats going on
mm
no more running for you
 
nasir who is this
a stowaway i gather he boarded the ship at toha
what are you doing here why did you sneak aboard the ship
 
you wont talk in that case 
hm ow oouuuch
ike theres no need to be so rough
im not going to waste my time playing games with this urchin you want me to let you go open your mouth and start talking
owowow quit it ill talk
 that hurt i thought you were gonna break my face 
well whats your name what are you doing here
im sothe im im a thief but i didnt come onboard this ship to steal anything
 
stop scowling at me like that youre making me uncomfortable
its not just you ike always looks like that dont mind him just keep talking
im looking for someone i heard this ship was sailing for begnion so i decided to climb aboard
this person youre after is in begnion
i dont know the trail went cold in toha and i couldnt think of anywhere else to go from there
is it family
huh
the person youre looking for
yeah i mean were not related by blood or anything but were definitely family
 
nasir my mercenary company will look after this boy he wont be a burden to you or your crew
if thats what you want to do its fine with me
are you sure
youre going to be put to work i hope youre prepared
sure no problem illill do whatever you need
i wish we could help you but we have our own troubles to deal with
i see your point this is a very difficult time for all of you
 
i see no other option ill take you on as a junior member of my crew
really
its either that or i toss you overboard and i suspect youd prefer i didnt
thank you ill repay you somehow i swear it
dont worry about the boy ike well take care of him
its your ship you can do as you please
well then its settled sothe was it come and ill introduce you to the rest of my crew
sure
youre a lucky boy
im just happy i dont have to hide anymore
 volke
right here
gah whereve you been you disappeared the moment we got on this ship
dont worry about it ill be there when you need me
its not me its my sister youve never once shown up for a meal and she thinks youre dying of hunger
did we ever eat together while we were on land
all right listen land big ship small its not the same thing i dont want mist roaming the ship with a plate of food anymore so please eat one meal a day with us
one hundred gold
youre going to charge me to make you eat and thats more than you charge to pick a lock why
i dont like large groups bye call me if you decide its worth it
maybe i should just tell mist hes dead 
do you have a minute
of course commander ike
you and i havent had very many opportunities to talk and i  
you dont think you can trust me
no its not that im just curious  i was surprised to see anyone in toha who chose to fight on the side of the laguz
i joined the toha vigilantes solely for the purpose of saving laguz im not from crimea but when i heard she had joined with gallia i envisioned my perfect world one in which the laguz could live normal lives free of oppression however when i came to crimea i found things were no different there than in any other beorc nation
it was the same for me i couldnt allow myself to ignore these problems any longer
im happy to hear it of all the beorc ive ever met youre the only one who shares my conviction
zihark is there some other reason you defend the laguz
i dont follow you
you see i was born in gallia or so ive been told i just wondered if you had a similar reason guiding you
 of course i have my reasons would you be upset if i didnt want to discuss them my reasons are extremely personal
no its no problem i wanted a better understanding of what kind of man you are and i have that now
can i ask what that is
you are a good man im glad to have you along
im glad to be here i feel im finally able to do the kind of good ive longed to do for years
ooo 
you dont look so well are you all right
im seasick when i was traveling with the merchants we sometimes used ships every time was the same  urp im sorry
did you travel with muston and the others for a long time
about four years all told i had just left home you see i was all alone and i couldnt find work in my hometown i had so many people i could depend on but once i left everything changed if mustons group hadnt found me by the side of the road id probably be dead by now
hm you seem to have led quite an adventurous life its a bit surprising
i get that a lot
i find it hard to imagine that you couldnt find work though your magic skills are amazing
arent they though hee hee im always happy when people notice whew wow i feel so much better now im actually starting to get hungry
im glad to hear it just stay above deck and when you start to feel sick look off at the horizon all right
/***EOF***/
of all the battles in the war so far the contest for fort pinell is the fiercest to date and from this horrific clash of weapons and wills the crimean army emerges bloodied and exhausted yet victorious the prize of fort pinell is no small thing but it is the promise of additional reinforcements from gallia   and the large begnion army encamped in castle daein  that keeps the breath of hope alive in the soldiers hearts there is one other pivotal piece in daeins defense of the former crimean capital  the severely undermanned castle nados as the days end draws near tibarns small force of hawks and gallians cease their attacks and return to camp headquarters
ah well met from the looks of things the battle ended in our favor
we claimed victory yet daein had more troops than we expected and it was a hard fought battle
i dont have the best news to report either
what is it
as the day ended we withdrew as planned but as we were leaving reinforcements began flooding in from the capital
mmm  thats a piece of ill news
the men that were originally guarding the castle were nothing special but there was one who appeared midbattle and crushed an entire unit by himself he was so much stronger than the others it was as if a wolf had appeared in a kennel of blind newborn pups
what did he look like
he was covered from toe to tip in black armor that made it difficult to judge his size but i think he was bigger than me if my intuitions right he is the villian youve all been talking about
the black knight  hes in that castle
general ike please come with me were getting ready to have a war council and discuss tomorrows battle
so the black knights in that castle is he
theres little doubt of it
that beorcs a real handful even when i attacked him in cat form i barely scratched him
its his armor its apparently blessed by the goddess ordinary weapons natural or no cant damage it
oh thats just swell so how are we supposed to defeat him angry looks
leave that to me ive got a sword that should be effective against him 
i dont like it but i suppose theres no choice we dont use weapons or shields those are beorc tools for beorc alone
very well if the villain in question appears well leave him to general ike now then shall we determine who among us storms the castle
ike  can i talk to you
not right now mist were discussing battle strategy
i know that even so  please itll only take a moment
mist  i promise ill make time later be patient and wait quietly
 ah um 
what is it o beauteous one
i feel a bit dizzy may i rest a moment
oh what foul deed is this that rears its head the gods of war do charge a heavy toll bewitch us and attack our very minds the princess she is faint and oer tired forgive your humble servant this trespass
hark my dear and bless me with your arm good folk we shall retire for a spell
of course princess please rest and allow us to proceed with these preparations
th thank you im sorry
what is it
 mmm 
come on mist you realize the princess was making time for you to talk with me dont you
 well um  i thought i could talk to you later but then i changed my mind and wanted to talk to you now
ive been hoping to talk to you too i havent heard very much from you since the other day
yeah  im sorry when you told us that story i was so shocked thats why
the part about mothers death and about father right
uh huh
thats only natural so you have come to some kind of understanding with it all is that it
at first i couldnt believe it the stuff about the medallion and the revival of the dark god and all of that none of it  none of it sounded real and everything about father that was even more unbelievable
it was all i could think about but but i didnt want to think about it anymore it made my head hurt i didnt know what to do i couldnt even sleep i would just lie awake at night and stare at the tent walls
yeah i was the same way
i guess my body finally reached its limit last night i fell asleep and when i woke up this morning i dont know it was all gone i only had one emotion left
one emotion what was it
its hard to say  sympathy i suppose
for mother
uh huh and for father i think more for him than anyone else  father and mother were in love werent they and then the medallion it made father go what did you say berserk
when he returned to himself he found mother when when father died it hurt so much i thought i was going to die father must have felt the same no he must have felt even worse
i think youre right and father kept it all to himself too mother the medallion being hunted he never said a word to us it was his burden alone
the man who killed father was that knight we saw in port toha right the one in the black armor
yes
youre going to fight him arent you for father
yes i am thats one thing i wont let anyone else do in my stead
trying to stop you is pointless i know if i were stronger if i were a swordfighter id be doing the same thing
mist 
but you must keep your promise you promised to lead the company in fathers place and to protect me if you go and get yourself killed ill never forgive you
i understand thats why im not going to lose
 i know
how are you feeling princess
um  it was a lie im not feeling unwell at all im sorry i fooled you
ah i knew it all along it was all for ike and mist was it not it would appear my dear princess that you care for them greatly
i witnessed the death of both my father and mother soldiers fell one after the other and then i i was separated from geoffrey it was ike and his friends who rescued me if not for them i im sure i would be dead now my lord ike and mist too know the pain that i carry with me the pain of losing ones parents in war that may account for why the two of them right from the beginning were so warm and friendly they gave me the support i needed to survive mist and i have continuously encouraged each other to go on so 
they rescued you and are your patrons there are those among the soldiers who complain in jealousy of ikes station but it is a trivial matter we the retainers of house crimea find this general very much to our liking
 ah bastian im pleased to hear it
enough plain speaking i must ready my silver tongue anew shall we return to the council
yes
sir knight the crimean army will renew their assault of the castle momentarily the troops we face are not the half breeds we fought yesterday it is the army that bested general bertram they are not what one would call an easy opponent
hmph resolve it
i beg your pardon
hafedd you are in command the castle defenses are on your shoulders i have business with general ena
understood
is everyone ready the castles strength has been bolstered with reinforcements from the capital we must strike now before any more can arrive if the black knight appears dont try to engage him he is mine i will take care of him
if not for a whim of his majesty i would not be facing you here for a warrior meeting a powerful foe is a joy above all others  and for this i give thanks to the king now let us enjoy the gift we have been given
it appears this is the end gwaaa  hurrrkkk  aaahhhh 
the one i seek is behind these doors dont follow me im going in alone
ike wait im going with  
no soren we have to let ike go alone the black knight is his defeating him is a crucial step that ike must take in order to truly get over the death of his father
idiocy ill hear no more of this naive nonsense what if something happens to him what then
i think ike has gained the composure to keep calm and judge whether or not he can match an opponent if in fact he cant it means hes reached his full potential and thats all there is to him we just have to accept that but i believe in ike i trust him his life is not his alone any longer i dont believe hes so irresponsible as to leave his companions behind by choosing to engage in a contest he cannot win please soren you must feel the same way dont you
 i dont like it sometimes bravery and good judgment arent enough
commander greil  watch over your son
commander can i speak to you for a moment
what is it titania
i have something important to ask of you
all right what is it
i want you to tell me about the night commander greil was killed i understand that its difficult for you however i need to know i have to just tell it once  its all i ask if you cant i  his death will be something ill never be able to face
i feel ive done you a terrible disservice by not telling you earlier its just that  there was a lot i had to get clear in my own mind i know ive kept you waiting
so youll tell me
yes i think ive finally come to a point where i can face it
all right whenever youre ready
that night  ive already told you everything up to where i was on my way into the forest right at the head of the path father had told me to go back to the fort  but i had a bad feeling and followed him anyway when i entered the clearing he and the black knight were already fighting they seemed to be evenly matched at first then they exchanged a few more blows and suddenly father was sent flying they spoke to each other for a moment but i was so far away i couldnt hear what they said then the black knight threw a sword at fathers feet i think he wanted father to pick it up and use it
 
but father didnt touch the sword he just readied his axe again and charged  it was over in an instant i i couldnt believe my own eyes they they looked like they were embracing just  standing there frozen but i saw the black knights blade it was protruding from fathers back and shining in the moonlight
oh greil 
when the knight pulled his sword out father sagged and fell backwards  i ran and tried to catch him but i couldnt hold him and we both fell to the ground the wound father had taken was terrible but at that point he was still alive
 
the black knight approached and said give it to me i had no idea what he was talking about i do now though he had been sent by king ashnard to retrieve the medallion father told him hed thrown the medallion away but the knight didnt believe him then he tried to get father to talk by threatening to kill me and mist i was so angry i leapt up and attacked him but it was useless i didnt give up though i didnt care what happened to me and i attacked again
of all the stubbornness 
if king gallia hadnt been nearby i probably would have died that night too
 
after the black knight vanished i simply all i could think was that i didnt want father to die he  he was still alive i thought if i could just get him back to the fort we could save him i clung to that false hope and started walking toward the light of the fort  i just kept walking 
 thank you ike it must have been so hard for you
titania 
commander greil died on your back his last moments must have been much happier than i had imagined  thank you  now i can finally move past my grief 
 titania
yes
i um  theres something else i havent told you about
 
i met him  i met the black knight again
what
we fought
you did well to keep your life
im not the same boy i was on that night ive grown a lot ive worked hard yet even so i wasnt able to defeat him
theres nothing you can do about that not even commander greil could defeat him youre not ready to  
its not that its not that my blade work wasnt good enough
then what do you mean
titania its his armor its impervious to damage
what thats not possible even the strongest  
he said his armor had been blessed by the goddess he said only weapons that were also blessed could hurt him
where are we supposed to get something like that
i have one here
ah ike that sword  where 
the night after father died i went back to that clearing by myself id hoped to id hoped to find some clues that might help me hunt down the knight the sword was still there i brought it back with me and ive been hiding it ever since i wasnt thinking about using it i believed that if i just carried the sword with me id meet the black knight again  and it worked
so this sword will work against him
its supposed to it was made to contest alondite which is the sword wielded by the black knight
do you think you have a chance
 ill win
all right i wont stop you use that sword to avenge commander greil but listen ike  you must promise me one thing
what is it
when you meet him youll exchange blows if at that moment you dont feel you stand a chance you must flee there are times when running away is not the same as losing
dont you believe in me titania
of course i do one day you will defeat the black knight im sure of it thats why i dont want you to lose your life on the first go around when the time comes i promise not to interfere and i wont let anyone else interfere either i want you to face him one on one and i want you to be calm and use your own best judgement at times withdrawing can be the key that unlocks a future victory dont forget that
 understood
why did you return to crimea you had the perfect opportunity to escape
 im going to the capital
no you are not the king has ordered me to put an end to you
i thought as much  so be it i am prepared
will you not resist
i do not believe i could prevail against one of your power
how extremely frank
my only wish was to be beside the one i love if that is not to be then it matters not what happens to me
as my last act of compassion i shall make your end a swift and merciful one do you have any final words
 if you see nasir tell him that ena was sorry
if i have the opportunity i will so tell him rest in peace
 my love 
turn and face me black knight
hmph ive been waiting for you child
ah did you kill that girl
despite my promise the blow was not clean she breathes still
ill take her
youll have to do so by force you brought the sacred sword ragnell did you not
its right here if using it is the only condition i need fulfill to defeat you i will not hesitate
it appears youve grown smarter good there is no challenge in killing a fool shall we begin
brother
mist no stay back
i  i will fight you ill never let you kill my brother
mist you  
gawains daughter eh good now i can pull out the entire family tree by the root
youre not to interfere mist this craven wretch is mine
hmph do as you will this time we begin in earnest
what an odd fate this will be the third time i have defeated you the first was in the forest of gallia the second at delbray in crimea
weve met twice and ive lost twice but the third time will be different
oh
my sword fighting skills were given to me by my father if i stay true to them i cannot lose
did you never think that using your fathers techniques on the man who killed him would be futile
my father robbed himself of using his stronger arm if he had he would not have lost to the likes of you
hah  you think so let us test your stronger arm then come son of gawain show me your strength
protect the black knight
do not interfere this man is my prey i need no assistance
oh then uh  hey get that girl kill her before she flees
get out of here mist
no im not leaving you i can protect myself i wont run away
will you flee how appropriate tuck tail and run child of gawain it is what dogs do best after all i like how you tremble with fear at the realization that you are no match for me it suits you
foul villain i do not flee i will never turn my back on you and run away
youve grown stronger i commend you 
haaaah  haaaaa 
th the black knights fallen how can this be d dont  dont think youre going to walk out of here though now activate the traps now
whats going on this rumbling 
 nasir
ena
mist we have to go
a all right 
hurry
 father  i finally i stopped him father 
b brother thank goodness im so happy youre alive
mist  i avenged father
i know
even now though im not as good as father was theres no way i could ever defeat him defeating the black knight was my way i wanted to show him how strong father really was
i know ike i know
our father was the best in the world a great man
thats right dad was great and so was mom and so are you brother i love you all im so proud of my fantastic wonderful family
ike mist both of you you did so well 
 
i really had you worried didnt i but now its  
dont say anything i understand
lets get back to the others i cant do anything else today
right
hows she doing
shes going to be all right shes sleeping in the back
and nasir
hes there with her hes been taking care of her the entire time
i see
nasir
ike i am sorry for escaping and causing all the problems i did when we arrived in crimea i sensed ena i had to go and look for her
is that so
you you saved her didnt you i dont know how to thank you
im not worried about it i just want you to talk to me whats the connection between you and ena
ena is my only granddaughter
your granddaughter that cant beyoure not old enough to 
it may be difficult for you beorc to believe but we of the dragon tribe live for a very very long time when we reach a certain maturity we stop showing almost all signs of further aging for example do you remember prince kurthnaga whom you met in goldoa
yeah he was a nice kid
the prince is the youngest in all of goldoa yet for all his apparent youth hes at least a hundred years old
a hundred 
ike 
yes
why did you save ena she was your foe after all 
you were willing to put yourself in danger so she could escape i assumed she must be dear to you
you did that for a dirty traitor under the guise of providing information to gallia i gave the same information to daein i also took mists medallion and gave it to king ashnard  and even so you 
you helped us many times over if there are reasons for all this would you tell me about them id like to help
i cannot at least not yet 
thats not the answer i wanted nasir
please i want you to believe me i am not your enemy king daein had ena with him for her sake there was nothing else i could do forgive me
tell me are you willing to display your loyalty
what do you mean
ashnard is in the crimean capital if we hope to defeat him it would help to have the cooperation of one whos been close to him if youre not our enemy then prove it by aiding us
all right i understand on the strength of your belief in me i swear i will not betray you again
theres one other thing i need to hear how much do you know about the medallion did you realize what it was when you gave it to ashnard
im fairly sure that i know more about it than you do i cant go into details but  merely gaining possession of the idol does not allow king daein to release the dark god the reason for that is  
the only one who can sing the galdr of release is a girl named altina right
thats correct i too investigated palmeni temple
yet king daein doesnt know that and hes kidnapped leanne based on what happened in the past who knows what he may do 
earlier i was able to speak briefly with ena it sounded like she knew where the heron princess is being held when she awakes we shall ask her about it
ike
is that you nasir what are you doing here
ike ill take over from here hurry and leave this place
you know i cant do that besides the black knight cant be defeated  not without this blade
ike i cannot allow you to die here please take care of the girl ena
nasir i didnt expect to see you here what a fool
 aahh  ah nasir
uargh  yet thats not nearly enough 
ike the castles collapsing get out now
whats this it cant be this entire castle i ungh i i cant move this c cant be happening 
 ike nows your chance take ena take care of ena
nasir
nasir 
 
ike mist both of you you did so well 
 
i really had you worried didnt i but now its  
dont say anything i understand
lets get back to the others i cant do anything else today
right
ike shes awake
good
how are you feeling
where am i
in our camp
 you saved me didnt you why
because nasir asked me to
what where is he i i must speak to him
nasir is dead 
what
he protected me and engaged the black knight the castle fell around them both 
is that so so it wasnt a dream  
just who who were you to him why were you serving king daein
i am ena  he  nasir was my grandfather
youre nasirs granddaughter
it seems impossible for beorc to believe it but we of the dragon tribe live for thousands of years once we reach a certain maturity we show no further outward signs of aging
a thousand years  i cant begin to imagine
and um about nasir you must be aware that he betrayed you and yet you saved me i who had once been your enemy why
nasir helped us time and time again no matter what i couldnt see him as a true enemy if there are reasons for all this would you tell me about them id like to help in nasirs stead
i i cant tell you now
thats not the answer i was hoping for
however in payment of my debt to you i can provide information i will tell you where the heron princess is being held
ah thats a good start
/***EOF***/
are you all right
nn  yeah ill be fine
so the sleeping prince awakens
father cant believe you i know those are practice swords but theyre still heavy you have no right to be so rough on ike
if this is too much for the boy hell never make it as a mercenary
but–
you dont have to worry i told you im fine
ha youd better be now grab your sword and get ready
what dont tell me youre going at it again but–
just until i land a single blow im not giving up until i can get one good hit in on father
i like your resolve ike but it takes more than a strong will to  hm
aha i knew id find you here
hi boyd what brings you here
nothing special you said you were going to get the boss but you never came back i got picked to check up on you
oh sorry i got caught up with ike and my father
its nothing besides i figured id get a good laugh watching ike get worked over by the boss you look finewhat happened
nothing at all im sorry to disappoint you
you just missed it just a minute ago he was out cold
mist
ha ha sorry
you came at just the right time boyd you can be ikes sparring partner
what me
im beginning to think it would be better if he sparred with someone closer to his own skill
 i understand
thanks for your help boyd
hmph i dont know about this to his skill business but im ready
all right im ready for you lets go
not that way ike
did you hear me not that way
hey are you even listening to me
you can do it boyds got nothing take him out
nothing i dont have nothing i mean i have– i mean 
hey whats the holdup lets get started already
im coming wait right there
hurry up will you or are you afraid of me
come on what are you doing are you sure you really want to learn how to fight
yaaaawn  you know im getting sleepy
ha ha im not done yet were just getting started
whoa come on whats that all about youre wasting our time
ah
i cant believe this if you throw your weapon awayhow do you expect to fight let me help  here you go ike heres your sword
oh thanks
try to be a little more careful
that–that wasnt too bad
boyd youre such a loser
shut your trap
good work boyd thats enough
oh all right
your swordsmanship was decent enough ike dont forget how it felt it wont always be this easy
i know
now that youre done warming up its time for you to face me again
i was hoping youd say that
but first mist
right here
here you go ike its a vulnerary
id recommend using it now before you fight father last time he knocked you silly
always take time to heal your wounds in a battle–even small ones by the time you think youre in trouble its probably too late dont get into that situation
give it your all
get ready ike–here i come
come on boy you going to give me a challenge this time around
 
ungh 
ike you were great
father you were holding back werent you
what is that true
if you could tell the difference that means youre improving
you know i wasnt really giving it my all either 
that is such a lie
bah
so father does that mean you finally admit that im ready
what to join the company to take on a job
yeah i mean boyds already out there on the battlefield im ready im tired of being a trainee
listen the difference between you and me is that im a professional
a professional who just got beat
that was just random chance random chance
youve got a point ike  all right tomorrow will be your first day as a full fledged mercenary
really
but if i think its too much youre back to trainee status youd better work hard
no problem watch– ill catch up to everyone in no time
well see wed better be heading back to the fort everyones waiting
/***EOF***/
for the past year ive been focused on winning this war i stand here today as a testament to your fortitude and commitment i understand this will never suffice but i wanted to take a moment to say something to you all thank you i hope i may continue to rely on you
of course i hope that i may continue to be of service
theres only one place for me to be ike and its by your side
youve grown so much  i would like nothing better than if commander greil and elena could see you now 
youve become a great man ike for now and ever more please continue to be our commander
what a long road weve traveled and yet in many ways it seemed to pass so quickly im proud to have fought beside you ike
we did well didnt we im sure mom and dad would be proud of us
great job ike of course if i hadnt been by your side the whole time victory might have slipped away 
ike ike er  i mean commander ike im going to keep practicing so i can be better than ever thanks for having faith in me
finally its finally over at long last we can return to a life without war praise the goddess
ike are we going to go back to being mercenaries im a great soldier and all but  the easygoing life of a mercenary is the only life for me tee hee now lets go find some good looking lasses
 bah i suppose you want some kind of congratulations now right well too bad youre a snot nosed whelp and im still better than you dont ever forget that
heya boss we did it whooo hooo you know i am completely in love with your fighting style if i could train under you it would be great so let me stick around for a while all right
ive no more work here i will be leaving you shortly if you have need of my services you know how to reach me
elincia youve had to wait a long time but i finally fulfilled my contract the mission is complete
my lord ike  on behalf of all crimea and my departed father mother and uncle i thank you once again 
oh stop come on will you please stop doing that
pardon
i think ive gotten used to a few of these noble customs and whatnot but i still cant handle the bowing it makes me antsy and itchy too
oh my lord ike  hee hee
i think ive gotten used to a few of these noble customs and whatnot but i still cant handle the bowing it looks painful and its so cold and formal just talk to me without all the ceremony
my lord ike  thats um 
yeah
n nothing its nothing 
oh glorious day of sweet victory praises upon the day the goddess did see fit to send sir ike to save our land
thank you general ike because of you i believe we better understand how best to serve princess elincia
through your strength the dark clouds that blanketed crimea have been dispelled from this day forth we will give our all to see the restoration of this land and its people
general you are crimeas savior for your meritorious service i salute you huzzah nay a thousand huzzahs
whew am i glad thats over when i saw king daein i was sure i was done for or that hed torture me  but you were a bull thank you now i can go home and see my family once more
when i get back to the countryside im gonna boast to all my family and friends that i fought under you
general i owe you a debt of gratitude im going to stay in crimea and open a shop in the city i do hope youll come by
you know i owe you a lot i think im going to stick around and open an inn hope youll come by and visit
largo and i are going to stay here and open up a shop
with crimea undergoing reconstruction there are going to be a lot of people moving about well open an inn with good food and drink and free butter on every table well be rich in no time
well let you know when everythings all set up you can drop in anytime
well even give you special rates hmm  maybe we should call it general ikes inn
general ike i will be taking my leave of you for the time being i must return to begnion and present a report on the wars outcome
arent you going to take begnions soldiers with you you lent us quite a few
though the war may be over it will take many weeks to see the country secure i spoke with the princess earlier and she asked that we help if possible so ill leave them in your care a while longer
we really do owe begnion a lot dont we in the end we got not only you but a whole battalion of reinforcements general zelgius and his troops are the reason we were able to minimize casualties during the final battle he and his men took care of the retreating daeins and allowed us to focus on the enemies before us
no matter the assistance you had the victory itself is a result of your strength and leadership i know two people who will be very pleased to learn of your triumph
please give my thanks to both the apostle and sephiran i plan to go and thank them myself someday but 
understood fare well general ike i look forward to seeing you again
fare well
it was a glorious victory general
general zelgius what are you doing here
looking at it now and it all may seem a bit impertinent but  i came with reinforcements in case things took a turn for the worst your opponent was the mad king ashnard after all and if worse had come to worst  well you might have needed the help duke perseus ordered us to join in the fight and rescue princess elincia at the very least
oh i see
my apologies
no no  i appreciate the concern it was a dangerous day
your crimean army proved up to the task let me offer you my congratulations you did well to win the day im certain the troops we lent you and the apostle herself are quite pleased
our success was thanks to the begnion shield protecting our flank not the soldiers you lent us but your reinforcements capturing and holding the retreating daein soldiers because of that we were able to concentrate on the enemies before us without concern for our rear guard
i was merely following the orders of my superiors
in that case please express my appreciation to the apostle and sephiran one day i will go and thank them in person
understood now then i will return to daein
what about the troops youve lent us
though the war may be over it will take many weeks to see the country secure i spoke with the princess earlier and she asked that we help if possible so ill leave them in your care a while longer
i see its very appreciated
its our pleasure by your leave
ike hey handsome ive decided to return to service in the begnion pegasus knights cool beans huh oh i owe so much to you ike thank you so very much ill see ‘ya around
i think i may try to start over in begnion maybe its too much too soon  but i just want to live a more responsible life plus im tired of men threatening to break my knees  good bye ike
good bye general ike this war has given me the confidence to enter the service of the begnion knights thank you so much
devdan is glad all the fighting stopped devdan prefers the peace and quiet war is not good for anything
 well were going home all of our desert friends are waiting for us and wow do we have some stories to share with them
laguz and beorc  perhaps the gap between us has narrowed war is horrible yet maybe weve gained something of value after all
find me when you come to the dunes we can sit and talk with no fighting
are you leaving already
yep im outta here ive got some important guests to convey to the king
guests
master ike thank you for everything
hes talking about us were taking my father to visit gallia for a while we herons prefer to live near the forests after all tibarn spoke with king caineghis on our behalf
youre not returning to serenes
while we made our peace with the apostle were not ready to live there again
i see youll be able to return someday beorc and laguz will come to understand and respect one another
you may be right i hope you are
are you ready we should be leaving soon
giffca im in your debt as well gallias a very special place to me  id like to visit again someday if i may
come whenever you are able the king will be pleased to see you
oh and another thing youll be seeing me again soon gallias decided not to spare any effort in aiding crimeas reconstruction ill be back shortly with a whole army of workers and laborers look for us
all right well be waiting
oh wait reyson leanne

ike i will help rebuild crimea too i will lend you much strength
i cant believe im doing this but  i must admit that youve done well you were a good fighter too good to leave with these beorc well meet again
i dont know when but  if that thing we talked about happened that would be fine i guess not that i care so good bye
well its about time for us to take wing
weve built quite a close bond havent we
this is true were especially grateful for your help in serenes forest the next time youre visiting the southern coast come to phoenicis the entire country will celebrate your arrival
the country of the hawk tribe eh that would be fun im interested in what kinds of food you eat
we collect berries from trees on peaks that no beorc could climb the juices and desserts made from it are beyond compare we have ocean delicacies mountain treats  we have everything
ill pass on the desserts  but ill take extra helpings of meat
ha ha leave it to me
i hate to interrupt your gleeful chat but i thought i should tell you  you dont have to visit kilvas its our policy not to invite beorc into our home unless they pay well 
ah king kilvas  despite all of your posturing you came to our aid in the end you turned out to be a better ally than i dared hope for
pah keep your foolish tongue inside your foolish head  and dont tell anyone i have a reputation to think of
fare well and im serious about phoenicis too come anytime
general the bird tribes are in your debt  we are grateful please take care
if you ever have need of the kings eyes fire a flaming arrow from a high place ill see it and come flying um that is if im not busy on an errand for the king
 
 general ike i i will never ever forget you thank you for showing me the error of my ways
im just glad that its finally over maybe now i can get some sleep yaaawwwnn  zzzzzzz 
things are going to be rough in daein too i dont know what the future holds but im heading back its my homeland after all
 i have played my part all that remains is for me to take my leave of this place history will judge my actions 
muston and the others are going to daein and i think im going to go with them thank you for everything general ike hmm  i hope they packed enough food  im pretty hungry 
crimeas an interesting place but ive decided to travel to daein perhaps fate will bring us together again
how odd ena weve been both enemies and allies
thanks to you rajaion was saved and so was i  thank you
so you were with king daein because you were trying to save rajaion
yes
enas fiance went missing many years ago after ena finally found him she came to me for help she told me that rajaion was with king daein and that he had been warped almost beyond recognition long ago enas parents died and i was unable to do anything for her even so she still came to me for help no matter what i had to help her  it was to that end that i used you   i am so sorry
its all in the past now theres nothing for you to worry about any longer
thank you ike
will ena return to goldoa
yes we must take rajaion back to his hometown
we are you going too nasir
yes i am for the first time in decades i will walk on goldoan soil
thatll be nice take care of yourself and give my regards to kurthnaga
i will until we meet again
nasir
hm
i dont know what you thought but i  i always trusted you except for that one moment when i learned of your deception i never thought of you as an enemy
huh even now you defy my prediction
prediction
when we were sailing off the coast of phoenicis remember i said that war would change how you look at things and yet  through all thats happened youve remained the same
i just cant pretend to be anything im not ive never been any good at that
please stay that way ike dont change for anyone
ill see you again wont i
yes im sure of it
no matter how harsh the winter spring will ever follow this popular proverb proves true as the warm winds of change begin to blow across the countryside the war has left the country in ruins but the people rise from the ashes and take the first steps towards rebuilding their nation though once scorned and despised as sub  humans the laguz put aside past enmity and come to the aid of their neighbors and the crimeans never forget it was gallia that fought beside them and helped free them from the yoke of daein oppression led by the examples of elincia and her retainers crimea begins transforming into the land its king had dreamed of a land where beorc and laguz live together in harmony and equality as the reconstruction efforts progress the administrative government announces the enthronement of elincia as the new queen and now the day of her crowning arrives
hah im so tired i could fall over peace is all well and good but it sure is busy
were rebuilding a country that was completely devastated by war its bound to be tough
youre right i bet princess elincia and the people in the palace are twice as busy
speaking of elincia whats she doing
shes in that room over there surrounded by court officials they seem really busy i feel so sorry for her
as long as shes getting at least a little bit of rest im not worried but she probably isnt 
maybe if i sang her a lullaby  ah oh no i forgot
you forgot what
i gave the medallion to reyson but i forgot all about the galdr ike what should we do
hey yeah  we never did find out who altina is did we she was the only one who could sing the galdr  well when things calm down well have to head out and search for her
is that altina you speak of one of the three who defeated the dark god
hey
sephiran so you made it did you
i arrived mere moments ago let me congratulate you on a successful end to your journey
thank you please tell me do you know who altina is
of course altina founded my homeland of begnion
oh then it was a mistake  we cant give a song to someone who died so long ago 
there is one who yet shares both bloodline and name–the true heir of altina
who is it
sanaki kirsch altina  none other than the apostle herself
the apostle is this something everyone in begnion would be aware of
no there are very few who know that name why do you ask
the apostle is altina 
oh im so relieved and exhausted too ike im going back to my room see you later sephiran
that was rather sudden did i say something to cause her distress
 no nothing like that its just that so much has happened between begnion and serenes 
would you tell me about it i would hear what you have to say on this matter
sure to tell the truth 
i see  the assassination of the apostle the serenes massacre and the use of the medallion to revive the dark god  all of it was part of ashnards grand scheme
thats the conclusion we came to
 you have me at a loss
why is that
for many years i have walked these lands watching  listening  and never did i uncover what you have found now that you have presented me with this information i dont know what to say
i merely fulfilled the hopes of my father and mother
now you speak from hindsight rescuing princess crimea winning the apostles trust and defeating king daein  with laguz at your side no less you have accomplished all of these miraculous things
i had trusted and valiant companions at my side it was only through their support that i was able to do these things
ever the humble one eh now then before i return home may i hear the galdr of release i must convey it to the apostle
you would do that
none of you can leave crimea the new queen will need your strength
 i suppose that will be the case for a little while wont it
 a little while you are the hero of crimea general ike if you wish it no post will be beyond your reach
i dont care about any of that its more trouble than its worth and i dont see the value of being some fancy lord when the countrys safe im giving up that title and everything and going back to being a simple mercenary
ha ha  t truly you are a  wha ha ha ha ha
is something strange
yes its very  haaaa ha ha haaaaa
um i think thats enough
im im s s sorry  hee hee  ahem 
unbelievable despite all appearances youre really quite rude
commander may i have a minute
sure what is it titania
princess elincia  oops its queen elincia isnt it the court ministers want queen elincia and you to come out onto the balcony and greet the people
what greet the people  me
yes you ive done what i was asked to do now hurry up and get going
h hey titania ah nuts why do i  whats going on
the people of crimea wish to see their hero and to sing his praises–even if the hero himself protests
if they want a greeting surely their new queen elincia would suffice ill go speak to her
whats wrong
everyones waiting to see you
im nervous ive spent my whole life in hiding no one ever taught me how to rule a kingdom i dont think im ready to be their queen i dont think im ever really going to be ready
whats the matter with you
ike stop it how can i–
did anyone teach you how to hire mercenaries
no but thats not the same–
how to win back lost allies how to win back your lost kingdom
but thats  thats different
no its not
youve done such an amazing job and i think you always will
i see
all right come on well do this together
thank you my lord ike i am  i am so blessed to have met you
and so it was that in the spring of the year 646 elincia ridell crimea saw peace return to her homeland in the years to follow the story of queen elincia and her noble hero ike spread across the land and inspired the songs of many a wandering troubadour
/***EOF***/
the continent of tellius blessed by the goddess to the northwest lies the land of crimea home of the greil mercenaries
without warning crimeas eastern neighbor the kingdom of daein launches an attack on crimeas capital city of melior
ike leads a handful of mercenaries to melior to confirm sorens news of the attack en route they happen upon a young woman unconscious but unharmed fearing for her safety they take her to their stronghold
when she awakens the woman gives her name as elincia and lays claim to the title of princess of crimeashe relates the sad tale of her flight from crimea and of her parents murder at the hands of ashnard king of daein the greil mercenaries answer princess elincias plea for help and agree to escort her to the kingdom of gallia
located to the southwest of crimea gallia is home to the laguz a race quite unlike ike and his fellow beorc
crimea and gallia have long struggled to overcome their differences in recent years the two kingdoms have done much to ease the prejudice between the laguz and beorc factions their combined efforts have forged a bond of trust and friendship that may yet overcome years of intolerance
ike and company escape the daein army abandoning their longtime base from there they begin the long march toward gallia their task clear and their destination far they slip into an ocean of trees
blazes why does it have to be so blamed humid if we werent being chased id strip off this armor here and now
then im almost glad that we are being pursued i suppose youll have to grin and bear it wont you
hm i suppose i will
right so enough of your griping youre merely wasting energy still this heat is appalling
dense forests such as these are not made for us delicate humans the sub humans love em though
these sub humans are they really so different from us
what you mean to tell me youve never seen a beast man before
no never
well i have theyre a hairy bunch ill tell you and ugly as sin too their faces are all fangs and whisker their claws are like daggers razor sharp and deadly and even though they can speak our language theyre beasts through and through savages every one
are there more than one type
the ones shinon calls sub humans can be divided into three groups each one named for its physical characteristics first the beast tribe next the bird tribe and finally the dragon tribe they are traditionally called laguz the laguz tribe residing here in gallia is the beast tribe who possess those feline qualities of which shinon spoke
to the south are the islands where the bird men live the dragons are in goldoa its something every mercenary should know looks like you know even less than i gave you credit for ike my boy
hm perhaps
 a little farther and well be out of these trees ike
really that means gallia proper compared to this forest even a kingdom of half breeds will seem like heaven
 and thats when we lost track of them i assigned a squad to pursue them and returned so i could give you this report
understood you may step down
so princess elincia is making her way through the forest to gallia ena
it appears your advice was sound well done you have earned my praise
thank you
when the king assigned me a tactician i wondered what i had done to lose his trust when i saw it was a young girli burned with anger at the kings judgment still its worked out better than i had expected keep up the good work
of course
now then its time for the hunt to begin
hold it right there everyone were coming to the edge of the forest form up combat positions
i dont suppose our daein pursuers were willing to let us just slip away
there is no doubt that they will attack again without knowing their numbers it is difficult to advise a course of action
take your best guess soren with the limited information we have what is the best way to proceed
 some of our group cannot fight if we are caught well have a difficult time defending them and attacking the daeins i propose we separate into two groups a small fighting force to engage the enemy and buy the main group some time and the rest of us–who will escort the princess to gallia at full speed
you want to divide our combat strength the main force aside dont you think the risk to the smaller group is too high
i believe this is the only way to achieve our goal and keep casualties to a minimumits possible theres an ambush waiting for us at the edge of the forest if we proceed with no plan we may be caught between the pursuit and the ambush which would be the end of us all
looks like weve no choice but to give it a go
all right lets split up the diversionary team will be gatrie shinon and me the rest of you guard princess elincia and proceed to gallia straightaway got it
are you sure youre taking enough men
idiot pup smaller numbers mean better mobility your time would be better spent worrying about yourself than about us
 
listen up this will probably prove to be the biggest fight this companys faced remember–youve got only one life i dont want any of you dying on mein times like these it matters not what our blood ties are we are family if you dont want to cause your family any grief then live ike will be commanding the main force titania youre his support all right lets move out see you all in gallia
so theyre waiting for us after all 
there are more of them than id imagined there would be i thought they would have been spread out across the forest border i didnt expect to see so many in one place
do we rethink our strategy
no weve already split up its too late to reconsider now
isnt there some way we can at least get the princess mist and rolf to the far shore safely
there are two bridges this thicket extends to the edge of the westernmost bridge if we can use the trees as cover we might be able to reach the bridge undetected from therewe can launch a surprise attack
well be creating a diversion right
correct while we keep the enemys attention the princess and the others can cross the bridge to safety
weve no time for discussion thats the plan we go with
my lord ike i i will fight with you
 no you wont
my lord
i cannot let you expose yourself to danger of any kind everyone here is risking his life to ensure your safety if you understand that youll cooperate and do as i ask
i see i will do my part
 
its settled then
right lets break through their lines
mist rolf take care of the princess do not let yourselves be seen
right be careful everyone
leave it to us ike well just pretend its a game of hide and seek and i never lose at hide and seek
everyone ready lets go
weve spotted the mercenaries you there inform general petrine at once request that she gather the troops
yes sir
whats this theyre not bad lets go men hit those mercenary scum with everything you have
reinforcements have arrived
very good lets crush these sellswords once and for all
try me ill not let even a single soldier get past
oooh my life ends here but though you flee to gallia you will fall to daein 
i dont know how but we made it

father shinon gatrie 
 
 princess elincia im afraid were going to have to part ways here
but what do you mean
were going back to aid our companions so i want you to continue with mist to the royal palace of gallia
what no ike im going to stay with you

 thank you please be careful
if youll excuse me
o benevolent ashera grant them all your blessings 
all right were going to go now

we go east on the road we used before lets find the commander before the enemy reinforcements show up
/***EOF***/
the crimean army defeats general petrine one of king ashnards feared four riders and finally arrives home the princesss return  is met with the jubilation and tears of the retainers who have managed to survive as long as we have princess elincia crimea will be liberated these are the words that gave the people hope as they endured the harsh rule of a conquering country the silent masses who long for the restoration of their homeland slowly begin to give voice to their dream surely they think this chance to see crimea freed will not be wasted
can it be
there is no mistake in my words the princess has returned to crimea lady lucia serves as her guide they should be on their way here as we speak
how long its been since weve seen the princess we have been living for the day where we  steal the eyes from daeins army and bring her home and now it has come
indeed for his majesty for the queen andfor crown prince renning as well we must act as one and support our beloved princess elincia
yes if all goes well our dearest wish will soon come to fulfillment
theres no time to wait if we wish to properly greet the princess and her retinue there is much to be done
right lets let everyone know we must divide the tasks and begin preparations for a feast at once
and flowers must be prepared for the princesss chamber oh we mustnt forget music and entertainment either
i suppose i shall have to polish the silver tableware i was hiding too
you you possess such refined things i figured a rustic boor like you would have sold them for a lamb shank
i received the silver from his majesty when i was awarded my knighthood  i have been saving it for just such an occasion
well done get ready we are going to be very very busy ha ha what a fantastic day this will be
the crimean retainers are waiting for us at this castle delbray
yes in your absence princess we used the cellars beneath the castle as a secret meeting place it is from there that we contacted other retainers who were hiding throughout the land
and no one was discovered
we disguised ourselves as merchants or peasants and daein looked right past us their arrogance is without equal however now that weve heard of your return we are bringing out our hidden crimean armor and polishing away
merchants ha geoffrey is one thing but i cannot imagine bastian as a shopkeeper
no one could thats why he dressed as a street performer
now that i can see im sure it suited him perfectly did he juggle and gambol about hee hee
and geoffrey  never have you seen a merchant with such perfect posture
hee hee hee that sounds just like him
princess elincia seems to be having a wonderful time shes been smiling and laughing for hours
it seems she and lucia grew up together she feels completely at ease around her
the princess seemed to be of good cheer when she was with us as well but i suppose she was putting on a brave face
when i see her in this light im reminded that shes still only a young woman what we see now is the princess as she was before daeins attack that is the true princess elincia
its good to be home isnt it weve still many battles ahead but for tonight we should relax and let ourselves forget our cares no one can continue under this much stress forever right
i suppose youre right
todays the happy day the princess returns yet the goddess sees fit to bring rain 
calm rain is like a kiss upon the face a scent and feel unparalleled in kind reunions in the rain are most heartfelt
say bastian  how far do you suppose the princess and her escort have come why arent they here yet
 sigh listen friend you have asked me that same question fifty eight times and i have responded fifty seven times but now fifty eight comes anon you need to calm yourself
i know but  
its only a little while longer make no mistake our princess will arrive today i understand your impatience i really do but youre the general of our little army if you act so the men will react in kind
you youre right 
a true knight is the essence of composure take a deep breath breathe in and out 
 sigh  woooooo  whew 
see dont you feel better
 hmmm ah blast its no good im going to go uh  check on stuff
what am i supposed to do with him
theyre here i see them
what really
thats them isnt it the princesss army
where show me where youre looking geoffrey thats not the princess those are daein troops
what no please tell me youre joking 
once we cross the hills well be in delbray territory count bastian went ahead of us so they should know of your return by now speaking of which here he comes now i suppose he couldnt wait any longer and came riding to meet you how sweet
princess elincia lady lucia
bastian theres no need for you to rush so im coming in your direction anyway  
weve been attacked castle delbray is surrounded by enemy troops
no
it cant be 
geoffreys acting as a decoy you must continue on this road to the southwest
so the enemys found us eh
nothing to do about it but change course ill lead you to another hiding place
wh what are you saying lucia we must help geoffrey bastian
luck was not with us princess we have no choice well have to abandon our companions in castle delbray
no we will not geoffrey and the others have survived so much already  i will not abandon them
princess please understand if we could do so without danger to you we would gladly risk our lives to go back
we cannot do this please lucia we must go to the castle  bastian you must not do this thing
geoffrey is a knight in the name of our friends honor princess you must escape
no  no theyve survived this long theyre alive no
general ike  we dont have much time while we stand here squabbling daein scouts may spot our position please move the army southwest on this road
no
pardon what did you say
were going to the castle if its surrounded by daein troops we cut our way through and join the other knights understood
werent you listening i said we had no choice but to leave them behind they were lost to us the moment the enemy discovered and surrounded them
theyre not so lost that we cant take them back
you are the general of crimeas army are you not even if only for the moment i would hope that you would act more in accordance with your responsibilities
i didnt choose or ask to be general i was put here by matters of time and circumstance but as a mercenary i have a contract with princess elincia thats still in effect that means shes my employer and right now my employer says she wants to go and save the people stuck in that castle is that correct elincia
yes i dont want  i dont want anyone else to be sacrificed
so were going to help them if youre so worried about the princess ill leave her here with you and you can keep her safe
my lord ike 
theyre coming into view combat formations
our goal is to rescue those knights near the castle
attention greils mercenaries move out the enemy awaits and we go to meet him
until the princesss army is out of sight we must not let the enemy spot them do what you must to draw their attention
yes sir
these crimean refugees are no easy meat and there are more of them than i expected hmm 
g general rikard enemy reinforcements are approaching from the east
what
it appears to be troops from princess crimeas army
the army that brushed aside our troops in daein and defeated general petrine at the riven bridge theyre marching towards us fantastic i was getting bored hunting stragglers lets smash all of these curs and wrap ourselves in glory
g general geoffrey its the crimean army princess elincias army is headed this way
fools what are you thinking bastian oh princess  its not too late please take wing and flee
lucia bastian  are you sure you want to do this
the words of ike ring yet on in my ears 
we were so trapped by our own ideas that we were unable to sympathize with your feelings im terribly sorry
because the two of you think to put me above all else you say you will sacrifice your lives for me yet  even if im able to borrow of ikes strength and win back crimea  if the cost of that victory is the lives of the two of you i shall never smile again and joy never again would that emotion fill my heart 
princess elincia 
please aid ike and rescue geoffrey and the others then return to me come back alive
for you we would the world itself depart
well be back
h hold a moment please my brave general
you again
i was but a humble court official in the service of our late king my name is bastian count of fayre allow me to give you proper greeting and respects general ike many thanks are due to you i am here to formally request your permission to join in the battle taking place in the  
shut up were in combat if you want to prattle on and on like this do so after we defeat the enemy
oh yes but of course well it seems ive found yet another font of good humor  hmph
general ike allow me to apologize for my earlier remarks ive a selfish request but  i would like to join  
yeah all right fine now hurry up
eh
if youve got the time to apologize youve got time to take out some enemies
of course to save my companions i will give my all
fantastic now lets go
are you sir geoffrey
eh who are you
im ike im leading the crimean army for princess elincia
the princess where is she
dont worry i didnt bring her to the battlefield with me
i see  thank goodness thank you for that regard
are the other soldiers inside the castle
yes im sure theyre staving off any attacks by enemy infiltrators
good im glad we made it in time lets combine forces and finish this
are you well my friend
bastian  why did you come back
ill explain it to you later for the sake of the princess expend your energy on living
understood
geoffrey im so glad we made it in time
lucia my sister what are you doing why did you leave the side of the princess
theres no time to discuss it now just know that she is safe if you want to see her yourself youd best try and survive
sister wait  blast
crimean royal knight fifth platoon captain kieran reporting for duty sir
kieran you live
yes sir general i was taken prisoner by daein and held in the dungeon of canteus castle oh it was a vile place they tried all manner of terrible tortures on me but i resisted to the last then i was freed by a company of mercenaries in the hire of princess elincia since that time i have been faithfully at the side of the princess protecting her from all harm
is the princess in good spirits
she is general geoffrey it is her great wish that you live so that she may see you once again
is that so very well now that ive heard that i must stay alive at any cost rally your hearts men of crimea we will fight and we will win the princess needs her castle
oh thank the goddess the crimean army has arrived we who have suffered so much under daeins rule will finally be free we can put our faith in that cant we if theres anything we can do to help well do it please rescue our beloved crimea
youre part of the army that brought the princess arent you oh youve done a great thing ive been hiding this scroll so i could give it to you use it to drive daein out of our homeland you can do it
is that the crimean army where is gawains son ah  hes much improved he is his fathers son after all contrary to my initial estimation he may prove to be worthy
what him its him
ike the castle has fallen to the enemy
curses we were too slow
i am rikard your corpse will be the sustenance that feeds my hunger for fame
no matter ones proven deeds one defeat unmans us all and so it ends 
fool run now and ill let you live
urghgg  im  not strong enough yet 
is that all you have it seems you do not possess the talents to surpass your father after all a pity
and yet another general of daein is defeated i wonder how powerful you will become army of crimea i look forward to our next meeting 
my lord ike
princess elincia so you came after all
thanks to your words both of my friends came to understand how vital it was
i dont understand the feelings of knights but i do understand how important your former retainers are to you and i also understand the strong support with which they provide you im happy we were able to save them
as am i
all right shall we return if im going to be fighting with them i should probably introduce myself
wait my lord ike
yes
as you said lucia and the others are very important to me they are family i may presume too much but well my lord ike you and the others are also irreplaceable to me so  i ask for your continued support
of course its an honor
princess
geoffrey
princess  ah to behold you again its  its 
if you had lost your life today this reunion would not be taking place geoffrey do you hear me be careful
yes princess lucia told me of what occurred our country and princess now exist as one it was never our intent to sacrifice your feelings for the sake of the nation please forgive us
but soft what luck that we do feel fates kiss anon the clouds do part the rains do stop heaven itself does sing and thus rejoice at the return of our one true ruler oh princess  until worlds end do you we vow to follow we are planets of your fair blazing sun
no longer will we think of honor and dying in so cavalier a fashion no matter the difficulties we face we will choose the road that allows us to continue living at your side
why appear now do you mean to tell me you purposely waited until the battle was over
hmph i know how your mind works i assumed you would attack the moment you saw me but perhaps youve learned to judge the importance of time and place
to a mercenary nothings more important than the contract between him and his employer
shall we call off our contest then when you die here youll be in breach of contract after all
thats not a problem all i have to do is win  ready yourself
hmph
youre not as overly clumsy as i had feared it is regrettable that your weapon is so poorly made
why do my attacks have no effect
my armor is blessed by the goddess only weapons that are also blessed can so much as scratch it
grrr  so common weaponry is useless is that it
you should not worry about such trivialities you possess the sacred blade ragnell do you not
ah
it is the counterpart to my blade alondite tell me you were not idiot enough to leave it in that place you took it with you did you not along with your fathers corpse
that that sword the one you threw to my father like an act of charity the one he refused thats ragnell
i claim victory today when next we meet bring ragnell without the proper weapon i grow bored
 
ah ike there hiding in the shadows of that tent grab him
huh what
hey ouch come on you gotta let me go
stop whining you little baby get over here
you spineless sop you never learn do you
whats going on
listen to this ike while i was changing my clothes my dear brother here tried stealing from my purse again
dont do this here you dont need to tell the whole camp about it do you
whos created this situation in the first place and here i was thinking that youd finally turned yourself around  even as we speak mother is at home weeping in her soup you chowderhead
dont worry about mom dads there to take care of her
you brainless eunuch gaaaaaa
m marcia ow ow my foot youre crushing it i heard something crunch help im being crippled
and no one cares
all right all right i think thats enough
hmph its one thing that youre a guppy brained lout  but its worse that you never ever change youre always being chased by thugs and i always have to go looking for you do you have any idea how much i worry would it hurt you to think of others once in a while youre my older brother remember
marcia 
 
im sorry ill give up gambling ill work hard and repay all of my debts please youve gotta believe me
 
why not forgive him hes the only brother youve got right
 well if ike insists 
r really do you forgive me
only if you keep your word this is the absolute last time
i swear i swear on dads grave
heh  thats not going to work you twit dads still alive
made you laugh bout time too
straighten up and dont trouble your sister anymore
say marcia
what is it makalov
you want to bet on how long i can keep my promise ill give you four to one odds
aaahhh
/***EOF***/
good morning ike may i have a moment of your time
what is it im listening
our expenses our ability to fight the current status of our troops these are all things that you must know
i see having a grasp of that is part of the commanders job too right understood let me hear it
very well
and thats it
ugh 
ike is something wrong
even though i was aware of the numbers hearing it in a report like this is hard
do you mean the casualites and refugees
death and destruction are all part of war my father said that a lot the first casualties of war are those without strength and those without luck and theres nothing you can do about it live with bravery be daring and fearless live for those who have died and yet i cant help but think f i were more powerful i could save more people couldnt i
ike 
 blast
indeed
forgive me i got carried away
no not at all  um perhaps i should 
thank you for the report i will need more of the same from here on keep up the good work
thank you commander i will do my best but if i have your leave i must be going
 thats it
i think ive got most of it
ill give you a report before each battle i hope that it helps
im sure it will thank you im relying on you for all the details keep up the good work
this place brings back such memories it hasnt changed in the slightest
titania have you been to gallia before
a long time ago when i was still a knight of crimea i volunteered for a military officer exchange program and spent some time studying at gallias royal palace
i get it now thats why you werent surprised when we saw the laguz
thats right ah ive missed the sea when the setting sun strikes the water its almost as though the horizon itself is on fire
hmm now that i think about it my father knew where that old castle was he sure acted like someone whod been to gallia before was he here with you
mm hm and we werent the only ones youve been here too ike
what
ike
its mordecai youd better answer him
yeah but 
we can finish our talk later after weve reached the castle
well that was cryptic
what is it mordecai
do you tire should we rest here
no i think were all right
good
beorc are such a weak species a distance like this is nothing any laguz worth his claws could cross it in a single bound
lethe
hmph it is the truth
if you persist in this way you will shame the king you sound like a fool
hsss you are my subordinate never speak to me in such a way
whats wrong is wrong you are a fierce warrior lethe but when it comes to the beorc you are far too stubborn
what did you say
come on now both of you lets calm down
 mordecai
 wait 
what is it
that smell on the wind its iron the smell of beorc heavily armored well armed
are you sure
general kotaff the crimean mercenaries have entered our area of operations
ha theyre trapped call every last man ready for battle we stop the enemy here
black armor theyre daein men all right
youre saying that some of the invasion force is still around
daein worms they strut about the gallian forests as though they own them i wont stand for it
grrr the castle to the southmany beorc are inside they carry iron weapons i smell them
not good titania gather everyone together
ha understood
what now
what do you mean
if you hope to crush the worms youd do well to capture the ruins in the south since you probably want to flee there is an escape route 
were going to fight
oh
there are times when running has its advantages but i dont think well lose here
 i see
i will also fight
good we could use the help
ike everyones here
all right lets go
i want you two to take mist and rolf and retreat to the rear
of course
were counting on you be careful
everyone who can fight grab a weapon greil mercenaries move out
ike
mist you and rolf clear out of here stay back no matter what
no ike were going to fight with you–both of us
what no thats not going to happen be serious mist the two of you cant even wield weapons
ive got this
a heal staff
yeah i made rhys teach me how to use it i can heal injuries i mean just little ones but still 
little ones no theres no way im letting you on this battlefield huh
rolf stop being such a brat you little twerp
im going to fight too im good with a bow
really thats news to me is that the best lie you could come up with
its no lie
thats right hes not lying
of course he is
what are you talking about mist
rolfs always practicing with his bow and hes really good arent you
i sure am
and when did you learn to use a bow
well lets see um i guess i just sorta picked it up naturally
stop lying you booger eating brat you cant just pick up a weapon and start firing away someone has to teach you the basics
well maybe im just a prodigy cause i learned it all myself
you little 
you dont know anything boyd
thats right
this is ridiculous
enough you two go back
no we dont want to all rolf and i do is sit and wait and worry about all of you were tired of waiting we want to fight by your side
is that so
how about it rolf is that how you feel too
uh huh no doubt wed rather be with you
sigh 
what now commander

are you serious
yes you wont regret this ike i promise
i hope not
lets see now where are they aha ive found them

aarrr lets see what we can see then

yar har ho
yo ho har
by the way 
what is it
if there is some special task you would ask of us we are willing to listen
what are you talking about
bah open your ears if you wish it we shall follow your orders hssss but you must direct us
really youre willing to take orders from me
this is a beorc fight if you dont direct us then we have no reason for being here so spoke our king
but last night you 
that that was an emergency
we thought you were in danger
you thought correctly we were in danger i thank you we were greatly aided by your arrival
you are welcome
hmm
very well let us fight together if you choose not to direct us we shall do as we please do you find this acceptable
of course well then good fortune to us all
ike
you youre that 
thats right its me marcia as promised im here to pay my debt im going to join your group
join us but i thought you were one of the holy pegasus knights of begnion 
pfff i resigned so what do you say are you going to let me in or what come on
are you sure about this i mean ill be honest with you were a destitute band of mercenaries your wages will be a pittance compared to what youre used to
so what are you saying no
no im simply pointing out that youll be losing almost all of 
pfff i wont lose out on anything plus ill work twice as hard as anyone else cmon please let me join pleeeease
well if thats what you want i guess well give it a shot were shorthanded though so youre going to be busy
huzzah thats great just tell me what needs doing
rolf stay by my side
you got it
hold a minute that was too easy whats going on
nothing but if im close to you i can protect you so you have no need to worry
what hey thats my line
rolf
im im sorry
huh why are you apologizing
what but arent you here to yell at me
why did you do something to make me mad
i thought maybe my whole decision to fight and stuff i made that on my own i thought that it might upset you
i wont complain about the commanders decisions
so youre all right with it
i suppose but i want you to stay close so i can watch out for you
got it
wait there is one thing when did you learn to use a bow
um its a secret
thats no answer rolf blast i told you to stay close
eeeek hu hu humans yaaaaah
um 
urk urk ahhh oh come on you are so rude if you cant tell im playing dead so go away huh why because my mother told me if you ever meet a beorc play dead and it will leave you be its not true is it hsss i knew it wasnt true i knew it well then take this and get out of here quickly i hate humans i dont want to talk to youhsss shoo
youre from crimea arent you im a warrior of the beast tribe lord ranulf spoke of you  doubtless you have noticed that fort tatana has been taken by daein forces watch your step around that bunch theres a dangerous mage with them we of the beast tribe find magic and especially fire magic particularly threatening i am waiting for friends and cannot take leave of this house but i would give you this if you use it your magical resistance will increase it will help you fight that mage take care
scallywags of the sea are we we earn our gold with axes bold
scallywags of the sea are we an end like this is quite worthy
death to the rogues who defy daein defend our brethren erase their shame
arrgh urr urg in the name of the empire cleanse my shame 
we defeated their commander but we still dont know what they were after
it seems unlikely that they were merely pursuing princess elincia i wonder if daein is planning to invade gallia perhaps crimea was only a stone on which to whet their blades
no matter the motive the fact remains that daein crossed the border under such circumstances hostilities between daein and gallia could break out at any time
so its war again
if war erupts between the beorc and laguz its only a matter of time before other nations become involved could daein truly mean to set the land aflame in a blaze of war if that happens many of our citizens will be sacrificed on the altar of their ambition
we too need to choose which way to move whose side to take 
whose side we shall never support daein unthinkable
captain titania we are human would you truly have us side with sub–with laguz against other humans that is unthinkable
beorc and laguz 
are you going to sit here and argue about a war that hasnt started you beorc are all so timid its pathetic
lethe you must not say such things
mordecai lethe what do you think will it come to war
our claws are sharp if daein invades gallia we are ready for battle if our king wills it war will come
i like it not war brings pain sorrow
this is troubling 
enough we have lost much time let us make for the palace we must reach tonights camp before the sun sets
is the palace still far
on your skinny beorc legs it is very far but we will do as we can
my lord ike everyone
princess elincia
i heard about commander greil i i dont know what to say
dont worry were all right were getting by somehow
 oh ike 
the king has arrived
um  hey there
thank you for coming to gallia palace i am caineghis ruler of the kingdom of gallia
these are the greil mercenaries i am ike their commander
you have been raised well young pup i didnt recognize you
what
when last you were here you were still a small child
is that you titania its good to see you
the pleasure is all mine your majesty
the two of you are friends how how does the king know me
mm i have something i must tell you about your father greil 
lethe mordecai leave us now prepare rooms so our guests may have a place to rest and heal their wounds
at once my lord
would it be best if i were to leave as well
no princess i would have you stay and this one also will stay
 
this is giffca my shadow pay him no more heed than you would the air
understood i would have titania and soren stay with me as well
me
so be it now then where to begin
titania how much did greil tell his son
ike was raised with no knowledge of gallia whatsoever nor does he recall ever having been here
is that so then it is best for me to tell him all that i know  although that is not much
thats all right whatever you can tell me would be much appreciated i want to know more of my father
hmm you have good eyes honest and bravei see your father in them long ago greil your father worked as a mercenary for gallia we forged a strong bond he and i to speak truly i still do not trust the beorc but your father was different
princess elincias father king ramon and his brother lord renning are also of a different kind all are or were exceptional men men in whom one could put his trust
oh ho titania you are an exception as well among beorc females you are unique
you are most gracious your majesty
my father was a mercenary for gallia 
correct and you and your sister you were both born here in gallia you stayed only for a short time but part of your childhood was spent within these borders
mist and i were born here is that so i dont remember any of this at all
i feel your parents were carrying a dark secret someone was hunting them im sure of it once over ten years ago and after your mother had been slain your father chose to leave gallia before he left i went to him and asked him to share his tale i asked him why are you being chased is there anything i can do to help but i was unable to loosen his tongue and then i heard he had returned to gallia and i thought i had another chance to hear his tale his fate was black indeed if i had been faster if i had hastened my steps perhaps things would be different
wait now i understand the voice i heard that was you wasnt it
his wound was fatal i could do nothing i thought it best not to interfere in his final moments so i remained hidden tell me ike  at his last did he confess anything to you the identity of the black knight did he reveal it
the black knight no i dont know who he was my father entrusted me with his command told me to trust king caineghis and to live peacefully in gallia he said to forget everything else
is that so well then let me do as i can if any of your mercenaries desire to live here i will so arrange it i will vouchsafe them homes and land
your kindness is truly appreciated but speaking for myself i couldnt live here in peace not now i will avenge my father i cannot so quickly forget the past or the black knight
but ike thats not 
i know im not im not strong enough an opponent who could defeat my father is well beyond my reach but thats why ive devoted myself to growing stronger i will lead my fathers mercenaries and prepare for the day when my chance for revenge arrives
a prudent course of action you look as one who would be more impulsive but you are greils son after all
ha youve matured ike it seems like yesterday that you were merely a child
titania 
and now i would ask a boon of you
the strength of your mecenary band ike would you lend it to princess elincia
are you serious
king caineghis
gallia and crimea are allied nations that cannot be denied however this alliance in reality binds only the royal families it is not respected by our citizenry
the people of gallia are seldom seen in crimea are they even though our nations are friends the people of crimea have little real understanding of the laguz many of our people still use that undignified name sub human when they speak of the laguz 
 my fathers heart was filled with shame and sorrow over what you describe more than any king in our history he wanted to deepen relations between our people and then 
perhaps that is why daein targeted him their hatred of the laguz is well known
could it be 
in my heart of hearts i would like to take guardianship of princess elincia and assist in the rebuilding of crimea however anti beorc sentiment is running high here in gallia if we were to offer safe harbor to elincia i feel many of our elder statesmen would protest they would say that we are giving daein an ideal excuse to attack
which means gallia cant offer princess elincia any relief at all is that it
unfortunately it is true
my lord ike king caineghis has advised me to turn to the begnion theocracy for aid in crimeas restoration he says we should make of begnion a formal request and gain the support of their shields
passage to begnion will require several months at sea an escort will be necessary 
as you know we lack the numbers to serve as a complete mercenary army so if the princess were willing to hire us as an escort it would be an offer beyond our expectations
titania soren i think perhaps we should accept the kings offer what do you say
its what you want right commander well then its our job to follow you
however you wish to proceed is fine i will do all in my power to ensure that our road leads to success
understood as of now the greil mercenaries shall assume the honor of serving as escort to the princess of crimea
princess elincia our journey together will undoubtedly be a long one may we serve you well
oh thank you very much i only pray that i in turn may be worthy of your service
/***EOF***/
i got it
ike just a bit more would you mind hearing my report on our last battle
uh sure go ahead please
very well
 this can only mean one thing the enemy knows exactly how we are going to move with your permission ill begin an investigation to see if theres anyone suspicious among the troops  ike
 
ike are you all right
hm  yes sorry what is it
nothing i was just giving you the standard update shall i put it off till later
no sorry but can you start over from the beginning ill pay attention this time
understood
good morning you two whats wrong ike you look so sleepy
ive had a lot on my mind i meant to sleep last night but i was up thinking before i knew it it was morning
really i never thought id hear that ike didnt sleep because he was thinking i wonder if soren will start being polite 
listen titania  can i just  
b brother ike
whats wrong mist
what am i going to do ike my medallions gone
what its gone
no
what am i going to do it was my only memento of mother  
did you drop it or put it somewhere and forget something like that
no i always carry it with me i would never lose it i had it before i went to bed last night  it vanished while i was sleeping sniff waaaa 
dont cry its not your fault
but but 
i said dont cry ill find it all right
all right  sorry 
 
ike just a bit more would you mind hearing my report on our last battle
uh sure go ahead please
a are you serious
you are to begin immediately
yet thats  general petrine if we do this thing daein will suffer
its for the good of the country besides its only one territory stop mewling like an old woman
i hear you and yet if the goal is merely to stop the crimean army this is not necessary the strength of my troops will suffice to  
the last idiot who told me that ended up on a corpse pile now listen to me and listen well no matter how passionate you are when you tell me youll defeat crimea ill never pin my hopes on a bunch of foreigners all you have to do is stop their forward progress thats all my plan will accomplish this
general petrine do you truly think so little of us its true that we were born in begnion and not daein but my men and i have been loyal to this country for eighteen years we have spared no effort to learn all the proper manners and customs of this land but now after all of that to be dismissed as a bunch of foreigners 
no one asked how long youve lived here want to know why because no one cares certainly not me where were you born huh where were you raised ha this country doesnt need squatters like you the only people daein can count on in times of crisis are daeins themselves everyone else is just gutter leavings
so were useless is that what youre saying
you tell me migrant why is it that your unit which was trained to be an elite royal guard is here patrolling this hick infested backwater the answers clear to me how about you
i  i 
oh im sorry  am i offending you well heres your chance to show us your worth halt crimeas advance if you are as skilled as you claim you should be able to limit the damage to its bare minimum should you not
grrr 
hmph angry is a good look for you i look forward to seeing the results of your work get going outlander
g general shiharam  must we truly go through with this its such a horrific act its only recently that the citizens hereabouts have even come to trust us
we have no choice but to obey its as the woman says the only thing we can do is ensure the crimean army is defeated as soon as possible
general  
open the floodgates do it now
my lord ike were you able to find the medallion
no its gone i fear that daein may have somehow stolen it
what is such a thing possible
i dont know to what degree but there can be no questioning daeins involvment
is the medallion special
 yes oh yes 
 i beg your pardon
what is it
my question may have touched a sensitive area
oh no  its not that i dont want to discuss it with you personally i just cant really talk about it to anyone its a private matter
ah i see
ike
what is it ulki
i hear the sound of rushing water just ahead a lot of it
rushing water
according to the map theres a large river up ahead
that must be what you hear
this is unnatural warped it is not the sound of a normal river 
general ike sir weve got trouble the road ahead is blocked by water
what how can that be
perhaps a local river has flooded the whole region is soaking wet
is the road completely impassable
no sir we can move forward but the waters turned the ground to mud and the water is still flowing at a tremendous rate sir this is going to cut back our speed dramatically
this is the work of daein they thought to impede our progress in order to gain some time for themselves and theyve succeeded
blast is there nothing we can do
well  if they were able to flood the road only when we approached there must be floodgates in the area
so if we can close them well shut off the flow of water right that makes sense lets get some scouts looking for gates
whats that hey if youre looking for something leave it to me i am the hawk kings eyes after all
what do you mean
these peepers of mine can see for miles and miles theyre quite handy it would be a shame not to use them
is that some laguz power youre a hawk with the eyes of a hawk
it beats your fantastic wit my eyesight isnt a racial ability its just my own natural talent heck my pal ulki has ears that can hear grass growing on the other side of the country
i see well then the jobs yours do you think you can find the floodgates
i just look for some openings with a lot of water pouring out right yeah i can handle that
the crimean army is here all troops combat formations hit them fast and hard we cant let this battle drag out
so those are the floodgates
if we can get them closed the water will recede in about twelve hours or so
all right lets get going
 
are you all right you look rather pale
oh general ike 
what is it mist is worried that youre not feeling well
to be honest  the man leading the enemy forces general shiharam hes my father
what hmm  thats not good do you really want to face your father in combat
i joined this army based on my own convictions i think i can meet my father with my head held high
well if youre sure  just remember if you change your mind let me know theres no need for you to be in the vanguard if you dont want to be
thank you 
lady jill is that you what are you doing with the crimeans
im sorry  ive chosen the path thats right for me
pah you would betray your own father
 
you traitor
 
my lady jill  no why does this have to be 
ge general how long are the floodgates to remain open
until the crimean army has been defeated
sir if we wait that long all of the neighboring farmland will be drowned the locals are already quite upset they may not abide this much further
 
general
enough soldier if youve got the time to be bellyaching take your butt out to the battlefield and kill some crimean soldiers
captain haar do you support this action this is inhumane lives will be ruined daein citizens will die even if we claim that its necessary in order to achieve victory  this is too much
this is daeins way are you ready to disobey the king and be put to the death for your troubles
i would rather die than kill innocent daein civilians
if youre executed as a traitor to the throne your parents and siblings will also pay are you still prepared
 
now do you understand what im trying to tell you go fight bravely
 y yes sir
to gain the trust of the king weve become cruel and heartless first hunting and executing the laguz and now flooding the lands these people call home
general shiharam  if someone hears you use the word laguz in this country youll be branded a traitor
hmm youre right as always to live in this land where laguz prejudice is so virulent weve had to seal away everything we know and teach our children to hate all sub humans all that just to survive here
its ashnards fault this country has become what it is today ah what a terrible miscalculation we made even so i  i hated the idea of furthering the corruption of the imperial senate i will continue to support your reasons for leaving begnion
 i wonder if jill has distanced herself from the crimean forces
i did give her warning
above all else i would like to avoid meeting my daughter in combat
i pray that she does not take to the field this day knowing her temperament talking with you would only increase both of your sorrows
i have but one favor to ask of you
say it and it will be done
do not fight today
what
only one side can win a battle if we are defeated in the end i want you to care for the survivors and their families
 yes sir commander shiharam
commander  its been many a long year since you last called me that
may the fortunes of war be with you through all thats happened  its been an honor to serve with you
mmm 
ike its no use the waters too high
i wasnt fast enough  no
ike  we must retreat im sorry but we lose
how can this be father forgive me
father
jill is that you
why why are you doing this terrible thing you must close the floodgates now the fields will be lost but there may be time to save the homes
i cannot 
father
if you wish to stop the water you must defeat your father that is the only way 
what is it there has to be a reason i know that an act like this cannot be what you desire
 jill you must leave please if you cant do that then slay me theres no more time
 very well in that case i will fight with you
what did you say
not as a soldier of daein but as one of your soldiers i will fight
jill calm yourself you mustnt get caught up in the emotions of the moment and lose your way
joining the crimean army opened my eyes for the first time i was able to think about what i fight for until that moment i only did as i was ordered it was all for fame and glory now i finally understand i fight for those i wish to protect father i want to fight for you
even if you come to regret it
yes im prepared for that i jill fizzart hereby return myself to the command of general shiharam what are your orders sir
hold on youngster who do you think you are you cant just come barging into peoples homes let me tell you something you can ransack my home all you want but youll find nothing of value here all our young men have been dragged off to war and all thats left are women and children if its gold youre after take that scroll on the floor there you may be able to sell it its just something i picked up so i dont know if it has any value but take it anyway you dirty thief
you you filthy crimean get out get out now theres nothing in this shack that would make you happy
 
oh so you wont leave till you get something is that it here take this old staff now hit the road youve no need to steal anything else from us or will you take my life as well in that last skirmish  my boy my only son  you stole his life curse you i hope youre satisfied
neither of us desires a drawn out battle come hold nothing back
 haar  the rest is up to you   ji ll 
general ike sir the floodgates have been closed
soren whats the damage to the surrounding area
its terrible all of the fields and homes have been completely destroyed
i see 
 i dont think this is what the enemy general wanted either so why did this have to happen
its heartless  what will happen to those whove lost their homes can we do anything to help them
you want to aid the people of our enemy that is time and energy we cannot afford
soren take a portion of our supplies and distribute it among the locals
what are you serious
our opponent is the daein army weve no quarrel with these people
ike i know you feel for these people but this is war we dont have  
i dont know what it will accomplish soren but moving on without lifting a finger is something i cannot do
i understand id rather regret something i had done than regret taking no action at all
i would like to help too perhaps i can aid the injured
 idiocy 
well thats that we gained some time by flooding the river but it wont hold them for long i knew that foreign cur was useless  it looks like the decisive battle will be fought near the capital
preparations are complete general petrine in order to ease command for you sir bryan will serve as your deputy regarding strategy it would be easiest if you spoke with him directly  
sorry to tell you this ena but im not the one wholl be directing our forces in the capital
will it be the black knight then hmm the plans must be adjusted slightly ill select someone else to act as deputy 
no not him either his majesty wishes you to direct the defenses ena
me i am to take command of the army
thats right youre moving up in the world general ena
i its too much for me  i must confirm this with the king 
ha what a rare sight this is ive never seen you so flustered listen if you wish to meet with his majesty you must fulfill your duties hes ordered that there be no communications until that time
 
im a bit late
well if it isnt the big black knight its been such a long time youre always so very busy arent you here one day there the next  your secret maneuvers are  
they are proof of the trust his majesty has placed in me ena go to the east gate you have a visitor
very well 
is it the worm did he bring it with him
it appears so he insists that he give it directly over to ena though
hmph as long as it is ours it makes no difference
when ena returns you will be the one to take it directly to the king show care that it is not unwrapped on the way there that could be unfortunate
i dont need to be told that more importantly what will you do now
me i will 
ena  have you been well
where is lehrans medallion
right here take it please
it feels so heavy and its not all the wrapping either could this be the chaotic energy  of an evil god
so you can now return to king ashnards side can you not
no not yet
what do you mean
ive been entrusted with the defense of the capital i must face the crimean army
no
thank you youve done so much for me but now its  its enough please reclaim your freedom theres no need for you to follow daeins orders any longer
and you do you mean to die
no  i cannot retreat even if i have to slaughter the entire crimean army  i will return to him 
yet he thinks nothing of you 
that matters not the only place i belong is at his side i will most likely never see you again  i will pray for your eternal happiness
ena wait
forget about me that is my final request farewell nasir
 ena 
oh father 
jill  no matter the reasons im the one who took your father from you i cant use this war as an excuse
 
if you want revenge on me for your father i understand you have that right
 
once youve had some time to think things through let me know what you will do id like to have you stay with us but  its really up to you thats all i had to say
 sniff  sn sniff  
one two three  five in all were lucky to have that many
captain haar  what are we supposed to do now general shiharam is dead and our homes are gone what are we to do with our families
what do you want to do weve lost any right we had to stay here so that leaves begnion or crimea 
general shiharam was slain by crimea joining with them now is not its not possible
then all you can do is return to begnion i doubt youll get a heros welcome but ive an old friend in the pegasus knights shall i contact her
sniff  ah gods eighteen long years what does any of it mean now
dont say that no matter what im proud to have served under general shiharam
youre right  it was an honor 
yoo hoo you there young man i have business with the general of this army would you convey a message
who are you
 who am i what kind of low born greeting is that my name is calill and i am a first class mage
and what would a first class mage want with this army
whats your problem you look as if you dont believe me well  suppose i cant hold that against you its not often you find beauty like this coupled with intelligence like mine but its true nonetheless
a mage huh well i guess you can never have too many mages lying around
oh and as a bonus im quite skilled with a knife as well beauty brains and brawn  sigh the goddess has seen fit to put the abilities of three people into one delectable packagesounds like favoritism doesnt it a um hellooooo are you listening to me theres a beautiful woman talking
yeah the point is that you want to join the crimean army right how much are you planning to charge
well arent you the little businessman lets see  how does free sound
suspicious whats the catch
i like my fees to be based on performance watch how i do in combat and make me an offerdepending on what it is ill decide whether or not to grace you with my assistance
youre not lacking for confidence are you
of course not i already told you im a first class mage
all right youre in
what are you allowed to make decisions like that on your own perhaps i should speak to the general
i am the general
whaaaaaat
reyson could you come down here for a moment
what do you need
ive got something i want to ask you about
if i can help i will
your  your ancestors    
forget it its nothing
what is something wrong
i apologize please let it go
it seems like something important has happened but if you do not want to discuss it that is your righthowever if this werent a battlefield your secret might not be safe please take care in the future
what do you mean
we of the heron clan if we choose to we can read the thoughts of others
seriously
however this power is only available to us in a calm and peaceful environmenthere in this desperate maelstrom of chaotic emotion it avails me not energy here is warped and distorted
you know now that you mention it reyson are you feeling sick
 
youre so pale that its hard to tell but i think your face looks more wan than usual
pay it no mind im fine
youve got nothing to prove why dont you stay off the battlefield for a while
ike im fine i promise please do not give me special treatment
as far as giving you special treatment goes i dont really have a choicei promised king phoenicis i wouldnt push you too hardif anything were to happen to you id be at war with daein and the bird clans at the same time
 i seei came to repay my debt but im really just being a burden
that was not my intention hold on a moment who said anything about you being a burden
i cannot engage in combat so im nothing more than an obstacle in the field
reyson no thats absurd dont you understand how useful your abilities areno one else can do the things that you can youre irreplaceableso if youre not feeling well and try to do too much you may not be there when we really need you
im of use to you then
thats what ive been trying to tell you we depend on you and thats why i need to make sure you stay healthy
in that case  i wouldnt mind taking a short break but you can call me anytime ill come right away
/***EOF***/
the crimean capital yet the opponent that awaits them is none other than ashnard king of daein if they lose here all of their hardships will have been for naught preparations for the attack proceed with the utmost care the final battle is approaching an air of exaltation pervades the camp but ike remains focused on the road ahead readying himself for what is to come
it appears that leanne is being held in gritnea tower to the south thats right isnt it ena
yes that is correct
how do you know that
i was searching for information and that search led me to a troop of daein soldiers that had been assigned to the tower it was the extra knowledge i needed
you wont tell me any more than that will you no matter how important it might be to our upcoming fight
 
 i beg your pardon
i figured as much ive already decided to trust you so all thats left to do is move out
thats gritnea tower right
i believe so
say ike  theres something really odd about that tower  sniff i mean really odd 
what is it
i sense several of the beast tribe but what is that  sniff  ugh something smells terrible
the tower holds laguz who have been given toxins foul potions that warp their true shape
are you talking about the laguz that cant change forms like the ones we fought in begnion
 yes
do you know how many and what type are in there
as far as numbers a conservative estimate would be thirty types there are tigers and cats from the beast tribes hawks and ravens from the bird tribes and dragons 
there are some from the dragon tribes as well
no more than ten er probably no more than ten 
we have to fight ten dragons like you
they are not like me master ike they are much stronger
 thats hardly encouraging 
regardless we must hurry its going to be dark soon its rather embarrassing but we of the bird tribes dont move well in the dark
sad but true of course the same can be said for those on the enemy side as well
on the other hand darkness means next to nothing for my kind depending on who we face it could prove to be a significant  
there are more of the beast tribe than any other it is because we are close to gallia
listen you  are you sure you want to be on our side
 hm yes of course that is why i provide accurate information
nasir
what do you think ranulf my grandchild is impressive is she not
thats not what i was going to say grandpa  
so once it gets dark were going to be at a disadvantage right all right as long as we know that we can plan for it
youre too calm about this for my tastes this is going to be a  
enough ranulf we dont have time for complaints we need to find the entrance to the tower
yeah yeah im coming
look at this will you what a glorious mix of birds beasts and dragons we have to greet us
king of hawks this is no joking matter they  
hold on my brothers just a little longer soon i will grant you all release
oh 
tibarn is not the only one who is filled with rage to warp the gift that the goddess has granted us this crime shall not go unpunished yaaaaa
prince reyson 
come ranulf lets join them we must rescue leanne as soon as possible for reysons sake as much as anything else
those poor laguz  someone will die for this today
 ahh  where am i 
whee hee hee it appears that shes finally coming around
we brought this girl here on direct orders from his majesty simple stuff yes very easy very nice then he gives all these special commands dont let her escape dont let her get sick dont let people kill her more than anyone else his highness should know how hard it is to keep one of these birdies healthy 
is there a problem
eh who do you think you are why is it you disturb my meditations im thinking here
um  im here to relieve you on guard duty
standing guard eh dont see much reason for a guard in this place but armies always have all their rules and regulations and appearances and hullabaloo ah no way around it i suppose
i believe that guards and watches are important
wheee in other places yes but gritnea tower is currently overflowing with veteran soldiers not to mention those repulsive beasts those feral ones you know trying to escape from this place is the same as committing suicide not that ive tried mind you
so a watch is necessary
hmmm wheee whats that now who said that oh its you important eh whys that
weeell if the girl were to leave her room we would be unable to stop her from getting killed
ooo you found a blind spot thats the problem with us scholars we concentrate on one thing and miss something as fundamental as  
blast theyre getting riled up again  listen you you stay right here and stand guard dont let that heron girl take one step outside this room do you understand me wheee i told you we needed guards
 sigh  dont worry ill take care of everything
bah always when im in the middle of something  snaggle toothed cheese stealing 
finally methinks that guy fell a little far from the nest hello little heron girl theres nothing to be afraid of i wont hurt you just sit there and be quiet all right
where isthis place who are you 
that took longer than id expected cursed sub humans flea bitten wretches huh wheres the heron girl and the guard helloooo guard bird girl wheeeeee this cant  no ive been had nooooooooo what do i do if this is discovered his majesty will  hell hang me up by my thumbs oh no  oooooh noooo  no no no i will not report thisum  uh  think izuka think hmmm if i can somehow divert attention from myself 
master izuka
gyaaaa
master izuka weve got trouble a strange group of insurgents approaches the tower they are well armed sir master izuka
eh insurgents wheeee   um  ahem did you say insurgents have appeared
yes sir a mixed group of sub humans and humans
ah  i see i see then we must give them a warm reception no
general heddwyns mages have engaged them but theyre not nearly enough we must apply to the capital for more reinforcements to  
release the feral ones
th those monsters but 
no need to worry i have just given them their medication theyve all been trained not to attack any daein soldiers
v very well i  
do it now the enemy must not be allowed inside the tower
y yes sir
 feh feh feh wheeeeeeee what fortuitous timing now then i will take this moment and prepare to make my escape
 whew i thought as much when i first snuck in here but this really is an unbelievable place what in asheras name is going on why are all these crazed laguz creeping about
i hate this
hm oh you dont like this eh neither do i this helmet and armor are horribly restrictive you know
hows that leanne its been twenty years but im still quite an eyeful dont you agree
youre very handsome naesala
yeah i havent changed much eh and you knew it was me back there right away didnt you ah im glad you survived its very good to see you again
yesi am also pleased
now on to the problem at hand we went to the trouble of escaping that tower so id hate to end up a meal for one of our insane cousins our objective is to rendezvous with nealuchi here we go leanne hold on tight
yes i will
whats going on theyre all looking the same direction
naesala over there
tibarn and friends eh oh very good this will work out nicely 
ne nestling weve found you at last
nealuchi youre here sooner than expected you pushed your old wings to the limit didnt you
i couldnt be late to the rescue of the dear lady leanne now could i
nealuchi you came for me too
oh what a glorious sight you look so much like your dear departed mother sniff 
dont cry nealuchi
hey save your tears for later while tibarn and the others take care of the enemy we must escape
y yes of course this way
this is not good  theyre closing in there are not enough feral ones someone anyone haaaalp go find master izuka at once
master izuka  call him 
oof i cant believe im saying this but i must withdraw
ike any sign of her
no i dont see her anywhere
leanne  where have you gone
hello everyone are you having some sort of problem
naesala
oh king kilvas how nice
i believe i have what you seek right here
brother oh my brother
leanne youre safe
brother brother
 you you rescued her
listen and listen good i dont want there to be any misunderstandings here it was tibarn he forced me to do this it wasnt any sense of charity or anything it was a sort of payment for the debt i had incurred
i knew choosing you would pay off excellently done
flatter me all you like hawk king youll get nothing in return as promised the duke tanas account has been completely settled
yes as agreed
well then i take my leave of you
theres no need to rush off is there since youve come all this way why not stay and help us with king daein
what a splendid idea
what enough of your nonsense i prefer to keep my life intact thank you
naesala are you leaving
listen to me leanne i have no good reason to fight the king of daein
no good reason and what about your fellow kilvans king daein has taken their natural identity and warped it beyond repair
they left kilvas of their own accord how far should my responsibility for them extend
you 
i hate to interrupt but 
what is it nasir
i have something i want to show you all will you please come below
this tower has a basement
we just discovered a hidden staircase
lets go
what is that smell
 it is corruption
its too dark to see anything we need light 
 what what is this oh by the goddess 
 
w what is this  nasir answer me
ranulf
laguz  at one time they were laguz 
i hope ranulf and the others are all right they behaved as if nothing had happened but i could sense they were in pain
that dungeon was the most vile thing i have ever seen im glad you werent there
was it that bad
it was barbaric beyond description  there were more laguz corpses than we could count they had been tortured twisted and warped beyond all recognition
ah such horrors 
why would ashnard do such things what could be his purpose here
 the king called powerful beorc to his cause but he had to see if they were worthy he would test them by pitting them against those laguz ashnard considers laguz to be tools in service to his own mad ends nothing more they are instruments to be used as he sees fit i heard that he  ordered his scholars to perform all kinds of experiments they used elixirs to drive them mad and keep them locked in their changed states their life spans were much shortened but for a brief time they became extremely powerful they 
 
 thank you for telling us thanks to you we found leanne youre free now you can do whatever you like
 i will go to the capital please accept me into your army
you dont have to do that fighting against your former companions could prove difficult
take me with you there is something that i have to do please master ike
i ask it of you as well please
 very well lets fight together
general ike the army has arrived at the outskirts of melior we await your deployment orders sir
very well tell the men to stand down and await my command
 at last we face the king of daein
yes  the war is coming to an end
it appears so
hm is there something bothering you
no of course not its nothing like that but 
but what
some  some of the soldiers are saying that when the wars over their chances for promotion will dry up
they want to continue fighting even though crimea  and daein too   have suffered so much
no thats not what i mean i apologize i will go inform the men
 
well done youve improved dramatically in a very short period of time
do you think so
i do not know how to lie or offer false praise i am deputy commander of the apostles bodyguards if you were not destined for greater things i would petition the apostle herself for your enlistment
oh thank you i cant believe it myself if not for your instruction tanith this would not be possible
training new recruits has long been my duty and yet i believe this is the first time anyone has been so appreciative my other pupils commonly referred to me as the great demon isnt that so marcia
great demon mutton chops no d dont be silly we all adored our sincere and devoted deputy commander great demon pfff more like great uh angel lady 
ha sure seriously though youve improved so much princess  perhaps we should try something special 
what n not that shes not ready for that youre crazy
tanith i im not sure that im ready 
listen to me princess the foes we are facing are daeins elite troops led by king ashnard himself how do you expect to fight them without at least one killing attack under your belt
 
you do it deputy commander and well keep practicing right princess elincia
i  i will try it
whaaaaat
i want to grow stronger to reach that goal i will do whatever it takes
well spoken now then to match your desire i will fall back on the methods i used while training the apostles bodyguards
all right 
oh horsemeat 
come we have little time for niceties both of you follow me now come on maggots do you want to live forever
y yes maam
ugh  she really is a demon
hmm  the three of them look busy i think ill wait until later to talk to them
/***EOF***/
father brother its that lady ike rescued shes awake
really
come on lets greet our guest
so how are you feeling
oh i im fine and you are
the names greil im the commander of this mercenary company
my lord greil you are the one who came to my aid are you not i dont know how to thank you 
hold on the one who found you and brought you here is my son ike if you want to thank someone thank him
no please thats not–
lord ike was it you have my gratitude
oh 
pardon my bluntness but i have some questions for you tell me who are you what were you doing in that place
 
the place where ike found you was evidently the site of a fierce battle between crimean and daein forces do you have some relation to the crimean royal family
 
i make no promises but we may be able to help you will you share your story with us
you took me in and cared for me i will place my trust in you elincia ridell crimea i am the daughter of king ramon of crimea
what
you say you are the princess of crimea
yes
thats an odd claim to make ive never heard of king crimea having any children
that is to be expected my heritage my very existence has never been made public
whys that
to avoid national turmoil you see i was born after my uncle lord renning was named as successor to the throne so 
they kept you a secret to avert a possible blood feud yes im willing to accept that for the time being very well lets suppose that you truly are princess crimea you must know whats become of the king and your uncle i would like to hear that news
 my father and my mother are dead they fell at the hand of ashnard king of daein my lord uncle and the royal knights are still battling the daein army i believe
i see
 i fled the castle to follow my lord uncles orders and seek refuge in the kingdom of gallia 
in gallia
 yes we believed that king caineghis would grant me sanctuary so thats where i was going but we were discovered by daein troops and i lost my escort of knights my life–the life i have now–was purchased with the blood of those brave knights 
does king daein know of your existence
yes i was told the royals of each nation were informed of my identity in the event of dire circumstances 
if thats the case they must be searching frantically for you
 
master greil my lord ike you said that you were mercenaries did you not please would you help me to gain gallia i beg of you i have no one no one else to turn to
princess crimea truly
father spoke to her as if he believed she were telling the truth
i see 
what is it titania
mm its nothing i was just remembering something from the past
from the past back when you were still a crimean royal knight
what how do you know about that
a long time ago i overheard shinon and some others talking about it
they keep such loose tongues
was it a secret
no it wasnt but much like i have more experience than you i also have many more things to worry about
like princess crimea
well yes i myself was unaware of the princesss existence but now that i think about it she does bear a striking resemblance to both the king and queen
so she probably is the true princess i wonder what father will do will he take on her request
weve got trouble there are soldiers a lot of them
what
is everyone here
yes
commander what are the daein dogs saying
turn over princess crimea and leave the area immediately comply now or we will attackpretty straightforward
what are we going to do
thats what were here to decide one thing has been made clear by the arrival of our friends outside
so i would say this confirms her identity as princess crimea wouldnt you
yes but what do we do now id like to hear the opinion of everyone here titaniaid like to hear from you first
the blame for this war rests on daein if we ally ourselves with themthe companys reputation will surely suffer conversely if we deliver princess crimea safely our stock will risein the eyes of our primary employers our road is clear
soren how about you
theres nothing to think about we must deliver the princess to daein immediately
even if crimea is in the right
we are mercenaries our actions are dictated only by self interest if we want to ensure our future we need daein in our debt they will win this war after all and nothing else serves us better
shinon gatrie
sorens a pompous superior whelp but hes got the right idea besides the destinations gallia so its a moot question i dont care how much we get paid theres no way under the sun im going to stinking beast country
princess elincia she does possess a certain regal beauty  theres a lot to be said for that you know however i do prefer country girls a bit cuter and not quite so standoffish oh forget i said thatwhatever you decide is good for me commander yep uh huh yep 
oscar boyd what about the two of you
i agree with captain titania if we turn the princess over to the daein army were essentially giving them permission to kill her
im in favor of helping her thats what heroes are supposed to do
well rhys whats your opinion
i believe that none of this hinges on whether shes a princess or not refusing to aid someone in need is not something we should ever do thats what i think
thats right lets help her
please we have to help her
and what about you ike
i agree with titania i say we help her and take her to gallia
i see i think i know where you all stand  well then heres my decision
we escort the princess to gallia
 
 tsk
 are you sure thats for the best father
yes besides i think the choice has been taken out of our hands
what
open your ears and listen listen all of you
huh what is it
uh i dont hear a thing 
idiot thats the problem dont you think thats a bit odd complete silence in all four directions
oh so thats what youre talking about
were surrounded the soldiers arent waiting for an answer they already decided to attack
it would appear they had no intention of keeping their side of the proposed bargain
they were planning on lulling us into a false sense of security and destroying every one of us
probably so but the deal is were not so naive or inexperienced as to fall for their trap take your positions were going to settle this right now
ill go and hold the rear entrance ike youre in command here dont let the enemy take the front
 got it be careful commander
hah ill give it a shot
reporting in sir the mercenaries have taken up arms and formed up in the bailey
oh so theyve sniffed out our plan have they which means theyre not an opponent that will be easily fooled well need something special
shall we continue with the planned attack
no princess crimea is somewhere within that fort if we use flaming arrows to try to smoke them out we might bring the princess to harm weve been told to do our best to deliver her alive and uninjured it would be preferable if they were to come out of their own accord if they do slay all but the princess
yes sir
whats going on werent they supposed to be completely surrounded
i dont believe it what went wrong 
grr howve they lasted this long just who are these mercenaries knowing your enemys strength is vital to any strategy soldiers retreat we fall back for now
general dakova no not the general not at the hands of these scum i will not allow it aaaaah face me and breathe your last you wretched scum
ike the enemys taken the fort
oh no mist and the others 
 ike its too bad but weve been defeated
how  father forgive me 
weve cleared the surrounding area of daein troops
theres no question about it were enemies of the daein kingdom now arent we
weve no time for rest everyone pack your things now we leave at once before the enemy brings reinforcements
understood boyd come with me
right behind you brother
ah weve got to hurry too come on rolf weve got to pack as much food and supplies as we can
uh whatever you say lets go mist
titania take shinon and gatrie and make sure we have a secure road from here to the great forest well make our way to gallia through the sea of trees
on my way sir
rhys you stay with me i want you to help me pull essential documents from the library everything else we burn
y yes sir
ike youre in charge of the princess
all right
princess elincia im going to ready a horse for you what should we have you do i know–go to the mess hall
im sorry
time will go by faster if youre helping mist than it will if youre just sitting around waiting for me
oh i understand i can do that
sorry this is kind of awkward making a princess help with packing 
please dont worry mist i just hope that i dont end up slowing you down by getting in your way
dont be silly youre so much better at this than i am its a big help are all princesses as good at this sort of thing as you are
ha ha i wasnt raised at court so my life was a bit different than other princesses i cookedcleaned sewed why i did all manner of things
really thats surprising i would never have guessed that by looking at you
lets see i also rode horses practiced swordfighting ah mist whats that around your neck
what oh ah 
im sorry i didnt mean to 
 i guess i can show it to you princess elincia
oh its a lovely  thats an incredible medallion isnt it i wonder what that light is
it used to belong to my mother its all i have to remember her by hmm i dont know where the light comes from it didnt used to be like that a while back it just started glowing
the world is full of mysteries isnt it one thing is clear though it certainly is beautiful
i wonder what that light means 
what what did you just say i think i must be hearing things i thought you said they got away
ge general petrine i am deeply ashamed by my honor 
honor i care nothing for your pathetic honor have you forgotten the daein armys motto success or failure life or death hey you get this trash out of here
yes maam move it you
w wait general petrine have mercy 
dogs breath im surrounded by worthless imbeciles ena
tell me which way we should move to catch these mercenaries and the girl
 the crimean capital melior is already under king ashnards control the remnants of the crimean army are neglible which means the only place left for the princess to turn is south to the kingdom of gallia
hah so the girl like her dead father before her seeks the friendship of those hairy devils eh what an absolutely stupefying world we live in
if she gains sanctuary in gallia capturing the princess will become that much more difficult the mercenaries she has escorting her are a powerful group not one to be taken lightly i will gather intelligence on them as quickly as 
its not necessary i will head up the pursuit of our wandering princess
general petrine you will go yourself
if we know where the princess and her band are headed theres no need for subtlety ill just hunt them down and kill them mercenaries hah whatre they to me remember i am general petrine no matter who i face i have never failed nor will i ever ha ha ha 
/***EOF***/
after his fathers death places the mantle of leadership on his young shoulders ike agrees to continue as elincias escort
the company heads to the begnion empire the oldest and largest nation on the continent of tellius as crimea is a former fiefdom of begnion the princess turns to them for succor much as a scared child returns to a parent many in tellius believe that without begnions might and influence crimeas reconstruction will be nigh impossible however begnion and gallia have no diplomatic ties and are further separated by an impassable mountain range so the company is forced to return to crimea where they hope to locate a ship to carry them to begnion
accompanied by ranulf the warrior who has volunteered to guide them the company leaves castle gallia behind with heavy hearts and wounded spirits they begin the long march back to crimea
hey ike i heard youre leaving going to begnion eh
hello ranulf i was hoping id see you id wanted to thank you for everything youve done im glad to have the chance before i leave
well arent you the dutiful one hey that reminds me you were born here in gallia right i knew there was something odd about you youre awfully friendly for a beorc you know oh you might not know but a beorc is what  
i know what it means its what you call us humans right
oh knew that did you well then let me tell you something else when we use the word human we mean it much the way you beorc do when you call us sub human
really its an insult to be called human im glad you told me i would never have guessed
i should warn you if you run across any laguz who call you that be careful they are no friend of yours
got it thanks i wont forget
but ive digressed long enough let me explain why im here
huh
princess elincia may i have a moment of your time
y yes of course
the king asked that i give you this please accept it as a gift
what may i ask  
within that leather pouch is twenty thousand gold pieces beorc currency of course
oh i truly appreciate this generous offer but a gift of this magnitude is not something i can accept king caineghis has done so much more than necessary already 
the king is ashamed that he cannot at this time provide any personal support please will you accept his apology and acknowledge his desire to aid you
but 
no well then lets try this 
yes
you accept the kings gift then as payment for conducting you safely to galliayou hand it over to ike 
um 
come on ranulf you cant expect her to accept this and its an outrageous fee no matter how you look at it
twenty thousand gold for the life of a princess perfectly reasonable in fact it almost borders on insulting consider how you have suffered the lives you have lost ten no a hundred times this amount would not be unreasonable
 
i  i have reconsidered i will accept the kings kindness in turn i will present it to my lord ike you will accept it will you not
i i will thank you
no my lord ike it is i who must thank you
well now that thats settled lets move on unfortunately we do not have any ships here in gallia if you are to find a ship that will take you to begnion you must return to occupied crimea
if theres no other way then well just have to risk it
no matter how cautiously you proceed youre certain to run into daein forces keep that in mind
i understand its too bad were so short on soldiers still theres not much we can do about that now however i will review our supplies carefully before we depart
in regard to your personnel problems the king has decided to lend you what aid he can lethe mordecai
i will join you
mordecai and lethe both of you are you sure
none of the others could stand the idea of traveling with humans i myself tremble with loathing at the thought of going to begnion but when the king gives an orderobedience is the only option
that may be but having witnessed the combat prowess of the gallians for myself i know how fortunate we are
we will not fail you
hsss ive no intention of becoming friends do not forget that and stay out of my way
ha ha you must forgive lethe her tongue cuts as deep as her claws do i will return once ive reported to the king while im gone please finish your preparations for departure
very well
ike heres a summary of our last battle
there were no casualties and no one suffered permanent injury we fought excellently
hey ike hold up a moment you know i was thinking since this castle is on the way we should probably stop by
um really why is there something special about this place
why yes there is this is canteus castle daein seized it early on in the war now it serves as a camp for prisoners ive even heard there are a number of crimean retainers being held captive in the dungeon beneath the castle
what are you certain
princess im hurt of course my information is reliable
if we can rescue some crimean soldiers they might decide to join us that would be quite a boon would it not
yes it would i think its worth the risk
the question now is how do you open these cells and free the prisoners
the cells are certain to be locked so in order to open them  
logic would dictate that the keys will be in the possession of the jailer weve no choice but to steal them if were lucky the guards will have keys as well in either case we must move with caution we dont want to trade blows with the entire castle garrison
which means we stay close to the walls and avoid being seen or heard right all right then our first priority is to get our hands on the cell keys 
hey you there
i have business with sir greil where is he
youre sorely lacking in social etiquette arent you state your business
ill speak with sir greil and sir greil alone now take me to him
what you ask is impossible commander greil is dead
well that is a problem
just who are you anyway
call me volke sir greil hired me im in intelligence
my father hired you
you are sir greils son correct youll do sir greil hired me to investigate something you pay my price and ill give you my report deal
how much
fifty thousand
thats a bit steep
and worth every penny
i dont have that much give me some time
so youre willing to pay
my father hired you he must have had a good reason
are you sure commander we have no way of knowing if hes telling the truth
well know when we see the contents of that report until then lets have him travel with us
so thats your plan eh listen you get the report when i get paid and im not waiting around until then ill keep my information for the time being call me when youve got the gold stop into any tavern along your way tell the barkeep youve need of a fireman youll see me within an hour
hold a moment
intelligence you said you were in intelligence right is information the only thing you sell
come out with it what are you asking
locks can you open locks
sure fifty gold per lock
youre going to have him open the cell doors
is that wise weve only just met him theres no telling if we can trust him
 
volke will you help us break into these cells
as long as i get paid ive got no complaint
titania objections
i told you before didnt i youre the commander if you decide on a course of action i will but follow
volke i beg your pardon but lets pretend this little talk never happened
hm if thats how you want things so be it i wouldnt have objected to traveling with you not if it meant steady work but 
any objections soren
i abide your decisions ike as always
what do the two of you think
under the circumstances i think trusting a man about whom we know nothing is dangerous i am opposed to this
if we want to get those cells open i think risk is going to be inevitable if we dont have to steal keys we can reduce that risk and improve our chances of rescuing the prisoners its worth a shot
 
righto im off good luck and all that
what wait youre not going to help us here
much as i would like to i have a job to do i will rejoin you when im finished
hmm  i see well good luck to you then
yes and to you as well
 
uh tell me something will you whats going to happen to us those daein soldiers took my friends away and they didnt never come back what did they do to them oh something bad happened i just know it
quiet fool keep your cowardly mutterings to yourself it matters not what vile torture they devise a true knight of crimea is bold steadfast and strong i care not if they pull out my nails with tongs or insert pins into the soft flesh of my underbelly or yank  
stop it i cant bear torture im not a professional soldier im just part of the militia i cant believe i left my family behind for this will i ever see them again oh i want to go home
curses if only i had a weapon of some sort
help will come i will not give up 
you there weve come to rescue you
 ah
youre not a soldier are you your clothing gives you away
i am a pilgrim my name is sephiran
youre a monk why would they imprison you
i was arrested in a nearby village where i was tending to wounded crimean knights i received no trial but have nevertheless been kept prisoner in this place ever since
i see  that explains it weve come here to liberate the prisoners of war you should take this opportunity to escape
you will set me free that is most gracious of you if youve no objection i would ask your name
i am ike of the greil mercenaries please the cell door is open you should leave while you can
thank you perhaps we will meet again ike
youre from crimea right come on  were here to rescue you weve opened your cell nows the time to escape

the mercenary company im attached to serves under the command of the princess of crimea we came here to free any crimean prisoners
the princess of crimea youre not part of the royal guard how do you know about the princess

blast you curse your name curse the name of oscar and all who call him kin i will never let you surpass me princess im coming kieran will be forever at your side
whoa hes even more excitable than i remember hard to believe hes actually a decent knight 
youre a crimean soldier right ive opened your cell lets get out of here
who are you
im ike im with a mercenary company hired by princess crimea i can fill you in on the details later for the time being youll just have to trust me
 very well
youre a crimean soldier right come on im here to rescue you
s seriously im not dreaming again am i
im a mercenary in the employ of princess elincia ill give you all the details later for now we have to move
what the princess oh happy day wait let me stretch a bit ooo sorry im stiff from this hard floor ow ow ow ow cramp cramp
oh for the love of  come on this way
all all right hold on a second i dont remember the king having any children 
theres no time to explain hurry up
oh uh c c coming
l look out were under attack
gwaah enemy soldiers
commander danomill the castle defenses have been breached what are your orders sir
what fortunate timing we were starting to run low on prisoners do try to capture them alive i wont have you robbing me of my fun
as you command sir
weve been spotted theres nothing left to do but fight
look whos come to play i am so very happy to see you now then are you ready to become my prisoners and live a life of eternal bliss within my lovely dungeon
youll not escape i will see all of you dead you will be exe cu ted 
ive brought one of the crimean soldiers who was being held prisoner
ahem im sure you are unaware of this but i am
princess elincia
oh yes quite right
i am kieran i served under general geoffrey as leader of crimeas fifth platoon my platoon had the honor of escorting you from the palace during daeins attack
really you were there when 
i was lord renning ordered my platoon to accompany general geoffrey and serve as your escort our mission was to see you safely out of crimea to gallias king but we failed you and when you were lost to us i believed my worthless life was at its end yet here you are to think that i would be so blessed as to see you again such emotion i the tears sniff 
kieran were there any others
such terrific emotion so  i beg your pardon
did anyone other than yourself survive
of course though i was the only one unfortunate enough to suffer the misery of captivity general geoffrey and several of his soldiers fought off the daein attack they were able to slip away even now they wait in crimea hoping for one last chance to strike a blow against daein
geoffrey he is alive ah how those words drive off the shadows across my heart thank you kieran thank you for surviving
you are too kind your highness the opportunity to serve you again is the greatest reward i could ask for for as long as i draw breath i will stand ready at your side this i swear
all right we all know where kieran stands how about you two will you recognize princess elincia as the rightful heir to the crimean throne will you fight for her
look here my names brom and this lass is nephenee were just simple country militiamen from the same territory now we dont know much about nobles and stuff kings and queens dont matter much when youre workin the fields course we know well be in trouble if someone takes our fields away from us so thats why we joined the militia this king of daeins no friend of ours and i hear hes doing terrible things too  vile tortures with rusty nails and and more whats going to happen to my family i left them all back home and im so worried i can hardly see straight
if you can defeat the king of daein will this country return to the way it used to be is that what youre after
it is my hope i may not be as powerful as my father but i will never abandon crimea
you sound like a lady who stands by her word looks like my choice is easy
mine too
ill fight in your name ill help you and yours and well send those daein egg suckers packing
thank you
i beg your pardon 
youre 
o blessed saint 
master sephiran you live
brom nephenee are either of you wounded
were fine but what about you you were jailed for helping us im so sorry oh i hope they didnt hurt you
it is nothing to fret about everyone is safe and that is what matters
o blessed one 
pardon me may i have a moment of your time
who are you
i am a monk on pilgrimage my name is sephiran thanks to your efforts i have been freed from my imprisonment
a monk why did the daein army arrest you
i was arrested in a nearby village where i was treating wounded crimean knights i received no trial but taken prisoner nevertheless i was scheduled to be executed on the morrow i owe you my life i thank you from the bottom of my heart
you dont have to thank us however i am curious about your situation why were you aiding crimean soldiers
do you question my story
youre a monk on pilgrimage as well as an ally of crimean resistance fighters under the circumstances do you blame me
tell me something ike if you came across a wounded person could you ignore his plight
normally no i could not but in times like these where it means risking my own life  i dont know its tough to say
ha ha youre quite honest however if actually faced with such a choice a man such as yourself would not hesitate if faced with an individual in pain you would act instinctively your body would not wait for the command
who who are you really youre so calm so full of peace i cant believe youre a simple monk
if youll forgive me i must be going fare thee well young warrior i am certain that we will meet again
 ike
oh hello volke what do you want
i was thinking about traveling with you for a bit ill be in the general area so if you need anything you can call me ill help you out for a fee of course
what did you say
why would you do such a thing in times such as these there must be many parties that need intelligence
well youve sparked my curiosity and besides no well just have to leave it at that
thats not acceptable
dont be so inflexible its not as if ill be joining your merry band or anything this is strictly business
and yet you  
titania
i believe this is a good opportunity we will almost certainly have need of this mans talents he is a dubious character at best but at least we know his motives everything begins and ends with gold hell be easy to control
soren hes standing right there
i dont think he minds
what will it be ike the decisions yours
very well you may do as you like
excellent call me if you need anything
im sorry but i cannot accept your proposition however as we discussed earlier i will summon you when we have the fee for my fathers information is that acceptable
agreed be seeing you
first the thief and then that monk what an odd band of characters youve attracted
ranulf have you finished your errands
all done but about those two  
yes theyre both rather mysterious
well the monk seems like a decent enough fellow
determining who is a friend and who is a foe is something i must be able to do but its just so hard
thats only because you dont have enough information to base your judgment on all we can do now is press on
youre right 
 
you there beorc what do you think youre doing
i was trying to get back to my room but ive lost my way can you tell me which way i need to go
its this way follow me hey not so close walk behind me
what
er  pardon me the king has ordered us to treat beorc with kindness but  it will take some time it is difficult to fight that instinct perhaps some memory of the slavery our forefathers suffered at beorc hands flows in our blood
i understand ill keep my distance
very well lets go
all right
and so we put this guy right here and this dealy bobber goes there and were finished
packing huh want some help
do i want some  pfff youre a hoot handsome im already done
youre more skillful at this than i wouldve imagined or is it that mist is woefully inept
aw the begnion pegasus knights were always moving around so i learned to pack quickly they used to train us on it all the time go here  pack this fun stuff
is that so i can see that you have a strong sense of duty quitting the begnion pegasus knights to join us must seem 
what are you saying im a burden now
um no im very grateful youre here as i told you before were short on personnel
oh good then and im happy to be here um say ike you dont need to worry about me quitting the begnion service my decision wasnt based solely on my desire to repay you 
you had other reasons
yes i im also searching for my missing brother he may be a dolt and a scoundrel but hes all the family i have in this world remember when you found me when we were fighting the pirates well i was trying to track him down but every time i go looking for him i end up in some dangerous situation with ugly boat monkeys trying to kill me
heh so thats why you decided to join us is it i can understand that
so are you sorry you asked
not at all the important thing is finding your brother as quickly as possible right
thats the plan
 
you seem depressed
look at who im trapped with of course i am depressed  and keep your worthless observations to yourself all of you are so slow i cant believe youre still not ready
sorry about that if we were like you and didnt need to carry anything it would be easier but we have weapons and things to get ready
weapons of steel are a human weakness without them you cannot fight properly
but lethe youre carrying a dagger arent you in the scabbard on your leg
this is not for fighting
then whats it for
i use it to remove small bones from meat it can also cut fruit into bite sized pieces it has proven quite useful
hmm 
what if youve got something to say spit it out
you despise beorc but you dont mind beorc crafted tools
if somethings good its good denying somethings obvious worth out of petty spite is foolish its not that i i do not despise everything beorc if every beorc could get along with us as well as you do im certain 
lethe
this is a ridiculous conversation im leaving now
 
here are two crimean soldiers who were being held as prisoners
ahem this may come as a surprise but my name is elincia i am the daughter of ramon king of crimea who was so recently killed by daeins heartless attack im on a mission to liberate and restore our homeland and i need all the support i can garner

ike and company break the siege of delbray castle and join ranks with the crimean retainers therein the army grows to its largest size yet and with the addition of the retainers truly becomes the armed force of its name in addition their recent heroic acts finally move the conservative gallians to dispatch much needed reinforcements
the long waited warriors of gallia march through the treacherous marhaut mountain range a series of jagged peaks that spread across  southern crimea they then slip through the gaps in the daein forces and move toward crimeas army gallia rises this information emboldens ike and he marches the army at top speed to join their new allies
leanne im coming in
king tibarn
how are you feeling
today i am feeling most splendid
ah it is good to hear that you are well not surprising  it is a beautiful day
i am growing used to the smell of the sea
yes we hawks enjoy the smell of the sea as well then you are starting to feel more at home here good good and how is lord lorazieh
 unchanged  
hm  i had thought his condition might have improved well lets hope for a brighter tomorrow
 yes
you can understand what the heron princess is saying cant you your majesty
hm yes well some of it at least oh you werent around when reyson first got here were you lotz when he arrived he was just like this youd never know it by how fluently he speaks our modern tongue would you
now that you mention it he does use some funny words when he gets angry but the letter that just arrived is written in standard script isnt it
over these twenty years hes gained total mastery of you you read the letter didnt you
n no i just caught a glimpse of it in your hand thats all im sorry er your majesty 
you little scamp 
a letter
hm yes thats right its a letter from reyson it appears the crimean army has passed safely through daein and is on its way to the homeland
what good news so hes doing well isnt he
yes reyson is fine but  i wonder what happened he doesnt give details but he asks phoenicis to send reinforcements
if prince reyson is asking for help things must be fairly serious
id like nothing better than to take wing immediately but i cant leave lord lorazieh and leanne here alone 
ill go with you
no that wont work
but 
dont try that look on me theres no way im taking you with me
yeah thats crazy talk
 big meanie
i suppose its time to put my plan into action
what is it
plan
all right im off to gallia to get things settled lotz i want you to watch over leanne and help her pack
yes sir
please put that cloth in here
um i  i dont have any idea what youre trying to say maybe i should talk louder 
tee hee youre not very smart i wasnt you to take this and put it in here
um do you want me  to put this in that bag
yes yes
got it in it goes im getting the hang of this im putting it in the bag
ah aaaaahhhh
what is something wrong
whos there
what are you  over there behind me what someone is behind me gwaaaa
lotz no let him go
if you want your father to be killed then by all means keep screaming
 brother 
ah the prodigal son returns
i have gained that which you requested
show me
this way
these heron royals all look alike dont they perhaps it proves their bloodline but its unsettling how similar they are
i believe you had one in your possession previously
yes i tried to get her to free the dark god from the medallion but all she did was get sick and die pah theyre ridiculously frail creatures i should have just killed her in the first place and saved some time
might i suggest this one be treated with more care capturing her was not an easy task
for you it did take quite a long time didnt it
diverting the sharp eyes of the hawk king proved to be quite difficult it required much planning and care
ha dont tell me it was difficult i know you i know you use that arcane powder to travel about at will
the powder drains my strength for that reason i would rather not use it unless absolutely necessary
you are an enigma dark one everything you possess is fey and of unknown origin
the armor i presented to you do you find it dissatisfactory
no it has my approval my wyvern rajaion and this armor which renders any enemy attack impotent  both are well suited to me they both shine because they are mine and now the medallion and that galdr as well both belong in my hands
will the revival of the dark god take place soon
let me see  the conditions arent bad but how long will they continue har it is no matter as long as all my chess pieces are on the board things will work out soon every knee will bow to ashnard
 what is going on whats happened here
m my king 
lotz hold on
im so sorry  the princess  
who did this who was the craven dastard that did this to you
 knight in black armor gwaa urrk
lotz no curse you daein this was evilly done well if you think to play such a game youll not find me an easy mark
ranulf whereabouts is the gallian army encamped
just over those mountains
so were finally going to join forces 
reports say that king ashnard is gathering his forces in the capital the time to work together is certainly upon us
ike theres an enemy ambush waiting for us on that mountain
mmm  if we go around that mountain and avoid it how much time will we lose
a couple of days at least
in that case weve no choice but to go through them right
agreed
um wait a second  isnt this where theres usually some sort of discussion hello
the enemy approaches sir
listen up men let them get as close as possible before pushing the rocks over the cliff we must not let crimea join forces with those sub humans
commander the foes are encamped on top of the rise i wonder what sort of trap they have this time
those boulders didnt get up there all by themselves  are they seriously going to roll them down on us
at first glance it seems a simplistic trap but these narrow paths make avoiding the rocks impossible i think they may be surprisingly effective
so 
we run up the mountain as quickly as possible and smash the enemy commander right
right  how did you  
i know genius
actually that is the best plan try to avoid the boulders and reach the top as quickly as possible once there defeat the general
right move out
grr so youve made it this far have you then prepare to be sent down screaming
heh heh ha ha ha gather as many fools as you like your weakness cannot survive no one on this earth can withstand the might of our king 
is this the lot of them
it looked like there were more of them from down there
now weve got you eat rock heh eat rock  im pretty clever 
above us look out
need a hand
tibarn you came
well met reyson and well met to the rest of you as well warriors of crimea
how did you come to be here
i thought id help you wipe out daein
thats good news for us but has something happened why did you suddenly decide to help
i asked for his aid we must defeat king daein to that end the more powerful we are the better yes
so thats the story is it
its true that reyson requested my aid however thats not the only reason that im here
hm what is it
in a moment first let us meet with the king of lions he waits for us at the foot of the mountain
understood come on everyone lets get off this peak and take a rest at the bottom
king caineghis its an honor to see you again
first let me offer you my congratulations youve made quite the triumphant return princess elincia
thank you and allow me to express my gratitude for having the kingdom of gallia fighting at our side your presence fills me with strength
during this short interim youve managed to turn the tide of the war to be honest im quite surprised
i didnt i didnt come this far on my own my lord ike and his brave companions were with me it was only with the support of many that i was able to return home
yes my reports cover most of that everything that happened in begnion and in daein as well
as to that  about nasi  
king gallia princess crimea i apologize for interrupting the festivities but theres something i must discuss with you would you gather over there
this group contains the people who were at the heart of that last battle correct
yes it is
what about those two children surely they werent involved
 children
um 
this is soren hes my tactician
and this is my sister mist before we begin this war council theres something i need to share with all of you its a story that involves my parents as well ive kept most of it from my sister but i felt this would be a good chance for her to hear it so i asked her to join us
understood go on
it all begins when we meet princess elincia and escorted her into the forests of gallia 
and that is everything i know
f father he  is that how mom thats not true is it
mist  do you want to leave
um  no im all right im all right im just a little confused
mist 
 
thats the whole of it eh
so this wasnt ever just a dispute between crimea and daein  there was something else at play the entire time
what could king ashnards ultimate goal possibly be he has risked everything even surrendering his own country 
twenty years ago even before he became king he tried to release the dark god from within the medallion however he was thwarted by the actions of greil and elena
what manner of being is this dark god what would happen if it were freed from its prison
i fear the world would once again be beset by natural calamity  much like it was 800 years ago at that time all the world save tellius was drowned beneath the seas
that is a true story i thought it nothing more than a fable 
we have living proof goldoas king deghinsea he and two other heroes fought alongside the goddess herself to defeat the dark one
king goldoa was one of the legendary heroes but hes still alive 
the black dragon king is a living fossil and as stubborn as anything alive hes been trying to control the rest of us for years and he always says the same thing do not fan the flames of strife as long as lehrans medallion exists you must never begin a war that engulfs the entire continent
 never begin a war its possible perhaps there is more than one way for the dark god to gain its freedom
oh ho arent you the clever one thats just what the black dragon king says yet the truth of that is unknown theres a war going on right now but the dark gods nowhere in sight is it
 could it be  i think i may finally know ashnards intentions
really
king goldoa said that a conflict which engulfs the entire continent would free the dark god from the medallion let us assume that the war would have such an effect on the medallion no matter where it was or who possessed it and lets also assume that the king of daein thinks this as well i can hear him now where is the tinder for the blaze i need the answer to this question proved to be an easy one yet he had to find a way to test his theory so he attacked neighboring crimea it had to be crimea begnion was too big too powerful daein would have lost crimea however is a country known more for its scholarship than its military strength daein probably felt that a surprise invasion would let them win while taking minimal casualties themselves and they were right crimea was easy prey
 
king ramon was also friendly toward laguz i imagine that this too influenced daeins decision if things went well the conflict would be enough to engulf crimeas ally gallia and the fires would spread first crimea then gallia and eventually begnion as well daeins power would increase and strife and discord would spread across the land eventually reaching the lost medallion
so you believe king daeins goal is to awaken the dark god after all
at the very least it is one of his ambitions there can be no mistaking that
which means that our plan to attack him at the capital fits right into his strategy doesnt it its the trigger he needs to break the dark gods bonds
even if thats true we cant stop now this wars gone too far for that
we have to smash daein to end its menace once and for all we bury every one of them and finish it
mmm  agreed thats the only plan that makes any sense
if only we had the medallion with us 
what is it reyson is there a way to avoid all of this
we that is the descendants of lehran we have a gift through the power of the slumber galdr we have the ability to suppress the chaotic energies of the dark god in the medallion so even if a massive battle occurred if it were in my possession i might be able to 
im so sorry its because of my carelessness that the medallion was lost in the first place
mist i told you that it wasnt your fault didnt i
but  
you were never careless mist i know you kept the medallion next to you at all times you told me it was a keepsake of your mothers and you always always took good care of it didnt you
thats why its not your fault so please dont punish yourself anymore all right
princess elincia 
shes right and besides the dark god could be released no matter where the medallion is so its nothing to worry about
thank you ranulf
all right  its about time for you to hear what i have to say reyson
yes
im sorry
huh f for what
leannes been kidnapped it may have been by daeins hand
that cant be 
why would leanne be taken the release galdr can only be sung by the girl altina right
but ashnard doesnt know that
oh no 
what a mess  nothing can ever be clear and simple can it
 
 
mister scuse me mister are you guys gonna go into these mountains there are lots of soldiers wearing black up there those guys they killed my poppa and burned our village thats why we went to the mountains in the first place youre gonna go up there and take care of em arent you gonna make em pay please mister say that you are my momma and my sister and me dont have anywhere else to go and i wanna go back to the cabin my poppa built
i understand were going to take care of those guys you just stay here a bit longer all right
yay go give em heck mister oh wait wait i heard those guys talking about something too they said if anyone comes up the mountain single file theyd get em all at once it was something like that anyway
really thats a lot of help thanks
good luck mister kill em all do it for my poppa
excuse me do you have a moment
forsooth what ho my eyes behold sir ike pray tell what would you ask of me good sir
um well  i just wanted to chat i try to speak with all the members of the army when i have a minute
i see a fine idea that is good sir some generals hope their soldiers all to be aloof and ready always for the fight if all goes well sweet happiness abounds but if the tides do turn then anger grows one wonders if he can lead men at all i too am often plagued by such grim thoughts
uh yeah listen i  
yet you walk out among your men at arms spin tales tell jokes and lend a willing ear huzzah dear sir huzzah until the end in truth i did much fear your name at first i swore to find the mettle of the man and studied you with cautious steady eye i thought to find yourself a brutish rogue a villain crafty in his fiendish plans with status and great wealth his only goals had such been your own ethic and deceit i would have taken measures sure and swift to see your person vanished in the night yet lo what do i find before mine eyes a man so noble true and without peer as would beset the moon herself with lust
 
general
zzz wha   huh  er  sorry about that must have dozed off what were you saying something about the moon or something
commander you are tired and unaware of how your body doth cry out for rest if it would please you i was of a mind to partake in a sweet and soothing draught a beverage warm and pleasant to the lips
 um if youre offering me a cup of tea in your tent ill accept  that is what youre offering  right oh and i apologize in advance if i fall asleep again im really tired
your words do make my ears alive with joy i shall regale you with a tale or two and poems to ease the savage toll of war
hey there little man ive got serious business with the general of this army take a message will ya
and you would be 
the names largo and im a world class berserker
world class berserker  thats a rather dubious title
whats this you doubting my strength i can pin a tiger with my bare hands thats not just hot air either
dubious
you think im fooling with you have your general hire me and then see for yourself you can decide how much im worth after you see me in action but let me tell you if the golds not good enough pffft im gone
huh all of this sounds vaguely familiar but at least youre confident
like i said world class berserker here watch me bend this lance rrrrrrrrrr
all right youre in
yes so uh how about taking me to meet the general
im the general
wah bwaa ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa thats good youre a funny little guy bwaa ha ha ha haaaa so seriously wheres the generals tent must be that big one there
 
largo
hey i thought id find you here calill youre looking hot almost as hot as me bwaaa ha ha ha haaaaaa
did you come looking for little old me oh how sad for you my contract with this army isnt up for quite some time
yeah i thought youd say that thats why im joining up too
what are you really going to hire largo general ike
thats the plan
huh this little guy really is the general bwa ha ha ha dont i look like the biggest fool around and i mean big rrrrrrr sorry if i offended you little guy
oh  hes such a clown but you made a good hire after all hes a world class  
berserker yeah i heard
he pinned a tiger with his bare hands two of them actually at the same time
bwa ha ha ha haaaaa yeah that was awesome
 definitely dubious

really thats an improvement on your usual sobbing and nose running
you jerk i my nose does not run
all right come on lets head for home my goodness what a day this has been
/***EOF***/
theyre not here either 
ike pursuing them any farther may be dangerous i think it would be best if we returned to gallia for now its possible the commander may have followed another road into gallia its something we should consider
 youre right getting killed looking for them would waste everything they accomplished by breaking away i guess all we can do is trust that theyre well and withdraw
ike theres a fort over there just now for a moment onlyi thought i saw someone shall we investigate
what really yes lets go take a look
it seems as though this place has been abandoned for a long time
theres no one here hm i couldve sworn i saw a silhouette but i guess it was a trick of the light
lets take a quick look around if we dont find anything here well head back to gallia
very well 
here they are ive found the crimean mercenaries surround them
curses daein troops 
uh oh daein soldiers here too now wheres that exit hm whats that sound someone fighting
your name wouldnt happen to be ike would it
it is but who are you
im mia im a mercenary hired by crimea to bolster the armys numbers
an army mercenary huh so uh what are you doing here
i got careless and was captured they were about to send me to a prison camp when greil saved me
youve seen my father where
just a little bit north of here not too far away though
really so hes safe 
tell me who exactly are you guys
were the greil mercenaries as you can see were fighting against daein
huh youre taking on a whole daein battalion with these numbers nice that settles it then
settles what
this battle im coming in on your side you dont mind do you
its fine with me but i dont know if youll get paid just because i let you fight
well worry about the details later great so thats all taken care of what next boss man
ha ha ha found you at last you provided more entertainment than i thought you would
who are you
me i am general petrine and my arrival marks your doom lament your fortunedear children for all hope is lost you will not leave this place alive
petrine of the four riders of daein
do you know her soren
if shes who i think then shes one of the four generals who are king daeins most trusted confidants she is said to wield a flame lance of terrible arcane might
ha ha ha youve heard of me why im flattered ill try to make this easy on all of you give me the princess and do it now if i roast the girl along with you curs i wont be able to present her head to his majesty
sorry to tell you this but the princess isnt here shes been in gallia for quite some time now
what nonsense is that do you expect me to believe you theres no way mercenary scum like you could get past my troops
they say that blind arrogance sows the field of its own destruction something tells me they were talking about you
who–
father
whatre you doing back here you dumb pup
we got the princess safely into gallia when you didnt rejoin us we decided to look for you the mission wouldnt be complete until you returned
 what am i to do with you still you did well good work ike
ha ignoring me proves youve got more guts than common sense so youre the commander eh hmph and i was waiting for some great hero youre just another sellsword
am i
ha ha you know i think ill keep you his majesty well lets just say he enjoys strong men yes i do think youll make a grand souvenir you dont have to come along quietly but i must have you alive dead men have no value after all
 so the rumors of mad king ashnards twisted games are true are they
shinon  what are these twisted games the boss is talking about
theres rumor that king daein gathers strong men from around the continent and sets them to fight one another those who live regardless of their birth are given influential positions dont know if its true though
oh so that weird dames got her eye on the boss now does she
shinon gatrie ill distract the woman you two grab ike and the others and get out of here now
got it
but commander we cant leave you here on your own
idiot that womans no threat to the commander all right come on lets go
move it well regroup in gallia
youll not escape me not you or your little friends youre far too tasty a treat to pass up
you said your name was petrine is that right listen up this place is nowhere near big enough theres not enough room for a true contest between the two of us im going elsewhere you coming
do you actually think im going to fall for such a simple ruse
you and i weve got more power than the average person we dont come across a chance like this too often id like to flex my muscles without any distractions getting in the way you
ha ha you really do know how to sweet talk a girl dont you all right im coming
over here
all right men im leaving you in charge here dont let even one of these crimean vermin escape understood i want them exterminated by the time i return
we join up with shinon and we get out of here come on dont fall behind
well met shinon are you unharmed
do i look injured im as fit as ever you must be disappointed daein hasnt stuck me full of holes yet
 
guess its time to tighten our belts and move on now that im gonna be dragging your worthless carcass around again ‘ll have to work twice as hard
gatrie
hey is that you ike i heard you got the princess to gallia nice work youre quite the hero  but wait so what in blazes are you doing back here
youll think it foolish but i was worried about all of you
aww youre going to make me cry you silly pup all right sniff  get it together gatrie tonight you and i will share a meal sing a song or two
how goes the battle
there arent very many of those mercenaries but theyre fierce
and youre having a rough time eh bah what an embarrassment
i apologize 
it will work out reinforcements will be arriving soon once theyre here i want you to end this farce at once
yes sir
more enemy troops 
hmph you wretches youre not worthy of general petrines attention i will roast your bones and present them to her as a trophy
urgg ahh 
titania are you all right
ooh i think i can move but theres no way i can fight 
get yourself to safety then and wait until this is all over
i understand watch your back ike 
im sorry ike i dont think i can fight anymore
that doesnt matter not as long as youre still alive find someplace out of harms way understood
ill do that and ike watch yourself 
i have to find my father where did he go
titania is my father 
dont worry commander greils the better fighter hell be fine
dogs breath who are you man you look like a common sellsword but you fight like a demon
whats wrong ready to surrender
and admit defeat me dontt be absurd

master greil my lord ike i am pleased you are well
princess elincia why did you return here
the princess came and requested gallian aid for your mercenary company that is what brings us here
are you one of gallias sub humans
sub human ha what arrogance it takes to coin such a name you think yourselves the only onesworthy of the name human and so we laguz must be beneath you and thus you call us sub human we are less than human to you is that it
im sorry i dont know any other name for you if i have offended you i apologize what should i call you laguz would that be more appropriate
huh you show manners how oddi like that now you are who exactly
my name is ike ike of the greil mercenaries
im ranulf a warrior of gallia we did not know what to think when this group of beorc came tramping through gallian fields imagine our surprise to learn that one of them is princess elincia now that was a shock two days ago daein proclaimed their conquest we thought crimeas royals had all been killed
conquest theyve laid claim to crimea so that means crimea must be 
i also heard this news from my lord ranulf after after i fled the capital my lord uncle renning he i i am all alone
princess elincia 
this is why our king ordered extra patrols along the nations border it wasnt mere chance that brought my warriors here to offer you support
i see 
first of all i must present princess elincia to the king as for the rest of your men ike i must get orders from my superiors until then you may rest at an old castle inside gallia sorry but i cannot bring so large a group of foreigners to the palace without warning
i understand commander thats not going to be a problem is it
 
commander
hm what was that
whats wrong youre not paying attention its not like you
i was thinking about something so whats been decided
princess elincia is going on to the palace with ranulf were going into galliaand setting up camp at an old castle which way to this castle ranulf
i shall prepare a guide to take you one of you quickly
no dont go to the trouble if its nearby we cross the river on the border and head west its gebal castle right you go ahead get the princess to king caineghis as fast as you can
 understood what thoughtful guests you are if youll excuse me oh and if its not overly presumptuous ill have food delivered to you later

you can learn it all at once itll all fall into place as soon as you start to get some experience

/***EOF***/
oh my if it isnt young prince serenes welcome welcome welcome
nealuchi youre looking well
and feeling well too thank you very much this old crows as spry as ever hee hee tell me though how fares your father king lorazieh
the same as ever since that terrible day he remains abed  he seldom rises anymore
mmm  im not surprised in the span of a few days he lost his family his friends and almost all of his countrymen
yes 
and yet were blessed that you are still with us prince reyson if theres anything this doddering old bird can do for you please do not hesitate to ask
thank you i appreciate your kind sentiment
sorry to have kept you waiting reyson nealuchi you can talk ancient history later leave us at once
yes yes of course im sure youve much to talk about much to say ill just take my leave of you please prince reyson make yourself at home
hmph old nealuchis always been fond of house serenes when he heard the white prince himself was gracing us with a visit he could barely contain his joy so prince whats this all about we havent seen your face around here in a long time and im naturally quite curious as to your intentions
your attitude during the goldoa meeting piqued my interest what is it youre after naesala why do you provoke tibarn
you came all this way for that are you serious
do not mock me crow king tibarn is my fathers guardian if not for him we might have suffered the end of house serenes itself i will not brook any insults to him
oh i see so rather than ally yourself with me your trusted companion of old you would side with this new protector thats an unfortunate shift in attitude i trust you remember that when you and your sister were young it was i and not tibarn who watched over you
any change in my bearing can be laid at your roost naesala after all you my old friend are the one who continues to engage in commerce with my enemy with humans if you were to change your ways im sure we could rebuild the relationship the two of us once shared
oh no that i could never do you see humans are essential to the fulfillment of my ambitions
 youve changed naesala if this is the path youve chosen ive nothing left to say
 i doubt you could ever understand what it means to guard kilvas prince to protect an entire country
king naesala duke tanas of the begnion imperial senate has arrived
bring him in
your majesty j just now i brushed against the most splendid specimen w was that a serenes noble theyre supposed to be extinct
and what if it were
oh i was right wonderful my eyes did not deceive me those dazzling white wings and that shimmering hair sparkling like falling gold dust that is the crystallization of beauty in its purest form  
duke oliver can we please discuss the business at hand per your request we have appropriated several pieces of art from the ships of duke gaddos
yes yes and you will be compensated as promised but right now there is something else that i simply must have
really another request what can we purloin for you today more art perhaps
oh ho something much more stunning and if you agree to my proposition i will double your normal fee
that is a most generous offer tell me what is it you desire
desire but surely youve already guessed 
meeting with the apostle was fine but all she did was pay us and give us another job she answered no questions
i wonder what shes planning that cargo  i cant help but believe that there were living creatures inside but what do you suppose the apostle intends to do with them
i dont know titania are all nobles and royals like this they have plans and paperwork for every little thing and their speech is as confusing as it is tedious
but ike the other nobles we know are different theres princess elincia and king gallia and the dragon prince too all of them have been so nice and friendly and easy to talk to
perhaps the rudeness of the upper echelon is unique to the beorc class system princess elincia was raised in special circumstances maybe thats why shes so different
bah i could never get accustomed to the culture of beorc nobles
tell me soren are you all right
hm
recently  ever since we reached begnion in fact  youve seemed depressed
is is that so how odd well i can think of nothing specific thats bothering me
well if you say so
so its time for the desert which is the best direction to enter from
 
soren
 eh yes what is it
all right i know theres something going on
im  im sorry  i was thinking what is it you wanted
well i was going to ask you for directions but its no longer necessary it looks like were being met
ah
who are you answer me
were mercenaries we were hired to take care of a group of bandits operating in this area
more of the senators dogs you cast us as thieves so you can murder us and hide your guilt but we will not be defeated mark my words the day will come when all slaves are free and then you will pay for your crimes
what on earth are you talking about
no more useless words come my brothers take them
what were facing laguz i dont like the look of this
laguz or no it doesnt change the fact that they are brigands do not lower your guard
i know what im doing everyone watch your footing in this sand take care and fight well
sniff  hm
i sense something 
 grrrr must be my imagination 
a female cat splendid ive not seen your face in these parts before
aaaah wh where where did you come from
oh i see that ive startled you my apologies
who are you
if you wish to learn someones name isnt it polite to introduce yourself first
grrr  i am lethe from gallia
and i am stefan i live here in this desolate wasteland playing at being a hermit
is that so well dont let me interrupt your life
oh no please dont worry about it
oh i wont
 and
what
why are you standing there staring at me im interested in gallias beast tribes fascinating really i have an idea can we go somewhere and talk
 i dont think so
why not
my companions and i are in the middle of a battle ive no time to chitchat with you
very well  then i will help you and once this battle is finished youll have time to converse yes
i suppose perhaps 
right off we go then
 what sort of lunatic have i found now
sniff 
urrrr
somethings here beneath the sand  mmmrrr
nope im over here
so there you areyou are good at hiding
to be praised by one of the beast tribes is an honor i am stefan i live here in this desolate wasteland playing at being a hermit who are you i havent seen you in these parts before
i am mordecai a warrior of gallia this is the first time i have walked beyond the borders of my country
i thought that might be the case and i was right hoooo im ever so clever
mordecai listen here im interested in the beast tribes of gallia would you mind talking with me ill buy dinner
um  my friends and i are fighting so i cannot sorry
very well then i will help you once this battle is finished youll have time to converse yes
all right if you will fight with usthen i will call stefan a friend later we will talk about gallia
im looking forward to it right then off we go
yes off we go right then 
huh
oh look at you lost in a place like this  what an odd duck you must be hmm it would be a shame to see you go home empty handed though i will give you this as a memento now in exchange  i ask you to treat our meeting as a dream and let it fade from your memory and now i bid thee farewell
woah
are you lost young one what are you doing in this place
what are you doing here are you with the sub humans  wait did you just pop out of the sand
mmm 
what
 hmm it seems i made an error
what are you talking about youre not  
i was wrong its nothing ive no use for you
oh all right then
hold
what now
it would be a shame to see you go home empty handed though i will give you this as a memento now in exchange  i ask you to treat our meeting as a dream and let it fade from your memory and now i bid thee farewell
haah haa haa  we lose 
you youre the leader of this band arent you
yes i am ill resist you no further take me with you or execute me here  i care not but my companions  would you let them go  please
no i wont allow it
huh
i wont let you take muarim
grrr  stay back little one you were not supposed to expose  
if you want muarim youll have to kill me first
youre  
yes he is a beorc child i claimed him when he was little more than an infant he has nothing to do with us sub humans 
stop lying im here because i want to be whos the leader of the laguz emancipation army i am youre a big jerk muarim trying to cover for everyone and get yourself killed i wont allow it
little one 
hey i dont care who the real leader is
a laguz who calls himself a sub human is protecting a kidnapped beorc who claims to lead a laguz emancipation army do i have that right because if i do i have absolutely no idea what any of you are talking about would someone please tell me what is going on here
 
all right  please go over that again its been customary throughout begnions history to keep laguz as slaves
thats right
but thats in the past now twenty years ago all slavery was outlawed and all laguz were freed
and as far as the general public is concerned that is exactly what happened
so theres a portion of society that willingly breaks the law
the commoners obey but there are still many laguz slaves in the homes of nobles muarim and i brought this to the attention of the senators but they would not listen thats why we gathered other fighters we break into the homes where slaves are kept and help them escape of course the nobles cant let this be known publicly so they brand us thieves and turn us into wanted outlaws
all right i think i understand your motivesbut youre not going to solve the basic problem this way
we know that but we cant give up and leave them in chains we cant and wont
do you mind if i try to help
huh
this sort of beorc behavior is something thats been bothering me i think there may be something that i can do 
naesala stop this foolishness where are you taking me tell me
its only a little farther ill tell you once weve arrived just as i promised
i left no word with tibarn if i had known we were coming this far i would have left a message 
here we are this is what i wanted to show you look below you reyson what do you see
what what is this how is this possible what happened here
 
this is serenes is this what youre trying to tell me this colorless vista these cracked and withered branches these lifeless trees  this is my forest
sacred trees seed root and trunk awake from your slumber and heed my cry answer the call of the green mighty ones
 the ancient tongue its been many years since i heard it last you can still speak it
the voice of the forest is still why  how did this 
its been like this since your clans been gone the area near the entrance is especially bad they used fire most of the trees are dead
 unforgivable how how can they do things like this cursed humans  what did this forest do what did my clan do 
humans hold all laguz in contempt and in the same way they hold all of nature in contempt as well they think everything exists for their pleasure and betterment they are beneath contempt
naesala  it appears that i have misjudged you i called you a groveling toady to humans and labeled you traitor i was overly harsh i apologize
not to worry i engage in occasional commerce with humans that much is true a more pressing issue is the growing darkness you can return to phoenicis tomorrow can you not im certain that some noble has a villa in this area at this time of year it is almost certain to be empty i suggest we borrow it for the evening
you would sleep in a human building
think about it  bird folk like you and i have no night vision whatsoever if we were discovered by humans they would surely overwhelm and capture us right
mmm  i see your point
very good ill go stumble around until i find something to eat please make yourself comfortable
naesala
yes
thank you for everything youve done i i appreciate it
dont be ridiculous were old friendsare we not
right you are old friend
is everything in place
yes that duke tanas cannot sit still he is literally quivering with anticipation its not pretty
i bet it isnt just make sure that mountain of suet stays hidden if reyson catches so much as a glimpse of his bulk he will take wing
understood
now time to put on the finishing touches this too i do to raise up kilvas reyson please dont judge me too harshly that being said im sure you will ah well such is life enjoy your new one  old friend 
ahem you are from the northwest nation of crimea are you not you have my condolences for the terrible misfortune that has befallen your country and people yet you remain blessed fate has brought you here to the grand temple mainal to the splendor of begnion grandest of all the nations of tellius by the way i hear you are traveling north to the grann desert there are ancient ruins there you know they are the remnants of a race known as the zunanma who come from a civilization that predates our own im sure you will enjoy the sensation of being immersed in such primordial surroundings
um yeah itll be a real picnic
oh yes picnics are indeed nice oh but a word of caution studying the ruins from afar is one thing but you would be well advised to keep your distance  for safetys sake its said that theres a bandit stronghold near the northwest ruins and we hear occasional reports of strange figures wandering the dunes in the northeast be careful
how are your preparations progressing
theyre underway we leave within the hour
your next mission takes you to the grann desert you must choose your companions with care
a desert is just a large patch of sandy soil is it not
ha ha with one major difference unlike sandy soil youll not find solid earth near the surface you could dig and dig and find only more sand those on foot and horseback may find it difficult to move around
i see im sure that soren knows much about these things but 
hmm has something befallen master soren
i dont know if hes feeling ill or just moping about it all started when we arrived in begnion
oh 
be that as it may it wont hurt for me to have this information can you tell me more
of course theres little water in the desert and the soil is very dry few trees or grasses grow there which means there are no groves or anything else which would provide cover and as i mentioned before those on foot or horseback will find the sand slows their pace considerably the exceptions are magic users staff wielders and thieves such people will not be affected to so large a degree
thieves are agile so i understand why they would be unaffected but those skilled in the magical arts that doesnt make sense
i once heard an explanation from a magic user that i know he claimed that the spirits he employed flew before him and cleared the sand from his path however considering the source im not sure how much of that is truth
who was the source
prime minister sephiran
would he play a joke like that
ha ha well the prime minister is a very amusing man but please allow me to continue my explanation what else  others who are unaffected by sand are pegasus knights wyvern riders and other flying units oh and laguz too terrain features dont seem to affect them much in either form although they will be slowed some
you said laguz didnt you almost everyone here says sub human
well of course beorc and laguz are both living things every precious life was created to be equal by the blessed goddess the fact that there are still those who persecute laguz in the land of the goddess  it is deplorable
 are you of a noble house
yes i am one must be of noble birth to serve the goddess
but i thought that all nobles were half crazed fools who cant speak the truth you seem quite honest
ha ha ill take that as a compliment oh and one last thing
what is it
the desert contains the remnants of more than one lost civilization rumor has it that treasures from those times still lie undiscovered beneath the shifting sands those with good luck may come across such treasures during battle
hoooweee the grand temple luxury and gorgeousness as far as the eye can see if a scoundrel like myself can find employment in a place like this i guess my luck hasnt abandoned me after all
 
but for all the glitter and gold theres an equal amount of dangerous work hmm that i could do without maybe i can use my prone to illness ploy cough yes i think i can arrange to work about one out of every five jobs or so and now that ive a fixed income its time to visit the local inns and see what games of chance are about
evening
whaaaa you  did you happen to hear any of that
you were talking out loud loudly
um i uh  i wasnt being serious i am an extremely diligent man yes i am
those peddlers you were with you were in debt to them right
huh how do you know that
when we took out that group your debt vanished 
yes youre right that was a tremendous help thanks much
come now you cant believe that the world is as forgiving as that or that we are so foolish
what
debts are debts and you have many those peddlers werent the only people who were owed coin by you  right we cant have debt collectors hounding the company day in and day out my staff officer repaid the rest of the money you owe
tha thats very kind of you
it was from the company coffers you my friend are now in our debt you fight to repay the greil mercenaries
ah but aaah
payment will be deducted from your wages for quite some time it seems youre working for free friend
oh i   oooh
until your debts are completely repaid dont even think about leaving the company or getting sick right then i trust youll do your best
 what a mess awww  nuts
/***EOF***/
what is this who are you what have you done with naesala
oh  ooooo this is something everyone should see there can be no doubt  i gaze upon the last living wonder of the serenes royalty those golden locks witness how they gather in the morning sun and multiply its brilliance the gentle lustre of those argent wings manifest proof of royalty as sure as i am alive magnificent  absolutely magnificent a true work of art wrought in flesh and feather all this beauty  mine  the fortune i paid the raven king seems like a pittance compared to this treasure
what naesala sold me to you
oh ho ho ho you are exquisite even in rage now if you behave yourself ill grant you a life of luxury 
oww my nose my beautiful nose
bishop oliver you winged freak youll pay for that
noooo you mustnt harm him you mustnt ruffle a single feather of those gorgeous wings
my beauty you mustnt be frightened in time you will come to see how kind and charitable a master i can be
this is madness
oooh s so frightening how delicious but i fear that we must now be separated for a short while loyal servants attend my words you must not raise a hand to this one prepare his meals with care and do not disturb his rest i would not see his countenance marred by displeasure herons you see are such delicate things and then at the proper time  yes the proper time when will it be i say to you those haughty senators and their ilk have looked down their noses at me for the last time i shall show them all ooooh but i must have a grand stage one where none can fail to see me the serenes royals are creatures of legend and when i arrive with one at my side  i can hardly wait to see duke gadoss face oh ho ho ho aho ho ho ho ho ho ho
naesala you wretch  curse your eyes how dare you do this to me 
ive brought him
well done ike i shall see that you are well rewarded
wheres your usual entourage i see only two of your holy guard 
oh there was some sort of disturbance i think theyre clearing away the rabble but on to business  is that one there the ringleader of the thieves why hes nothing but a child has he offered up any kind of defense for his deplorable actions
we are no thieves we are trying to free the laguz that these filthy aristocrats hold in captivity
what manner of absurd fairy tale is this in the year begnion 624 apostle misaha my honored grandmother emancipated every last laguz slave in accordance with her law today there is not a single slave to be found in all of the begnion empire
you lie countless noble houses even now keep laguz as servants or entertainment or worse and the senate those vast windbags grant tacit approval by doing nothing
thats enough i told you to keep a cool head
bu but  
ike  whyever would you bring such an ill mannered rogue to meet me what is it youre planning
if anyones planning something its you
really and what could you possibly mean by that
your last mission showed us the slave trade and now youve put us in contact with an underground emancipation group from the very beginning i found this whole arrangement a little odd you have more vassals than you can use yet you hire us for these missions your motivations have me puzzled
oh i see and have you solved this puzzle of yours
you want to expose the depravity of the inner circles of power but you dont want the general public to know that the majority of the senate is involved in slavery
and to think i thought you were as untutored as a wild monkey youre actually quite bright
i didnt figure it all out by myself i have companions whom i trust with my life they helped
hey hold it what in the world are you talking about would someone like to explain this to me
the apostle is aware of the laguz slavery on top of that it appears she intends to do something about this problem
are you serious
i am however whether i succeed or fail depends largely on what you do next
so be it i think its time you told us about the next job you have lined up for us
ive received reports that bishop oliver the duke of tanas is up to something suspicious duke tanas has a villa near the woods of serenes go there and return with irrevocable proof of whatever hes doing if you succeed in this i promise to support your princess elincia with all the power at my command
well bring back whatever information it is youre looking for be ready for us
is this the place
yes it is its rather heavily guarded even so i think a direct attack would be our best chance of gaining entrance
halt who goes there what are you doing this villa is the property of duke tanas senator of the empire no trespassing
i am ike of the greil mercenaries under orders from the apostle weve been charged with investigating the duke
what the apostle sent you wa wait here a moment
all right brother well sneak around out here and see what we can see
good idea
leave it to us if we get stopped we can talk our way out of it all right mist lets get going
yeah
what is it i hear that you lads claim to be here on the apostles business
we have a letter here that bears her seal
hmm  well  i see it appears genuine very well am i in a position to ask what exactly i am suspected of doing
we are here by the apostles leave do you honestly intend to make us discuss this private matter outside
oh no no of course not never i would never insult please c come inside 
oh slavery me the apostle would honestly accuse me of such an unfashionable thing as slaveholding oh ho ho ho
do you claim no knowledge of such a thing
ive shown you every nook of my mansion every cranny ive been most thorough have i not and you saw no trace not a single sign of any laguz here did you
that is true
this accusation is absolutely ridiculous to think that i a bishop who serves only the apostles will would do anything to violate our countrys emancipation act be certain that you tell the apostle everything tell her that duke tanas is upright and cleanhanded there is not even a shadow of falsehood in my noble eyes look into them deeply my boy and tell me what you see 
well hmmmmm
ugh hey stop that back off
we have little choice do we i think it would be best if we left for the time being
hey halt you cant go in there
ah
ike
mist what is it
ike i saw him in a room on the top floor of this building i saw someone  i think he was one of the bird tribe he looked like he was trying to jump out a window but he was forced away from it and back into the room
wha what what is this this child babbling about
someone from the bird tribe can you describe him
um he had long hair it was sparkling like gold and his skin it was so pale  almost translucent oh and his wings they were pure white
is that accurate titania
it is i saw him as well
that can only mean there is a member of the heron clan in this place according to books only members of the royal heron family possess white wings
it appears that there is at least one room we have yet to see what is it going to be duke tanas you can cooperate and show us this room that you somehow forgot or 
guards kill them all dont let a single one escape
so this is how you want to play it eh i thought it might come to this
devdan hears the sounds of battle 
you dare to bring conflict into bishop olivers home my lance will make you pay for your impudence
what  what fate is this is it just punishment for my complicity in this evil 
ah
oh my sweet beautiful little bird dont be frightened come let us fly away together 
stay away from me you filthy fat man
 urgh
come quietly you belong to me i will not give you up no one shall take you from me 
though the price may be my life i will never cooperate with you
hey where are you duke tanas  are you in here
 ah  n n nooo 
duke tanas 
who are you
ah you  youre the serenes  are you unharmed we have come to help you your injury  did that man do that to you
this wound must be tended to 
stay back
but 
do not approach me cursed human
the greil mercenaries have returned
ah master ike it is good to see you well how went the mission did you unearth any meaningful proof
where is the apostle
master ike
i must speak with the apostle where is she
apostle sanaki is in the garden having a pleasant conversation with princess elincia i will go directly and see if she will meet with you please wait here
in the garden great
ah master ike no you mustnt behave so you will cause such problems
apostle 
what you what are you doing how dare you approach me unannounced this is most inappropriate and i will not  
what has happened my lord ike
all of it i want to hear all of it now
what are you talking about
master ike one must not speak to the apostle in such a discourteous fashion
twenty years ago something happened in serenes forest something terrible i want to know
what
master ike
w what happened twenty years ago
you found one of the heron clan and a serenes noble no less one of them still lives but that such a thing 
apostle sanaki 
tell me
that is a very difficult problem hmm  how to impart this tale 
it would appear that no one is willing to begin this story that being so i would open with what is commonly known of the matter do you find this acceptable
and you are
he is a friend of mine nasir if you know something i would hear it when you are done the apostle can clarify agreed
hmmm 
it begins with the assasination of the previous begnion apostle it was twenty years ago  one year after the declaration of emancipation was made the leader at the time was the apostle misaha who was more adored by the public than any apostle before or since when she was assassinated the citizenry was wracked with grief all of begnion despaired and then a rumor began to circulate that the assassination was the work of the serenes herons in the twinkling of an eye the rumor spread throughout the begnion capital one night shortly thereafter it happened the citizens grew violent they massed at the edge of serenes forest home of their supposed enemy and set it to burn the crowd raged on for three nights and in the end the heron clan was lost
but their involvement was just a rumor wasnt it why why did they 
oh the shame of it 
apostle the remainder of the tale is yours you stand as the empress of begnion you are responsible for the acts of your citizens are you not
 false the accusation was completely false
the assassination of the apostle was not the work of the serenes clan
that is correct
the heron clan possess no fighting skills their tribe survived by living a life of peace and piety within their forest unlike other laguz they never focused on developing their strength for the purposes of combat anyone with any knowledge of laguz would have known such a thing at the very least the citizens of begnion would have known this however they had lost their leader and in their grief they cared little for the truth they were merely looking for some way to vent their rage and despair isnt that true apostle
please lord nasir your tone of voice 
its all right princess elincia he speaks the truth be it with a sharpened tongue or no
ike the bird tribes of phoenicis target only begnion ships with their piracy the ravens of kilvas are after cargo and so they attack everyone with equal vigor the hawk clans however hold the heron clan as brethren and still remember the false accusations and their brutal murder
the heron at olivers mansion he slapped my hand away when i tried to help him he had such hatred in his eyes when he leapt from the window he spoke to me remember the genocide he said twenty years have passed but i will never forgive what you did
such needless pain it may sound like utter hypocrisy but my people regret deeply the actions of that horrific night we stole the heron clan from this world  every time we see the blackened forest our grave sin comes back to haunt us
apostle  you are honorable the majority of the senators have done their best to banish all memory of the serenes and that night yet you have resisted that is your intent is it not you are not like them  you are attempting to take responsibility for the actions of the people to undo the wrongs of the past you launched your own investigation into the laguz emancipation issue youve even gone so far as to hire outsiders like ike and his mercenaries to expose the problem havent you
 princess elincia
yes
i would like once more to make use of your escorts would you grant me this boon
of course er that is if ike and his group agree i have no objection to your proposal
depends on what you want
the member of the heron clan you met i want you to find him i want to meet with him i want to speak with him
if that is your wish we will do it in any case we let that monster oliver slip through our grasp well handle both tasks at the same time
im counting on you
ahem 
muarim
little one how  how was it were you treated roughly did they attempt to punish you
no it was nothing and the apostle i thought shed be some mean old hag but shes just a kid really shes even shorter than i am
li little one you must lower your voice and watch your tongue
what why
rest easy muarim everyone in this room is with me the apostle has no ears here
that is good
muarim
speaking ill of the apostle here is considered treasonous keep it up and theyll kill you  or threaten to
what
little one  while we are here please choose your words with more care than you have shown i beg of you
oh right right i understand
for a laguz you seem to know more about the court etiquette here than my fellow beorc tormod
bah 
thats cause cause i dont know much about any of this stuff thats all
it is no matter little one ike the reason i am familiar with the customs of the begnion nobles is i myself was once a slave
what
oh no 
for generations my family served as slaves to one house they were wealthy and powerful senators all as a child i was raised never to question my station as a slave from the day that i was born the most grueling physical labor was as natural as breathing i knew nothing else to ensure we were liked by our masters we were drilled in the etiquette of polite society until it became second nature we were slaves  we did what we could to live as long as we could the most important thing was not to incur the wrath of our masters if we displeased them we were punished if we were lucky we were beaten if we were unlucky 
muarim thats enough
i am sorry lord ike if a former slave like myself is present all of you will be judged scorned and looked down upon i came here to ask if you would  take care of something for me i would have you take care of the little one
why would you say such a thing you were born a laguz slave and youre not allowed to be free thats not right thats why we promised each other wed change all of that we made a promise laguz like beorc would build homes and plant fields families would live together in peace and freedom thats the world we dreamed of 
thats a dream that belongs to us as former laguz slaves we dont need the help of another beorc like you
what sniff
little one 
 does it really warrant that much concern
huh
since i first arrived here in begnion its something thats been bothering me if youre born into a noble house youre a noble if your parents are slaves youre a slave do you think a persons worth is decided at the moment of their birth thats  i cant understand a country where that passes for normal i just cant
those dont sound like the words of someone working for princess crimea princesses are princesses because theyre born into royal families right are you going to deny that
no youre right elincia  she is a princess i dont think weve treated her with more respect than any other employer weve had but heh funny weve addressed her as princess the entire time but ive never really considered what it meant
from where i stand i think youve been blessed you were born a beorc and raised in a country with a lenient social structure thats an enviable life
its so hard  i  no matter how i try ill never fully understand your pain but listen i didnt treat elincia any differently after i learned of her heritage im not going to think of you or treat you differently just because you used to be a slave its not going to happen youre you and im free to think of it that way if i want right
 
muarim theres nothing anyone can do about your pastabout the burdens you carry and i know i dont know everything thatsgoing on but you shouldnt be trying to push tormod away hes dedicated to you and being with you is his choice its part of his freedom
 i see now i will go and find him
if meeting those in the temple is uncomfortable i can go and bring him back what do you think
no i can do it i have a good nose tracking the young ones scent while avoiding other beorc is an easy task
ike  i want  i mean never mind may our friendship be true and enduring
i share your sentiment our troop will have you for as long as you wish
what the  um who are you how long have you been a member of my troop
i joined after the battle in the sands my name is stefan i apologize for not introducing myself earlier
why are you here
in part its because im curious but mostly its the guiding hand of fate that has led me to you
huh
in the desert i watched the dance of your sword you have a unique style but it is incomplete filled with hesitation you have recently lost your teacher no
ah 
luckily your foundation is quite strong which is why i can be of service your technique  how powerful will it be when perfected i would like to know
wh who are you
you can learn the dance of blades from me without knowing my history can you not what say you let your heart decide
i understand if you can help me perfect my technique i will gladly accept an invitation to learn from you
then prepare yourself come attack me with all your strength
/***EOF***/
good morning ike todays your first day as a professional soldier isnt it
yeah and im ready to go
what you are is late the others were suited up and ready at the break of dawn
sorry ill get up earlier from now on so whats my first job
im talking with titania right now wait outside until were done
yes sir
very well commander greil shall we continue
you were telling me about some bandits that needed taking care of werent you
correct the request comes from a nearby village according to our reports the bandits are not all that strong i think it best if i ride out and take a look i plan on taking oscar and boyd along with me
just the brothers hm go ahead and add ike to your team shinon gatrie and i can handle the other two jobs easily enough titania im leaving ike in your care im trusting you to show him the ropes
understood commander
come on ike lets get you set up
all right my first job
captain titania preparations are complete and im ready to go
impeccable timing its nice to know we can always count on you to be at the ready oscar
dont forget about me im ready for action
is that so boyd thats a surprise
ha not today it isnt
as of today i am going to be the absolute model of perfection i need to set a good example for ike
ill take your word for it
your first campaign at last i know youve wanted this for a while are you nervousike
i think i was more nervous last night i could hardly sleep this morning im feeling pretty good its the calm before the storm
you should try to relax youre not going to be out there alone
yeah youre right
right everyone ready lets go
this is the village of caldea the bandits are few but we mustnt get careless our goal is to take out the bandit leader in front of the large building and then secure that building
all right let me explain whats going on
this is a map of caldea theyve hired us to drive off some bandits were the blue marks here the red marks are the bandits
there arent many of them but we cant get careless the one in front of the building up north is their leader
our mission is to take him out and recapture that building
ike listen up all this stuff is old news to me but i can give a rookie like you a few tips first off dont let yourself get worked up and jump out in front of everyone youll just end up getting hurt
dont try to do too much ike when things get dangerous you can–and should–rely on us as long as you watch how the enemy moves carefully youll be fine think of this as a training mission
ill do that oscar boyd thanks for your help
dont mention it
just sit back and watch how a professional handles things
enough chitchat you three weve got work to do
ike before you engage an enemy take a good look at his weapon the weapon you use often determines who has the upper hand in a fight for example the axe im wielding serves me well against lances but it fares less well against swords
and my lance is great against swords but not against axes and to complete the triangle 
ah my sword its strong against axes but weak against lances right
yes exactly if you can remember that youll be more effective in combat
thats just the basics though thisll come in handy soon enough so dont forget it
swords over axes i wont forget not if i remember that ill always have the advantage over you boyd
do you think you could maybe find a different way of remembering yeah thanks
and one more thing dont forget to visit the locals were here to help after all the villagers should welcome our presence
whats going on out there is that some sort of army pah a bunch of mercenaries looking for their next meal the villagers mustve hired em listen up lads hurt em and hurt em bad we let this bunch live and well have hordes of hired swords hounding us the rest of our days
its those fool villagers they think they can buy a bunch of sellswords to chase us away it aint gonna work out how they wanted all they get for their trouble is a bunch of ruined houses tearem down boys thatll teach em
my work here is done this house is totalled time to move on to bigger things now i smash me some mercenaries
you looking for something fool you looking for a fight heh heh  you came to the right place ill give you a tussle
i im meant for better than this i dont want to die here 
hey youre nothing but a boy well every brat needs a beating now and then are you ready for it
not todayif you want to run away nows your chance
heh heh heh imagine that you sassing me dont that beat all
despite my own warnings i let my guard down and i got beaten ha ha urgh 
titania you shouldnt move
thats the end of it ike are you all right
yeah ill be fine
you know you surprised me to think that youve come so far
look at my father though ive still got such a long way to go
theres nothing you can do about that after all commander greil is–
huh what about my father
oh nothing
nothing now im really curious
dont worry youll learn all about it someday
 
hey ike that wasnt bad for your first battle not as flashy as my first time though
yeah you were a real standout ill never forget the sight of you so keyed up you broke your own axe
oscar dang it you didnt have to bring that up
anyway ike congrats on finishing your first missionwelcome to the group
everyones all right then lets get going im sure mist has a nice hot meal waiting for us
/***EOF***/
the begnion empire the largest nation on the continent is a theocracy dedicated to the goddess ashera
reigning from the summit of the empire and guiding the world with the voice of the goddess the apostle sanaki rules begnion as asheras chosen vessel the apostle is showered with love and respect from the entire nation seven imperial senators aid the apostle in the governance of her realm this system of government has been the backbone of begnion for many long centuries after ike and his company aid the apostle her holy guard takes them to the imperial capital sienne
the upper class of begnion society live lives of pampered comfort and luxury known as the sainted these elite power brokers reside in massive temple like homes whose spires dominate the skyline the guiding tower overlooks all from the heart of the city here ashera holds her vigil watching over the world surrounding the tower is a series of temples both large and small placed in an orderly systematic fashionone temple however is conspicuously larger than the others it is the grand temple mainal home to the apostle ike and his company used to the freedoms of crimea find the differences in culture and custom to be very confusing
ahem now then you have proclaimed yourself to be the orphan of crimeas king ramon princess elincia ridell crimea correct
yes
i have heard stories that king crimea had a daughter in secret my men have reported as much to me in the past however whether you are that princess or not is another tale do you have nothing that would lend credence to your claims
nothing at all it took all my energy simply to avoid capture by daein i had no time to secure any proof of my claim
hmph and with crown prince renning also dead there is no one who even knows your face what am i to do
i will vouch for her
my lord ike
i have no doubt that princess elincia is the true heir to the throne of crimea
oh really and tell me what gives you this strength of conviction if we believe her story this woman has not engaged with the outside world since the day she was born so how is it that you a lowly mercenary dare to assert her authenticity
the daein army pursues her with bloody minded determination at every turn they demand that we turn princess elincia over to them what further proof do you need
hmm  if someone of proper standing made that pronouncement i would accept it as irrefutable proof but you  youre a commoner you have no surname no documented lineage you have nothing i know commoners they are poor for a price they will support any lie no matter how outlandish
 
oh now i suppose you will tell me you are the son of some noble house no of course not but wait perhaps youre a royal knight of crimea
i am neither a noble nor a knight i have no connection with the palace whatsoever and no matter how much gold i stood to gain i would not betray my convictions elincia has paid us yes but nothing more than the standard fee to purchase our services as her escort nothing more we have come this far only because we believe elincia to be a woman of integrity we would not sell our swords to a liar i dont care how high and mighty you might be i will not stand here and let you mock the bond of trust that ties us to elincia
my lord ike
how dare you who are you to address the apostle so crudely guards guards seize this man for his abuse of the apostle the penalty can be only death
halt ha ha ha ha ha sephiran was right about you you are very interesting
a apostle
sephiran that monk we rescued from the prisons
a monk was it his disguises are always so clever it never ceases to amaze me as always he remains an enigma heed my words sephiran is in truth duke belsys prime minister of begnion and my most trusted advisor he has been traveling the neighboring lands for months trying to ascertain the condition of the people there
we have received detailed reports on princess elincia and the mercenary company serving as her escort
so you knew we were coming you knew who we were all along
yes i apologize for testing you you see life here in the palace is dreadfully dull i am always so very bored thanks to the princess and her brazen little escort this interrogation proved to be an amusing diversion
oh ho ho so thats what this was how very like you apostle a cunning game of wits and words simply smashing even your most loyal servant duke oliver of tanas was on the verge of being completely fooled i am humbled oh ho ho come duke lekain
ah ahem it was all a ruse was it oh apostle you do tease us so mercilessly still it was not such a bad way to amuse ourselves was it duke hetzel
hoo too true my good duke princess crimea it appears that you have put quite a smile on the face of our beloved apostle what an honor that must be hoo hoo hoo
 ah  um yes  i suppose 
madness
oh yes i almost forgot in all the fun sephiran has already vouched for your identity as the true princess of crimea i require no further proof you may rest easy
i am most grateful
wait a minute
yes
what is the meaning of this you knew elincia was princess crimea and you continued to humiliate her for your own entertainment for some stupid game of wits and words this is no joke
 
elincias homeland is lost to her her family has been hunted down and killed by the monsters of daein and with nowhere else to turn she endures mortal danger and terrible heartbreak to reach your door and then you you laugh at her where is the humor in that where is your decency youre horrible you are all horrid people you disgust me beyond words and you owe elincia a proper apology
my  my lord ike please  
wretched peasant you loose that treasonous tongue once more and  
duke lekain restrain yourself
but  but 
i am speaking be still
grrr 
now then ike i fully understand your feelings your passion for your employer is truly a beautiful thing would that my own fawning vassals shared your commitment however truth be told your behavior does test my patience raise your voice once more to me and you will seriously damage the princesss already precarious position do you understand
not really why dont you fill me in even if elincia is truly crimean royalty she is at best heir to a dead country nothing more without begnions support elincias claim holds no meaning am i mistaken
pah
even if we harm her fragile feelings for the sake of her countrys future she must stand by and say nothing in fact she is in no position to do anything but beg for begnions favor or hadnt you noticed
 
i have much to consider for now i shall take my leave of you i will meet with my senators soon and discuss this state of affairs crimeas future will not be uncertain for long until that time i suggest you rest and relax perhaps you could try your hand at our courtly games of wit and words
what incredible nerve to take advantage of our situation and speak down to us like that i dont care if shes the empress or the apostle or whatever i cant stand her
listen ike isnt it possible that the apostle saved you
what
titania is correct begnion is a nation ruled by time honored custom and ancient conventions you insulted the apostle  the very symbol of their way of life the fact that you are still breathing is a miracle
i hadnt realized
and as her escort your criminal behavior would fall directly on your employer princess elincia if you had truly angered the apostle any hope of restoring crimea would have vanished like a puff of smoke
thats madness they would sacrifice a whole country to satisfy their own egos
ike  this may not be much of an answer but letting madness rule the day is the prerogative of nobility the beorc divide themselves into classes and with classes come prejudice from the moment of our birth to our final dying gasp we commoners know we are not allowed to defy the upper classes
princess elincia i  im sorry my ignorance does not excuse my stupidity  i truly am sorry
no i what you said you said in my defense and in my honor it made me very pleased
huh
to see you so angry on my behalf your words filled my heart
it wasnt as noble as you make it sound
however there is one point that i would contest it is true that ive lost my family and my home but i did have people to turn to people to rely on my lord ike you and your company were at my side for me this has been a great source of inspiration and of happiness
princess elincia 
my lord ike  please call me elincia
huh that would be improper wouldnt it i mean youre our employer and 
you called me so earlier
i did really
you didnt notice
no i  oh my aplogies ill be more careful well i suppose we should go theyve prepared rooms for us
ah my lord ike  
i am so booooored weve been here for five days already and theres absolutely nothing to do they gave me free reign to wander the temple but ive seen everything im tired of it
i take it princess elincia has been invited to yet another social gathering a little time off is one thing but this 
i guess ill get in some fencing practice 
ike the captain of the apostles holy guard is headed this way
i beg your pardon are you and your mercenary company enjoying your stay here in begnion is there anything you find wanting
theres nothing to do and mist is bored
ah ike whyd you say that
werent you just complaining about that exact same thing to me you said you were bored and tired of everything
that doesnt mean you should go spouting it to everyone oh youre such an idiot ike
my apologies  neither of them meant any offense theyre just frustrated
yes i understand that i will pay it no mind
did you have some reason for coming to speak with us
i bring word from the apostle she wishes to charge you with a task
the apostle wants to employ us
i didnt expect this
expect what
your reaction id have thought that you would be spouting and fuming at the thought of working for the apostle
if princess elincia can tolerate endless social gatherings to judge begnions mood and garner her favor the least i can do is help her earn points by running an errand or two
hmm 
ike theyre coming
so we lay in wait for them here right
yes the apostles orders were clear stop the band of merchants traveling on the old highway and seize their cargo this does look to be the best spot for an ambush
all right i dont know who were facingbut were on the job lets do this right
a poor crop this time around cats tigers and a few crows all weve got are laborers were not going to get rich with this
aw and we worked hard to catchem is it as bad as all that
ive been selling half breeds for twenty  five years the ones that fetch the highest price are the trophy herons and if theyre white winged royals the fanatics will empty their purses of every last coin
well if thats the case why dont we hit serenes forest next time there might be a few of em left
youve the brains of a dead wyvern why do you think herons are so expensive its because theyre rare its been twenty years since that mob burned serenes the herons were all roasted like chickens no matter how you look at it that was utter lunacy all that gold up in smoke
oh  if theyre so valuable id like to see one with my own eyes id catch it and put it in a cage 
 idiot 
think what you could buy with all that gold a new axe oh and some furry boots too
shut up fool stop your daydreaming and look over there
wh what who are they
bah look alive lads theyre not common travelers
here they come titania are we sure this is the right bunch
this fog makes it hard to see but their numbers and appearance match our intelligence  it must be them
well theyve certainly seen us theyre readying their weapons
very well  get ready to fighteveryone
ah  what terrible luck my sixth sense told me that the weather would be nice today
hey grumbling and whining wont pay off your debt come on beautiful cough up my gold

with you  where are we going what am i going to do
youre joining my company im going to let ike beat some sense into you well see how that works
no wait  im working for these guys at the moment and well if i just up and joined with the other side it might cause problems  
stuff it sponge brain no more lame excuses follow me now
sorry sis sorry im coming 
oh bother buying all these things is well and good but i simply cant carry it all and wheres largo he leaves me in this backwater burg and wanders off to goddess only knows where 
hello
oh you there todays your lucky day youve arrived at just the right time i have something nice to give you i just got back from a shopping spree and i got this as a free bonus of sorts oh please no need to thank me when youre a sophisticate like me you never want for trinkets or men for that matter well toodle doo then be sure to treasure that for the rest of your days now which way to the nearest city

hey you why dont you lay down your weapons and walk out of here with your lives you can posture as much as you want but theres no way you can beat us

in that case weve no choice youll receive no mercy from us

ah forgive me marcia 
brother wh why 
marcia hold on please  dont die on me marcia
our duty is done lets grab the cargo and get out of here
well done the news of your victory is welcome as is the cargo you seized now about your payment 
wait this mysterious cargo was a bunch of really heavy crates would you tell me what they contained
that  
your job was to deliver the cargo youve no need to investigate further
but  
princess elincia has returned to her quarters you would do well to inform her of your safe return
 
it appears that the apostle will handle your payment on the morrow perhaps you can speak with her theni beg your leave i must be going
very well
thank all of you for comingmy fellow laguz kings its been decades since all of us were gathered in one place i would extend my gratitude to king deghinsea of goldoa who arranged this meeting place at short notice
it was nothing king caineghis
fellow kings and countrymen attend to my words as you no doubt have heard daein has invaded crimea and overrun her of course crimea is a beorc nation however since the time of her founding she has made every effort to engage the laguz with honor and dignity never has this been more true than during the thirty year reign of good king ramon during this era gallia and crimea initiated many ambitious cultural projects in an attempt to bring our divided people closeryet one man has always reviled our work the daein king ashnard why he took this recent course however i know not ashnards actions are monstrous his army has put much of crimea to the sword her people live in terror her king lies dead and now the daein forces continue their ruinous march and cross the border into laguz territory  into gallia
that trespass o king of lions is because your country chooses to harbor king crimeas orphan is it not
yes that is the justification they would present
but the princess of crimea is no longer in gallia is she
your spies are as efficient as ever king tibarn of phoenicis as you say the princess has already departed for begnion
i know this only because she came to the aid of a ship carrying begnions apostle
ah so princess elincia is safe and in contact with the begnion empire that news gladdens my heavy heart
i do not believe that daein yet has this information if word got out that the princess of crimea has been granted sanctuary in begnion daein might halt its invasion of gallia
your information is dated hawk king have your legendary eyes and ears abandoned you after all these years
you have something you wish to say
would you be so kind as to explain yourself king kilvas
princess elincia barely escaped crimea with her life and then fled to gallia and yet a certain king of beasts there one on whom she had pinned all hope chose not to support her
 
with nowhere else to turn the princess and her retinue spent two long months at sea arriving in begnion mere days agodaein knows of these events as welland the king has dispatched a team of hunters to make a corpse of the girl and that dear kings is the latest news at least to the best of my poor knowledge
daein knows the princess is in begnion king kilvas how did you come to possess this information
why theres no trick to it i just perk up my ears and point them in the right direction
you expect us to believe that a stray wind carried it to your ears this is an odd tale naesala
hmm do you think so well there is one trick to information gathering that i know shall i share it with you
if it involves dealing with human scum ill pass forgoing my laguz pride is not something im willing to do
ha is that not always the way of phoenicis to cling to those last tattered remnants of pride instead of proclaiming that you will attack none but begnion ships just admit that you dont have the power to do more
what did you say
both of you will desist at once king naesala of kilvas your actions of late can indeed be judged as too extreme
black dragon king of goldoa what do you pretend to know of my actions please enlighten me
i would remind you of the beorc ship you attacked in phoenicisian waters and left stranded in goldoan territory
oh that
naesala you lying crow youve been sneaking about in my territory again have you
i heard from my own son kurthnaga that a beorc resembling princess crimea was on board that ship
it is true
what king kilvas you 
dont act surprised i have no intention of ruling some tiny island nation forever i will make kilvas a name to remember to that end no amount of gold is enough laguz or beorc i care not if the pay is right theres nothing i wont do
i care not about the reach of your ambition but you should choose your methods with more care what good will it do you to expand your domain only to find enemies at your every border
i will take your words to heart for the time being
and you too king phoenicis what good will your piracy do you if it earns the wrath of begnion continue at this pace and theres no telling when the hostilities will end
until the people of begnion apologize for the slaughter of our brother herons i will do no such thing
prince reyson of serenes are you of the same mind
those humans burned serenes forest and killed my people no amount of human blood can slake my thirst for vengeance for my siblings for my countrymen i demand justice i cannot even return mybedridden father to our forest home  i am no soldier i know nothing of war so king phoenicis acts in my stead i am most grateful to him and i would not see him stop until begnion has paid
blood leads only to blood and violence begets violence nothing more revenge is simply another name for murder
 
and you king of lions what will you do about your home of gallia now that you know daeins feint toward gallia is merely another move in his game of war how will you act
theyve made no formal declaration of waruntil they do we watch and wait
if its the first step towards eradicating all human scum phoenicis will help you destroy daein
no unless this becomes a true war among all nations i want you to stay your hand as long as gallia is protected by the sea of trees we can stave off daeins attacks
ah the luxury of a large nation you would waste a chance to expand your territory just to maintain the status quo sad
i agree with king gallia if we were to form a laguz alliance against daein we would drive begnion to daeins side and lose a valuable ally the flames of war cannot be fanned haphazardly above all we must think of lehrans medallion its location is unknown but it still exists we know this and as long as it does we cannot allow any war that could stand to engulf all our nations do you understand laguz kings i beg of you do not forget it
psst you wanna hear somethin theres a rumor going round that a tiger sub human has been seen on the foggy banks of this very river
 
eh wot you dont seem surprised all right then how about this that sub human they say its always in beast form it cant change back right frightening aint it the only way for us humans to fight them savages is to wait for em to change out of beast form i mean how can we kill em if they wont change
 
still no reaction eh what a bore owzabout this juicy morsel then was saving it i was but  i eard from my darling in the army that tigers cats and other four legged sub humans hate fire magic thats a useful tidbit aint it oh i knows things
you there serving wench theres work to be done why are you wasting time chatterin on
wha whats wrong just saying allo to one of the new servants is all
you fool this is no servant
 aye  oy  eh wot oh crickey princess crimeas escort  a guest of the apostle  oh ohnoohmygosh please please forgive me
 
wha what should i do ooo he looked right angry he did i might get sacked
well if it isnt ike out for a walk commander
hello gatrie yeah if i stay in that horrible gaudy room for too long i start to feel depressed is that why youre out here too
no im here for different reasons im just admiring the flowers
oh right yes they all seem to be in bloom this time of year the large yellow ones are especially pretty
not those flowers those flowers
 gatrie were inside theres nothing here but the temple handmaidens
exactly its like a whole new species of girl lives in begnion everyone in this palace is drop dead gorgeous
 
you know what i mean ike tee hee say which one strikes your fancy that buxom lass with the chestnut hair is  hey ike ike bah hes still just a boy
um commander ike
hm oh its you
are you trying to clear your head as well
yeah i guess so im just walking and thinking about things begnion is so odd i dont understand this country at all
mm i can see that everythings so wrapped up in form and tradition it feels like begnion has lost track of more important things
youre some noble houses daughter are you not what made you decide to become a knight
to escape my royal family  no not to escape but to confront it i want my life to be my own
how do you like being a knight
i am still not satisfied i may now be a knight but my hands still shake when i draw my bowstring so perhaps my goal was not simply to become a knight perhaps my true goal was to become stronger commander ike the others say that you never give up no matter how bleak the fight that seems like true strength to me
please allow me to continue fighting by your side if i remain with you i will grow stronger from your example
your skill with the bow is spectacular how could i possibly refuse your request were pleased to have you
oh thank you thank you very much
aaaaahhhh 
that was quite a sigh

the crimean royal palac located in the center of melior is famed for its beautiful  gardens where the world seems at peace but times have changed countless battles have raged in these idyllic confines and a new dark lord now sits upon the throne the palace itself has not suffered  it remains a study in dignity and elegance yet there is no peace on this day a grim tension fills the air engulfing all it touches in deafening silence within the heart of the palace sits the author of this war ashnard king of daein

 where did that come from that was magnificent it seems the princess too has grown stronger
its said we grow into the roles were given isnt it elincia will make a splendid queen
 
thats  thats just what nasir said what its true stop it dont give me that i cant believe what i just heard look
nasir said it right whew thats a relief i thought the world had gone mad
 stupid cat
all right lets go this ends today
im ready
i have everything i need
very well were ready  
say ike this is the end of the end you know so rather than just giving orders  why dont you say a word too
i think princess elincia said enough
i want to hear what you have to say brother father always did it didnt he
you want me to say something like father would have done
uh huh
um hey there before this final battle theres only one thing i want to tell all of you 
i dont want any of you dying on me remember  you only have one life at a time like this it doesnt matter what our blood ties are we are family thats what my father always used to say and today for the first time  i understand why he said it  because we are a family
so if you dont want to cause your family any grief then live dont drop your guard dont turn your back use every drop of your strength our road has been long but it ends today lets liberate crimea and free our friends and our families from daeins tyranny men of crimea laguz of tellius greil mercenaries move out
attack were being attacked
the castle gate has fallen the crimean army cannot be stopped
 it appears the end is near your majesty please use the rear gate and withdraw we will cover your retreat
i am not leaving
but if  if we lose your majesty the daein royal bloodline itself will be lost
are you saying i will lose hm is that what you wish to say
 of course not however our army is in dire straits it is merely an act of prudence your majesty i humbly ask that you consider the continuance of the bloodline above all else of course your judgment  
the value of the thirteenth generation of daeins royal family is not so high as to warrant your pathetic display i am daein if i am to be destroyed then let daein be destroyed with me
your  your majesty  that is  
i have no need of inconstant retainers you are an obstacle away with you
 b but your majesty 
my sole desire is to rule through strength the weak perish and the strong live on  this is the law of nature it is the law the goddess herself created when she forged this world
 it appears that further conversation would only be a waste of time though even if his majesty desires it not i will remain and protect him i cannot allow the legacy of daein to end here
tell me bryce  you were my fathers retainer were you not
 from the fifteenth year of my life and for twenty more years until his death  i did serve him faithfully
the thing that killed my father was not plague nor was it another illness  it was me
wh what
oh but it doesnt end there there was my stepmother too and every brother who stood to be a legitimate heir all of them died by my hand
 
are you still determined to protect me knowing this truth
 i am even knowing now as i do you are still your fathers son the blood of daeins kings flows in you you are all that remains by your leave
such loyalty to a corpse in truth there is nothing in this world more humorous than a knight
hey look out
is  is that 
 
elincia what are you doing get back
 ashnard 
wh what did you say that is the king of daein
heh heh heh heh its been a long time princess crimea
 
you look quite different than you did the day that i cut your father and mother down like cattle  i can hardly believe youre the same little girl who did nothing but tremble and stare at me
you  you craven   ive returned to see you defeated i will no longer allow you to treat crimea any way you please
haaa haa haa how brave and noble of you however you are not the one i seek
aaah
elincia
are you the one they claim is the son of gawain
king ashnard of daein your treachery dies on my blade
oh ho ah ha ha ha haaaa i see that blade in your hand  it is a sacred blade is it not the only type of blade that can pierce my armor hm it matters not how famous the blade if the wielder lacks skill the greatest sword is nothing but blunted steel
dont worry you will see for yourself how blunt it is
i expect good things from you son of gawain what you see before you are my elite handpicked soldiers how will you deal with them im looking forward to watching you dont disappoint me
hold
any of you whose arms remember what it is like to battle step forth i would take of your strength now
 
are you nervous
yes and you my lord ike
no im actually pretty calm in a strange way now that were finally here i can focus on defeating king daein nothing else seems to matter
i wonder if we shall win 
we will win i didnt come this far to lose youve come all this way as well so believe in yourself
 youre right
 ike i dont like these odds i think it likely that we may take a lot of casualties what do you think of pulling in one of the other commanders to lend us a hand
i have answered your call so daeins elite soldiers are giving you some trouble are they
sorry to have kept you waiting but now that im here you can breath easier i promise you that king daein will fall at my hands
im here but heed my words im only here to aid you dont try to put the burden of this battle on my shoulders
one blow for nameless wretches like you one blow is more than enough
heh heh heh heh youve done well to have grown so strong at last i have gained a foe worthy enough to test my sword excellent enjoy my might to your hearts content
 do you think you can defeat me ggrrraaahh haarr haaarr haaaarrrhhh  gggrraaaaagggghhhh its not over yet i havent seen all you are capable of

sorry to have kept you waiting is that king daein hes become a monster the medallions chaotic energy is overflowing from his body no matter leave him to me i promise you this ashnard will fall at my hands

 rajaion

leanne what is it
that dragon with the big wings 
a laguz  no it cant be ashnards mount was a wyvern wasnt it
i cant tell for sure
if he is a laguz
then let us sing
what are you doing
be patient please theres something we want to try
huh
 
 
reyson thats 
leanne told me that dragons true form had been warped so we sang the galdr of rebirth 
ra rajai on 
err aah 
 rajaion d do you know who i am
 e  ena
yes  yes you recognize me
you were made to suffer because of me  im sorry
 sniff  rajaion rajaion oh rajaion 
 ena  lets return to goldoa the two of us together
i will go anywhere my love as long as it is with you
ena from this day forward forever  
 sniff  sniff ah rajaion 
 
he was one of the dragon tribe
thats right he and ena were engaged to be married and then he was driven mad by king daein and his form warped
 i see
aha is that nope dang 
hmm ah here it is
what is it mist did you find something
the medallion ike the medallion i finally have it back 
mist that medallion is  
yeah  i know
reyson leanne
hm what is it mist
what
here
 oh
the medallion
the medallion belongs in serenes forest my mother was only holding it for lillia
 leanne you take it
thank you little mist
 
 
thank you daughter of elena in the memory of my departed sister i accept the medallion from you
ive brought her nasir
 
 im sorry mist
 
i knew how much the medallion meant to you and i stole it nevertheless no matter the words i use to apologize i did something unforgivable i gained your trust  and ikes  and betrayed it then i compounded my dishonor by fleeing  i am so very sorry 
  thanks for coming back nasir i  i wanted to see you again and im glad i did welcome back
 ah mist i do not deserve your kindness 
 mist please allow me to apologize as well i am the one who is truly at fault here what nasir did he did for me
im sure theres some very important reason for all of this and its probably still unresolved im honestly quite curious plus i want to help but  but i doubt that i can so im going to wait ive decided to wait until the two of you can tell me about whatever it is so you dont need to worry about it anymore all right
 thank you mist
thank you
 
har so tomorrows the day we take on the capital im ready whooooo it doesnt matter how hard the fight youre facing might be i always feel excited the night before
id like to tell you how wrong that is but i cant i cant seem to calm my nerves either
were going to win you know king daein wont survive the day
mmm i wonder
are you two on guard duty
oh its you heya ike
do you have some need of the king
yeah will you tell him im here
we will wait here
 
so tomorrow it is did you come by to check on our preparations
you know me too well youre going to circle the capital and ensure that no airborne enemies escape thats clear isnt it
yes i think encircling the capitals a good idea well guard the west and take care of airborne combat as well the phoenicis and kilvas armies are unbeatable in that regard
kilvas is going to help out
of course
after what we saw in the dungeons of gritnea tower we all agreed that king ashnard must pay reyson and leanne helped to sway certain opinions it was tough but in the end we understood what needs to happen that having been said the crows are traitorous by nature if worse comes to worst it may be just us hawks out there
that will be enough at least i know i can rely on you
well to be perfectly honest i wouldnt mind a chance to remove ashnards head from his shoulders
its just like the time i fought the black knight youre being kept away from the main fight my apologies hawk king
thats all right but if you find yourself overwhelmed give me a call
understood
and as for you reyson im sure youre tired of hearing this but  
i know i know be careful dont die dont worry i wont die im not going to leave leanne and my father all alone
nestling it appears theyre discussing tomorrows battle shouldnt you join them
 no i think not its just tibarn after all he doesnt really want help from kilvas anyway
the hawk king may not care but prince reyson would surely feel that you had betrayed him yet again nestling
what
oh and dear lady leanne as well if you were to flee in the face of the enemy it would break her heart hah   it would be so sad haaah  heeee
senile old crow you think if you bring those two into it ill do as ive been told and fight  curse you
this war has been waged for over a year but it could all be over by midday tomorrow how do you feel ike think well win
well win
i knew youd say that ha you dont fool me anymore but even so i appreciate your bravado tonight
without such courage it would be impossible to face king daein
master giffca what are you doing here
the king felt uneasy knowing you were here on your own i come in his name
so are you going to fight with us
that is my purpose that is if lord ike grants his permission
of course the daein army is large so were going to be attacking them from the front and holding the two eastern gates id be very appreciative if you would agree to take command of that front
if that is your wish i can but agree
whats this now you werent satisfied with the work i was doing i mean i know that im no master giffca but please 
ranulf i want you to be with me is that all right
oh now i see sure that would be fine getting to be part of the main pack is the highest of honors
master giffca
its been a long time how is the king
hes in good health the king has given me a message for you two
a message not orders
thats right he said to be sure you make it home alive and then he said that your work in the past year has been most satisfactory and that hes sincerely grateful to you both
 thats such an honor
we have fought hard but it wasnt a bother ike and the others are good beorc  we are happy to fight with them
i see
/***EOF***/
the information gathered at palmeni temple leads ike ever closer to the hidden truths behind the war the assassination of begnions former apostle led to the massacre of serenes a serenes princess was kidnapped the medallion is stolen a complex skein seemed to connect these events and now those threads have become clearer and cleaner ashnards motives are still a mystery but his silhouette lurks in the shadows of all that happens ike returns from the temple and renounces all rights to the rule of daein those rights are then passed through general zelgius of begnion to the apostle herself the crimean army absorbs another troop from begnion and with its might increased marches on the daeincrimean border its next goal is the riven bridge a massive structure that connects the two countries
if thats the decision youve reached well respectfully comply
if we can march quickly and know that someones protecting our backs it would be a huge relief
as you wish may the fortunes of war be with the crimean army if you have need of soldiers send word well move out at top speed
ill be counting on it
my lord ike may i have a moment
of course what is it
the soldiers say that tomorrow well be able to see the great bridge once we cross it well be in crimea
thats what ive been told
it feels like ive been away for many years crimea is the land where i was born and raised to feel so removed from it  i feel now at this late juncture that i know almost nothing of my own country it is an unreal experience
i know what you mean i dont have the sense that were on the brink of being back in crimea either i dont even remember this area at all maybe its because i was born in gallia and raised in the countryside but countries are joined together like this all over the continent im really in awe of it all
so am i for one who knew nothing of life outside the royal villa  everything is so very big
big hmm  yeah i guess youre right when we left crimea it was spring  the snows were melting the days were getting longer and the weather was mild
its been almost a year since we departed only a year but the distance weve traveled to get here has been long and hard it feels like many years have passed us by yet this is the land where i was born and raised  ah my dear sweet crimea how is it that you feel so far away
for me too crimea is my homeland were almost there  lets go home
it is as you say my lord ike lets go home
oooh what a romantic setting makes it hard to make an appearance i guess i could just leave you two 
huh i know that voice 
hey there ike looks like we stayed alive long enough to be reunited arent we the lucky ones
ranulf
my lord ranulf how nice to see you again
my princess elincia welcome home id curtsy but the tail makes it look silly
what are you so darned chipper about
once i heard the news that the crimean army had taken the daein capital i ran all this way to greet you
how go things in gallia youre not engaged in open hostilities with daein are you
not yet
whats that supposed to mean
in light of your armys success the elders have finally agreed on something gallia will lend its full support to princess crimeas efforts to liberate her homeland its a done deal
really
so is the gallian army going to  
were going to establish communications with them and create a united front that being said gallia is here to support you the crimean army will always be at the center of the effort dont forget that
king gallia is being most gracious that posture will allow crimea to lay claim to any victories we achieve
dont say things like that im shocked that you would understand such subtleties who are you and what have you done with ike
i dont believe you have the right to speak to me like that kidding actually soren just lectured me on the same situation when we received reinforcements from begnion
of course you were tutored by your nervous little staff officer now i get it  has he snapped yet he seems high strung
king caineghis is always thinking of crimea isnt he how can i ever repay him
princess  lets win your country back when thats done please rebuild the bonds of friendship between our nations that would be the ultimate way to say thank you wouldnt it
yes yes of course
so theyre finally here are they has the work on the bridge been finished and your answer had better be yes
y yes general do you think it will work
sometimes the simplest of traps offer up the best results lure the enemy in and then finish them off one by one got it
listen up dogs there will be no retreating today we stop crimeas advance here we will not allow them to gain the comfort of their homeland any who do not fight to the death will face my lance
theres the bridge  wow its huge  i doubt if daeins going to let us cross over without objection
yeah i think thats highly unlikely
titania its time to march make sure the troops stay alert and move with caution
understood commander
say ike theres one thing ive been meaning to ask you
what is it
i havent seen nasir around whats happened to him
he was declared an enemy combatant and locked up
what hey i understand you being irked that he didnt mention testing you and all but treating him like a criminal is too  
testing me what are you talking about
huh oh um  nice weather eh
were going to talk now
nasir is a daein spy no way thats not possible he was our spy
youre telling me he was a gallian spy none of this makes sense to me 
he worked for us on behalf of the king but daein as a laguz he would have absolutely no reason to work for them
but there was a goldoan named ena who was working as a general for daein
 are you serious
yes we were forced to fight her in the daein capital when we attempted to capture her nasir intervened and allowed her to escape he betrayed us
what hold on a minute 
maybe that was  if thats the case then i can see why no even so teaming up with daein is just too much hmm  
i hate to interrupt whatever it is youre doing but weve arrived at the bridge
let me speak to nasir please
once weve finished this battle we can go together all right
of course
all right haar time for you to go to work
zzzzz  no mom five more minutes zzzzzzzzzz 
dozing off on the battlefield  youve got a lot of nerve dont you hey wake up or ill burn you to a crisp
zzzzz  snort huh wha   uh  right has the enemy arrived
yes they just got here now get out there and do your job
oh im all over it yaaaawwwnnn 
what an absolute fool
well here we are and theres the daein army on the other side as expected theyre already in battle formation and waiting to give us a warm welcome aw thats charming
thats just what i want
oh ho well said and by the way i thought id join you today
not as a gallian but as part of our army right
if its a problem i can always sit this one out
of course not thanks for your continued support ranulf
ha the pleasures all mine lets go carve us some daeins
attention  lets yaaawwnn go hmm maybe i can catch a nap while we fly 
 now then lets see how things look
greetings jill so youre still alive eh good to see
thats what i was going to say to you you survived im very pleased
general shiharam left me in charge im supposed to get our survivors and their families to begnion i cant die until thats done
oh i see  but then  captain why are you still in daein
i  believe it or not im a vindictive man revenge for the general is something i couldnt let go
oh but that 
dont get the wrong idea youre not the enemy im seeking
huh but 
the ones responsible for general shiharams death are the daeins i pretended to return to the fold so i could get close to general petrine im just waiting for my chance but i think they may be on to me my units a bunch of tough guys who serve as petrines watchdogs plus ive been ordered to charge the crimeans head on its daeins way of killing two birds with one stone
dont do it come fight by our sides if youre looking to kill daeins then we share the same goal
jill  i um  i dont trust crimea anymore than i do daein im sick to death of serving countries
captain 
still  i cant abandon the daughter of the man to whom i owe so much  guess im changing sides again
really oh thank you captain
no youve got that backwards
pardon
im a new recruit  so im under you thanks in advance captain
what dont be silly wait ah captain
is that the crimean army
what ho it is the army come again i see the crimean flag in the rear but lo who do i spy in the distance green hair orange dress and eyes bewitching fair elincia comes let us to her aid ride
the princess has returned count bastian return to the castle and inform geoffrey at once i will move ahead and inform the princess that her retainers are here to meet her
lady lucia keep your wits about you that we are excited is fair to say  but show the enemy no weaknesses lest he does cut us down like autumns wheat
good advice and you watch that you arent waylaid on the way back to the castle
even if daein unleashes on myself the full force of their armys wrath they are no match for clever bastian ill meet you at the castle gate anon
right
are you ready to fight are you ready to die we must give our all to protect princess elincia
my fellow crimeans now is the time we stand and fight for the life of our homeland
ha ha do you like your meat rare or do you like it charbroiled let me know and ill cook you up just as ordered wha ha ha ha ha
y your  your majesty forgive me please  oh i dont want to die  so scared 
 combat tsk its one of those things you simply cannot control
the dark angel  shes found me at last  at least i can sleep now 
princess elincia welcome home its so good to see you safe
lucia lucia is it really you
i am no spirit see flesh and bone through and through
ah lucia you have no idea how ive longed to see you
and i you princess elincia when my brother geoffrey told me you had been lost my world went dark when i learned you were still alive i was so 
then geoffrey is safe as well happy day are there others how many crimean retainers have survived
well theres count bastian that silver tongued rascal is as loquacious as ever also general tagio marquis katols orphan silok and marquis mitnala are all with us the soldiers we have contacted so far do not even number one hundred but if they know youve returned retainers hiding throughout the land will surely come pouring in
yet my existence  it is not known to the general populace 
theres no need to worry about that tales of your exploits in daein have reached every corner of crimea in every village in every town the people are talking our fair king had a hidden child they say the secret princess of crimea is fighting to save us all in addition daein soldiers have been frantically searching for a mysterious and elusive princess crimea all theyve succeeded in doing is convincing the people that you truly are their princess all of crimea has been anxiously awaiting your return
oh lucia do you speak truly they have acknowledged my existence i never expected this day 
news of your actions in daein reached the ears of king gallia through nasir i then told lucia who passed it to the citizenry you know the thought that nasir is a traitor just doesnt feel right to me i cant believe it
you think i dont see that look at what we know about the medallion we discovered it thanks to his hints hes helped us throughout our entire journey in that at least he was not false yet if he will not speak there is nothing i can do to save him
lets go see him one way or another i will loosen his tongue
this way
hes being kept in this supply tent we wanted to keep him away from the other soldiers
what is it
hes  hes gone i brought him breakfast this morning he was here 
hmm 
soren are you in here
yes
ike its late what do you want
shhh
um ike
oh no  how strange i was sure hed come this way yooo hooo
that voice  its the woman from the item shop isnt it
commander ike where have you gone handsome
crud
 did you run in here to escape
look whenever that woman corners me it takes forever to get away let me hide in here until things simmer down
we begin marching tomorrow morning this is a waste of valuable time ill go and chase her away
wait soren
iiike ikey poo where aaaaare you
aimee
oh soren ew i mean um hi why are you out so late
do you have some business with ike
well yes i do i found a special something that id like to give to him do you know where he is
ike is in a war meeting if you have something for him i can hold on to it for you
hmm  what should i do you see i have this new staff  the staff is very valuable im not sure if i feel comfortable simply handing it over to someone who doesnt understand that
thats a hammerne is it not a rare staff that can take any item no matter how battered and worn and repair it completely
why thats right youre quite knowledgeable arent you
if i may continue i believe that there is only one of these in all the world it truly is priceless and you want to give this to ike
well i do want to be helpful
 if you truly wish to capture ikes attention bringing him staves and whatnot will avail you nothing
what really oh dear  i was so hoping he would like it
food however would be much more effective than a staff hes particularly fond of spicy meat dishes
is that so cooking is not something that im skilled at but  oh ive got it i know the perfect dish
ah good he will be very pleased um what about the staff
hee hee you can keep it as payment for the cooking tip take good care of it
  well shes unexpectedly generous i received something quite nice from your admirer ikey poo thank you so much
hey wait a minute
understood proceed as ordered
sir yes sir
whats next  huh whos there
sir yes sir  hey its general ike the great i heard all about it you know those guys went and made you a noble

there is no time to waste the final showdown with ashnard is coming between the forces king caineghis grants them before returning home and the soldiers king tibarn brings the crimean army possesses three times the fighting power that it did when it left begnion even so the daein forces encamped in the capital are strong rested and comparable in number in addition the road to the final confrontation is blocked by two formidable obstacles  fort pinell and nados castle how these two tests are faced will mightily affect the course of the war
i see so crimea and gallia have finally joined forces have they half breeds and humans fighting side by side  how sweet
in addition it seems the incident with the heron princess has brought more phoenicians to the struggle as well
oh the hawk king is getting involved eh
which means that the crimean armys strength of arms is all but equal to our own and growing daily of course this pathetic ragged band is still no match for our superior leadership and skill
heh heh heh  heeee hee hee hee things are getting interesting are they not but i am still unsatisfied divide our army into two battalions and send one to meet the crimeans
and who will be in charge of that battalion
bertram
bertram
does that bother you well then  perhaps i should leave it to you and see what happens heee heee heee
do you believe i would betray you
i believe your heart has considered it
surely you jest i will divide our forces and see that they march to meet crimea under bertrams command is this satisfactory
i leave it to you good sir knight
one other thing your majesty in my absence did you order the death of ena
ena ena  oh yes her id forgotten about that one i lost all interest in her when she failed to hold daeins capital you know ive no use for failures yes yes i remember it now i ordered general petrine to take care of her ha another failure under my command i told petrine that if the task was beyond her capturing ena would be enough
i see
why do you ask
according to one of general petrines men they have indeed captured ena but with the generals death theyre unsure what to do with her
heh heh that was one of petrines better qualities she always did follow orders well what do you intend to do
i wish to receive your instructions do you still wish to see her killed or have you changed your mind
mmm do as you will i care not however do not bring her into my presence when that one is near rajaion seems to grow restless
as you wish
everyone seems to be here go ahead soren you can begin now
very well
please look at this map the current position of our army is here in the marhaut range between us and the capital there are two large outposts of enemy troops  fort pinell and nados castle
both holds were built to guardian our fair land but now daein rules them both and knows of us with rations set they could hold out a year say what you will of daein and her foul plans one must admire her skill in things of war
come now bastian why would you praise our foe
i do but speak the mean of it good sir the truth is harsh but lies would be worse still
will you two please shut up please sheesh
 
pinell and nados are fairly close to one another i doubt they would expect us to attack both at once but 
that seems to be a waste of our strength and we dont want to get ambushed from the rear while attacking
we cannot divide our army but we could send a small force to attack the base with weaker defenses and keep it occupied at the same time the main army can focus on the other one and conquer it
these are both strongholds built for the defense of crimea now that theyre under enemy control they pose a significant danger
these are fairly close to one another i doubt they would expect us to attack both at once but 
that seems to be a waste of our strength and we dont want to get ambushed from the rear while attacking
we cannot divide our army but we could send a small force to attack the base with weaker defenses and keep it occupied at the same time the main army can focus on the other one and conquer it
i see  so which one has more soldiers
that would be fort pinell
very well then the main army will lead an assault on fort pinell meanwhile ill take my army and a unit or so of gallians and set out for castle nados well launch an attack and when they come out to meet us well retreat then well attack again it will keep them busy
that should give us the time we need well take care of our front by days end lets go capture a fort
its settled then
my lord ike
princess elincia huh
whats going on why are you dressed like that
i thought to join you on the battle lines  
is that a pegasus where did you get that
he belonged to my great grandmother im a bit nervous about riding him but im going to try neverthelessike
i appreciate your desire but your retainers will never allow it will they
as for that 
did you agree to this geoffrey
no personally im against it but she is the princess and it is her wish i can do nothing
the princesss great grandmother was a begnion pegasus knight of some renown before marrying into house crimea princess elincia herself is skilled at both riding and swordsmanship as a child she was granted permission to train in case the need for her to fight ever arose
behold the pegasus and uniform all treasures of our house crimea fair we did fear much that we would never see a chance to use them in their proper stead oh muse of fire i cannot find the words behold a light that dares to shame the sun our princess clad in raiments fair and fine gives courage love and vigor to our cause
im surprised you were able to hide armor and a flying horse from the daein army
ahem prince renning foresaw a time when the princess would need them and bade us convey them from the palace prince rennings thoughts were always of the princess even as his life abandoned him be true to your heart and live life as it dictates those were his final words to her
my lord uncle was always the one person who understood me best even though im dressed like this i have no experience and do not expect to fight as well as the rest of you but this constant waiting behind and doing nothing it sets my heart beating with such unease i fear it may burst even if i cannot fight i could use a staff to heal the wounded if i could save just one soldier it would mean so much to me please my lord ike i promise to obey orders and stay out of harms way as best i can
lord ike we will take responsibility and guard the princess
it is her heartfelt wish 
this is not something that i can allow or disallow she is my employer if this is what the princess wants all i can do is comply be careful will you
oh thank you so much
let us go forth like sunlight to the dawn elincia fights and crimea wins the day
soren do you have any information on the enemy general
our intelligence reports say the commander of this army is bertram one of daeins four riders
one of the four riders so hes on par with that woman we fought earlier general petrine
 thats not necessarily so the name four riders is given to the four persons of highest ability among the kings advisors
so the members can change is that it who are the current four riders
first there was general petrine whom we defeated at riven bridge then the man we face today general bertram next is general bryce who served the previous king and finally the enigmatic general known as the black knight those are the four
this is the same black knight who murdered commander greil
of that there appears to be little doubt
 
tell us soren do you have any more information on general bertram
i know not where he hails from he appeared after the fall of crimea and has quickly gained ashnards favor
so hes a man of no mean ability
like the black knight he always wears his armor and never shows his face unhelmed some say hes not even in his armor but that its inhabited by an ancient spectre or a demonic creature its all just superstition and rumor designed to heighten fear of the man
its not important once we cross swords well know the truth then we can discover for ourselves if hes just a loudmouthed braggart or truly a monster as long as our blades can wound him i care not either way lets go
 
ike there are more enemy soldiers than we expected just from what i can see now they are double our numbers
and we must assume that the fort houses many more troops this may prove to be a long battle
even if they have twenty times our numbers we must overcome them in this war there can be no retreat
general bertram the crimean army has risen to the bait orders sir
 
 your orders sir
 
general um  how shall we make answer
turn the ground ssssoft with blood make a graveyard of thissss place bury them all
y yes sir
 perissssh  perissssh 
 ga aaa  releasssse 
sir the enemy troops are fleeing shall we give chase
no let them run we fought enough today get our men inside the fort and give everyone a break
yes sir
i see so crimeas won another victory have they heh heh heh heeeee heee heee well then send the rest of our troops to castle nados as reinforcements put general hafedd in charge and let him exchange blows with them
yet that would leave the capital protected by only the imperial guard
you forget yourself knight i will be here as well if they defeat hafedd and make it all the way here then they are worthy to cross swords with me
i would beg a question your highness why do you divide our troops and give the enemy the advantage its as if you were  
as if i were  what go on
its as if you desire the crimean army to continue winning and make its way here to you
ill not deny it
are you saying that you desire daeins defeat
no i am not if you think through it clearly daein will not lose we had many plans when we started this war we went through many scenarios many predictions but as you know our predictions have been completely overturned by this gang of rabble was that luck or was it the gap in skill between the individual soldiers and if it is arent you interested in seeing how far they can come
i do not understand
heh heh heh heeee heeee heee perfect nothing raises my spirits like war come crimea let me be the one to consume your noble hearts
general may i have a moment of your time
yes what is it
id like your advice on something sir lets say i was faced with an undefeatable enemy in that case what should i as the weaker fighter do should i try to avoid slowing down other better fighters and retreat or do i sacrifice myself and try to at least land a single blow on the opponent
if its an enemy general or just someone thats far too strong for you theres no need to get yourself killed but i dont want you to simply run away either study the enemy first and see if retreating is your only option id like you to do that much at least
study the enemy
thats right what type of fighter is he what kind of weapon is he using things like that if you can learn to do that you can determine how best to engage your opponent
those are the very core of combat fundamentals arent they oh im a danged fool it could be i think all my troubles started because i wasnt paying enough attention to the basics youve given me something to think about and some hope too thank you sir youre the smartest general ever
huh  what a brave little fella
are you leaving now
yep were going to do some reconnaissance and tease those daeins a bit
good luck
pah you dont need luck when youre as tough as me
tibarn about  
reyson no i truly am sorry leannes kidnapping is completely my fault
its not your fault please dont apologize i know leanne is alive these battlefields are filled with chaotic energy but i can still sense her its faint but i know its leanne
which is all the more reason for us to hurry there may be other ways to finish this but crushing daein is the surest
agreed
reyson is this mysterious power that you use to sense leanne something only herons possess
its not something any of the hawk clans have that is a certainty
thats not true tibarn the power may differ in potency between us but all laguz possess it to some degree
ah so its just that my sense isnt developed is that it
the power is distributed something like this among the bird tribes its very strong in the heron clan among the beast tribes ive heard its most developed in the cat clan though not as strongly as in the herons as for the dragon tribes  its said they may be equal to or even surpass the strength of the herons
even though i knew that all laguz were not alike there are even more differences than id imagined
your eyes should have told you that once we change we dont look alike do we
good point
enough pleasantries its time for me and my men to take wing
right see you later then
tibarn may the fortunes of war be with you
and you as well dont try anything too dangerous
 
 reyson
my apologies ike though i knew this was coming  its still difficult
dont apologize youve nothing left to prove to me
 ah  
 
/***EOF***/
ike theres someone here claiming to be an envoy from the theocracy of begnion shes been asking if the princess of crimea is aboard what do you want to do
a begnion envoy how did she know about this ship
hmmm perhaps she had word from king gallia on the other hand this is begnion were speaking of i imagine it has spies in every corner of the continent perhaps one of those spies is the source of her information
so we shouldnt be surprised that she knows about princess elincia right
no but its extremely unusual for begnion to send an envoy to meet a princess whom they do not even acknowledge
what do you mean
it is a complicated matter you see the envoy is essentially an extension of the empress herself both crimea and daein were once part of begnion both nations have only recently splintered from the theocracy i cant fathom why the empress would extend the courtesy of an envoy to a nation she must consider somewhat beneath her she must be planning something
beneath her that is somewhat harsh dont you think
harsh perhaps but its true clothing it in sweet words will not hide its bitterness will it
soren even i would question the tactfulness of your words
i will try to be more diplomatic
ike nasir youve no need to scold soren his words are just that they do me no harm
im glad to hear that princess but he should mind his manners
 
deciding how we ought to treat with this envoy is a more pressing issue princess will you meet her and hear her message
i believe i must we gain nothing by refusing to see her let us meet with the envoy
princess elincia of crimea i presume 
yes
it is an honor to meet you my name is tanith i am deputy commanding officer of begnions holy guard
i must ask what would begnion want of me that she would send her holy guard to greet me
the apostle has learned of you princess elincia and she has come here to meet with you personally the duty falls upon me to take you to her now
the apostle am i to meet  surely the apostle has better things to do than 
will you accompany me
i suppose that i 
we are the princesss escorts and we will be coming with her i hope you understand
of course
then yes i will go with you thank you
bad newsmaam weve sighted laguz near the apostles position birdmen crows most likely
hmph weve seen their kind before they fancy themselves pirates without a ship but theyre thieves plain and simple commander sigrun is with the apostle and it will take more than a few winged scavengers to get past her lets remain calm
i  actually im afraid we arent quite sure where the apostle is
what theyve kidnapped the apostle
no no i from what the commander said the apostle grew impatient and had another of her more willful moments i asked at the docks and sure enough one of the longshoremen heard her order the ship to set sail without us
what where were her attendants what was she doing without her guard why can she never just stay put ive told her time and time again that the seaports here are rampant with pirates and crow thugs right where is she now
the wind is poor today so we think her ship should not be too far from us i came here as quickly as i could
understood well move immediately
excuse me but is something wrong
your highness i must apologize but an urgent matter has arisen and i must attend to it immediately i will return for you later await my return
what was that all about
judging from her expression id say something has happened to the person shes meant to be protecting
say do you think that ship over there is involved the envoy is flying in that direction
if so then the pegasus knights fears have already been realized theyre under attack its the ravens they spoke of isnt it
ike why dont we go lend them a hand
are you feeling all right soren its not like you to offer to help anyone
its a great opportunity to put the empress in our debt wed be fools to pass that up wouldnt we
i should have known youd have an angle what do you want to do titania
i dont approve of sorens motivations but i agree that we should help
well then thats what well do will you be all right on your own princess
youre doing the right thing i would not dream of stopping you i know those pirates are no match for your strength
give them give them a sound thrashing
huh youre starting to sound like one of us arent you all right then wed better go
ugh no matter how many we defeat there are more waiting to attack and not just those ravens of kilvas either  there are beorc too what do they all want here
need a little help
you arent you princess crimeas escort
yes the princess ordered us to come to your aid may we join the fray
that would be appreciated well keep the ravens at bay in the interim why dont you go ahead and move onto that ship the big vessel is ours im not sure who the small one belongs to
there are human soldiers aboard but if theyre in this part of the sea they must be pirates cut them down
right well take care of them
oh no there are more of them were doomed
no dont panic we must protect the apostle no matter what listen up pirate scum you may outnumber us but we will not yield an inch
wait wait dont get confused were here to help you were your reinforcements the deputy commander of the holy guard asked us to help drive the enemy from this ship
oh commander tanith sent you were saved the apostle has taken refuge in the cabin belowdecks
where on earth is the holy guard between those crows and the pirates were outnumbered its only a matter of time before were overwhelmed
lady astrid allow me to serve as your shield
gatrie im so sorry that ive gotten you involved in this too 
oh please this is nothing im fine before i was hired as your bodyguard i was a top notch mercenary i can handle this many opponents all by myself this is nothing
is that so your confidence is impressive to say the least 
tee hee well trust me my confidence is backed with my blade im ready to fight
i will fight too
y you youre one of the passengers from house damiell arent you i cant permit someone of your stature to throw herself into harms way
i was once a knight of begnion albeit for only a short while i wont get in your way
no i cant  
we must defend the apostle right we do not have the luxury of choosing how to do so come we must get ready the enemy is coming
you are right we need every able fighter accept my apologies and thank you for your help
until the holy guard arrives we need you to defend the entrance to the ships cabins
got it weapons ready everyone
who are you
my names ike im with the greil mercenaries i came to defend this ship  and the apostle if i can
is that so i am astrid of house damiell
a blueblood huh well unless youre good with a sword youd better hide yourself in a cabin
ill do no such thing i once trained with knights and cavaliers i may be of noble birth but i know something of battle i can fight
well if you can fight we can use you lets work together you going to be all right with that
more so than i would be with hiding belowdecks certainly
gatrie 
lady astrid are you all right
what do you mean im fine why shouldnt i be
i saw you talking to that rough blue haired lad earlierwhat did he say to you was he rude did he try to tell you to run for safety while he fought for your honor
 words to that effect yes
oh what a fool i tell you hell never learn you already have an unbeatable bodyguard  me ill have to remind him of that later
you know that ike person
he is the son of a man under whom i had the honor of serving hes not a bad person by any means but he has no manners whatsoever 
i see well he seemed more concerned than rude when i told him i would prefer to fight he seemed to understand
hm oh oh of course i see it now how silly of me not rude you say i should have known my presence would have changed the boy for the better im the ideal role model
well if it isnt ike good to see you youre looking well my boy
yeah
well im glad to see it ive been worried sick about how the greil mercenaries held up after i left did you ever recover
we managed just fine uh what are you doing here anyway
me oh im on a vital mission absolutely critical i am you see these men keep attacking this ship and i am to continue driving them back
i see are you working for the begnion apostle
no no my employer is far more charming
is that so from the sound of it it must be a young lady
aye after a fashion judging by the look of things you must be on begnions side yes i certainly hope so id hate to have to slay you after all weve been through
no youre right were here to defend the apostle
well thats a relief theres nothing more awkward than having to kill a friend because of his poor taste in employers i tell you still i guess thats the hazard of life as a mercenary its good to see you ike lets finish this together
im with you gatrie
hey gatrie whats with that sour look on your face
you know i think it must be fate why else would we be here fighting side by side once again it makes me wish i hadnt abandoned you so quickly after your father commander greil died
its not like you to say things like that gatrie 
you look like none of this matters to you arent you mad at me or anything i abandoned you all
no i understand how you must have felt when you left and its only because you left that you met this nice new employer i see no problem
yes you do have a point so i guess it all worked out i cant believe i wasted all this time worrying
the fact that you worried tells me that you never really abandoned us after all
hm youre right again i am truly glad to see you ike
gatrie is that you well ill be it is you
oh titania its been such a long time how have you been
busy of course the mercenary life is a busy one have you been doing well since you left us
yes in fact im on a very serious mission right now i cant afford to lose a life hangs in the balance

tee hee you know me too well but i do love the work she gives me im so happy i dont know what to do well it is nice seeing you again
you too good luck gatrie
hm hey its you
 hello gatrie
whats wrong are you still holding a grudge because i abandoned the greil mercenaries so abruptly

tee hee you dont need to worry about me why i cant remember when ive been this happy
im relieved to hear that
but enough chitchat theres a battle that needs fighting
agreed its nice to fight at your side again even if were working for different people
tell me walker are my soldiers proving useful
k king kilvas
what arent you happy to see me
grrr look at this mess i paid you good money to help me outmaneuver everyone else and catch the crimean princesss ship first everything seemed to be going exactly as wed planned but now were being attacked by a squad of pegasus knights were flying no flags weve stripped our armor of any crests they should have no clue who we are why are they attacking us
didnt you know that is a begnion ship youre attacking
what thats a begnion ship it was your featherbrained lackey who told us that princess crimea was aboard that vessel
call it a miscommunication one of those unfortunate misunderstandings that seem to happen now and again
you deceitful king kilvas i wouldnt be surprised if youd planned this treachery from the start
such unkind words you wound me i would never intentionally lie to you and as proof i bring good news i have it on unshakable authority that the ship that just sailed up alongside begnions carries the crimean princess
oh but unless we can break through the begnion ranks theres nothing we can do 
would you care for some assistance
and what would it cost me this time
you learn quickly my friend lets see youd be receiving my own royal assistance so double  no triple rates
ludicrous so much gold  where would i 
i suppose i could defer payment until later of course that does bring up the question of interest 
leave my sight i wouldnt seek your aid if the world were burning down around me
very well weve no more to discuss call me if you change your mind ill find a nice perch and enjoy the show
curse you youre no better than your feral cousins
those humans take themselves far too seriously its almost as though being obstinate is a way of life to them they let their foolish pride stand in the way and what do they get in the end a swift and stupid death now im getting terribly bored merely watching their foolishness
ne ne nestling i can sense youre up to no good again
stop calling me nestling really how many times must i tell you that nealuchi
to me you will always be nestling nestling you can tell me as many times as you like but i cant stop you may be king now but in my eyes you will ever be my little nestling with eggshell stuck to your tail feathers
oh curses senile old fool forget it
hey you there
yes sir
we should take advantage of the confusion of battle to help ourselves to the cargo these humans seem interested only in fighting their fellow men if they cant be bothered to defend their treasure i think it fair to say theyve lost their claim to it
right you are sir
hmph fight fight till you drop ground bound humans we kilvas will be sharpening our black beaks in the mean
hm a battle tell me what you see janaff
its a bit far off but with no fog it shouldnt be a problem hmm the middle ship  i see beorc aboard by their crests id say they serve the hated begnion empire and the other ships im not sure who they belong to neither flies any flag and i see no crest but i can make out more beorc from their behavior i would say that one side fights begnion while the other rushes to begnions aid
a battle between beorc ships i do not understand this at all ulki tell me what they are saying
just a minute sir  the apostle is aboard the begnion ship and coming to her aid soldiers serving crimeas princess they appear to be mercenaries and on that last ship more soldiers although i do not know which country they serve it seems they had a contract of some sort with the raven king
the apostle that would explain the presence of those graceless pegasus knights
what would you like to do your majesty we will fight if you give the word
the apostle this is a tempting opportunity however we are no scavengers feeding on others scraps when we fight it will be with honor were going back home do some scouting and report back to me with what you find
yes sir
blast all my plans are falling apart ill cut you all down
accursed crows you ruined all of my plans 
finally there they are i hope well find empress sanaki safe and sound ladies chaaaarge show them what weve got
oh no
pegasus knights begnion sent their holy guard here blast accursed crows my plan was perfect its over men into the seas swim for your lives and if you get caught tell em nothing not a word about our homeland or your life is forfeit
i saw this coming of course you know if theyd just paid me more id have been willing to lend a hand oh well what do a few human lives matter to us theyre none of our concern were done here lets go
yes sir
thats it it looks like the dust is finally starting to settle
looks like those crows took flight as soon as the holy guard arrived the other assailants fled too
then our job here is done crows are one thing but what were those men doing with them
yes i thought that was odd too
they looked like pirates but they certainly didnt act like them
true they werent interested in treasure and their soldiers definitely were trained fighters but who were they which country did they serve was this an attempt on the apostles life
its possible the apostle is the symbol of the begnion empire itself the apostle is its empress if she were to perish its fair to say begnion itself would perish as well
i see 
the apostle is missing what do you mean
that voice 
something must have happened lets go find out
 ugh this business is becoming quite the headache
i im sorry maam if i can offer up my life in repentance for  
oh stop it if you want to repent go do something useful and find the apostle
yes maam
did i hear correctly is the apostle missing again
oh youre that mercenary 
my men guarded the cabin entrance as far as i know we kept it safe from the enemy 
from what i have been told the apostle slipped out of the cabin on her own in the chaos 
on her own now why would anyone called the apostle do something as stupid as that
hey ike watch your words youre being rude
its all right dame knight i have more important matters on my mind i hate to ask but would i be able to enlist your help in searching for the apostle
of course you dont mind helping do you ike
nah
well search the enemy ship would you search your ship just to be sure i would appreciate it
ill do what i can to find her but i dont even know who im looking for 
i think its safe to assume she will be a woman of stature a noblewoman of some sort
huh
well i suppose all i have to do is keep my eyes peeled for any stowaway  anyone i dont know lets split up it will go faster if we search separately mist and i will check this side
then soren and i will search the rest of the ship
soren about what i said this morning 
yes
about the way you phrase things
i i ought to apologize for that
no dont apologize i know you i know its been bothering you hasnt it
no well 
dont take it personally im no better you know your ability to speak plainly the things others wont is part of what makes you brilliant others are too bound by courtesy with you i trust that what you say is exactly what you think
well yes  thank you ike
now about that missing apostle 
oh 
you found her
no i dont think so but theres a child stowing away in here
what what is a child doing hiding on our ship
she must be some aristocrats daughter probably slipped on from the begnion ship it was a hectic battle she must have been frightened and hid herself here in the confusion are you going to help her
well we cant just leave her
hey are you all right
i im fine 
hey dont be scared
uh wh who might you be you dont look like a laguz perhaps a new recruit
no im a mercenary i was hired by princess elincia
the crimean princess ouch
whats wrong oh you hurt your foot let me see
hold do not approach me hey i told you not to  oooouch youre hurting me you fool
looks like the bones not broken still wed better have mist take a look at it just in case
oh what what are you doing
just hush up and hold on to me theres my sister she can heal that foot of yours right up
are you trying to help me shouldnt you be elsewhere
im supposed to be looking for some sort of apostle person but i think there are enough other people looking and id rather help the injured first
ha i see this is indeed 
hm what is it
oh nothing if thats the case i accept your help
ike any luck finding the apostle
nope all i found was a little lost child
hey shes quite a cutie
mist do you think you could use your staff to heal this kid
yeah is she hurt
just her foot but maybe she bumped her head too shes been mumbling complete gibberish since i picked her up
i kept silent blaming these antics on your ignorance but i can no longer tolerate your manners
huh whats wrong its your foot isnt it
prepare yourselves peasants
prepare for what
you stand in the presence of sanaki empress of begnion i am the apostle the voice of the goddess
empress what did she say
what then she is 
oh no  is she really 
no she cant be
no way
hold your judgment even if shes lying there must be a reason 
y you ignorant 
are you all right empress
my apologies we were unable to reach you and we left you in terrible peril i accept full responsibility
youre late sigrun what would you have done had something happened to me
please empress i beg your forgiveness
that wont be necessary i am also partly to blame for what happened
lets focus instead on our rescuers as a reward for rescuing me i would like to invite them to visit our court and be sure that the one they serve that girl who claims to be the princess of crimea is invited as well
princess elincias bodyguards i presume i am sorry for the trouble youve gone to
and you are 
i beg your pardon my name is sigrun im a commander of begnions holy guard no word of thanks will ever repay you for saving the empress
wait so its true
are you saying that little child 
is begnions 
empress hm it appears so i cant say i quite believe it but she seems sincere besides how many people do you know who command a legion of pegasus knights
the empress has invited us to join her at sienne the capital of begnion i think we should go where is the princess we should ask her permission before agreeing
she must be in the cabin ill take you to her
commander how are you staring at the sea i see 
i know you youre jorge right you make weapons for us
no jorge buys used ware im his twin brother well mostly his twin he has blond hair you see my name is daniel just remember that i have brown hair and that jorge has blond and youll be fine
brown hair daniel and weapons blond hair jorge and items i think ill remember
fantastic say can i ask you a quick question youre a battle expert right youve fought a lot
enough yeah what is it
picture this lets say there are two ships and suppose there are planks connecting the ships at three different points
all right im picturing it
now then soldiers from one ship are about to attack the other one imagine that the defending side has fewer soldiers if they want to mount a solid defense what should they do
it seems clear enough to me position the soldiers with the best defense on the planks soldiers like cavaliers and knights
i see so you would hold the enemy at bay by using your strongest allies to block the primary crossing points
then youd want to have your long range attackers line up behind the tougher units barring the bridges im talking about anyone with javelins axes or magic youd be able to do a lot of damage without much risk
sounds like a good plan but it seems rough on the soldiers defending the bridges
you would want to heal them oftenobviously but maybe theres a way to reduce how much damage they take
its a stretch but what if i dont have them attack at all that way they wont run the risk of getting any counterattacks
hmm  thats not a bad idea
great thanks that gave me some good ideas
ideas for what
oh my brother and i have been playing a wargame ive lost four times in a row
a wargame
well let you join if you bring some parchment and a quill come see us anytime if youre curious see you later
maybe i shouldnt have been so serious with him 
well well if it isnt our commander what brings you down here
i was just on my way to the deck
oh i see thats too bad i had a story i wanted to share with you
a story
hm mm and quite a ripping yarn it is too interested
well  not really
oh youre so rude and after you were so sweet the other day
what are you going on about
when those crows attacked  i had wanted to see what they looked like so i was hiding on the deck watching i had heard they could fly of course but i had no idea they could fight i thought one of them had the drop on you and i couldnt help myself i cried out commander watch out
i thought id heard a strange shrieking sound that was you
and upon hearing my sweet voice commander you turned around and brought down that crow with one shot it was awe inspiring
not really he was exhausted from the battle he could barely move
and thats when you first caught my eye my dynamic young commander
is that why your hand always lingers on mine when you hand me my equipment
oh no have i been too obvious
maybe i should send one of the others down to pick up our gear from now on 
hm youre embarrassed arent you youre so cute when youre being coy but once i set my sights on a mani never let him get away remember that
hey
what do you want
is there any reason youre still on our ship the crows are gone the truce is over isnt it
 i have a duty as a daein soldier i cannot allow a crimean princess and her band of mercenaries to run free where they will
if you want to start a fightyoure on the right path think you can take us all on your own because if you want to get your friends i wont stop you from leaving the ship
watching you all fight those crows like a band of street rats with sticksi could see you were no match for me but even if i were to leave this ship the land is too far away for me to reach
nonsense i can see land in the distance from time to time and i thought you could go anywhere on that wyvern of yours
no wyvern could fly that far without resting and these islands are thick with half beast scum even if i wanted to i couldnt leave this ship
then let me ask you why did you follow us alone knowing that
i wanted to be recognized i wanted my deeds to earn me fame a soldier has little else to strive for 
and yet you soldiers sneer at mercenaries at least we fight for something real there are some dumb soldiers in this world
you leave us no choice ill take you as far as begnion
but as long as youre on my ship you will not utter the phrase half beast if you cant agree to this condition ill kick you off the ship right now
 
im just saying there has to be something more we can do
boyd  youre not making any sense i understand your enthusiasm to help  but try to explain what you mean we cant do anything until we know exactly what it is you want to do
youre so impatient oscar i was just getting to it all right
impatient youre calling me impatient youre so impatient you can barely be bothered to put your armor on
nag nag nag listen i think we should come up with an unstoppable killer attack something only we can do
an unstoppable attack that sounds good 
doesnt it im glad you approve peewee
dont call me peewee
it is a fine plan but you havent explained what this new attack is supposed to be how do we do it
hey i came up with the idea its your job to figure out the details make it cool though oscar
boyd this plan sounds oh dear  how do i put it
let me do it ill think up a great one
no way forget that its too much for your little peewee brain
i told you dont call me that
they may not like to admit it but they certainly are close
/***EOF***/
no fair playing the martyr nobody made me go with you i left of my own free will im ready to accept my punishment too wait what am i saying
please commander greil titania entrusted me with her orders if anyones to blame for this mess its me im the one who should be punished 
i set a poor example commander greil any punishment should be mine alone
regardless of your reasons you disobeyed the orders of a superior officer you are confined to quarters for ten days
but father they did what they did to help me and rolf
rules exist for a reason mist men wont survive on a battlefield if they do as the wish without so much as a by your leave

oh that is joyful news here is your pay as promised
thank you very much and if you find yourself in need again do not hesitate to send word
of course of course all of you put on a most marvelous show–such combat skills to be honesti was expecting commander greil to be here today when i saw just you nothing more than no offense a band of children well i will admit to being a tad nervous
i apologize for troubling you unfortunately commander greil had other pressing matters to attend to
oh no dont apologize theres no need after all you got rid of those brigands and you did it impeccably well
its a fine compliment you pay sir but it was our pleasure
as a matter of fact youre more than good enough to be in the royal army if you so desired especially your commander greil hes far and away better than most any general ive seen hereabouts er  what i mean to say is dont you think running off pirates is a bit beneath you
thats not–
dont get me wrong now you certainly helped all of us simple folk out even so it seems to me the proper place for you and your commander greil is in the service of the crimean throne well thats what this old man thinks
we–and commander greil–are quite satisfied with the work we do now
youve nary a selfish bone among you well then rest assured well speak again if any problems arise thank you again
hmm 
titania is something amiss
no of course not our mission is complete and thats all that matters you did well today every one of you
pah jobs like this barely make a dent in my incurable boredom its like that old buzzard said theres better work out there something with a bit of challenge
shinon
im joking j o k ing
come titania be honest dont you find the work we do to be a bit disheartening unglamorous
what you too gatrie whats gotten into you
please look were not a band of money hungry recruits were professionals and were very good at what we do shinon and i have discussed this at length all of this mundane mercenary work is unworthy of us were wasting our talents
i see youre telling me that you think commander greil is mismanaging us do i have that right
whoa hold it right there thats not what im saying at all
what is it titania
whats what
you seem so angry its not like you
hmph 
exactly ikes got the right of it
its just that i look we do good work and we help people i want you to be proud of that i felt like you were saying work that doesnt bring fame and fortune isnt worth doing thats all sorry
no youre right we are the ones who ought to apologize
enough lets get going shall we rest is part of our jobs too we cant go into the next battle exhausted
now thats a plan im so hungry i could eat a wyvern
titania
what is it
if youre looking for pride i have it
hm
you and my father have kept this mercenary group together and im just proud to be a part of it thats all
ike 
pah im surrounded by idealistic fools whats so wrong with fame whats wrong with having money to live well
/***EOF***/
ike ike ive got to tell you something listen to this
settle down mist its too early for you to be yelling like that now whats going on
sorens back he just arrived
really thats odd he wasnt supposed to return for a while yet
i know i wonder what hes doing back so soon 
its probably nothing to worry about ill go and talk to him where is he
in the mess hall i think he wanted to talk to father
right ill go check there
 troubling news indeed gather the troops
yes commander
ike if youve got time to waste youve got time to work get over to the briefing room
yes sir
hey whats going on around here
bad news something big is happening and we need to formulate a plan of action
soren
hello ike long time no see
im happy to see youre back but hat happened i thought you were going to be studying for a while longer
its a long story 
whats the hold up get over here now
lets go ill fill you in later
you probably remember that sorens been training with another mercenary group well hes back now and he has some unbelievable news
what news is that
its crimea and daein theyve gone to war
war it it cant be
thats why ive called everyone here soren has some more information go ahead soren
all right
take a look at this map
ah its a map of crimea quite detailed from the looks of it
yes this is the melior crimeas capital our base of operations is 
everything started three days ago i needed to do some research so i went to the archives of meliors royal library
without warning the scream of a terrible beast–a wyvern perhaps–rent the air and the building was rocked by a tremor
i rushed outside and saw wave after wave of knights cavalry and wyvern riders each clad in glistening ebon armor black as night
the daein army
correct
was there provocation
as you know relations between crimea and daein have never been friendly however the past centuries have seen only minor skirmishes nothing that has ever approached the scale of this attack it was brutal and without warning daein laid the capital to waste ive never seen destruction on this scale before
a swift attack devastating and brutal a daring gambit indeed
but if it succeeds a very well chosen one at that
yes the king of daein would not hesitate to employ such treacherous tactics what happened next
king crimeas brother deployed the crimean army to meet the attack the king ordered his people to flee the city before the battle reached them fearing the worst i also fled and made my way here
so we dont know how the tides of battle flow now do we
thats all right word of the war cannot have traveled far yet we may well be the first ones who know of it out here you did well to bring us this information soren i know some risk was involved
it was nothing
daein has invaded crimea we may be mercenaries but this still affects us
what are we going to do
thats the question of the day how do you see it titania
crimea is the closest thing our company has to a homeland the crimean royal family and noble houses have been generous providing us with many lucrative jobs from a moral standpoint as well as a business one its in our best interest to help crimea
and you soren
i agree on one point we are mercenarieswe are not crimeas private militia no coin has crossed our palms so i think we should stay out of it
so you would have us sit and watch as crimea is overrun
i would daeins troops are superior in both numbers and morale the chances of a crimean victory are slim indeed
but crimea is ruled by king ramon who is known throughout the land for his wisdom and his brother duke renning is said t possess peerless valor and courage daein may not find victory so easily
valor and courage are for childrens tales in terms of military prowess daeins king ashnard is every bit lord rennings equal victory will hinge on troop numbers and supplies and daein is superior in both i think the outcome is painfully obvious
curse you soren crimea is not doomed if they can turn aside daeins initial thrust and turn it into a test of endurance 
with the crimean army both demoralized and ill prepared they simply will not be able to hold out that long
all right thats enough both of you
i hear what you say however we must ascertain the current situation before we decide on any action well send a scouting party to get a closer look at melior
ike i want you in charge of this assemble your men and get going
what me
titania will accompany you as an advisor
commander you must be joking hes just a boy and hes had barely more than a taste of battle what do you expect a whelp like him to accomplish
ah shinon since youre so concerned you can go as well
wait thats not what i blast
who else gatrie rhys and soren that should do
father wait why do you want me–
that was an order get moving theres no time to waste
yes sir
titania im going out for a bit i want you to give ike some direction
understood
 yes sir
ike wait up
what
here this is for you
a sword where did you get it
from father he told me to come and give it to you
its beautiful
this is the first sword youve gotten that wasnt a hand me down from somebody isnt it thats great
yeah 
well be careful oh and bring me a souvenir something nice ive never been to melior before 
mist im not going on vacation sheesh
 
are you feeling all right ike you havent said a word in quite some time
i dont understand what my fathers doing why put a new recruit like me in charge of something so important
youre going to succeed him as our commander one day dont you think he wants you to know how to lead
me i dont  i dont know if im capable and even if i am that days a long way off right i mean im inexperienced weak im nothing compared to my father
im not so sure about that when i look at you i see a young man full of promise commander greil is a great man but i think youll be every bit his equalin time you might even surpass him
dont be ridiculous
its just my opinion you need not pay it any mind yet if you fear your own weakness why not take this chance to go out and better yourself that would be more in keeping with your personality no
i suppose youre right
how did things look over there soren
same as here there are corpses strewn everywhere there are quite a lot of them especially when you consider how far we are from the capital
are they crimean
 judging by the armor the vast majority of the dead are daein soldiers
so crimea has the upper hand
just the opposite i think the crimean soldiers were members of the imperial guard that means king ramon–or another member of the royal family–was on the move when daein soldiers fell on them
could it have been lord renning
no as long as the crimean army still draws breath lord renning will not leave their command perhaps another member of the court 
weve got daein soldiers moving in on our location and they dont look happy
you there who are you what are you doing here
were no one you need–
youre armed heed me drop your weapons and surrender act quickly or else
listen to me fool youre making a mistake were not 
ah not going to cooperate eh ready your weapons men move in and kill them all
tsk headstrong fools
getting caught up in some skirmish is not art of the plan 
but theyre obviously not going to listen to us greil mercenaries get ready to fight
all right ike lets see how you handle the role of captain well what are your orders boy well do what you say so long as you hurry up and spit it out
i know i know im thinking give me a moment will you shinon
bah useless wed be better led with mist than this soft untested whelp
lets see were in the middle of the road and theres not much cover soren and rhys are vulnerable so we have to protect them from enemy attacks right
thats a sound strategy ike i can attack from behind your defenses good thinking
do you mean that um all right lets do that then
grrr blasted mercenaries theyre better than i expected even so theyll not prove a match for daeins finest
gwaa haa wretched curs you will regret your decision to oppose daein 
bah youre nothing more than a bunch of ragtag sellswords who are you to oppose daein you are so terribly ignorant of your position in this world
you refused to listen to us and then you attacked without provocation is this the way of the daein army
youre a cheeky little monkey arent you once youre dead youll regret sassing me
a mage eh ill have to keep my guard up around you no matter how young you look
you forced this combat we cannot allow you to return home are you ready to die
ive fought the crimean army before the imperial guard has some skill but the rest are a poor joke which will you prove to be hmm perhaps youll offer me some entertainment after all
if you attacked us because you thought we were with the crimean army you made a mistake i left my post years ago now im nothing more than a common mercenary
that means nothing to me youre not of daein youre armed and youre here its our job to destroy you simple wouldnt you say come dog prepare yourself
id just as soon avoid this bloodshed but that seems unlikely if thats the way it is ill not hold back
did we suffer any casualties
any wounded or dead no excellent well done
i dont know taking out these daein soldiers may have been a bad move um hey shinon what are you doing
this swines got some nice weapons besides he aint gonna complain he wont need them where hes going
shinon
get ahold of yourself we cant afford such behavior right now steal from the dead on your own time
what you judgmental little–
soren shinon stop this at once this is no place for us to waste time bickering amongst ourselves
lets clear out of here we have to tell the commander what happened
lets take this road we should be able to cut through the forest and huh
something wrong
no as i said this road 
wait ike i just saw something move on the far side of that thicket
a wounded soldier perhaps lets go have a look careful now
oh no 
did you find anything rhys
 its a woman 
leave her we shouldnt get involved in matters that dont concern us
oooh 
thank goodness it looks like shes merely fainted
right wed better take her with us for now and make sure shes all right give me a hand will you rhys
of course
 i dont like this 
/***EOF***/
whats wrong ike done already come on son youll never beat me with that attitude
ha ha ha think youre as stubborn as your mule headed father
ike grow up big and strong i believe youve got the makings of a great warrior
 father this isnt a dream is it this  this is all real
mist the suns going down and its getting cold come on lets go
 
mist
oh oh ike sniff 
mist 
 w why why
i was at his side but i couldnt save him im sorry
 sniff 
its  its so unreal 
dads gone  hes gone ike sniff and i dont i dont know what to do 
dont worry im here
bro brother 
ill lead the company in fathers stead and ill protect you all you the princess everyone ill protect you youll see
brother ike  no 
mist
i wont allow it  i cant lose you dont you see if you go then ill be all alone i wont allow it
im not going anywhere i promise you mist 
commander greil why is this happening why is any of this happening why now first crimea and now you 
 
ike 
oh ike wheres mist
shes resting in her room rhys and rolf are with her
thats good she needs to sleep shes been through too much we all have you should rest too ike
ill be all right grief wont bring my father back to life
i know ive been a burden on the both of you titania soren i just need to thank you both for staying here with me
not at all 
theres no need dont trouble yourself
so where is everyone
ike to tell the truth 
yes
boyd and i are back
how did it go
i cant believe it they just left and they didnt take one look back heartless scum ill never forgive them
boyd whats going on
ike are you all right
im fine tell me whats happened start talking
well uh its what i mean to say is uh 
shinon and gatrie have left us
soren
what theres nothing to hide is there
they left both of them why did they–oh i see they left because of me didnt they
ike 
titania told us you were going to be the new commander shinon just about exploded he and gatrie left not long ago
we went after them we tried to talk things out but it was a waste of time
we all knew that ike was going to inherit command of the company didnt we it just happened sooner than we wanted it was greils decision if some of us arent satisfied with that theres no reason we should stop them from leaving as far as losing fighting strength is concerned we can solve that by adding new members
how can you say that after all the battles weve been through together how can you say that
forgive me ike i wasnt able to stop any of this 
its not your fault titania they did what they felt they had to do they didnt want to lose their lives to an inexperienced commander
ike dont talk about yourself like that
im not saying that to gain anyones pity its the truth but even so i have no intention of giving up command of this company
ike then what will you–
im going to follow my fathers wishes im going to assume command if everyone will accept me thats what id like to do
of course
id already made up my mind thats what i was going to do all along
what so now you want me to start calling you boss is that it well i can do that boss it is
im in too
rhys
mists asleep i know i missed most of the conversation but i have a good idea of what youve been discussing commander ike yes it does have a nice ring to it
what about you soren
 ike im not sure what help i could be to you what place is there for me in a mercenary company anyway
you are so weird ive always depended on you havent i i need your tactical knowledge i need your objectivity youre not going to leave me are you soren
dont worry ill be here watching over you
thank you i know im not as experienced as most of you im going to make some mistakes but ill try not to let you down
well youre going to have a lot to learn about being commander im glad youre serious because its a lot of work
tell me everything
first youll need to understand company expenditures then well talk about ensuring that everyone is properly outfitted and we cant forget the need to gather good intelligence oh and youll want to know everyones abilities and relationships
uh huh 
earlier i spoke with a merchant caravan thats taken refuge here in the castle they fled crimea at the same time we did i told them who we are and they asked if they could travel with us i think theyre worried about protection from daein in exchange theyve offered us a good rate on items and weapons theyll also buy items and forge weapons for us
uh huh 
they also said we could use their wagons to store our goods thats one more worry off our minds
uh huh 
so anyway–
titania
yes
i know i said tell me everything but this is too much i cant keep up maybe i shouldnt learn everything in one sitting can you show me the ropes along the way is that all right
oh yes of course sorry i got a bit carried away
ill take over for now why dont you get some rest
im all right 
you worry too much get some rest thats an order ill do my best to manage
yes commander
good morning ike how are things going does everything look good
thats not what i think is it
if im not imagining things thats a squad of daein soldiers why do they have to show up now
what gives were inside gallias borders arent we they must be out of their minds to pursue us this far
if theyve come this far im sure getting out of here alive was never one of their priorities
 
were in trouble they have us completely surrounded we cannot escape
so many of them and so few of us it doesnt look good does it
doesnt matter we have to fight greil mercenaries ready yourselves
yes sir
ill begin formulating a strategy immediately
ike brother
mist i want you and rolf to go in the back and hide
but ike 
just do it now everything will be fine but i need you to do this all right
mm all right be careful 
 its happening again my medallions glowing

i was traveling with some merchants but we got separated i came here to escape this rain but some soldiers in black found me they thought i was a crimean refugee
oh
i tried to tell them who i was but they wouldnt believe me they said they would put me to the sword if i didnt help fight you im very sorry 
dont apologize you didnt have any choice if it had been me id have done the same but listen i think ive seen the merchant convoy you were traveling with in the castle there was a weapons vendor named muston and i think a woman named aimee sold items 
thats them oh thats incredible are they all unharmed where are they
theyre fine theyre fine in fact weve all come to an agreement and theyre traveling with us now i dont see any reason we should go on fighting if youre with them we can protect you from daein
youre right yes would you please allow me to join your company too
that sounds fine ilyana this is a dangerous place go ahead and seek safety within the castle well hold off the enemy troops
no ill fight too
but youre sick youll need some help
this isnt the full force of daein soldiers more of them are waiting in the forest you need me
 well i wish you werent right but it sounds like we will need your help
im just glad to get away from those awful black clad soldiers
what they still resist impossible fight dogs  focus and press forward
urgh aaa glory to to daein

princess elincias newly formed crimean army with ike as its commander marches to tor garen and claims its first victory tor garen is a vast wall guarding daeins border manned by battalions of well trained soldiers it was long thought impenetrable yet the strength of the crimean army under general ikes leadership far outstrips daeins expectations and tor garen falls learning of gallias increasing interest in the war ike wastes no time ordering his troops further into the heart of daein the gears of history which had come to a halt with the fall of crimea slowly creak to life once more 
naesala king naesala of kilvas i would speak with you now
oh if it isnt general petrine what brings you up to these frosty mountain peaks
ive no time for pleasantries is it true has crimeas army breached tor garen
though i am loathe to report it this appears to be the case
bah kayachey you worthless dog being defeated by that girls motley band just proves how useless he was
surely its not the generals fault alone he was told that crimeas army was weak and that tor garen was impregnable and yet he was defeated id say that someone severely underestimated our enemy wouldnt you
what was that do you dare to insult daein crow men have forfeited their lives for less
insult daein never come now general petrine im merely stating the facts regardless of the previous battles outcome crimeas army will be stopped here i will be taking the field myself
 hmph sounds like youve set the stage for a grand performance
general petrine kilvas will always stand at daeins side  as long as we receive our payment of course
if gold is all it takes then may our friendship never end see to it that your performance warrants such consideration homasa come here
yes
work with king kilvas and put a stop to crimeas army no screw ups or else
leave it to me general
i will not suffer another failure king kilvas you must finish them and do so quickly are we clear arrr i am sick to death of being made a fool by that crimean floozy and her pathetic band of sellswords
and the remaining portion of my fee
dont worry we have it ready youll get paid when the job is done
as long as were clear on that point everythings settled well then im off
dogs breath even by half breed standards those crows are complete scum give that one even the smallest opening and hell steal the eyes from your skull what an untrustworthy wretch
so general there look to be a lot of enemy soldiers ahead mostly daein but there are some crows from kilvas as well
more than our last fight
yeah theres a lot but the most troubling thing is that king kilvas is with them
the crow king himself is cooperating with daein
yep and compared to the other crows the king is in a class by himself obviously hes no match for our king but  anyway you should move carefully
 general ike i hear the sound of many wings ahead it would seem kilvas soldiers have joined the troops of daein for this fight
is kilvass contingent larger than the what we faced in the last battle
there are many  but what causes me more concern is the voice of king kilvas
the king himself is cooperating with daein
yes and compared to the other crows the king is in a class by himself we must be cautious
an entire unit under the command of king kilvas i think that bodes ill for us
the outcome of the battle hinges on how we deal with them
 
kilvas soldiers hm as fellow bird tribe laguz what can you tell us about them
please dont lump us together with those carrion birds
were not partial to the crows
 
as you know we are outmanned by the daein troops is there any way to get the ravens to withdraw that would be a tremendous help
 well suppose i could go meet with king kilvas  if i had to i dont think that my speaking to him is going to make a difference though
if you like we will try but dont expect anything to come of it
no matter the circumstance i will never again speak to a crow
no matter what we decide sitting here like this is giving the enemy more time to prepare
youre right come on lets get moving
sir the crimean army has arrived
i hope they are prepared to pass into oblivion for this will be their final resting place
crimean stragglers joined with an army on loan from begnion ive even heard they have a betrayer in their midst and yet they still march on  what an odd group but as long as kilvas stands at the side of daein they have no future ah i suppose theyre just unlucky
it appears the enemy has spotted us
well a group this large is hard to miss
how will you proceed
no tricks nothing fancy well hit them from the front  fast and hard
im sure youre already aware of this but if you dont do something about kilvas youre at a disadvantage
yes ive heard about the ravens  but even so its not as if we can turn tail and run away
now that i think on it king kilvas and prince reyson used to be close friends did you ask him to speak to the king
he was most emphatic in his refusal it seems that naesala was responsible for reysons capture at the hands of duke tanas i cant really blame him
and the hawks they too are of the bird tribes surely some connection can be found there
they werent very excited about the suggestion
you could command them to do it
theres an antagonism between the tribes that we dont understand id rather not force the issue trying to coerce them into it would be unfair i will let them do as they please
that is so very like you however giving orders that are unpopular is often necessary when one is in command and  
maybe so but i can only do things the best i know how my own way
come its time to go
you 
king kilvas you egg stealing snake
one of tibarns flock eh you are his eyes if im not mistaken
its not enough that you sold the white prince to humans now youre fighting against laguz
you hawks rescued reyson didnt you so everything worked out in the end whats the problem
id like you to repeat those words to the princes face
reyson is here here why
he supports the crimean army the beorc leading this army helped him to escape serenes forest
helped him are you saying a human came to the aid of reyson a laguz
yes and he rescued princess leanne too
leanne is alive
dont play the fool you know the life of the forest has returned that was their power at work
i see thats how the forest of course
listen up crow you need to fly over there and talk to the prince if you dont do it im gonna know that you really are the enemy and report that back to king tibarn think it over
yes  mmm what to do
you 
king kilvas why have you decided to make the laguz your enemy
one of tibarns flock eh you are his ears if im not mistaken
why did you sell prince reyson to a beorc
you hawks rescued reyson didnt you so everything worked out in the end whats the problem
would you repeat your words to prince reyson himself
reyson is here here why
the beorc leading this army helped him to escape serenes forest
helped him are you saying a human came to the aid of reyson a laguz
that is what i say he also rescued princess leanne
leanne is alive
she was asleep for all these years the forest protected her their voices brought the forest back to life
of course so thats how 
why dont you try speaking to prince reyson if you do that perhaps king tibarns rage will burn less brightly
tibarns rage eh hmm mmm 
reyson
 
hey reyson look at you you look sharp kid
go away 
oh so you can talk
you  how dare you show your face to me
well i have been called brazen before some have gone so far as to say shameless come on at least let me give you a reason
begone my ears are closed to you
reyson were friends are we not
oh yes friends in fact were such good friends that you sold me to that foul bloated man
i didnt really sell you besides i planned on rescuing you right away you were just impatient and flew away on your own so  
are you blaming me
no no well maybe  i mean it was i who was in the wrong on all accounts
 
no one was hurt in the end come on smooth those ruffled feathers all right
leanne is alive
yes tibarns attendant told me thats wonderful news when he sees her face im sure king lorazieh will begin to feel better at once things are really looking up arent they reyson
 i suppose that  if you hadnt deceived me and taken me to the forest  we might not have discovered her  so i will forgive you just this once
reyson oh thats  
with conditions will you accept them
 what are they
pull your troops from this battle now and never again enter into combat against your fellow laguz
oh come now reyson thats asking too much  
what will you do then will you continue to fight the crimean army to which im in service
very well you win reyson ill leave and take my soldiers with me however i cannot say what the future will bring i have the fate of my nation to consider after all
hmm  very well
so were friends again come to kilvas for a visit will you nealuchi will be so pleased
ill do that when this war is over leanne and i will both come
oh and as for tibarn 
ill speak with him theres no need for you to worry
thank you farewell and watch yourself this is war you know
oh i almost forgot ive got something for you call it an im sorry present
eh whats this supposed to be
its a human trinket its called a knight ring
something made by beorc
dont make such a disgusted face i tried it and it proved to be quite useful
understood ill take it for now
dont get killed reyson if anything were to happen to you  nealuchi would never let me hear the end of it
naesala  thank you
listen to me darkwings we of kilvas are leaving turn at once and head for home
kilvas has betrayed us
i think abandoned would be more accurate but  
idiot its the same thing aaaargh accursed sub humans we should never have trusted them
my sword is lightning do you think you can follow its dance
 the shame 
oh ho black wings among humans these are considered bad omens are they not then take these omens as fact and let them herald you to the afterlife
n no  this cannot be is this my fate what of kilvas  
guaa  i was careless and youre better than expected to me my brethren we leave at once
king naesala the daein army has been routed
how nice what a lot of braggarts they turned out to be very well let us withdraw as well
are you sure if we retreat now what will general petrine say
promises made to humans are worth less than a dead snake forget about her losing the remainder of our payment stings but still  you cant buy your life back can you
good point well made sir
fly my darkwings we return to kilvas
we won somehow
its because you did an excellent job of driving off the ravens
yeah if we had continued to fight them we would have suffered more casualties than this i must extend thanks to reyson
my lord ike im pleased to see you well you havent been injured have you
princess elincia im fine im unharmed
oh thats good 
ike may i have a word and if you dont mind princess elincia would you join us as well please join me in that building
what could it be
lets go see
this is 
holy 
incredible no its gold all of it
daein must be filthy rich theres so much it doesnt even seem real what do we do with it
its the spoils of war so naturally its ours
in that case id like to borrow fifty thousand would that be all right
thats a lot of money what are you planning on doing
its a private matter 
i apologize commander youre not a child theres no reason for me to pry
 
no if i may borrow the fifty thousand that will be more than  
you wont borrow it youll accept it and in good faith the remainder well give to soren for company maintenance would that be all right princess elincia
yes of course
grrr 
um general p petrine p please general im just a m messenger h however i have to tell you  
i already heard you dunderhead i hated those filthy crows right from the start even so to be betrayed in such a fashion  grrr  someone will pay for this oh you certainly had your way with us didnt you king kilvas but if you want to make an enemy of daein then so be it once gallias fallen well turn our attention to your puny nation and wipe it off the face of the world
 
why are you still there do you find me amusing shall i make my lance dance for you
n no maam no never n not at all i beg your pardon so sorry  ill be going now 
dogs breath i need something a brilliant plan  if this continues much longer the king will have my head
you wanted to see me
youve waited a long time take this its the gold you were promised
finally scraped it together eh ill gladly accept it
arent you going to count it
theres no need ill trust you
all right then ill take what was promised the report you wrote for my father
there isnt one
what
there is no report never was
you lied to me you exploited my need to know more about my father
there is something i must tell you however it could not be written down it is too great of a secret for that your father told me to wait until i thought you were mature enough to hear it and then to tell you myself
mature then what was the fifty thousand gold for
ah the gold that was my idea i thought it would be a good way to test how resourceful and responsible you were
get started i want to hear it all
ive spent a long time as greils hired shadow a long time i remained hidden from sight in case the day ever arrived that i needed to fulfill my contract  all that time for one job
what was it
if greil were ever to go berserk i was to stop him i was to take his life
what
actually there was one other thing if greil were ever slain by his pursuers  i was to watch over his son and tell him greils secret at an appropriate time that was my job
berserk  what are you talking about why would you have to kill my father
because of lehrans medallion
what medallion what are you talking about
the medallion your sister carries
huh that old bronze thing i thought it was just a keepsake of my mothers  are you telling me that its something more
greil told me it was an object of great peril but nothing more i did some investigating on my own though and what i discovered surprised me
tell me
lehran was one of the heron clan an ancestor of our prince reyson who  carried with him a bronze medallion long long ago a band of heroes defeated an evil god and imprisoned it therein
an evil god do you think this is funny you are joking arent you
unfortunately im not and ive no idea how the cursed thing came to be in greils possession that being said i do know that the men who hunted your father were actually seeking the medallion why they wanted it and what they planned to do with it  just thinking about it gives me chills
im finding all of this a little hard to believe you said the medallion was an object of great peril didnt you then why would my father allowmist to carry it around that doesnt make any sense
its because she can carry it safely actually shes the only one who can if you want proof think back have you ever once touched it
 no i havent a long time ago i remember reaching out for it while mist had it in her hand  my father scolded me harshly after that i assumed it was my sisters alone and i never reached for it again
compared to other people the balance within your sister is extremely strong your mother it seems was the same thats why they could bear it safely the medallion is like a strong poison it takes the worst aspects of a person and magnifies them a thousandfold greil touched it only once and it drove him to complete madness
so thats what you meant when you said he went berserk
thats right beorc and laguz are made up of two forces balance and chaos in this there is no difference between us it is the proportion of balance to chaos that determines how much the medallion affects a person in that sense it predicts how much harm that person might do
your father was one of the preeminent swordsmen of his generation that day after he touched the medallion twenty soldiers had come for him twenty highly trained killers your father barely broke a sweat cutting them down then he began attacking his neighbors those who had taken him in concealed his identity and called him friend he slew them one by one until your mother rushed in thinking only to save her husband from himself
it was over in an instant your mother grabbed the medallion from his hand and stepped away from him they say she smiled as he pulled his sword from her breast and forgave him as her lifes blood spilled into the street
my father killed my mother no that cant be 
it was the medallion its power is too great for any man even one of your fathers caliber me you if either of us touched it im certain that we both would have been consumed by madness when your father regained his senses he tracked me down it seems hed heard rumors of me some time before he said he had need of someone like me closemouthed skilled and most importantly willing to do any sort of work of course after hearing what he wanted me to do i turned him down greil was once a famed general  he was sir gawain one of daeins four riders and i recognized him at once there was no chance someone like me would ever be able to stop him
but you took the job anyway why did you change your mind
greil had lost his wife and his grief was overpowering to keep anything like that from happening again he crippled himself he slashed the tendons in his sword hand so that he could not wield a sword again i took the job only because he had become someone my skill could handle and even then he was still far stronger than most men 
i  i dont know what to say 
that is greils secret as i know it i now entrust to you the responsibility of seeing that the medallion does not fall into the wrong hands your sister must keep it
 as my father lay dying he told me to forget everything and live in peace what did he mean
he didnt want you to lose yourself and go hunting for revenge i suppose he was killed much much sooner than he ever expected to be
so my fathers dying wish was for me to protect the medallion if i can do that everything will be all right
i believe so at the very least that must take precedent over everything else
i understand
well then my work here is done
 
whatever you decide to do now is up to you
if i call can i count on your assistance again
if im not busy with anything else i might agree to work for you again farewell
father 
oh one last thing
what is it
do you want to hire me in the event that you go berserk someday if we make a deal now you wont have to worry about it anymore as for payment  i can take it out of the fifty thousand you just gave me what do you say
please
thats a wise decision and in that case i no longer need to conceal my true identity
huh
im not really a thief im an assassin from now on ill take on any job youve got no matter how dirty
father  mother  oh why 
bye see ya later
yep oh mist watch your step its slippery 
whooooa
mist
ow i landed right on my butt hee hee this snows cold
be careful
all righty hey watch jill im gonna make a snow angel wheeee
 it must be nice to be so cheerful
jill
 whos there
its me
captain haar b but this is an enemy camp
ive been trying to track you down ever since you disappeared at toha i figured you were off chasing after the crimeans i never imagined that you would join up with them
at first it was just circumstance but  but now its different now im with them because i want to be spending time with them  and coming into contact with laguz  has shown me what a fool ive been
laguz i never thought i would hear that word from someone who once said sub human with such absolute hatred sounds like youve had some good experiences with this happy little band
i knew that if anyone would understand it would be you captain
so youre forming your own set of values for the first time thats good thats very very good but what are you planning to do now if you keep moving forward youre going to face general shiharam before long
causing trouble for my father was never my intent however as a member of this army i will face him with my shoulders straight and my head held high
so youre determined to see this through
i am
so be it then theres nothing left to be said farewell the next time we meet it will be as enemies prepare yourself  and get some rest you know how important it is
 
ike can i talk to you a few minutes ago a man ive never seen before showed up and spoke to jill i wasnt sure what was going on so i went and found you w what should we do whatever theyre talking about it sure looks serious
jill trained in the daein army fighting against her countrymen will be tough no matter how prepared she thinks she is
i dont care what happens you cant let her fight against her own father all right ike
hmmm it might not be a bad idea to keep her at the base camp just while were in daein
what do you think guys are we going to be able to perform a new special attack
i think we might i was looking through some old scrolls on fighting techniques and i found one that looks perfect
awesome nice work
what is it what is it come on tell us how it works
well if we want to learn it there are some things well have to do
aw dang i hope its not all technical cause i wont be able to keep up just summarize it will you
i can do that all right the most important thing is we all have to use the same weapon so if all three of us can use a bow thatll be one problem out of the way
a bow you and i have to use bows
boyd are you even listening to me yes we all have to use the same weapon thats part of the deal
crud nothing we can do about it i guess you better not slow us down rolf you little brat
stop calling me a brat im a better archer than you if anyone slows us down itll be you boyd
what did you say im gonna  
knock it off boyd your skills with a bow arent as polished as rolfs anyone can see that which means that even if rolf has some natural skill whoever taught him the fundamentals was an expert archer 
yeah i know but he just keeps blabbering this nonsense about how he taught himself
i  i did teach myself im a prodigy
well judging by your stance and the way you hold the bow i think we all know the real story
eeep
huh what is it what real story
oscar no shhh
 the story  that rolfs lucky to have a genius like me for a brother thats what
aw stop messing around this is getting stupid
whew 
whatre you guys talking about
the three of you have been huddled up here for a while now what are you scheming
shh um  uh  hi ike
scheming is such an ugly word were just  
oh hey ike were working on this special man  
yaaaaaaaaa
gaaa i forgot something 
oooo gotta go 
sorry about that ike hes been acting a bit odd these days
really seems to me that youre the odd one in the bunch
um sure all right do us a favor though and make sure the three of us are all in the next battle
sure i guess thats fine but why
well its a surprise thats all well show you later im sure youll like it come on we cant be standing around all day lets go oscar rolf
special man hmm  man  mandolin manicotti manifesto oh who cares
brrr  ill take on any number of enemies but this snow is another story i think my beautiful wings are icing over
that sounds like trouble are you going to be able to fly
 yes of course i can fly these wings arent for looks you know theyre made of flesh and blood and feathers its not like im some animal that has to hibernate when winter rolls in sheesh cant you beorc tell the difference between comic exaggeration and serious conversation
um  oh i was supposed to laugh was i sorry about that
oh my such sincerity this is unexpected it looks like someone taught you manners
er 
by the way ive been meaning to ask what are our chances for victory
were still at an extreme disadvantage
what thats not the answer i wanted you gotta do better than that beorc general im here if we lose how am i ever going to show my face in phoenicis again
were at a disadvantage but i dont intend to lose theres a man in daein that i need to find and i will be the last thing that he sees
ha ha well said i wish you could repeat that to todays younger generation there are some weaklings back home that i dont even want to call hawks id love to stick em back in their eggs and start over from scratch
hey you hatch from eggs eh
i was speaking figuratively you know like a metaphor we havent hatched from eggs for many generations now silly beorc  all right im outta here i gotta warm up the ol wings before battle or who knows what might happen
i figured that egg thing was a joke but i had no idea it ever really happened bird tribes  go figure
excuse me do you have a moment
 oh general ike what is it
its nothing really i just thought id say hello
thats considerate
um  your king is very generous isnt he and its not just reyson im talking about he left us his two retainers as well
 how do we pertain to the kings generosity
i guess its because reyson kept apologizing  i just thought that  am i misinterpreting something
i dont know but i know that the king can survive without our help
is that true thats pretty amazing ive been given the title of lord but i still cant run this army on my own titania and soren handle all the little details and thats what keeps us from collapsing into chaos
our king does nothing special everyone just does whats needed there is no chaos
hes really trusted isnt he
thats natural in laguz society the strongest become king unlike the beorc kingship is not tied to blood so we have no weak kings im sorry  perhaps that was improper
no i agree with you choosing a ruler by strength instead of birth makes much more sense
when we face begnion troops we target the units with weak leadership and eliminate them first beorc weapons can be very powerful but not everyone wields them well since beorc also choose generals by bloodlines their competency is uneven and that is a weakness of beorc armies as for you general ike the time to prove yourself is approaching
its true no matter how strong the individuals are that strength is worthless if theyre weak as a unit an armys power comes from leadership and management  thats good to remember thanks
mmm
