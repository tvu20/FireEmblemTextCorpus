That night, he sleeps until well past dawn. It is the first time since Greil's death that he has done so. The crimean army and its laguz allies have passed the trial of Nados Castle. At last, they've arrived at their final destination: the Crimean capital. Yet the opponent that awaits them is none other than Ashnard, king of Daein. If they lose here, all of their hardships will have been for naught. Preparations for the attack proceed with the utmost care. The final battle is approaching. An air of exaltation pervades the camp, but Ike remains focused on the road ahead, readying himself for what is to come."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "It appears that Leanne is being held in Gritnea Tower, to the south. That's right, isn't it, Ena?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "Yes. That is correct."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "How do you know that?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "I was searching for information, and that search led me to a troop of Daein soldiers that had been assigned to the tower. It was the extra knowledge I needed."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You won't tell me any more than that, will you? No matter how important it might be to our upcoming fight."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "...I beg your pardon."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I figured as much. I've already decided to trust you, so all that's left to do is move out."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That's Gritnea Tower, right?"}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "I believe so."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Say, Ike... There's something...really odd about that tower... Sniff...I mean REALLY odd..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I sense several of the beast tribe, but...what is that? ...Sniff... Ugh! Something smells terrible!"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "The tower holds laguz who have been given toxins, foul potions that warp their true shape."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are you talking about the laguz that can't change forms? Like the ones we fought in Begnion?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "...Yes."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Do you know how many and what type are in there?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "As far as numbers...a conservative estimate would be thirty. Types? There are tigers and cats from the beast tribes, hawks and ravens from the bird tribes, and...dragons..."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "There are some from the dragon tribes as well?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "No more than ten. Er...Probably no more than ten..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We have to fight ten dragons like you?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "They are not like me, Master Ike. They are much stronger."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...That's hardly encouraging..."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Regardless, we must hurry. It's going to be dark soon. It's rather embarrassing, but we of the bird tribes don't move well in the dark."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Sad but true. Of course, the same can be said for those on the enemy side as well."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "On the other hand, darkness means next to nothing for my kind. Depending on who we face, it could prove to be a significant--"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "There are more of the beast tribe than any other. It is because we are close to Gallia."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Listen, you... Are you sure you want to be on our side?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "...Hm? Yes, of course. That is why I provide accurate information."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Nasir!"}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "What do you think, Ranulf? My grandchild is impressive, is she not?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "That's not what I was going to say, Grandpa--"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So once it gets dark, we're going to be at a disadvantage. Right? All right, as long as we know that, we can plan for it."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "You're too calm about this for my tastes. This is going to be a--"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Enough, Ranulf! We don't have time for complaints. We need to find the entrance to the tower."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Yeah, yeah. I'm coming."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Look at this, will you? What a glorious mix of birds, beasts, and dragons we have to greet us."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "King of hawks! This is no joking matter! They--"}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Hold on, my brothers. Just a little longer. Soon, I will grant you all release."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Oh..."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Tibarn is not the only one who is filled with rage.

Yaaaaa!!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Prince Reyson..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Come, Ranulf, let's join them. We must rescue Leanne as soon as possible...for Reyson's sake as much as anything else."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Those poor laguz... Someone will die for this today!"}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(...Ahh? ...Where am I...)"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Whee hee hee! It appears that she's finally coming around!"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "We brought this girl here on direct orders from His Majesty. Simple stuff, yes? Very easy, very nice. Then he gives all these special commands! Don't let her escape. Don't let her get sick. Don't let people kill her...More than anyone else, His Highness should know how hard it is to keep one of these birdies healthy..."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Is there a problem?"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Eh? Who do you think you are? Why is it you disturb my meditations! I'm thinking here!"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Um... I'm here to relieve you on guard duty."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Standing guard, eh? Don't see much reason for a guard in this place. But armies always have all their rules and regulations and appearances and hullabaloo...Ah, no way around it, I suppose."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "I believe that guards and watches are important."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Wheee! In other places, yes. But Gritnea Tower is currently overflowing with veteran soldiers. Not to mention those repulsive beasts...Those Feral Ones, you know? Trying to escape from this place is the same as committing suicide! Not that I've tried, mind you."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "So a watch is necessary."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Hmmm? Wheee! What's that now? Who said that?! Oh, it's you. Important, eh? Why's that?"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Weeell...if the girl were to leave her room, we would be unable to stop her from getting killed."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Ooo! You found a blind spot! That's the problem with us scholars! We concentrate on one thing and miss something as fundamental as--"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Blast! They're getting riled up again... Listen, you! You stay right here and stand guard. Don't let that heron girl take one step outside this room! Do you understand me? Wheee! I told you we needed guards!"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "...Sigh... Don't worry. I'll take care of everything."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Bah! Always when I'm in the middle of something... Snaggle-toothed, cheese-stealing..."}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Finally! Methinks that guy fell a little far from the nest...Hello, little heron girl. There's nothing to be afraid of. I won't hurt you. Just sit there and be quiet, all right?"}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(Where is..this place? Who are you.....?)"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "That took longer than I'd expected. Cursed sub-humans...flea-bitten wretches...Huh? Where's the heron girl? And the...guard? Helloooo? Guard? Bird girl? Wheeeeee? This can't... NO! I've been had! Nooooooooo! What do I do? If this is discovered, His Majesty will... He'll hang me up by my thumbs! Oh, no... Oooooh noooo...! No, no, no! I will not report this!Um... Uh... Think, Izuka, think! Hmmm...If I can somehow divert attention from myself..."}, {"speaker": "Unknown", "line": "Master Izuka!"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Gyaaaa!"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Master Izuka! We've got trouble! A strange group of insurgents approaches the tower! They are well armed, sir!...Master Izuka?"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Eh? Insurgents? Wheeee-- Um... Ahem! Did you say insurgents have appeared?"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Yes, sir! A mixed group of sub-humans and humans."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Ah... I see, I see. Then we must give them a warm reception, no?"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "General Heddwyn's mages have engaged them, but they're not nearly enough. We must apply to the capital for more reinforcements to--"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Release the Feral Ones."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Th-those monsters? But..."}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "No need to worry. I have just given them their medication. They've all been trained not to attack any Daein soldiers."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "V-very well, I--"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "Do it now! The enemy must not be allowed inside the tower."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Y-yes, sir!"}, {"speaker": "Izuka", "line": "...Feh feh feh! Wheeeeeeee!!! What fortuitous timing. Now then, I will take this moment and prepare to make my escape."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "...Whew. I thought as much when I first snuck in here, but this really is an unbelievable place. What in Ashera's name is going on? Why are all these crazed laguz creeping about?"}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(I hate this!)"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Hm? Oh, you don't like this, eh? Neither do I. This helmet and armor are horribly restrictive, you know?"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "How's that, Leanne? It's been twenty years, but I'm still quite an eyeful. Don't you agree?"}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(You're very handsome, Naesala.)"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Yeah, I haven't changed much, eh? And you knew it was me back there right away, didn't you? Ah, I'm glad you survived. It's very good to see you again."}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(Yes..I am also pleased.)"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Now, on to the problem at hand. We went to the trouble of escaping that tower, so I'd hate to end up a meal for one of our insane cousins. Our objective is to rendezvous with Nealuchi. Here we go, Leanne.

This will work out nicely..."}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "Ne-nestling!! We've found you at last!"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Nealuchi! You're here sooner than expected. You pushed your old wings to the limit, didn't you?"}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "I couldn't be late to the rescue of the dear lady Leanne, now could I?"}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(Nealuchi! You came for me, too?)"}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "Oh! What a glorious sight...You look so much like your dear, departed mother...Sniff..."}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(Don't cry, Nealuchi!)"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Hey, save your tears for later. While Tibarn and the others take care of the enemy, we must escape."}, {"speaker": "Nealuchi", "line": "Y-yes, of course! This way!"}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Heddwyn", "line": "This is not good...

I don't want there to be any misunderstandings here. It was Tibarn! He forced me to do this. It wasn't any sense of charity or anything.

Excellently done."}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Flatter me all you like, hawk king. You'll get nothing in return.

Enough of your nonsense. I prefer to keep my life intact, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Leanne", "line": "(Naesala, are you leaving?)"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Listen to me, Leanne.

At one time, they were...laguz..."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I hope Ranulf and the others are all right.

I'm glad you weren't there."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Was it that bad?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It was barbaric beyond description... There were more laguz corpses than we could count...They had been tortured. Twisted and warped beyond all recognition."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Ah...such horrors..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Why would Ashnard do such things? What could be his purpose here?"}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "...The king called powerful beorc to his cause. But he had to see if they were worthy. He would test them by pitting them against those laguz. Ashnard considers laguz to be tools in service to his own mad ends. Nothing more. They are instruments to be used as he sees fit. I heard that he  ordered his scholars to perform all kinds of experiments...They used elixirs to drive them mad and keep them locked in their changed states...Their life spans were much shortened, but for a brief time, they became extremely powerful...they..."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...Thank you for telling us. Thanks to you, we found Leanne. You're free now. You can do whatever you like."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "...I will go to the capital. Please accept me into your army."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You don't have to do that.

If not for your instruction, Tanith...This would not be possible."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Training new recruits has long been my duty.

Isn't that so, Marcia?"}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Great Demon? Mutton chops, no! D-don't be silly! We all adored our sincere and devoted deputy commander. Great Demon. Pfff! More like Great...uh...Angel...Lady..."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Ha! Sure. Seriously though, you've improved so much, Princess... Perhaps we should try something special..."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "What? N-not that! She's not ready for that! You're crazy!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Tanith, I...I'm not sure that I'm ready..."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Listen to me, Princess. The foes we are facing are Daein's elite troops, led by King Ashnard himself. How do you expect to fight them without at least one killing attack under your belt?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "You do it, Deputy Commander, and we'll keep practicing. Right, Princess Elincia?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I... I will try it."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Whaaaaat?!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I want...to grow stronger. To reach that goal, I will do whatever it takes."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Well spoken!
