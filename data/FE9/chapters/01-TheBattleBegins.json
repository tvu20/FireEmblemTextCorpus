Today\u2019s your first day as a professional soldier, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yeah, and I\u2019m ready to go."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "What you are is late. The others were suited up and ready at the break of dawn."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Sorry. I\u2019ll get up earlier from now on. So, what\u2019s my first job?"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "I\u2019m talking with Titania right now. Wait outside until we\u2019re done."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Very well, Commander Greil, shall we continue?"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "You were telling me about some bandits that needed taking care of, weren\u2019t you?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Correct. The request comes from a nearby village. According to our reports, the bandits are not all that strong. I think it best if I ride out and take a look. I plan on taking Oscar and Boyd along with me."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Just the brothers? Hm. Go ahead and add Ike to your team. Shinon, Gatrie, and I can handle the other two jobs easily enough. Titania, I\u2019m leaving Ike in your care. I\u2019m trusting you to show him the ropes."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Understood, Commander."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Come on, Ike. Let\u2019s get you set up."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "All right...My first job."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Captain Titania. Preparations are complete, and I\u2019m ready to go."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Impeccable timing. It\u2019s nice to know we can always count on you to be at the ready, Oscar."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Don\u2019t forget about me! I\u2019m ready for action!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Is that so, Boyd? That\u2019s a surprise."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Ha! Not today it isn\u2019t."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "As of today, I am going to be the absolute model of perfection. I need to set a good example for Ike!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I\u2019ll take your word for it."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Your first campaign at last. I know you\u2019ve wanted this for a while. Are you nervous,Ike?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I think I was more nervous last night. I could hardly sleep. This morning, I\u2019m feeling pretty good. It\u2019s the calm before the storm."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "You should try to relax. You\u2019re not going to be out there alone."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yeah, you\u2019re right."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Right. Everyone ready? Let\u2019s go."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "This is the village of Caldea. The bandits are few, but we mustn\u2019t get careless. Our goal is to take out the bandit leader in front of the large building, and then secure that building."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "All right, let me explain what\u2019s going on."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "This is a map of Caldea. They\u2019ve hired us to drive off some bandits. We\u2019re the blue marks here. The red marks are the bandits."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "There aren\u2019t many of them, but we can\u2019t get careless. The one in front of the building up north is their leader."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Our mission is to take him out and recapture that building."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Ike! Listen up! All this stuff is old news to me, but I can give a rookie like you a few tips. First off, don\u2019t let yourself get worked up and jump out in front of everyone. You\u2019ll just end up getting hurt."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Don\u2019t try to do too much, Ike. When things get dangerous, you can\u2013and should\u2013rely on us. As long as you watch how the enemy moves carefully, you\u2019ll be fine. Think of this as a training mission."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I\u2019ll do that. Oscar, Boyd, thanks for your help."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Don\u2019t mention it."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Just sit back and watch how a professional handles things!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Enough chitchat, you three! We\u2019ve got work to do!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Ike, before you engage an enemy, take a good look at his weapon. The weapon you use often determines who has the upper hand in a fight. For example, the axe I\u2019m wielding serves me well against lances, but it fares less well against swords."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "And my lance is great against swords but not against axes. And to complete the triangle..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Ah! My sword. It\u2019s strong against axes, but weak against lances. Right?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Yes, exactly. If you can remember that, you\u2019ll be more effective in combat."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "That\u2019s just the basics, though. This\u2019ll come in handy soon enough, so don\u2019t forget it."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Swords over axes...I won\u2019t forget. Not if I remember that I\u2019ll always have the advantage over you, Boyd."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Do you think you could maybe find a different way of remembering? Yeah, thanks."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "And one more thing...Don\u2019t forget to visit the locals. We\u2019re here to help, after all. The villagers should welcome our presence."}, {"speaker": "Zawanar", "line": "What\u2019s going on out there? Is that some sort of army? Pah. A bunch of mercenaries looking for their next meal. The villagers must\u2019ve hired \u2019em. Listen up, lads! Hurt \u2019em, and hurt \u2019em bad! We let this bunch live, and we\u2019ll have hordes of hired swords hounding us the rest of our days!"}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "It\u2019s those fool villagers...They think they can buy a bunch of sellswords to chase us away. It ain\u2019t gonna work out how they wanted. All they get for their trouble is a bunch of ruined houses. Tear\u2019em down, boys! That\u2019ll teach \u2019em!"}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "My work here is done. This house is totalled! Time to move on to bigger things. Now, I smash me some mercenaries."}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Zawanar", "line": "You looking for something, fool? You looking for a fight? Heh heh... You came to the right place. I\u2019ll give you a tussle!"}, {"speaker": "Zawanar", "line": "I...I\u2019m meant for better than this...I don\u2019t want to die here..."}, {"speaker": "Zawanar", "line": "Hey, you\u2019re nothing but a boy. Well, every brat needs a beating now and then. Are you ready for it?", "unit": "Ike", "boss": "Zawanar"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Not today.If you want to run away, now\u2019s your chance.", "unit": "Ike", "boss": "Zawanar"}, {"speaker": "Zawanar", "line": "Heh heh heh. Imagine that, you sassing me. Don\u2019t that beat all?", "unit": "Ike", "boss": "Zawanar"}], "character-falls": [{"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Despite my own warnings, I let my guard down, and I got beaten. Ha ha...urgh..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Titania, you shouldn\u2019t move."}], "end": [{"speaker": "Titania", "line": "That\u2019s the end of it. Ike, are you all right?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yeah, I\u2019ll be fine."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "You know, you surprised me. To think that you\u2019ve come so far."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Look at my father, though. I\u2019ve still got such a long way to go."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "There\u2019s nothing you can do about that. After all, Commander Greil is\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh? What about my father?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Oh, nothing."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Nothing? Now I\u2019m really curious."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll learn all about it someday."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Hey, Ike! that wasn\u2019t bad for your first battle. Not as flashy as my first time, though!"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Yeah, you were a real standout. I\u2019ll never forget the sight of you so keyed up you broke your own axe."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Oscar! Dang it! You didn\u2019t have to bring that up!"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Anyway, Ike. Congrats on finishing your first mission.Welcome to the group."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Everyone\u2019s all right? Then let\u2019s get going. I\u2019m sure Mist has a nice, hot meal waiting for us."}]}
