If we weren\u2019t being chased, I\u2019d strip off this armor here and now!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Then I\u2019m almost glad that we ARE being pursued. I suppose you\u2019ll have to grin and bear it, won\u2019t you?"}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "Hm, I suppose I will."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Right. So enough of your griping. You\u2019re merely wasting energy. Still, this heat is appalling."}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Dense forests such as these are not made for us delicate humans. The sub-humans love \u2019em, though."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "These...sub-humans...Are they really so different from us?"}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "What, you mean to tell me you\u2019ve never seen a beast-man before?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No, never."}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Well, I have. They\u2019re a hairy bunch, I\u2019ll tell you. And ugly as sin, too. Their faces are all fangs and whisker. Their claws are like daggers, razor sharp and deadly. And even though they can speak our language, they\u2019re beasts through and through. Savages, every one."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are there more than one type?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "The ones Shinon calls sub-humans can be divided into three groups, each one named for its physical characteristics. First, the beast tribe, next, the bird tribe, and finally, the dragon tribe. They are traditionally called laguz. The laguz tribe residing here in Gallia is the beast tribe, who possess those feline qualities of which Shinon spoke."}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "To the south are the islands where the bird-men live. The dragons are in Goldoa. It\u2019s something every mercenary should know. Looks like you know even less than I gave you credit for, Ike, my boy."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hm...Perhaps."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "...A little farther, and we\u2019ll be out of these trees, Ike."}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Really? That means Gallia proper! Compared to this forest, even a kingdom of half-breeds will seem like heaven."}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "...And that\u2019s when we lost track of them. I assigned a squad to pursue them and returned so I could give you this report."}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "Understood. You may step down."}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "So Princess Elincia is making her way through the forest to Gallia...Ena!"}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "It appears your advice was sound. Well done. You have earned my praise."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "When the king assigned me a tactician, I wondered what I had done to lose his trust. When I saw it was a young girl,I burned with anger at the king\u2019s judgment. Still, it\u2019s worked out better than I had expected. Keep up the good work."}, {"speaker": "Ena", "line": "Of course."}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "Now then, it\u2019s time for the hunt to begin."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Hold it right there, everyone. We\u2019re coming to the edge of the forest. Form up. Combat positions."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I don\u2019t suppose our Daein pursuers were willing to let us just slip away."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "There is no doubt that they will attack again. Without knowing their numbers, it is difficult to advise a course of action."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Take your best guess, Soren. With the limited information we have, what is the best way to proceed?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "...Some of our group cannot fight. If we are caught, we\u2019ll have a difficult time defending them and attacking the Daeins. I propose we separate into two groups: a small fighting force to engage the enemy and buy the main group some time, and the rest of us\u2013who will escort the princess to Gallia at full speed."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "You want to divide our combat strength? The main force aside, don\u2019t you think the risk to the smaller group is too high?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I believe this is the only way to achieve our goal and keep casualties to a minimum.It\u2019s possible there\u2019s an ambush waiting for us at the edge of the forest. If we proceed with no plan, we may be caught between the pursuit and the ambush, which would be the end of us all."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Looks like we\u2019ve no choice but to give it a go."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "All right, let\u2019s split up. The diversionary team will be Gatrie, Shinon, and me. The rest of you guard Princess Elincia and proceed to Gallia straightaway. Got it?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are you sure you\u2019re taking enough men?"}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Idiot pup. Smaller numbers mean better mobility. Your time would be better spent worrying about yourself than about us."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Listen up! This will probably prove to be the biggest fight this company\u2019s faced. Remember\u2013you\u2019ve got only one life. I don\u2019t want any of you dying on me.In times like these, it matters not what our blood ties are. We are family. If you don\u2019t want to cause your family any grief, then live! Ike will be commanding the main force. Titania, you\u2019re his support. All right, let\u2019s move out! See you all in Gallia!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So they\u2019re waiting for us after all..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "There are...more of them than I\u2019d imagined there would be. I thought they would have been spread out across the forest border...I didn\u2019t expect to see so many in one place."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Do we rethink our strategy?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "No, we\u2019ve already split up. It\u2019s too late to reconsider now."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Isn\u2019t there some way we can at least get the princess, Mist, and Rolf to the far shore safely?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "There are two bridges...This thicket extends to the edge of the westernmost bridge. If we can use the trees as cover, we might be able to reach the bridge undetected. From there,we can launch a surprise attack."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We\u2019ll be creating a diversion, right?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Correct. While we keep the enemy\u2019s attention, the princess and the others can cross the bridge to safety."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We\u2019ve no time for discussion. That\u2019s the plan we go with."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord Ike, I...I will fight with you!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...No, you won\u2019t."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I cannot let you expose yourself to danger of any kind. Everyone here is risking his life to ensure your safety. If you understand that, you\u2019ll cooperate and do as I ask."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I see...I will do my part."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "It\u2019s settled then."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Right! Let\u2019s break through their lines!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Mist! Rolf! Take care of the princess. Do not let yourselves be seen!"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Right! Be careful, everyone!"}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "Leave it to us, Ike! We\u2019ll just pretend it\u2019s a game of hide-and-seek. And I never lose at hide-and-seek!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Everyone ready? Let\u2019s go!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Emil", "line": "We\u2019ve spotted the mercenaries! You there!

Let\u2019s go, men! Hit those mercenary scum with everything you have!"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Reinforcements have arrived!"}, {"speaker": "Emil", "line": "Very good!

Thank you..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Princess Elincia..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "It\u2019s still too early to rest easy. The others haven\u2019t rejoined us yet."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Ah!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "We are talking about the commander.

We\u2019ll see you soon."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "All right. Titania...Please take care of my brother. Promise?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "You have my word on it."}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "Oscar...Boyd...Don\u2019t get killed out there, all right?"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Rolf..."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Knock it off, both of you! You\u2019re like a couple of old women. We\u2019re gonna be fine. Nothing bad\u2019s gonna happen while I\u2019m around!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Pardon, my lord Rhys..."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Y-yes?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Take this with you, please."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "This is a mend staff, isn\u2019t it?
