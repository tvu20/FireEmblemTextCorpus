My father said that a lot. The first casualties of war are those without strength and those without luck. And there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Live with bravery, be daring and fearless.

You can\u2019t just pick up a weapon and start firing away! Someone has to teach you the basics!"}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "Well, maybe I\u2019m just a prodigy, cause I learned it all myself!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "You little..."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "You don\u2019t know anything, Boyd!"}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "That\u2019s right!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "This is ridiculous!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Enough. You two go back."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "No! We don\u2019t want to! All Rolf and I do is sit and wait and worry about all of you. We\u2019re tired of waiting!

No doubt, we\u2019d rather be with you."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Sigh..."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "What now, Commander?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We take them with us. We\u2019re too pressed for time to sit around here bickering. And at least if they\u2019re nearby, they\u2019ll be easier to protect."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Are you serious?!"}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "Yes! You won\u2019t regret this, Ike!

But your father was different."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "Princess Elincia\u2019s father, King Ramon, and his brother, Lord Renning, are also of a different kind. All are...or were...exceptional men. Men in whom one could put his trust."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "Oh ho! Titania! You are an exception as well! Among beorc females, you are unique."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "You are most gracious, Your Majesty."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "My father was a mercenary for Gallia...?"}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "Correct. And you and your sister? You were both born here in Gallia. You stayed only for a short time, but part of your childhood was spent within these borders."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Mist and I were born here? Is that so? I don\u2019t remember any of this at all."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "I feel your parents were carrying a dark secret. Someone was hunting them, I\u2019m sure of it. Once, over ten years ago...and after your mother had been slain...Your father chose to leave Gallia. Before he left, I went to him and asked him to share his tale. I asked him, Why are you being chased? Is there anything I can do to help? But I was unable to loosen his tongue. And then I heard he had returned to Gallia, and I thought I had another chance to hear his tale. His fate was black indeed. If I had been faster, if I had hastened my steps, perhaps things would be different."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Wait! Now I understand. The voice I heard...That was you, wasn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "His wound was fatal. I could do nothing. I thought it best not to interfere in his final moments, so I remained hidden. Tell me, Ike... At his last, did he confess anything to you? The identity of the Black Knight...Did he reveal it?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The Black Knight? No. I don\u2019t know who he was. My father entrusted me with his command, told me to trust King Caineghis and to live peacefully in Gallia. He said to forget everything else."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "Is that so? Well then, let me do as I can. If any of your mercenaries desire to live here, I will so arrange it. I will vouchsafe them homes and land."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Your kindness is truly appreciated. But, speaking for myself, I couldn\u2019t live here in peace. Not now. I will avenge my father. I cannot so quickly forget the past...Or the Black Knight."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "But, Ike! That\u2019s not..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I know. I\u2019m not...I\u2019m not strong enough. An opponent who could defeat my father is well beyond my reach...But that\u2019s why I\u2019ve devoted myself to growing stronger. I will lead my father\u2019s mercenaries and prepare for the day when my chance for revenge arrives."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "A prudent course of action. You look as one who would be more impulsive, but you are Greil\u2019s son after all."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Ha! You\u2019ve matured, Ike. It seems like yesterday that you were merely a child."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Titania..."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "And now, I would ask a boon of you."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "The strength of your mecenary band, Ike, would you lend it to Princess Elincia?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are you serious?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "King Caineghis!"}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "Gallia and Crimea are allied nations, that cannot be denied. However, this alliance in reality binds only the royal families. It is not respected by our citizenry."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "The people of Gallia are seldom seen in Crimea, are they? Even though our nations are friends, the people of Crimea have little real understanding of the laguz. Many of our people still use that undignified name, sub-human, when they speak of the laguz..."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "...My father\u2019s heart was filled with shame and sorrow over what you describe. More than any king in our history, he wanted to deepen relations between our people, and then..."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "Perhaps that is why Daein targeted him. Their hatred of the laguz is well known."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Could it be...?"}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "In my heart of hearts, I would like to take guardianship of Princess Elincia and assist in the rebuilding of Crimea. However, anti-beorc sentiment is running high here in Gallia. If we were to offer safe harbor to Elincia, I feel many of our elder statesmen would protest. They would say that we are giving Daein an ideal excuse to attack."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Which means Gallia can\u2019t offer Princess Elincia any relief at all...Is that it?"}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "Unfortunately, it is true."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord Ike, King Caineghis has advised me to turn to the Begnion Theocracy for aid in Crimea\u2019s restoration. He says we should make of Begnion a formal request and gain the support of their shields."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Passage to Begnion will require several months at sea. An escort will be necessary..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "As you know, we lack the numbers to serve as a complete mercenary army. So, if the princess were willing to hire us as an escort, it would be an offer beyond our expectations."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Titania! Soren! I think perhaps we should accept the king\u2019s offer. What do you say?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "It\u2019s what you want, right, Commander? Well then, it\u2019s our job to follow you."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "However you wish to proceed is fine. I will do all in my power to ensure that our road leads to success."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Understood. As of now, the Greil Mercenaries shall assume the honor of serving as escort to the princess of Crimea."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Princess Elincia, our journey together will undoubtedly be a long one. May we serve you well."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Oh, thank you very much! I only pray that I, in turn, may be worthy of your service!"}]}
