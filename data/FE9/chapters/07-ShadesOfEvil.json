Get the princess to King Caineghis as fast as you can."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "...Understood. What thoughtful guests you are. If you\u2019ll excuse me. Oh, and if it\u2019s not overly presumptuous, I\u2019ll have food delivered to you later."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "We\u2019d appreciate it.

The way we approach combat?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I\u2019m definitely a better fighter.

You have a problem with authority?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Just give me a straight answer. I\u2019ve only just started. I\u2019m barely able to handle my own duties around here. I shouldn\u2019t be in charge of anyone."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "You can learn it all at once.
