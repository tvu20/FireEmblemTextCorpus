Peace is all well and good, but it sure is busy."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We\u2019re rebuilding a country that was completely devastated by war. It\u2019s bound to be tough."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "You\u2019re right. I bet Princess Elincia and the people in the palace are twice as busy."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Speaking of Elincia, what\u2019s she doing?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "She\u2019s in that room over there, surrounded by court officials. They seem really busy. I feel so sorry for her."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "As long as she\u2019s getting at least a little bit of rest, I\u2019m not worried. But she probably isn\u2019t..."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Maybe if I sang her a lullaby... Ah! Oh, no! I forgot!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You forgot what?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "I gave the medallion to Reyson, but I forgot all about the galdr! Ike, what should we do?!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey, yeah... We never did find out who Altina is, did we? She was the only one who could sing the galdr... Well, when things calm down, we\u2019ll have to head out and search for her."}, {"speaker": "???", "line": "Is that Altina you speak of? One of the three who defeated the dark god?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Hey!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Sephiran! So you made it, did you?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "I arrived mere moments ago. Let me congratulate you on a successful end to your journey."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Thank you. Please tell me, do you know who Altina is?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "Of course. Altina founded my homeland of Begnion."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Oh, then it was a mistake... We can\u2019t give a song to someone who died so long ago..."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "There is one who yet shares both bloodline and name\u2013the true heir of Altina."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Who is it?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "Sanaki Kirsch Altina... None other than the apostle herself."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The apostle? Is this something everyone in Begnion would be aware of?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "No, there are very few who know that name. Why do you ask?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The apostle is Altina..."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Oh, I\u2019m so relieved! And exhausted, too! Ike, I\u2019m going back to my room. See you later, Sephiran."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "That was rather sudden. Did I say something to cause her distress?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...No, nothing like that. It\u2019s just that so much has happened between Begnion and Serenes..."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "Would you tell me about it? I would hear what you have to say on this matter."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Sure. To tell the truth..."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "I see... The assassination of the apostle, the Serenes massacre, and the use of the medallion to revive the dark god... All of it was part of Ashnard\u2019s grand scheme."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That\u2019s the conclusion we came to."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "...You have me at a loss."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Why is that?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "For many years, I have walked these lands.

Now that you have presented me with this information, I don\u2019t know what to say."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I merely fulfilled the hopes of my father and mother."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "Now you speak from hindsight. Rescuing Princess Crimea, winning the apostle\u2019s trust, and defeating King Daein... With laguz at your side, no less! You have accomplished all of these miraculous things."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I had trusted and valiant companions at my side. It was only through their support that I was able to do these things."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "Ever the humble one, eh? Now then, before I return home, may I hear the galdr of release? I must convey it to the apostle."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You would do that?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "None of you can leave Crimea. The new queen will need your strength."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...I suppose that will be the case for a little while, won\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "...A little while? You are the hero of Crimea, General Ike. If you wish it, no post will be beyond your reach."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I don\u2019t care about any of that. It\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth. And I don\u2019t see the value of being some fancy lord. When the country\u2019s safe, I\u2019m giving up that title and everything and going back to being a simple mercenary."}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "Ha ha... T-truly...you are a... Wha ha ha ha ha!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Is something strange?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "Yes. It\u2019s very...

Ahem..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Unbelievable. Despite all appearances, you\u2019re really quite rude."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Commander? May I have a minute?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Sure. What is it, Titania?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Princess Elincia... Oops! It\u2019s Queen Elincia, isn\u2019t it? The court ministers want Queen Elincia and you to come out onto the balcony and greet the people."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What? Greet the people? ...Me?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Yes, you. I\u2019ve done what I was asked to do! Now hurry up and get going!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "H-hey! Titania! Ah, nuts! Why do I... What\u2019s going on?"}, {"speaker": "Sephiran", "line": "The people of Crimea wish to see their hero and to sing his praises\u2013even if the hero himself protests."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "If they want a greeting, surely their new queen, Elincia, would suffice.
