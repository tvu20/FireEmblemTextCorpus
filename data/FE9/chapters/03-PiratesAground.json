Oh...So it\u2019s plagued by pirates, is it? I see. That would explain why the people here seem so anxious. You seem so very...young. And you claim you were hired to rid the town of these pesky pirates? Here, perhaps you should take this. It might help you if you run into trouble contending with the pirates. But do hurry. I came all this way to see the world-famous fish market, and I\u2019ll never do so with those ruffians around. Best of luck to you."}], "recruit-talk": [{"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Oh, crackers!

Especially your Commander Greil. He\u2019s far and away better than most any general I\u2019ve seen hereabouts. Er... What I mean to say is...Don\u2019t you think running off pirates is a bit...beneath you?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "That\u2019s not\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Mayor", "line": "Don\u2019t get me wrong, now.

You too, Gatrie? What\u2019s gotten into you?"}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "Please! Look, we\u2019re not a band of money-hungry recruits. We\u2019re professionals, and we\u2019re very good at what we do. Shinon and I have discussed this at length. All of this mundane mercenary work is unworthy of us. We\u2019re wasting our talents."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I see. You\u2019re telling me that you think Commander Greil is mismanaging us. Do I have that right?"}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "Whoa! Hold it right there! That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What is it, Titania?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "What\u2019s what?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You seem so angry.

Ike\u2019s got the right of it!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "It\u2019s just that I...Look, we do good work, and we help people. I want you to be proud of that. I felt like you were saying work that doesn\u2019t bring fame and fortune isn\u2019t worth doing, that\u2019s all. Sorry."}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "No...you\u2019re right. We are the ones who ought to apologize."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Enough. Let\u2019s get going, shall we? Rest is part of our jobs, too.
