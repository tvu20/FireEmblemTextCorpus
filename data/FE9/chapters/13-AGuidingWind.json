She's been asking if the princess of Crimea is aboard...What do you want to do?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "A Begnion envoy? How did she know about this ship?"}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "Hmmm...Perhaps she had word from King Gallia...On the other hand, this is Begnion we're speaking of. I imagine it has spies in every corner of the continent. Perhaps one of those spies is the source of her information."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So we shouldn't be surprised that she knows about Princess Elincia, right?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "No, but it's extremely unusual for Begnion to send an envoy to meet a princess whom they do not even acknowledge."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "It is a complicated matter. You see, the envoy is essentially an extension of the empress herself. Both Crimea and Daein were once part of Begnion. Both nations have only recently splintered from the theocracy. I can't fathom why the empress would extend the courtesy of an envoy to a nation she must consider somewhat beneath her. She must be planning something."}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "Beneath her? That is somewhat harsh, don't you think?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Harsh, perhaps, but it's true. Clothing it in sweet words will not hide its bitterness, will it?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Soren, even I would question the tactfulness of your words."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I will try to be more diplomatic."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Ike, Nasir. You've no need to scold Soren. His words are just that. They do me no harm."}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "I'm glad to hear that, Princess, but he should mind his manners."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Deciding how we ought to treat with this envoy is a more pressing issue. Princess, will you meet her and hear her message?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I believe I must. We gain nothing by refusing to see her. Let us meet with the envoy."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Princess Elincia of Crimea, I presume..."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "It is an honor to meet you. My name is Tanith. I am deputy commanding officer of Begnion's holy guard."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I must ask, what would Begnion want of me that she would send her holy guard to greet me?"}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "The apostle has learned of you, Princess Elincia, and she has come here to meet with you personally. The duty falls upon me to take you to her now."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "The apostle? Am I to meet--Surely the apostle has better things to do than..."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Will you accompany me?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I suppose that I..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We are the princess's escorts, and we will be coming with her. I hope you understand."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Of course."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Then yes, I will go with you. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Pegasus Knight", "line": "Bad news,ma'am. We've sighted laguz near the apostle's position. Birdmen. Crows, most likely."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Hmph! We've seen their kind before. They fancy themselves pirates without a ship, but they're thieves plain and simple. Commander Sigrun is with the apostle, and it will take more than a few winged scavengers to get past her. Let's remain calm."}, {"speaker": "Pegasus Knight", "line": "I... Actually, I'm afraid we aren't quite sure where the apostle is."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "What!? They've kidnapped the apostle!?"}, {"speaker": "Pegasus Knight", "line": "No, no! I...From what the commander said, the apostle grew impatient and had another of her more...willful moments. I asked at the docks, and sure enough, one of the longshoremen heard her order the ship to set sail without us."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "What!? Where were her attendants? What was she doing without her guard? Why can she never just stay put? I've told her time and time again that the seaports here are rampant with pirates and crow thugs!...Right. Where is she now?"}, {"speaker": "Pegasus Knight", "line": "The wind is poor today, so we think her ship should not be too far from us. I came here as quickly as I could."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Understood. We'll move immediately."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Excuse me, but is something wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Your Highness, I must apologize, but an urgent matter has arisen, and I must attend to it immediately. I will return for you later. Await my return!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What was that all about?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Judging from her expression, I'd say something has happened to the person she's meant to be protecting."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Say, do you think that ship over there is involved? The envoy is flying in that direction."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "If so, then the pegasus knight's fears have already been realized...They're under attack. It's the ravens they spoke of, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Ike, why don't we go lend them a hand?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are you feeling all right, Soren? It's not like you to offer to help anyone."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "It's a great opportunity to put the empress in our debt. We'd be fools to pass that up, wouldn't we?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I should have known you'd have an angle. What do you want to do, Titania?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I don't approve of Soren's motivations, but I agree that we should help."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Well, then that's what we'll do. Will you be all right on your own, Princess?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "You're doing the right thing. I would not dream of stopping you. I know those pirates are no match for your strength."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Give them...Give them a sound thrashing!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh...You're starting to sound like one of us, aren't you?

Is the apostle missing again?"}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "Oh, you're that mercenary..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "My men guarded the cabin entrance. As far as I know, we kept it safe from the enemy..."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "From what I have been told, the apostle slipped out of the cabin on her own in the chaos..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "On her own? Now why would anyone called the apostle do something as stupid as that?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Hey, Ike! Watch your words. You're being rude."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "It's all right, dame knight. I have more important matters on my mind. I hate to ask, but would I be able to enlist your help in searching for the apostle?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Of course! You don't mind helping, do you, Ike?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Nah."}, {"speaker": "Tanith", "line": "We'll search the enemy ship. Would you search your ship, just to be sure? I would appreciate it."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I'll do what I can to find her, but I don't even know who I'm looking for..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I think it's safe to assume she will be a woman of stature, a noblewoman of some sort."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Well, I suppose all I have to do is keep my eyes peeled for any stowaway--anyone I don't know. Let's split up. It will go faster if we search separately. Mist and I will check this side."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Then Soren and I will search the rest of the ship."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Soren...About what I said this morning..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Yes?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "About the way you phrase things."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I...I ought to apologize for that."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No, don't apologize. I know you. I know it's been bothering you, hasn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "No. Well..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Don't take it personally. I'm no better, you know. Your ability to speak plainly the things others won't is part of what makes you brilliant. Others are too bound by courtesy...With you, I trust that what you say is exactly what you think."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Well...yes... Thank you, Ike."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Now, about that missing apostle..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Oh...!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You found her?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "No, I don't think so. But there's a child stowing away in here!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What!? What is a child doing hiding on our ship!?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "She must be some aristocrat's daughter. Probably slipped on from the Begnion ship...It was a hectic battle. She must have been frightened and hid herself here in the confusion. Are you going to help her?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Well, we can't just leave her."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey, are you all right?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "I-I'm...fine..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey, don't be scared!"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Uh...Wh-who might you be? You don't look like a laguz. Perhaps a new recruit?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No. I'm a mercenary. I was hired by Princess Elincia."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "The Crimean princess? Ouch!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What's wrong? Oh, you hurt your foot. Let me see."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Hold! Do not approach me! Hey, I told you not to--Oooouch! You're hurting me! You fool!!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Looks like the bone's not broken. Still, we'd better have Mist take a look at it just in case."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Oh? What? What are you doing!?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Just hush up and hold on to me. There's my sister. She can heal that foot of yours right up."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Are you trying to help me? Shouldn't you be elsewhere?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I'm supposed to be looking for some sort of apostle person. But I think there are enough other people looking, and I'd rather help the injured first."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Ha...I see. This is indeed..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hm? What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Oh, nothing. If that's the case, I accept your help."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Ike! Any luck finding the apostle?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Nope. All I found was a little lost child."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Hey, she's quite a cutie."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Mist, do you think you could use your staff to heal this kid?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Yeah. Is she hurt?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Just her foot...But maybe she bumped her head, too. She's been mumbling complete gibberish since I picked her up."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "I kept silent, blaming these antics on your ignorance, but I can no longer tolerate your manners!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh? What's wrong? It's your foot, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Prepare yourselves, peasants!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Prepare? For what?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "You stand in the presence of Sanaki, empress of Begnion! I am the apostle, the voice of the goddess!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Empress? What did she say?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "What? Then she is..."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Oh, no... Is she really...?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No, she can't be."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "No way"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Hold your judgment...Even if she's lying, there must be a reason..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Y-you...ignorant...!"}, {"speaker": "Unknown", "line": "Are you all right, Empress!?"}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "My apologies! We were unable to reach you, and we left you in terrible peril. I accept full responsibility."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "You're late, Sigrun! What would you have done had something happened to me?"}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "Please, Empress, I beg your forgiveness."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "That won't be necessary. I am also partly to blame for what happened."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Let's focus instead on our rescuers. As a reward for rescuing me, I would like to invite them to visit our court. And be sure that the one they serve, that girl who claims to be the princess of Crimea, is invited as well."}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "Princess Elincia's bodyguards, I presume. I am sorry for the trouble you've gone to."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "And you are...?"}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "I beg your pardon. My name is Sigrun. I'm a commander of Begnion's holy guard. No word of thanks will ever repay you for saving the empress."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Wait...So it's true?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Are you saying that little child..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "is Begnion's..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Empress...Hm. It appears so. I can't say I quite believe it, but she seems sincere. Besides, how many people do you know who command a legion of pegasus knights?"}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "The empress has invited us to join her at Sienne, the capital of Begnion. I think we should go. Where is the princess? We should ask her permission before agreeing."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "She must be in the cabin. I'll take you to her."}], "conversation": [{"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Commander, how are you? Staring at the sea, I see..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I know you...You're Jorge, right? You make weapons for us."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "No. Jorge buys used ware. I'm his twin brother. Well, mostly his twin. He has blond hair, you see. My name is Daniel. Just remember that I have brown hair and that Jorge has blond, and you'll be fine."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Brown hair, Daniel, and weapons...Blond hair, Jorge, and items...I think I'll remember."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Fantastic. Say, can I ask you a quick question? You're a battle expert, right? You've fought a lot?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Enough, yeah. What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Picture this. Let's say there are two ships. And suppose there are planks connecting the ships at three different points."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "All right. I'm picturing it."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Now then, soldiers from one ship are about to attack the other one. Imagine that the defending side has fewer soldiers. If they want to mount a solid defense, what should they do?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It seems clear enough to me. Position the soldiers with the best defense on the planks, soldiers like cavaliers and knights."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "I see. So you would hold the enemy at bay by using your strongest allies to block the primary crossing points!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Then, you'd want to have your long-range attackers line up behind the tougher units barring the bridges. I'm talking about anyone with javelins, axes, or magic. You'd be able to do a lot of damage without much risk."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Sounds like a good plan but...it seems rough on the soldiers defending the bridges."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You would want to heal them often,obviously, but maybe there's a way to reduce how much damage they take."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "It's a stretch, but what if I don't have them attack at all? That way, they won't run the risk of getting any counterattacks!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hmm... That's not a bad idea."}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Great! Thanks. That gave me some good ideas."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Ideas? For what?"}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "Oh, my brother and I have been playing a wargame. I've lost four times in a row."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "A wargame?"}, {"speaker": "Daniel", "line": "We'll let you join if you bring some parchment and a quill. Come see us anytime if you're curious. See you later."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Maybe I shouldn't have been so serious with him..."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Well, well! If it isn't our commander! What brings you down here?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I was just on my way to the deck."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Oh, I see. That's too bad. I had a story I wanted to share with you."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "A story?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Hm mm. And quite a ripping yarn it is, too. Interested?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Well... Not really."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Oh, you're so rude! And after you were so sweet the other day!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What are you going on about?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "When those crows attacked... I had wanted to see what they looked like, so I was hiding on the deck, watching. I had heard they could fly, of course, but I had no idea they could fight! I thought one of them had the drop on you, and I couldn't help myself! I cried out, Commander, watch out!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I thought I'd heard a strange, shrieking sound. That was you?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "And upon hearing my sweet voice, Commander, you turned around and brought down that crow with one shot! It was awe inspiring."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Not really. He was exhausted from the battle. He could barely move."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "And that's when you first caught my eye, my dynamic young commander!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Is that why your hand always lingers on mine when you hand me my equipment?"}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Oh, no! Have I been too...obvious?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Maybe I should send one of the others down to pick up our gear from now on..."}, {"speaker": "Aimee", "line": "Hm. You're embarrassed, aren't you? You're so cute when you're being coy! But once I set my sights on a man,I never let him get away. Remember that."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey."}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "What do you want?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Is there any reason you're still on our ship? The crows are gone. The truce is over, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "...I have a duty. As a Daein soldier, I cannot allow a Crimean princess and her band of mercenaries to run free where they will."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "If you want to start a fight,you're on the right path. Think you can take us all on your own? Because if you want to get your friends, I won't stop you from leaving the ship."}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "Watching you all fight those crows like a band of street rats with sticks,I could see you were no match for me. But even if I were to leave this ship, the land is too far away for me to reach."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Nonsense. I can see land in the distance from time to time, and I thought you could go anywhere on that wyvern of yours."}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "No wyvern could fly that far without resting, and these islands are thick with half-beast scum. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't leave this ship."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Then let me ask you, why did you follow us alone knowing that?"}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "I wanted to be recognized...I wanted my deeds to earn me fame. A soldier has little else to strive for..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "And yet you soldiers sneer at mercenaries. At least we fight for something real. There are some dumb soldiers in this world."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You leave us no choice. I'll take you as far as Begnion."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "But as long as you're on my ship, you will not utter the phrase half-beast. If you can't agree to this condition, I'll kick you off the ship right now."}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "I'm just saying, there has to be something more we can do."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Boyd... You're not making any sense. I understand your enthusiasm to help , but try to explain what you mean...We can't do anything until we know exactly what it is you want to do."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "You're so impatient, Oscar. I was just getting to it, all right?"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Impatient? You're calling me impatient? You're so impatient you can barely be bothered to put your armor on!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Nag, nag, nag. Listen, I think we should come up with an unstoppable killer attack, something only we can do!"}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "An unstoppable attack!? That sounds good..."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Doesn't it? I'm glad you approve, peewee!"}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "Don't call me peewee!"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "It is a fine plan, but you haven't explained what this new attack is supposed to be. How do we do it?"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Hey, I came up with the idea. It's your job to figure out the details. Make it cool, though, Oscar."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Boyd, this plan sounds...Oh, dear... How do I put it?"}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "Let me do it! I'll think up a great one!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "No way. Forget that. It's too much for your little peewee brain."}, {"speaker": "Rolf", "line": "I told you, don't call me that!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "They may not like to admit it, but they certainly are close."}]}
