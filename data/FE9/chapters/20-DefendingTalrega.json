My plan will accomplish this."}, {"speaker": "Shiharam", "line": "General Petrine! Do you truly think so little of us? It's true that we were born in Begnion and not Daein, but my men and I have been loyal to this country for eighteen years.

The whole region is soaking wet."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Is the road completely impassable?"}, {"speaker": "Begnion Soldier", "line": "No, sir! We can move forward, but the water's turned the ground to mud. And the water is still flowing at a tremendous rate, sir! This is going to cut back our speed dramatically."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "This is the work of Daein. They thought to impede our progress in order to gain some time for themselves.

If they were able to flood the road only when we approached, there must be floodgates in the area."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So if we can close them, we'll shut off the flow of water, right? That makes sense. Let's get some scouts looking for gates."}, {"speaker": "Janaff", "line": "What's that? Hey, if you're looking for something, leave it to me. I AM the hawk king's eyes, after all!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Janaff", "line": "These peepers of mine can see for miles and miles. They're quite handy. It would be a shame not to use them."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Is that some laguz power? You're a hawk with the eyes of a...hawk?"}, {"speaker": "Janaff", "line": "It beats your fantastic wit! My eyesight isn't a racial ability, it's just my own natural talent. Heck, my pal Ulki has ears that can hear grass growing on the other side of the country."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I see. Well then, the job's yours. Do you think you can find the floodgates?"}, {"speaker": "Janaff", "line": "I just look for some openings with a lot of water pouring out, right? Yeah, I can handle that!"}, {"speaker": "Shiharam", "line": "The Crimean army is here! All troops! Combat formations! Hit them fast and hard! We can't let this battle drag out!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So those are the floodgates."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "If we can get them closed, the water will recede in about twelve hours or so."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "All right, let's get going!"}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Are you all right?

Hmm... That's not good. Do you really want to face your father in combat?"}, {"speaker": "Jill", "line": "I joined this army based on my own convictions. I think I can meet my father with my head held high."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Well, if you're sure... Just remember, if you change your mind, let me know.

If someone hears you use the word laguz in this country, you'll be branded a traitor."}, {"speaker": "Shiharam", "line": "Hmm...you're right as always.

What's the catch?"}, {"speaker": "Calill", "line": "I like my fees to be based on performance. Watch how I do in combat, and make me an offer.Depending on what it is, I'll decide whether or not to grace you with my assistance."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You're not lacking for confidence, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Calill", "line": "Of course not! I already told you, I'm a first-class mage."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "All right, you're in."}, {"speaker": "Calill", "line": "What? Are you allowed to make decisions like that on your own? Perhaps I should speak to the general!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I am the general."}, {"speaker": "Calill", "line": "Whaaaaaat?!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Reyson! Could you come down here for a moment?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "What do you need?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I've got something I want to ask you about."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "If I can help, I will."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Your... Your ancestors............"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Forget it. It's nothing."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "What? Is something wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I apologize. Please let it go."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "It seems like something important has happened, but if you do not want to discuss it, that is your right.However, if this weren't a battlefield, your secret might not be safe. Please take care in the future."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "We of the heron clan...If we choose to, we can read the thoughts of others."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Seriously?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "However, this power is only available to us in a calm and peaceful environment.Here, in this desperate maelstrom of chaotic emotion, it avails me not.

I'm...fine."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You've got nothing to prove. Why don't you stay off the battlefield for a while?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Ike! I'm fine, I promise. Please, do not give me special treatment."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "As far as giving you special treatment goes, I don't really have a choice.I promised King Phoenicis I wouldn't push you too hard.If anything were to happen to you, I'd be at war with Daein and the bird clans at the same time!"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "...I see.I came to repay my debt, but I'm really just being a burden."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That was not my intention. Hold on a moment! Who said anything about you being a burden?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "I cannot engage in combat, so I'm nothing more than an obstacle in the field."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Reyson, no! That's absurd! Don't you understand how useful your abilities are?No one else can do the things that you can. You're irreplaceable.So if you're not feeling well and try to do too much, you may not be there when we really need you."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "I'm of use to you, then?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That's what I've been trying to tell you. We depend on you, and that's why I need to make sure you stay healthy."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "In that case... I wouldn't mind taking a short break. But you can call me anytime. I'll come right away."}]}
