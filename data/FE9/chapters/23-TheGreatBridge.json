The assassination of Begnion's former apostle led to the massacre of Serenes. A Serenes princess was kidnapped. The medallion is stolen. A complex skein seemed to connect these events, and now those threads have become clearer and cleaner. Ashnard's motives are still a mystery, but his silhouette lurks in the shadows of all that happens. Ike returns from the temple and renounces all rights to the rule of Daein. Those rights are then passed through General Zelgius of Begnion to the apostle herself. The Crimean army absorbs another troop from Begnion, and with its might increased, marches on the Daein/Crimean border. Its next goal is the Riven Bridge, a massive structure that connects the two countries."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "If that's the decision you've reached, we'll respectfully comply."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "If we can march quickly and know that someone's protecting our backs, it would be a huge relief."}, {"speaker": "Zelgius", "line": "As you wish. May the fortunes of war be with the Crimean army. If you have need of soldiers, send word. We'll move out at top speed."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I'll be counting on it."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord Ike, may I have a moment?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Of course. What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "The soldiers say that tomorrow we'll be able to see the great bridge. Once we cross it, we'll be in Crimea."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That's what I've been told."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "It feels like I've been away for many years. Crimea is the land where I was born and raised. To feel so removed from it... I feel now, at this late juncture, that I know almost nothing of my own country. It is an unreal experience."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I know what you mean. I don't have the sense that we're on the brink of being back in Crimea, either. I don't even remember this area at all. Maybe it's because I was born in Gallia and raised in the countryside. But countries are joined together like this all over the continent. I'm really in awe of it all."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "So am I! For one who knew nothing of life outside the royal villa... Everything...is...So very big."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Big? Hmm... Yeah, I guess you're right. When we left Crimea, it was spring... The snows were melting, the days were getting longer, and the weather was mild."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "It's been almost a year since we departed. Only a year, but the distance we've traveled to get here has been long and hard...It feels like many years have passed us by. Yet this is the land where I was born and raised... Ah, my dear, sweet Crimea...How is it that you feel so far away?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "For me, too, Crimea is my homeland. We're almost there... Let's go home."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "It is as you say, my lord Ike....Let's go home."}, {"speaker": "Unknown", "line": "Oooh, what a romantic setting. Makes it hard to make an appearance! I guess I could just leave you two..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh? I know that voice..."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Hey there, Ike! Looks like we stayed alive long enough to be reunited! Aren't we the lucky ones?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Ranulf!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord Ranulf! How nice to see you again!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "My princess Elincia! Welcome home! I'd curtsy, but the tail makes it look silly."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What are you so darned chipper about?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Once I heard the news that the Crimean army had taken the Daein capital, I ran all this way to greet you."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "How go things in Gallia? You're not engaged in open hostilities with Daein, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Not yet."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What's that supposed to mean?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "In light of your army's success, the elders have finally agreed on something. Gallia will lend its full support to Princess Crimea's efforts to liberate her homeland. It's a done deal!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Really?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So, is the Gallian army going to--"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "We're going to establish communications with them and create a united front. That being said, Gallia is here to support you. The Crimean army will always be at the center of the effort. Don't forget that."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "King Gallia is being most gracious. That posture will allow Crimea to lay claim to any victories we achieve."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Don't say things like that! I'm shocked that you would understand such subtleties. Who are you, and what have you done with Ike?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I don't believe you have the right to speak to me like that. Kidding. Actually, Soren just lectured me on the same situation when we received reinforcements from Begnion."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Of course. You were tutored by your nervous little staff officer. Now I get it... Has he snapped yet? He seems high-strung."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "King Caineghis is always thinking of Crimea, isn't he? How can I ever repay him?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Princess... Let's win your country back. When that's done, please rebuild the bonds of friendship between our nations. That would be the ultimate way to say thank you, wouldn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Yes! Yes, of course!"}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "So they're finally here, are they? Has the work on the bridge been finished? And your answer had better be yes!"}, {"speaker": "Daein Soldier", "line": "Y-yes, General! Do you think it will work?"}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "Sometimes the simplest of traps offer up the best results. Lure the enemy in, and then finish them off one by one. Got it?"}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "Listen up, dogs! There will be no retreating today! We stop Crimea's advance here! We will not allow them to gain the comfort of their homeland! Any who do not fight to the death will face my lance!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "There's the bridge... Wow, it's huge... I doubt if Daein's going to let us cross over without objection."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Yeah, I think that's highly unlikely."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Titania! It's time to march! Make sure the troops stay alert and move with caution!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Understood, Commander!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Say, Ike. There's one thing I've been meaning to ask you."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What is it?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "I haven't seen Nasir around. What's happened to him?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "He was declared an enemy combatant and locked up."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "What? Hey, I understand you being irked that he didn't mention testing you and all, but treating him like a criminal is too--"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Testing me? What are you talking about?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Huh? Oh, um... Nice weather, eh?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We're going to talk. Now."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Nasir is a Daein spy? No way! That's not possible! He was our spy!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You're telling me he was a Gallian spy? None of this makes sense to me..."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "He worked for us on behalf of the king. But...Daein? As a laguz, he would have absolutely no reason to work for them."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "But there was a Goldoan named Ena who was working as a general for Daein."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "...Are you serious?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yes, we were forced to fight her in the Daein capital. When we attempted to capture her, Nasir intervened and allowed her to escape. He betrayed us."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "What? Hold on a minute..."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Maybe that was... If that's the case, then I can see why...No, even so, teaming up with Daein is just too much...hmm......"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I hate to interrupt whatever it is you're doing, but we've arrived at the bridge."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Let me speak to Nasir. Please!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Once we've finished this battle, we can go together. All right?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Of course."}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "All right, Haar! Time for you to go to work."}, {"speaker": "Haar", "line": "Zzzzz... No, Mom, five more minutes...Zzzzzzzzzz..."}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "Dozing off on the battlefield... You've got a lot of nerve, don't you? Hey! Wake up or I'll burn you to a crisp!"}, {"speaker": "Haar", "line": "Zzzzz... Snort! Huh? Wha--? Uh... Right! Has the enemy arrived?"}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "Yes, they just got here. Now get out there and do your job."}, {"speaker": "Haar", "line": "Oh, I'm all over it. Yaaaawwwnnn..."}, {"speaker": "Petrine", "line": "What an absolute fool."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Well, here we are! And there's the Daein army on the other side as expected! They're already in battle formation and waiting to give us a warm welcome. Aw, that's charming!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That's just what I want."}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Oh ho! Well said. And by the way, I thought I'd join you today."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Not as a Gallian, but as part of our army, right?"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "If it's a problem, I can always sit this one out."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Of course not! Thanks for your continued support, Ranulf!"}, {"speaker": "Ranulf", "line": "Ha! The pleasure's all mine! Let's go carve us some Daeins!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Lucia", "line": "Is that the Crimean army?"}, {"speaker": "Bastian", "line": "What ho! It is the army come again!

I will move ahead and inform the princess that her retainers are here to meet her."}, {"speaker": "Bastian", "line": "Lady Lucia, keep your wits about you. That we are excited is fair to say... But show the enemy no weaknesses, lest he does cut us down like autumn's wheat."}, {"speaker": "Lucia", "line": "Good advice. And you watch that you aren't waylaid on the way back to the castle."}, {"speaker": "Bastian", "line": "Even if Daein unleashes on myself the full force of their army's wrath...They are no match for clever Bastian!
