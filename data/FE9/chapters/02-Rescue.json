You still look a bit unsteady on your feet if you ask me."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Well, I\u2019ve been in bed for almost a week. I doubt anyone would be in top form\u2013even you, my friend!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I certainly hope that\u2019s all it is. In any case, until you\u2019re back at full speed, you won\u2019t be doing any work. We\u2019re mercenaries, after all, and..."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Even the smallest lapse invites death. Right? I know, I know. My apologies to the rest of the team, then. It looks like I\u2019ll be recuperating for a while longer."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Mm, it\u2019s for the best. Take your time and get fully rested and restored. You are our sole staff wielder, Rhys...The harder our work, the more we depend on you to be at our sides."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Thank you for your kind words."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Oh, by the way...That paper you\u2019ve been carrying around...Is it a letter?

This letter is for you, Titania."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "For me?"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Not more than a little while ago, I went out for a walk around the yard and...A man I\u2019ve never seen before came up to me and said...Give this to the red-tressed knight."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "How curious... I wonder what it is."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "I imagine it\u2019s a thank-you letter from the people of Caldea or something to that effect."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Oh, no! How dare they!?"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Titania? What\u2019s the matter? What did the letter say?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "...Rhys! Take this letter to Oscar, and tell him to prepare for combat and wait for me! I have to go out for a moment."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Uh, but, Titania?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I\u2019ll be right back!

It was from a group of bandits\u2013kidnappers. What are we going to do?"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Let me see it."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Oh, if only I\u2019d known...He didn\u2019t seem like a bad person..."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Hm. I get it. They\u2019re after revenge. They want retribution for the other day at that village... Caldea, was it? Hm. Taking children as hostages? What cowards!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Blast!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Wait, Ike! Where...Where do you think you\u2019re going?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I\u2019m going to get Mist!"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "But...No! Titania...She said she\u2019d be right back. You\u2019re supposed to get ready and wait for her..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "And do you honestly think we\u2019ve got time to wait? I\u2019m going!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "What do you think you\u2019re going to do on your own, rookie? Hold it! I\u2019m going, too!"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Stop! Both of you! I...I\u2019m going with you."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "Oh, c\u2019mon! Wait! This is crazy! Do you think you can just ignore the deputy commander\u2019s orders?"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "The road forks here...Well, which way do we go?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "How am I supposed to know that?"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Hold it! Are you saying you don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going? Unbelievable! You\u2019d better learn to think before you act,you moron!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Shut your mouth, Boyd!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "You think you can make me? Come on!"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "B-both of you, this is no time to be fighting."}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "I figured we\u2019d find you like this."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "What are you two doing? So you\u2019re coming after all? It\u2019s not like you two chambermaids to be disobeying orders.

Which way do we go?"}, {"speaker": "Oscar", "line": "You\u2019re going to the bandit stronghold, right?

You\u2019re not leaving me behind!"}, {"speaker": "Ikanau", "line": "So you came, did you, boys? Is it just you, then? You came alone?

It\u2019s just us. All I want to know right now is whether Mist and Rolf are safe."}, {"speaker": "Ikanau", "line": "Yeah, of course. We\u2019ve got \u2019em locked up safe and sound in that little shack back there. We got no problem with those brats. What we\u2019re after is a little revenge. We want the redhead and her pups. And that\u2019d be you boys."}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "Then hurry up and let those two go! We\u2019re here, aren\u2019t we? You\u2019ve got no more reason to hold them."}, {"speaker": "Ikanau", "line": "You\u2019re here, but Red ain\u2019t.

Without the red-haired knight, they\u2019re no match for us!"}, {"speaker": "Boyd", "line": "What\u2019d you say, dirtbag?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "We\u2019ll make you regret those words!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Titania!
