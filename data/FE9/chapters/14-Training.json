As Ashera's chosen vessel, the apostle is showered with love and respect from the entire nation. Seven imperial senators aid the apostle in the governance of her realm. This system of government has been the backbone of Begnion for many long centuries. After Ike and his company aid the apostle, her holy guard takes them to the imperial capital, Sienne.", "The upper class of Begnion society live lives of pampered comfort and luxury. Known as the Sainted, these elite power brokers reside in massive temple-like homes whose spires dominate the skyline. The Guiding Tower overlooks all from the heart of the city. Here, Ashera holds her vigil, watching over the world. Surrounding the tower is a series of temples, both large and small, placed in an orderly, systematic fashion.One temple, however, is conspicuously larger than the others. It is the grand temple Mainal, home to the apostle. Ike and his company, used to the freedoms of Crimea, find the differences in culture and custom to be very confusing."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Ahem...Now then, you have proclaimed yourself to be the orphan of Crimea's King Ramon. Princess Elincia Ridell Crimea, correct?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "I have heard stories that King Crimea had a daughter in secret. My men have reported as much to me in the past. However, whether you are that princess or not is another tale. Do you have nothing that would lend credence to your claims?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Nothing at all. It took all my energy simply to avoid capture by Daein. I had no time to secure any proof of my claim."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Hmph. And with Crown Prince Renning also dead, there is no one who even knows your face. What am I to do?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I will vouch for her."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord Ike!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I have no doubt that Princess Elincia is the true heir to the throne of Crimea."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Oh, really? And tell me, what gives you this strength of conviction? If we believe her story, this woman has not engaged with the outside world since the day she was born. So how is it that you, a lowly mercenary, dare to assert her authenticity?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The Daein army pursues her with bloody-minded determination. At every turn, they demand that we turn Princess Elincia over to them. What further proof do you need?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Hmm... If someone of...proper standing made that pronouncement, I would accept it as irrefutable proof. But you... You're a commoner. You have no surname, no documented lineage...You have nothing. I know commoners. They are poor. For a price, they will support any lie, no matter how outlandish."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Oh! Now, I suppose you will tell me you are the son of some noble house? No, of course not. But wait, perhaps you're a royal knight of Crimea?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I am neither a noble nor a knight. I have no connection with the palace whatsoever. And no matter how much gold I stood to gain, I would not betray my convictions. Elincia has paid us, yes, but nothing more than the standard fee to purchase our services as her escort. Nothing more. We have come this far only because we believe Elincia to be a woman of integrity. We would not sell our swords to a liar. I don't care how high and mighty you might be. I will not stand here and let you mock the bond of trust that ties us to Elincia."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord Ike!"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "How dare you! Who are you to address the apostle so crudely! Guards! Guards! Seize this man! For his abuse of the apostle, the penalty can be only death!"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Halt!...Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Sephiran was right about you. You are very interesting."}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "A-Apostle?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Sephiran? That monk we rescued from the prisons?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "A monk, was it? His disguises are always so clever. It never ceases to amaze me. As always, he remains an enigma. Heed my words! Sephiran is in truth Duke Belsys, prime minister of Begnion and my most trusted advisor. He has been traveling the neighboring lands for months, trying to ascertain the condition of the people there."}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "We have received detailed reports on Princess Elincia and the mercenary company serving as her escort."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So...you knew we were coming. You knew who we were all along."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Yes. I apologize for testing you. You see, life here in the palace is dreadfully dull. I am always so very bored. Thanks to the princess and her brazen little escort, this interrogation proved to be an amusing diversion."}, {"speaker": "Oliver", "line": "Oh ho ho! So that's what this was! How very like you, Apostle. A cunning game of wits and words. Simply smashing! Even your most loyal servant, Duke Oliver of Tanas, was on the verge of being completely fooled. I am humbled! Oh ho ho! Come, Duke Lekain!"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "Ah-ahem. It was all a ruse, was it?...Oh, Apostle, you do tease us so mercilessly! Still, it was not such a bad way to amuse ourselves, was it, Duke Hetzel?"}, {"speaker": "Hetzel", "line": "Hoo! Too true, my good duke! Princess Crimea, it appears that you have put quite a smile on the face of our beloved apostle. What an honor that must be! Hoo hoo hoo!"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "...Ah... Um...Yes... I suppose..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Madness!"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Oh, yes, I almost forgot in all the fun...Sephiran has already vouched for your identity as the true princess of Crimea. I require no further proof. You may rest easy."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "I am...most grateful."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Wait a minute!"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Yes?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What is the meaning of this? You knew Elincia was Princess Crimea? And you continued to humiliate her for your own entertainment? For some stupid game of wits and words? This is no joke!"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Elincia's homeland is lost to her! Her family has been hunted down and killed by the monsters of Daein! And with nowhere else to turn, she endures mortal danger and terrible heartbreak to reach your door. And then you...you laugh at her?! Where is the humor in that? Where is your decency? You're horrible! You are all horrid people! You disgust me beyond words! And you owe Elincia a proper apology."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My... My lord Ike, please--"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "Wretched peasant! You loose that treasonous tongue once more, and--"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Duke Lekain, restrain yourself!"}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "But... But..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "I am speaking. Be still."}, {"speaker": "Lekain", "line": "Grrr..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Now then, Ike. I fully understand your feelings. Your passion for your employer is truly a beautiful thing. Would that my own fawning vassals shared your commitment. However, truth be told, your behavior does test my patience. Raise your voice once more to me, and you will seriously damage the princess's already precarious position. Do you understand?"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Not really. Why don't you fill me in Even if Elincia is truly Crimean royalty, she is at best heir to a dead country. Nothing more. Without Begnion's support, Elincia's claim holds no meaning. Am I mistaken?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Pah!"}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "Even if we harm her fragile feelings, for the sake of her country's future, she must stand by and say nothing. In fact, she is in no position to do anything but beg for Begnion's favor. Or...hadn't you noticed?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Sanaki", "line": "I have much to consider. For now, I shall take my leave of you. I will meet with my senators soon and discuss this state of affairs. Crimea's future will not be uncertain for long. Until that time, I suggest you rest and relax. Perhaps you could try your hand at our courtly games of...wit and words?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What incredible nerve! To take advantage of our situation and speak down to us like that...I don't care if she's the empress or the apostle or whatever! I can't stand her!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Listen, Ike, isn't it possible that the apostle saved you?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "Titania is correct. Begnion is a nation ruled by time-honored custom and ancient conventions. You insulted the apostle--the very symbol of their way of life. The fact that you are still breathing is a miracle."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I...hadn't realized."}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "And as her escort, your criminal behavior would fall directly on your employer, Princess Elincia. If you had truly angered the apostle, any hope of restoring Crimea would have vanished like a puff of smoke."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That's madness! They would sacrifice a whole country to satisfy their own egos?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Ike... This may not be much of an answer, but letting madness rule the day is the prerogative of nobility. The beorc divide themselves into classes. And with classes come prejudice. From the moment of our birth to our final dying gasp, we commoners know we are not allowed to defy the upper classes."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Princess Elincia...I... I'm sorry. My ignorance does not excuse my stupidity. ...I truly am sorry."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "No. I...What you said, you said in my defense and in my honor. It made me very pleased."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "To see you so angry on my behalf...Your words filled my heart."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It wasn't as noble as you make it sound."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "However, there is one point that I would contest. It is true that I've lost my family...and my home. But I did have people to turn to...People to rely on. My lord Ike, you and your company were at my side. For me, this has been a great source of inspiration and of happiness."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Princess Elincia..."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "My lord Ike... Please call me Elincia."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Huh? That would be improper, wouldn't it? I mean, you're our employer, and..."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "You called me so earlier."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I did? Really?"}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "You didn't notice?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "No, I... Oh. My aplogies. I'll be more careful. Well, I suppose we should go. They've prepared rooms for us."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Ah, my lord Ike......"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "I am so booooored! We've been here for five days already...And there's absolutely nothing to do! They gave me free reign to wander the temple, but I've seen everything! I'm tired of it!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I take it Princess Elincia has been invited to yet another social gathering? A little time off is one thing, but this..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I guess I'll get in some fencing practice..."}, {"speaker": "Nasir", "line": "Ike, the captain of the apostle's holy guard is headed this way."}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "I beg your pardon. Are you and your mercenary company enjoying your stay here in Begnion? Is there anything you find wanting?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "There's nothing to do, and Mist is bored."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Ah, Ike! Why'd you say that!?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Weren't you just complaining about that exact same thing to me? You said you were bored and tired of everything."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "That doesn't mean you should go spouting it to everyone! Oh, you're such an idiot, Ike!"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "My apologies... Neither of them meant any offense. They're just frustrated."}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "Yes, I understand that. I will pay it no mind."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Did you have some reason for coming to speak with us?"}, {"speaker": "Sigrun", "line": "I bring word from the apostle...She wishes to charge you with a task."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "The apostle wants to employ us!?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I didn't expect this."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Expect what?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Your reaction. I'd have thought that you would be spouting and fuming at the thought of working for the apostle."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "If Princess Elincia can tolerate endless social gatherings to judge Begnion's mood and garner her favor, the least I can do is help her earn points by running an errand or two."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Hmm..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Ike, they're coming."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So we lay in wait for them here, right?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Yes. The apostle's orders were clear. Stop the band of merchants traveling on the old highway, and seize their cargo. This does look to be the best spot for an ambush."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "All right. I don't know who we're facing,but we're on the job. Let's do this right!"}, {"speaker": "Gashilama", "line": "A poor crop this time around. Cats, tigers, and a few crows...All we've got are laborers. We're not going to get rich with this."}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "Aw, and we worked hard to catch'em! Is it as bad as all that?"}, {"speaker": "Gashilama", "line": "I've been selling half-breeds for twenty- five years. The ones that fetch the highest price are the trophy herons. And if they're white-winged royals, the fanatics will empty their purses of every last coin."}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "Well, if that's the case, why don't we hit Serenes Forest next time? There might be a few of 'em left."}, {"speaker": "Gashilama", "line": "You've the brains of a dead wyvern! Why do you think herons are so expensive? It's because they're rare! It's been twenty years since that mob burned Serenes. The herons were all roasted like chickens! No matter how you look at it, that was utter lunacy. All that gold, up in smoke."}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "Oh... If they're so valuable, I'd like to see one with my own eyes. I'd catch it and put it in a cage..."}, {"speaker": "Gashilama", "line": "...Idiot..."}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "Think what you could buy with all that gold. A new axe...Oh, and some furry boots, too!"}, {"speaker": "Gashilama", "line": "Shut up, fool! Stop your daydreaming, and look over there!"}, {"speaker": "Bandit", "line": "Wh-what? Who are they?"}, {"speaker": "Gashilama", "line": "Bah! Look alive, lads! They're not common travelers!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Here they come. Titania, are we sure this is the right bunch?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "This fog makes it hard to see, but their numbers and appearance match our intelligence... It must be them."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Well, they've certainly seen us. They're readying their weapons."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Very well...

As you no doubt have heard, Daein has invaded Crimea and overrun her. Of course, Crimea is a beorc nation...However, since the time of her founding, she has made every effort to engage the laguz with honor and dignity. Never has this been more true than during the thirty-year reign of good King Ramon. During this era, Gallia and Crimea initiated many ambitious cultural projects in an attempt to bring our divided people closer.Yet one man has always reviled our work...The Daein king, Ashnard. Why he took this recent course, however...I know not. Ashnard's actions are monstrous. His army has put much of Crimea to the sword. Her people live in terror. Her king lies dead. And now, the Daein forces continue their ruinous march and cross the border into laguz territory...

You've been sneaking about in my territory again, have you?"}, {"speaker": "Deghinsea", "line": "I heard from my own son, Kurthnaga, that a beorc resembling Princess Crimea was on board that ship."}, {"speaker": "Kurthnaga", "line": "It is true."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "What? King Kilvas, you..."}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Don't act surprised! I have no intention of ruling some tiny island nation forever. I will make Kilvas a name to remember! To that end, no amount of gold is enough. Laguz or beorc, I care not. If the pay is right, there's nothing I won't do."}, {"speaker": "Deghinsea", "line": "I care not about the reach of your ambition, but you should choose your methods with more care. What good will it do you to expand your domain only to find enemies at your every border?"}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "I will take your words to heart for the time being."}, {"speaker": "Deghinsea", "line": "And you, too, King Phoenicis. What good will your piracy do you if it earns the wrath of Begnion? Continue at this pace, and there's no telling when the hostilities will end."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "Until the people of Begnion apologize for the slaughter of our brother herons, I will do no such thing."}, {"speaker": "Deghinsea", "line": "Prince Reyson of Serenes? Are you of the same mind?"}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "Those humans burned Serenes Forest and killed my people. No amount of human blood can slake my thirst for vengeance. For my siblings, for my countrymen, I demand justice. I cannot even return mybedridden father to our forest home!  I am no soldier. I know nothing of war, so King Phoenicis acts in my stead. I am most grateful to him, and I would not see him stop until Begnion has paid."}, {"speaker": "Deghinsea", "line": "Blood leads only to blood, and violence begets violence. Nothing more. Revenge is simply another name for murder."}, {"speaker": "Reyson", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Deghinsea", "line": "And you, king of lions? What will you do about your home of Gallia? Now that you know Daein's feint toward Gallia is merely another move in his game of war, how will you act?"}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "They've made no formal declaration of war.Until they do, we watch and wait."}, {"speaker": "Tibarn", "line": "If it's the first step towards eradicating all human scum, Phoenicis will help you destroy Daein."}, {"speaker": "Caineghis", "line": "No. Unless this becomes a true war among all nations, I want you to stay your hand. As long as Gallia is protected by the sea of trees, we can stave off Daein's attacks."}, {"speaker": "Naesala", "line": "Ah, the luxury of a large nation! You would waste a chance to expand your territory just to maintain the status quo? Sad."}, {"speaker": "Deghinsea", "line": "I agree with King Gallia. If we were to form a laguz alliance against Daein, we would drive Begnion to Daein's side and lose a valuable ally. The flames of war cannot be fanned haphazardly. Above all, we must think of Lehran's Medallion. Its location is unknown...But it still exists. We know this. And as long as it does, we cannot allow any war that could stand to engulf all our nations! Do you understand, laguz kings? I beg of you, do not forget it."}], "conversation": [{"speaker": "Maid", "line": "Psst! You wanna hear somethin'? There's a rumor going 'round that a tiger sub-human has been seen on the foggy banks of this very river!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Maid", "line": "Eh, wot? You don't seem surprised! All right then, how about this? That sub-human? They say it's ALWAYS in beast form! It can't change back! Right frightening, ain't it? The only way for us humans to fight them savages is to wait for 'em to change out of beast form. I mean, how can we kill 'em if they won't change?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Maid", "line": "Still no reaction, eh? What a bore! 'Owzabout this juicy morsel, then?

Yeah, if I stay in that horrible, gaudy room for too long, I start to feel depressed. Is that why you're out here, too?"}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "No, I'm here for different reasons. I'm just...admiring the flowers."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Oh, right. Yes, they all seem to be in bloom this time of year. The large yellow ones are especially pretty."}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "Not those flowers...THOSE flowers!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "...Gatrie, we're inside.

Oh, it's you."}, {"speaker": "Astrid", "line": "Are you trying to clear your head as well?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yeah, I guess so. I'm just walking and thinking about things. Begnion is so...odd. I don't understand this country at all."}, {"speaker": "Astrid", "line": "Mm...I can see that. Everything's so wrapped up in form and tradition, it feels like Begnion has lost track of more important things."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You're some noble house's daughter, are you not? What made you decide to become a knight?"}, {"speaker": "Astrid", "line": "To escape my royal family... No, not to escape...but to confront it. I want my life to be my own."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "How do you like being a knight?"}, {"speaker": "Astrid", "line": "I am still not satisfied. I may now be a knight, but my hands still shake when I draw my bowstring. So perhaps my goal was not simply to become a knight. Perhaps my true goal was to become stronger. Commander Ike, the others say that you never give up, no matter how bleak the fight. That seems like true strength to me."}, {"speaker": "Astrid", "line": "Please, allow me to continue fighting by your side. If I remain with you, I will grow stronger from your example."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Your skill with the bow is spectacular. How could I possibly refuse your request?

Thank you very much!"}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Aaaaahhhh..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "That was quite a sigh."}, {"speaker": "Marcia", "line": "Huh? Aw, nuts! You heard that, handsome?
