Ike! I\u2019ve got to tell you something! Listen to this!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Settle down, Mist. It\u2019s too early for you to be yelling like that. Now, what\u2019s going on?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Soren\u2019s back! He just arrived."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Really? That\u2019s odd. He wasn\u2019t supposed to return for a while yet."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "I know! I wonder what he\u2019s doing back so soon..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It\u2019s probably nothing to worry about. I\u2019ll go and talk to him. Where is he?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "In the mess hall. I think he wanted to talk to Father."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Right. I\u2019ll go check there."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "...Troubling news indeed. Gather the troops."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Yes, Commander."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Ike, if you\u2019ve got time to waste, you\u2019ve got time to work. Get over to the briefing room."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Hey! What\u2019s going on around here?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Bad news. Something big is happening, and we need to formulate a plan of action."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Soren!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Hello, Ike. Long time, no see."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I\u2019m happy to see you\u2019re back. But hat happened? I thought you were going to be studying for a while longer."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "It\u2019s a long story..."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "What\u2019s the hold up? Get over here now!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll fill you in later."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "You probably remember that Soren\u2019s been training with another mercenary group. Well, he\u2019s back now. And he has some unbelievable news."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What news is that?"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "It\u2019s Crimea and Daein. They\u2019ve gone to war."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "War?! It...It can\u2019t be!"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called everyone here. Soren has some more information. Go ahead, Soren."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "All right."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Take a look at this map."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Ah. It\u2019s a map of Crimea. Quite detailed, from the looks of it."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Yes. This is the Melior, Crimea\u2019s capital. Our base of operations is..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Everything started three days ago. I needed to do some research, so I went to the archives of Melior\u2019s royal library."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Without warning, the scream of a terrible beast\u2013a wyvern, perhaps\u2013rent the air, and the building was rocked by a tremor."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I rushed outside and saw wave after wave of knights, cavalry, and wyvern riders, each clad in glistening ebon armor, black as night."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "The Daein army?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Correct."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Was there provocation?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "As you know, relations between Crimea and Daein have never been...friendly. However, the past centuries have seen only minor skirmishes, nothing that has ever approached the scale of this attack. It was brutal and without warning. Daein laid the capital to waste. I\u2019ve never seen destruction on this scale before."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "A swift attack, devastating and brutal...A daring gambit, indeed."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "But if it succeeds, a very well-chosen one at that."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Yes, the king of Daein would not hesitate to employ such treacherous tactics. What happened next?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "King Crimea\u2019s brother deployed the Crimean army to meet the attack. The king ordered his people to flee the city before the battle reached them. Fearing the worst, I also fled and made my way here."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "So we don\u2019t know how the tides of battle flow now, do we?"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "That\u2019s all right. Word of the war cannot have traveled far yet. We may well be the first ones who know of it out here. You did well to bring us this information, Soren. I know some risk was involved."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "It was nothing."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Daein has invaded Crimea...We may be mercenaries, but this still affects us."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What are we going to do?"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "That\u2019s the question of the day. How do you see it, Titania?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Crimea is the closest thing our company has to a homeland The Crimean royal family and noble houses have been generous, providing us with many lucrative jobs. From a moral standpoint as well as a business one, it\u2019s in our best interest to help Crimea."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "And you, Soren?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I agree on one point: we are mercenaries.We are not Crimea\u2019s private militia. No coin has crossed our palms, so I think we should stay out of it."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "So you would have us sit and watch as Crimea is overrun?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "I would. Daein\u2019s troops are superior in both numbers and morale. The chances of a Crimean victory are slim indeed."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "But Crimea is ruled by King Ramon, who is known throughout the land for his wisdom. And his brother, Duke Renning, is said t possess peerless valor and courage. Daein may not find victory so easily."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Valor and courage are for children\u2019s tales. In terms of military prowess, Daein\u2019s King Ashnard is every bit Lord Renning\u2019s equal. Victory will hinge on troop numbers and supplies, and Daein is superior in both. I think the outcome is painfully obvious."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Curse you, Soren! Crimea is not doomed! If they can turn aside Daein\u2019s initial thrust and turn it into a test of endurance..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "With the Crimean army both demoralized and ill prepared? They simply will not be able to hold out that long."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "All right. That\u2019s enough. Both of you."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "I hear what you say. However, we must ascertain the current situation before we decide on any action. We\u2019ll send a scouting party to get a closer look at Melior."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Ike, I want you in charge of this. Assemble your men and get going."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What? Me?"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Titania will accompany you as an advisor."}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Commander, you must be joking! He\u2019s just a boy, and he\u2019s had barely more than a taste of battle. What do you expect a whelp like him to accomplish?"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Ah, Shinon. Since you\u2019re so concerned, you can go as well."}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Wait, that\u2019s not what I...Blast."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Who else...Gatrie Rhys, and Soren. That should do."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Father, wait...Why do you want me\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "That was an order. Get moving. There\u2019s no time to waste."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Greil", "line": "Titania, I\u2019m going out for a bit. I want you to give Ike some direction."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Understood."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "...Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Ike! Wait up!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "What?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Here! This is for you."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "A sword? Where did you get it?"}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "From Father. He told me to come and give it to you."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "It\u2019s beautiful."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "This is the first sword you\u2019ve gotten that wasn\u2019t a hand-me-down from somebody, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s great!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Yeah..."}, {"speaker": "Mist", "line": "Well, be careful! Oh, and bring me a souvenir! Something nice. I\u2019ve never been to Melior before..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Mist, I\u2019m not going on vacation. Sheesh!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Are you feeling all right, Ike? You haven\u2019t said a word in quite some time."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I don\u2019t understand what my father\u2019s doing. Why put a new recruit like me in charge of something so important?"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "You\u2019re going to succeed him as our commander one day. Don\u2019t you think he wants you to know how to lead?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Me? I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m capable. And even if I am, that day\u2019s a long way off, right? I mean, I\u2019m inexperienced. Weak. I\u2019m nothing compared to my father."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "I\u2019m not so sure about that. When I look at you, I see a young man full of promise. Commander Greil is a great man, but...I think you\u2019ll be every bit his equal.In time, you might even surpass him."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Don\u2019t be ridiculous!"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "It\u2019s just my opinion. You need not pay it any mind. Yet, if you fear your own weakness, why not take this chance to go out and better yourself? That would be more in keeping with your personality, no?"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I suppose you\u2019re right."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "How did things look over there, Soren?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Same as here. There are corpses strewn everywhere. There are quite a lot of them, especially when you consider how far we are from the capital."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Are they Crimean?"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "...Judging by the armor, the vast majority of the dead are Daein soldiers."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "So Crimea has the upper hand?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Just the opposite, I think. The Crimean soldiers were members of the Imperial Guard. That means King Ramon\u2013or another member of the royal family\u2013was on the move when Daein soldiers fell on them."}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "Could it have been Lord Renning?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "No. As long as the Crimean army still draws breath, Lord Renning will not leave their command. Perhaps another member of the court..."}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "We\u2019ve got Daein soldiers moving in on our location! And they don\u2019t look happy!"}, {"speaker": "Maijin", "line": "You there! Who are you? What are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "We\u2019re no one you need\u2013"}, {"speaker": "Maijin", "line": "You\u2019re armed! Heed me! Drop your weapons and surrender! Act quickly, or else!"}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Listen to me, fool. You\u2019re making a mistake. We\u2019re not..."}, {"speaker": "Maijin", "line": "Ah, not going to cooperate, eh? Ready your weapons, men! Move in and kill them all!"}, {"speaker": "Maijin", "line": "Tsk! Headstrong fools!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Getting caught up in some skirmish is not art of the plan..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "But they\u2019re obviously not going to listen to us. Greil Mercenaries! Get ready to fight!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "All right, Ike. Let\u2019s see how you handle the role of captain. Well? What are your orders, boy? We\u2019ll do what you say, so long as you hurry up and spit it out!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "I know, I know! I\u2019m thinking! Give me a moment, will you, Shinon?"}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "Bah. Useless! We\u2019d be better led with Mist than this soft, untested whelp."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Let\u2019s see...We\u2019re in the middle of the road, and there\u2019s not much cover. Soren and Rhys are vulnerable, so we have to protect them from enemy attacks...Right?"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "That\u2019s a sound strategy, Ike. I can attack from behind your defenses. Good thinking."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Do you mean that? Um...all right! Let\u2019s do that then."}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Maijin", "line": "Grrr! Blasted mercenaries. They\u2019re better than I expected.

You\u2019re nothing more than a bunch of ragtag sellswords. Who are you to oppose Daein!? You are so terribly ignorant of your position in this world.", "unit": "Ike", "boss": "Maijin"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "You refused to listen to us, and then you attacked without provocation!

You\u2019re not of Daein, you\u2019re armed, and you\u2019re here. It\u2019s our job to destroy you. Simple, wouldn\u2019t you say? Come, dog! Prepare yourself!", "unit": "Titania", "boss": "Maijin"}, {"speaker": "Titania", "line": "I\u2019d just as soon avoid this bloodshed, but that seems unlikely.

No? Excellent! Well done!"}, {"speaker": "Gatrie", "line": "I don\u2019t know...Taking out these Daein soldiers may have been a bad move. Um...Hey, Shinon? What are you doing?"}, {"speaker": "Shinon", "line": "This swine\u2019s got some nice weapons. Besides, he ain\u2019t gonna complain. He won\u2019t need them where he\u2019s going."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Shinon!"}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Get ahold of yourself! We can\u2019t afford such behavior right now.

This is no place for us to waste time bickering amongst ourselves!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Let\u2019s clear out of here. We have to tell the commander what happened."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Let\u2019s take this road.

Ike, I just saw something move on the far side of that thicket!"}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "A wounded soldier, perhaps? Let\u2019s go have a look. Careful, now."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Oh, no..."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Did you find anything, Rhys?"}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "...It\u2019s a woman..."}, {"speaker": "Soren", "line": "Leave her. We shouldn\u2019t get involved in matters that don\u2019t concern us."}, {"speaker": "Elincia", "line": "Oooh..."}, {"speaker": "Rhys", "line": "Thank goodness...It looks like she\u2019s merely fainted."}, {"speaker": "Ike", "line": "Right. We\u2019d better take her with us for now and make sure she\u2019s all right.
