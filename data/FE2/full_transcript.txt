@Narration 
A landslide north of here has cut off the path to Mila's Temple. The priestesses who just left are safe, but...

@Dialogue 
Girl: Thank You. Now I can return to my service at Mila's Temple. ...! Hold on... Could it be?!
Celica: Hmm? What's the matter?
Girl: My apologies. You just bear a striking resemblance to Lady Liprica.
Celica: Liprica!? That was my mother's name!
Girl: Then... then you truly are Princess Anthiese! This is wonderful!
Celica: You knew my mother? Please... Tell me about her...
Girl: Yes... Lady Liprica was originally a priestess at Mila's Temple. The king, charmed by her beauty, forcibly made her his queen. It was hard for her to bear, and she soon caught a grave disease. Soon after she gave birth to you, she perished... She worried so about you... Oh, Lady Anthiese, don't cry... I have something I must give you.
Girl: This diadem proves you are the princess of Zofia. Please use your power to save the Kingdom.

Girl: I am returning to Mila's Temple. Take care, Your Highness.

@Battle 
Alm: Everyone, stay alert! A brigade from Rigel is closing in. Fortify our defenses! Scatter our foes and pick them off one by one!

Desaix: The rebel forces are attacking? Shit! In that case... Archers! Kill that girl in her cell as a warning!

Tatarrah: Hoho... You fools hope to beat me, Lord Tatarrah? Delthea! Kill those idiots with your Aura!

Delthea: Ah! My head... What am I doing here? Urgh... Luthieeer--

Grieth: Hehe... Foolish brats. Have a death wish? I, Lord Grieth, will show you my power. Get 'em, boys! Kill them all!

Celica: Look! The Temple of Mila! Stay alert-- Mikhail, one of Duma's cantors, is ahead. Everyone, protect out frailer allies!

@Conversation 
NPC: A liberation soldier is imporisoned in Desaix's fort. Rumors say she'll be executed soon. You guys better hurry if you want to save her!

NPC: Valentia is split by a deep gorge. The floodgate exists to store water in the gorge, but... if it isn't opened periodically, the water overflows

NPC: The Rigelian army has occupied the gate and is keeping it closed. Please, Lord Alm. You must somehow open the gate before Zofia floods!

Unnamed Man: Some Gargoyles flew off to the shrine in the west with my child. If you save her, I'll give you my treasure.

Unnamed Girl: Wahh! I was so scared!

Unnamed Man: Thank you.
Unnamed Girl: Eheh. Thanks for saving me.

Unnamed Man: What? You want me to open the floodgate!? If I do that, the water will pour out too fast, causing a flood. Sorry, but until the floodgate at Mila's Temple is opened, I can't do it.

Unnamed Man: Oh! Mila's floodgate has been opened! I'll open this gate right away!
Unnamed Man: North of this floodgate is the Kingdom of Rigel. Be careful.

Palla: Catria! Those guys are bandits. Stay close!

NPC: The bandit king Grieth rules the eastern desert. He attacked and took all of our children as slaves. What should we do...?

NPC: Some say the dead can be revived in the nearby shrine. Dragons have settled there, though. Anything that draws near gets devoured.

NPC: The Earth Goddess Mila was sealed by King Rudolf of Rigel. That's why the land is barren. As things stand, we'll all starve...

NPC: Great Cantor Dolth rules the land north of here. Tresspass, and he'll summon necrodragons to devour you.

NPC: Travelling north is impossible with the gorge full of water. If you don't open the western floodgate, the water won't drain. There's a reserve gate in this temple's basement, but...

NPC: The evil god Duma gave Rudolf the sword that sealed Lady Mila. If you go to the Tower of Duma, you could rescue her. Just beware of the life-draining swamps on the way...

NPC: One of our priestesses is a prisoner in Grieth's fort. Please, save everyone captured by that evil thief!

Girl: Thanks to you, our healer returned safely. If you go north, look for a hamlet in the Lost Treescape. The Great Sage Halcyon who lives there ought to help you somehow.

Unnamed man: I'm the guard of this floodgate. What? You want me to open it? No can do. Only the Zofian royal family can order this gate opened. I ain't listening to you!

Unnamed man: Hmm? Wait a sec... That crown...! That's the royal family's crest! Then you must be the long-lost Princess Anthiese!F-forgive my rudeness. I'll open the floodgate straightaway.
Unnamed man: Your Highness, the western floodgate must also be open to drain the water.

@Recruit-Conversation 
Luthier: I beg of you, please save my little sister! She's being manipulated by the cantor Tatarrah at Rigel's sluice. If Tatarrah is defeated, the spell on Delthea should break...

Mathilda: Thank you. I just knew you'd come rescue me.

Delthea: I don't know what happened, Brother. Eh? I was under Tattarah's control? So that's what it was... I'm sorry if I've been a bother.

Palla: Oh! I was looking for you. Our sister, Est, is still missing and I was thinking... Your journey will be tough, like ours. May we travel together? We can help each other out.

Catria: Ahh, I hope we find Est soon... This is a secret, but if the three of us surrounded a foe, there's a really cool move we can use.

Atlas: Y'guys gonna go finish off that bastard, Grieth? If so, let me help out. My siblings got captured by him, but I don't know where they're at...

Jesse: Aw, thanks. You saved me. Name's Jesse. Just some merc. I got caught helping out a girl jailed in Grieth's fort. Cute kid from a foreign land.
Celica: That has to be Est... Hey, Jesse. Is there a way we can save her?
Jesse: Nope. There's no way the few of us can do anything.
Celica: But there must be a way...
Jesse: Well, I guess... Grieth has these two underlings: Sonya and Deen. They guard the north and south desert regions, respectively. Both of them seem to hate Grieth. However, neither will betray him while the other's alive. If you defeat one, the other may become your ally. Oh, and of course I'll lend you a hand, too.

Est: Eh? Big sisters! Ahh, great! I'm coming with you guys too!

Sonya: What, you've dealt with Grieth? Well, that vile man had it coming. Mmm... I owe you guys one, eh? I gotcha. I'll lend you a hand.

Deen: What, you've dealt with Greith? Well, that vile man had it coming. Mmm... I owe you guys one, eh? Very well. I'll lend you a hand.

@Recruit-Battle 
Delthea: For defying Lord Tatarrah... Die!

Delthea: Ahh, it hurts... B-brother...

Deen: No hard feelings, but we're enemies. Taste my blade!

Sonya: Heheh, little girl and company-- you're going to die!

@Boss 
Desaix: Is this all you've got...? I won't be beaten so easily!

Desaix: Grr... Mycen! Is he planning to give Zofia to Rudolf's brat?! Damn traitor!

Tatarrah: May Duma's blessings--

Grieth: Grr, is this already the end of my kingodm? Then I'll drag you all down with me to hell!

Grieth: I hope you're proud! How could I-- ugh...
/***EOF***/
@Conversation
Unnamed sage: If you go down these stairs you should get to Duma's Altar. It's said that there's no return once you've entered. Your Highness, please take care!

@Battle 
Alm: Celica!
Celica: Ah! Alm, help us... At this rate, everyone will... H-hurry... Please...

Alm: Celica?!
Celica: Alm...
Alm: Don't worry. I'll crush these bastards.
Celica: It won't work. Jedah somehow seals all attacks. Plus, Mogalls keep spawning and entangling us. We're done for... Sorry, Alm. I was weak after all. I've had an odd premonition that pain awaits you... That's why I left on a quest to save Mila... That's why I didn't want you to fight yet. I'm sorry I acted so cold... The truth is, I've always...
Alm: I understand. But Celica! Focus on escaping! I'll definitely save you, so hang on!

@Boss 
Jedah: You fools... You will regret this...

Marla: May Duma's blessings--

Hestia: May Duma's blessings--

Duma: That's enough... Hero Alm. Inherit our will and rule this land fairly... Carry both Duma's power and Mila's love... You must never repeat these events... Never again disturb our slumber...

@Narration 
Thus, the war ended. Many have died, but now Valentia sees peace. Why did this war occur? No one knows. There is but one thing said: If mankind again grows too arrogant... The flames of war shall rekindle. All will be lost... A most dire end. That, perhaps, will remain in our hearts.
/***EOF***/
@Dialogue 
Mycen: Alm, rest. Your sword training is over. Go and play, but don't leave the village. Bandits have been about.
Gray: Yo Alm! Listen to this guy!
Lukas: The infamous General Desaix has initiated a coup. Zofia's castle was captured and the king has been killed. We formed a liberation force to fight agains Desaix, but it's not good enough. So, I cam to ask General Mycen to help.

Mycen: Alm, you came...
Alm: Gramps! Why are you at Zofia Castle?
Mycen: I can't seem to escape destiny. Alm, it's best if you follow your own path. Free this land of Valencia from its cursed fate. You and the red-haired girl who will visit this castle soon... Perhaps that is what fate has in store for you...

@Conversation
Gray: We'll wait here. Ask your old man!

Tobin: Our country's people need us. Let's help 'em!

Kliff: Your old man was a General?

Mycen: What? Join the liberation forces?! I won't allow it! War brings only sorrow...

Python: Stop right there. Suspicious people may not pass. Eh? You're new recruits? In that case, go on inside, but be careful! Demons may be around.

NPC: Thanks to you all, Desaix's army fled to their own fort in the western forest.

NPC: Desaix escaped with the valuable 'Royal Sword'. It was a gift of friendship from the Kingdom of Rigel long ago. No normal person can use it.

NPC: The entire royal family was murdered by Desaix. Well, except the princess whom Lord Mycen was entrusted with.

NPC: Take this Ridersbane. Those who can use it can easily dispatch enemy knights.

NPC: It seems that Desaix has requested aid from Rigel. If he's not stopped before the Rigelian army comes, there'll be big trouble.

NPC: You're General Mycen's grandson? But he shouldn't have any kin... N-no way, that rumor was true?

NPC: Desaix secretly had every child born to the royal family killed. Sir Mycen tried to stop him but was charged with the crime instead and driven away.

@Recruit-Conversation
Lukas: No good, huh?... Too bad. Sir Mycen has grown cowardly in his old age. To think he was once called Zofia's hero...
Alm: Wait-- I'll join in place of Gramps.
Lukas: Eh? You'll come in his stead? Thank you. My comrades will be pleased. Let's go to the liberation's base.

Gray: Alm, I'm going with ya. This village is bound to get attacked, too, so let's beat up that Desaix guy first.

Tobin: Of course we're all coming, Alm, you're our leader! Let's go take back Zofia's castle!

Kliff: Me!? ... Well... alright, I'll go with ya. But help me if I get in trouble!

Silque: I'm Silque, a priestess in the service of Mila. I was brought here by bandits. Please let me come with you.

Clair: Thanks for saving me. I'm Clair of the Knights of Zofia. My older brother Clive leads the liberation force. Let's go to the base together.

Clive: So, you're Alm? Thank you for saving my sister. Well, I've got a favor to ask of you. Starting today, will you lead our forces? That's why we sought Sir Mycen, Zofia's hero, but for some reason, he's refused us. Therefore, I'd like you to command our units in his place. So, Alm. I'm counting on you to save Zofia.

Forsyth: Desaix requested aid from Rigel, up north. If Rigel complies, we won't stand a chance!
Alm: But the 'Gods' Pact' upheld by Zofia and Rigel... It means we won't war, right? Our guardian, Lady Mila, would never allow it.
Forsyth: Yeah, well... There's a rumor that Lady Mila has disappeared. Hey, hey! Don't look so surprised! After all, it's been strange lately, hasn't it? Crops failing, odd demons emerging... Only Mila's Temple knows what's goin on, I guess.

Python: What? We're finally marching on Zofia Castle? I'm coming too! Be wary of Slayde, the guards' captain. He's a pretty strong fighter.

@Battle 
Desaix: Rebel scum! Think you can defeat me? Slayde, use my army to scatter those swines!

Slayde: Die, rebels!

@Boss 
Desaix: What?! Slayde's been downed?! Shit! I'll remember this. I'm leaving this to you, men!

Slayde: Heh... Fools! What you just beat was a double. Lord Desaix left for his own lands already. I'll pay you back for this someday.
/***EOF***/
@Dialogue 
Celica: Well, Bishop Nomah, I'll be off.
Nomah: Celica... Must you go? The road to Mila's Temple is long. Between Geyse's pirates and the evil fiends rising, you'll surely be attacked. It's too risky...
Celica: But Father, it's been three years since we last grew crops. What in the world befell the Earth Goddess Mila? I want to find out for myself.
Nomah: I see... If you insist, then I shall not stop you, Celica. You know why Sir Mycen placed you in my care, right? You are the last of the Zofian royal family. Zofia's people depend on you. Don't try to do the impossible.

Mycen: Celica, it's been a while, eh?
Celica: ...? Grandfather! Why are you here?!
Mycen: Well, for many reasons... I see you've arrived safely.
Celica: Yes, thanks to my allies. We're all going to Mila's Temple.
Mycen: I see... Well, you might want to head upstairs first. You should find someone you've been wishing to meet.
Celica: It...it can't be! ...Alm? Zofia's liberator couldn't be Alm... could it?
Mycen: Well, why don't you go see?

Alm: ...? You are... Ce...Celica!
Celica: Alm... So it really was you. I haven't seen you since I left the village...
Alm: Yeah. We always used to play together. I held a serious grudge against Gramps the day you were sent away.
Celica: I was sad too, but Grandfather told me why he did it: 'If you stay in Ram, Desaix will come to kill you.'
Alm: But why? Why would Desaix want to kill you, Celica?
Celica: That... I'm sorry. I'd rather not say right now. In any case, Alm, I have a request. Can war be avoided with the Kingdom of Rigel?
Alm: That's impossible. King Rudolf of Rigel decided to attack while Zofia is weak. At this rate, Zofia will be destroyed.
Celica: But aren't we all the same? We should be able to coexist.
Alm: There's no way. Zofians won't tolerate Rigel's barbaric rule. We must retaliate!
Celica: How sad... I'm sure if we talked, we could come to an understanding... Unless, Alm, now that the Zofians call you their hero, you want to become their king as well?
Alm: What! That's mean, Celica. I just want to protect the people of Zofia, that's all. Besides, Zofia's only remaining princess is still alive. I'm planning to search for her. After I find her, I'm returning to Ram.
Celica: That's not true! Zofia's royal family is gone! But I get it, Alm. You go ahead to Rigel. My companions and I are going to Mila's Temple.
Alm: Celica!?
Celica: Goodbye, Alm...

@Conversation
Nomah: May the blessings of Mila be with you...

NPC: It's said a powerful sword is hidden at the Seabound Shrine.

NPC: Don't go near the Seabound Shrine, 'kay? A scary Necrodragon lives on that island and eats all trespassers.

NPC: If you want to sail to Valentia, take that docked ship. However, lots of pirates trawl the waters. Their boss, Barth, has killed many people.

NPC: Earlier, some men left to avenge their families. They probably won't return alive.

Palla: We came from Archanea, a continent to the east.

Catria: Our little sister was taken by pirates. We gave chase, but lost them around here.

NPC: A hero has arrived in Zofia! We're saved!

NPC: You'd better not go to Mila's Temple. That area's crawling with Geyse's bandits.

NPC: Hurrah! Zofia Castle is liberated! Desaix fled to his own lands!

NPC: Sure, I'm happy... But I'm a bit worried that the Kingdom of Rigel might invade...

NPC: Desaix's gone, but crops are wilting and weird demons emerged... What's happened to the Earth Goddess Mila?

NPC: Desaix escaped with the valuable 'Royal Sword'. It was a gift of friendship from the Kingdom of Rigel long ago. No normal person can use it.

@Recruit-Conversation 
Mae: That Boey's just a kid who only knows Fire magic. I can also use Thunder, so please rely on me, 'kay?

Boey: You must feel uneasy with just the girls, right? I'll come along too, so please relax.

Genny: If Lady Celica is going, then I shall go too. If you get hurt, I can heal you with my Recover spell.

Saber: Oh, shaddaaap! Dun interrupt my drinkin'! Don't gooo... Y'all can't cross the sea by yerselves, can ya?
Celica: Aren't you a mercenary? Could you protect us?
Saber: What? You wanna hire me? Hmm... Alright, it might be interestin'.

Valbar: You helped us out there. I owe ya one! Wherever ya go, I'll follow!

Kamui: Me? Well, I can join y'all if you like. ...Unless you're gonna fight the Necrodragon. There's no way to defeat that thing without Angel magic.

Leon: If my bro Valbar's going, then I am too. I'll show you my marksmanship!

@Battle 
Valbar: Kamui, Leon, don't slip up! If Barth is defeated, his goons should flee. Bring down Barth!

@Boss 
Barth: You've got nerve attackin' me, the pirate lord Barth! I'll dice ya!

Unnamed enemy: Boss died! Run!

@Narration 
A ghastly face looms from the shadows. It's the ruler of Fear Mountain, whom all fear: the legendary necromancer Nuibaba... If that dark spell he traded his soul for leaves his lips just once... All living beings will surely have a quick death. Oh, Alm-- why do you go? On this fearful mountain, what in the world could exist?

@Dialogue 
Halcyon: I am Halcyon. Hmm... You have come here seeking the missing Mila? The sword that sealed Mila lies under the Tower of Duma. However... Jedah will not allow you to draw near. If there is anything I can do, I will lend you my power.
Celica: I have nothing to ask of you. I'd like to help him...
Halcyon: I understand. I shall bless him with newly awakened powers.

Jedah: Heheh... Celica. Alm's trapped in the Dragon's Maw. Follow me if you want to save him. If you sacrifice yourselves to lord Duma, Alm's path shall again open up!

Jedah: Heheh, so you're finally here. This is Duma's Altar, our site of human suffering. Thus, I shall kill you slowly and painfully. Your pain will be Lord Duma's magnificent feast...

Alm: Ah, Gramps-- what the hell is going on!? How could such an evil man as King Rudolf be my father?!
Mycen: Alm. Your shock is understandable... But now you are the only remaining heir of Rigel's royal family.
Alm: But why... Why couldn't I avoid fighting my own father?
Mycen: Don't cry, Alm... Let me clarify your father's actions. Valentia became divided because of the gods. They have involved themsleves too deeply with mankind's affairs. As a result, the people have lost balance and head for ruin. After some consideration, Rudolf posed as a destroyer to investigate the advent of true heroes in Valentia. I was told this when he placed his newborn child into my hands: "This child will consign himself to hell's fire!" I couldn't refuse him. And so, I left all to fate. Alm. You mustn't let Rudolf's sacrifice be in vain. Go underground and slay the evil god Duma!

@Conversation 
Halcyon: The Tower of Duma lies just ahead. Take caution.

NPC: You guys saved General Zeke, eh? Though I hate Zofians, I must thank you guys.

NPC: General Jerome was a cruel man. Even this village was sacked until Lord Zeke came.

NPC: Just ahead is the Dragon's Maw. The necrodragons there'll tear you apart!

NPC: General Zeke has no memories of his past. Lady Tatiana found him washed ashore with an awful wound and nursed him back to health.

NPC: This is the hidden Sage's Hamlet. It is protected by Master Halcyon, the Great Sage.

NPC: Master Halcyon was the High Priest of Lord Duma. However, he lost a dispute with the shaman Jedah and fled here. If you wish to fight him, there is only one way. On turn 4, 8, 12... Ugh... I... Jedah's spell has...

Massena: Prince Albein. I am General Massena, the captain of the king's guards. We have heard our late King's final words and assembled here.

Massena Soldiers: Long live King Rudolf the second!

Unnamed sage: Your Highness, please listen to what Lord Mycen has to say.

@Recruit-Conversation
Alm: What are you doing imprisoned here?
Tatiana: My love, Zeke, is a general of Rigelian knights. He opposed the war, however. To ensure he didn't rebel, I was taken hostage. If Zeke sees me rescued, I'm sure he'll gladly help you.

Zeke: You're Alm, the one who saved Tatiana, aren't you? Thank you kindly.
Alm: General Zeke, you oppose this war, correct? Please, join our cause.
Zeke: I cannot. I only helped you fight Jerome because he made my people suffer greatly. Besides... I don't know who I am. All I can remember is that I washed up on Rigel's shore. To my pitiful self, His Majesty Rudolf gave me a new life. I will not betray him.
Alm: I understand... Apologies for my rudeness.
Zeke: No, not at all... Hm!? Alm, what's that mark on your right arm?
Alm: Mark?... Ah, I've always had this birthmark. What does it...?
Zeke: I see... His Majesty Rudolf once told me: "Zeke, if you find the one with a cross-shaped birthmark on his right arm, you must dedicate yourself to that person. He will certainly become the savior of all of Valentia..." If this is His Majesty's will, then so be it! Al, I shall fight with you!

Nomah: Celica! Are you okay?
Celica: Bishop Nomah! Why in the world are you here?
Nomah: I got worried and followed you. Then I accidentally fell down here. Haha, what a folly! Well, from now on, I'm coming along with you. That'll ease my mind.

@Battle 
Jedah: Hehe, cute critter, eh? I didn't expect you to kill it so soon. That brat was named Alm, yes? If you do not wish to lose him, girl... climb the Tower of Duma.

Rudolf: I see, so you've come at last... I leave this to fate now as a knight of Rigel. Men! You have fought well thus far! However... The Rigelian Empire's time has ended. Hear me, all of you! This is my final request. If I should fall, don't interfere. Those remaining should surrender courageously. Do not feel disgraced! Is that clear? Don't die in vain!

Zeke: What? Tatiana was saved? Very well! All troops, engage Jerome's men!

@Recruit-Battle

Nuibaba: I... I have erred...

Jerome: You bastards pleased?

Dolth: May Duma's blessings--

Jamil: May Duma's blessings--

Magnus: As expected, even I fell...

Rudolf: Alm... You've grown up well... Was it no mistake entrusting you to Sir Mycen after all? You figured it out by now, right? Your full name is Albein Alm Rudolf. My... only son... Guh... I have a last request... Use 'Falchion', the holy sword that sealed Mila... Defeat... the evil god... Duma...
