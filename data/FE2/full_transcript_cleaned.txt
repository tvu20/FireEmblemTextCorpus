a landslide north of here has cut off the path to milas temple the priestesses who just left are safe but 
thank you now i can return to my service at milas temple   hold on  could it be
hmm whats the matter
my apologies you just bear a striking resemblance to lady liprica
liprica that was my mothers name
then  then you truly are princess anthiese this is wonderful
you knew my mother please  tell me about her 
yes  lady liprica was originally a priestess at milas temple the king charmed by her beauty forcibly made her his queen it was hard for her to bear and she soon caught a grave disease soon after she gave birth to you she perished  she worried so about you  oh lady anthiese dont cry  i have something i must give you
this diadem proves you are the princess of zofia please use your power to save the kingdom
i am returning to milas temple take care your highness
everyone stay alert a brigade from rigel is closing in fortify our defenses scatter our foes and pick them off one by one
the rebel forces are attacking shit in that case  archers kill that girl in her cell as a warning
hoho  you fools hope to beat me lord tatarrah delthea kill those idiots with your aura
ah my head  what am i doing here urgh  luthieeer  
hehe  foolish brats have a death wish i lord grieth will show you my power get em boys kill them all
look the temple of mila stay alert   mikhail one of dumas cantors is ahead everyone protect out frailer allies
a liberation soldier is imporisoned in desaixs fort rumors say shell be executed soon you guys better hurry if you want to save her
valentia is split by a deep gorge the floodgate exists to store water in the gorge but  if it isnt opened periodically the water overflows
the rigelian army has occupied the gate and is keeping it closed please lord alm you must somehow open the gate before zofia floods
some gargoyles flew off to the shrine in the west with my child if you save her ill give you my treasure
wahh i was so scared
thank you
eheh thanks for saving me
what you want me to open the floodgate if i do that the water will pour out too fast causing a flood sorry but until the floodgate at milas temple is opened i cant do it
oh milas floodgate has been opened ill open this gate right away
north of this floodgate is the kingdom of rigel be careful
catria those guys are bandits stay close
the bandit king grieth rules the eastern desert he attacked and took all of our children as slaves what should we do 
some say the dead can be revived in the nearby shrine dragons have settled there though anything that draws near gets devoured
the earth goddess mila was sealed by king rudolf of rigel thats why the land is barren as things stand well all starve 
great cantor dolth rules the land north of here tresspass and hell summon necrodragons to devour you
travelling north is impossible with the gorge full of water if you dont open the western floodgate the water wont drain theres a reserve gate in this temples basement but 
the evil god duma gave rudolf the sword that sealed lady mila if you go to the tower of duma you could rescue her just beware of the life draining swamps on the way 
one of our priestesses is a prisoner in grieths fort please save everyone captured by that evil thief
thanks to you our healer returned safely if you go north look for a hamlet in the lost treescape the great sage halcyon who lives there ought to help you somehow
im the guard of this floodgate what you want me to open it no can do only the zofian royal family can order this gate opened i aint listening to you
hmm wait a sec  that crown  thats the royal familys crest then you must be the long lost princess anthiesef forgive my rudeness ill open the floodgate straightaway
your highness the western floodgate must also be open to drain the water
i beg of you please save my little sister shes being manipulated by the cantor tatarrah at rigels sluice if tatarrah is defeated the spell on delthea should break 
thank you i just knew youd come rescue me
i dont know what happened brother eh i was under tattarahs control so thats what it was  im sorry if ive been a bother
oh i was looking for you our sister est is still missing and i was thinking  your journey will be tough like ours may we travel together we can help each other out
ahh i hope we find est soon  this is a secret but if the three of us surrounded a foe theres a really cool move we can use
yguys gonna go finish off that bastard grieth if so let me help out my siblings got captured by him but i dont know where theyre at 
aw thanks you saved me names jesse just some merc i got caught helping out a girl jailed in grieths fort cute kid from a foreign land
that has to be est  hey jesse is there a way we can save her
nope theres no way the few of us can do anything
but there must be a way 
well i guess  grieth has these two underlings sonya and deen they guard the north and south desert regions respectively both of them seem to hate grieth however neither will betray him while the others alive if you defeat one the other may become your ally oh and of course ill lend you a hand too
eh big sisters ahh great im coming with you guys too

/***EOF***/
alm rest your sword training is over go and play but dont leave the village bandits have been about
yo alm listen to this guy
the infamous general desaix has initiated a coup zofias castle was captured and the king has been killed we formed a liberation force to fight agains desaix but its not good enough so i cam to ask general mycen to help
alm you came 
gramps why are you at zofia castle
i cant seem to escape destiny alm its best if you follow your own path free this land of valencia from its cursed fate you and the red haired girl who will visit this castle soon  perhaps that is what fate has in store for you 
well wait here ask your old man
our countrys people need us lets help em
your old man was a general
what join the liberation forces i wont allow it war brings only sorrow 
stop right there suspicious people may not pass eh youre new recruits in that case go on inside but be careful demons may be around
thanks to you all desaixs army fled to their own fort in the western forest
desaix escaped with the valuable royal sword it was a gift of friendship from the kingdom of rigel long ago no normal person can use it
the entire royal family was murdered by desaix well except the princess whom lord mycen was entrusted with
take this ridersbane those who can use it can easily dispatch enemy knights
it seems that desaix has requested aid from rigel if hes not stopped before the rigelian army comes therell be big trouble
youre general mycens grandson but he shouldnt have any kin  n no way that rumor was true
desaix secretly had every child born to the royal family killed sir mycen tried to stop him but was charged with the crime instead and driven away
no good huh  too bad sir mycen has grown cowardly in his old age to think he was once called zofias hero 
wait   ill join in place of gramps
eh youll come in his stead thank you my comrades will be pleased lets go to the liberations base
alm im going with ya this village is bound to get attacked too so lets beat up that desaix guy first
of course were all coming alm youre our leader lets go take back zofias castle
me   well  alright ill go with ya but help me if i get in trouble
im silque a priestess in the service of mila i was brought here by bandits please let me come with you
thanks for saving me im clair of the knights of zofia my older brother clive leads the liberation force lets go to the base together
so youre alm thank you for saving my sister well ive got a favor to ask of you starting today will you lead our forces thats why we sought sir mycen zofias hero but for some reason hes refused us therefore id like you to command our units in his place so alm im counting on you to save zofia
desaix requested aid from rigel up north if rigel complies we wont stand a chance
but the gods pact upheld by zofia and rigel  it means we wont war right our guardian lady mila would never allow it
yeah well  theres a rumor that lady mila has disappeared hey hey dont look so surprised after all its been strange lately hasnt it crops failing odd demons emerging  only milas temple knows whats goin on i guess
what were finally marching on zofia castle im coming too be wary of slayde the guards captain hes a pretty strong fighter
rebel scum think you can defeat me slayde use my army to scatter those swines
die rebels
what slaydes been downed shit ill remember this im leaving this to you men
heh  fools what you just beat was a double lord desaix left for his own lands already ill pay you back for this someday
/***EOF***/
well bishop nomah ill be off
celica  must you go the road to milas temple is long between geyses pirates and the evil fiends rising youll surely be attacked its too risky 
but father its been three years since we last grew crops what in the world befell the earth goddess mila i want to find out for myself
i see  if you insist then i shall not stop you celica you know why sir mycen placed you in my care right you are the last of the zofian royal family zofias people depend on you dont try to do the impossible
celica its been a while eh
  grandfather why are you here
well for many reasons  i see youve arrived safely
yes thanks to my allies were all going to milas temple
i see  well you might want to head upstairs first you should find someone youve been wishing to meet
it it cant be  alm zofias liberator couldnt be alm  could it
well why dont you go see
  you are  ce celica
alm  so it really was you i havent seen you since i left the village 
yeah we always used to play together i held a serious grudge against gramps the day you were sent away
i was sad too but grandfather told me why he did it if you stay in ram desaix will come to kill you
but why why would desaix want to kill you celica
that  im sorry id rather not say right now in any case alm i have a request can war be avoided with the kingdom of rigel
thats impossible king rudolf of rigel decided to attack while zofia is weak at this rate zofia will be destroyed
but arent we all the same we should be able to coexist
theres no way zofians wont tolerate rigels barbaric rule we must retaliate
how sad  im sure if we talked we could come to an understanding  unless alm now that the zofians call you their hero you want to become their king as well
what thats mean celica i just want to protect the people of zofia thats all besides zofias only remaining princess is still alive im planning to search for her after i find her im returning to ram
thats not true zofias royal family is gone but i get it alm you go ahead to rigel my companions and i are going to milas temple
celica
goodbye alm 
may the blessings of mila be with you 
its said a powerful sword is hidden at the seabound shrine
dont go near the seabound shrine kay a scary necrodragon lives on that island and eats all trespassers
if you want to sail to valentia take that docked ship however lots of pirates trawl the waters their boss barth has killed many people
earlier some men left to avenge their families they probably wont return alive
we came from archanea a continent to the east
our little sister was taken by pirates we gave chase but lost them around here
a hero has arrived in zofia were saved
youd better not go to milas temple that areas crawling with geyses bandits
hurrah zofia castle is liberated desaix fled to his own lands
sure im happy  but im a bit worried that the kingdom of rigel might invade 
desaixs gone but crops are wilting and weird demons emerged  whats happened to the earth goddess mila
desaix escaped with the valuable royal sword it was a gift of friendship from the kingdom of rigel long ago no normal person can use it
that boeys just a kid who only knows fire magic i can also use thunder so please rely on me kay
you must feel uneasy with just the girls right ill come along too so please relax
if lady celica is going then i shall go too if you get hurt i can heal you with my recover spell

kamui leon dont slip up if barth is defeated his goons should flee bring down barth
youve got nerve attackin me the pirate lord barth ill dice ya

the legendary necromancer nuibaba  if that dark spell he traded his soul for leaves his lips just once  all living beings will surely have a quick death oh alm   why do you go on this fearful mountain what in the world could exist
i am halcyon hmm  you have come here seeking the missing mila the sword that sealed mila lies under the tower of duma however  jedah will not allow you to draw near if there is anything i can do i will lend you my power
i have nothing to ask of you id like to help him

heheh so youre finally here this is dumas altar our site of human suffering thus i shall kill you slowly and painfully your pain will be lord dumas magnificent feast 
ah gramps   what the hell is going on how could such an evil man as king rudolf be my father
alm your shock is understandable  but now you are the only remaining heir of rigels royal family
but why  why couldnt i avoid fighting my own father
dont cry alm  let me clarify your fathers actions valentia became divided because of the gods they have involved themsleves too deeply with mankinds affairs as a result the people have lost balance and head for ruin after some consideration rudolf posed as a destroyer to investigate the advent of true heroes in valentia i was told this when he placed his newborn child into my hands this child will consign himself to hells fire i couldnt refuse him and so i left all to fate alm you mustnt let rudolfs sacrifice be in vain go underground and slay the evil god duma
the tower of duma lies just ahead take caution
you guys saved general zeke eh though i hate zofians i must thank you guys
general jerome was a cruel man even this village was sacked until lord zeke came
just ahead is the dragons maw the necrodragons therell tear you apart
general zeke has no memories of his past lady tatiana found him washed ashore with an awful wound and nursed him back to health
this is the hidden sages hamlet it is protected by master halcyon the great sage
master halcyon was the high priest of lord duma however he lost a dispute with the shaman jedah and fled here if you wish to fight him there is only one way on turn 4 8 12  ugh  i  jedahs spell has 
prince albein i am general massena the captain of the kings guards we have heard our late kings final words and assembled here
long live king rudolf the second
your highness please listen to what lord mycen has to say
what are you doing imprisoned here
my love zeke is a general of rigelian knights he opposed the war however to ensure he didnt rebel i was taken hostage if zeke sees me rescued im sure hell gladly help you
youre alm the one who saved tatiana arent you thank you kindly
general zeke you oppose this war correct please join our cause
i cannot i only helped you fight jerome because he made my people suffer greatly besides  i dont know who i am all i can remember is that i washed up on rigels shore to my pitiful self his majesty rudolf gave me a new life i will not betray him
i understand  apologies for my rudeness
no not at all  hm alm whats that mark on your right arm
mark  ah ive always had this birthmark what does it 
i see  his majesty rudolf once told me zeke if you find the one with a cross shaped birthmark on his right arm you must dedicate yourself to that person he will certainly become the savior of all of valentia  if this is his majestys will then so be it al i shall fight with you
celica are you okay
bishop nomah why in the world are you here
i got worried and followed you then i accidentally fell down here haha what a folly well from now on im coming along with you thatll ease my mind
hehe cute critter eh i didnt expect you to kill it so soon that brat was named alm yes if you do not wish to lose him girl  climb the tower of duma
i see so youve come at last  i leave this to fate now as a knight of rigel men you have fought well thus far however  the rigelian empires time has ended hear me all of you this is my final request if i should fall dont interfere those remaining should surrender courageously do not feel disgraced is that clear dont die in vain
what tatiana was saved very well all troops engage jeromes men
well  if i must fight  forgive me
may dumas blessings  
arise medusa now is the time you must fulfill your contract with me
i  i have erred 
you bastards pleased
 gwehehe  oh defiled beings who rule this foul swamp repel these men as master jedah ordered may they fall to the necrodragons that i shaman dolth summon from the dark realm
may dumas blessings  
may dumas blessings  
as expected even i fell 
alm  youve grown up well  was it no mistake entrusting you to sir mycen after all you figured it out by now right your full name is albein alm rudolf my  only son  guh  i have a last request  use falchion the holy sword that sealed mila  defeat  the evil god  duma
