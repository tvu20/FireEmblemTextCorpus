It stretches along the border of Ylisse and Regna Ferox."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "The khans that rule Ferox have grown quite wary of foreigners. Still, don't mistake a lack of hospitality for open hostility. This simply calls for a bit of diplomacy."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Negotiation's not my strong suit, but I'll do my best. Remember, everyone: your actions here reflect back upon Ylisse."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Trouble in the wind, milord: the Feroxi Guard are mobilizing."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "What?! Why?"}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Who can say? But they look ready to let fly at a moment's notice. We'd best prepare for combat, just to be safe. Perhaps we ought pool our supplies and select which Shepherds to deploy?

Do our unit always have to fight one-on-one?"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Are you suggesting we pair up? That's an interesting thought... I admit, I'd resemble a pincushion right now if it weren't for Sumia and her mount."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "Exactly. By pairing up, units could lend each other added offense and defense... It might also allow quicker soldiers to ferry slower units great distances... Yes... Yes! I'm sure of it. This opens up all sorts of strategic possibilities! We should try it whenever the opportunity presents itself."}, {"speaker": "Kellam", "line": "*Sigh* Do they STILL not see me? Perhaps Chrom will talk to me if I...wave my...hands around..."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "It already feels as though Robin has been a Shepherd forever. It's funny how fighting alongside someone speeds friendships along... And the more we fight side by side, the more valuable those friendships become!"}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "A key!
