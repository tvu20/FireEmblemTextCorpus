We're clear of them. But Yen'fay's forces approach swiftly. It won't be long now..."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "We should hasten south to meet them, and distance ourselves from Walhart. This battle will be challenge enough without the Conqueror breathing down our backs."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "...Another concern: the dynasts who betrayed us. They attacked us and let us go both, because it suited their purpose. Should they attack us from behind as we battle Yen'fay, it would be an easy victory. They would curry favor with the empire without risk of injury. This is how they think."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "Hmm..."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "We cannot defend two fronts. We'll need to choose our battlefield carefully... Say'ri, that mountain\u2014I've seen it smoke for hours but I see no trees on it anywhere?"}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "What...ah. That is no forest fire, sir. It's a volcano. Have you never seen one? That one is called the Demon's Ingle. It is known and feared by all people of Valm. Few dare even get close, lest they anger the wicked fire god."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Hmm... Robin? Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "Only if you're wondering how quickly we can reach the volcano."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "G-go to the Demon's Ingle?! Do you know what you're saying?"}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "I'm saying your opportunistic former friends wouldn't dare risk following us. And we can use the flames as barriers, to limit how your brother's army approaches."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "Mmm... And my brother will still come. His stubborn pride will force his hand..."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Then it seems we have our strategy."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "...'Tis a risky plan, but I can devise none better. And you two seem to have a peculiar talent for performing miracles."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Yen'Fay", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Why, General, such a melancholic air about you today. Whatever is the problem? ...Oh, is today the day you face off against your beloved sister? Dear me, of course it is! Well then, of course you'd be in a foul mood..."}, {"speaker": "Yen'Fay", "line": "She is a rebel and traitor to the empire. I have no sister."}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Oh, very good, very good\u2014right out of the book, General Yen'fay! (And I commend your acting ability...very convincing! I think your men all heard you.) In any case, I'm SO glad I can trust you not to take it easy on her ragtag little troupe."}, {"speaker": "Yen'Fay", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Yes, we BOTH know why you'd never let any of her comrades escape, don't we? Oh, I know it must be so difficult, General. But think of it this way: You still have a family. A big one! The whole imperial army is your family now! ...Well, I should run.

You, who stood by in silence while everyone around you suffered! While villages were razed and fields burned, you watched but said nothing...

What would you know of my brother, you loathsome toad!"}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "More than you, princess of Chon'sin. And I would watch that mouth of yours...

What do you mean \"sacrifice\"?"}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Oopsie! Did I just spill the beans? Hya ha ha ha ha!

No, I suppose not. He always was so quiet. And proud...honorable, I think they call it? Yet he swallowed his pride and cast aside his honor...all to protect his beloved kin. That's right, Little Sis. He did it...to save you."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "What?! ...Lies... You're lying!"}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "No, I'm telling the truth, which I admit is a rare treat, so you best shut up and enjoy it. Before you met these Ylisseans, I could have had your head with a word. In Chon'sin, at Valm Harbor... Did you really think yourself so elusive? You were my leverage for Yen'fay. Unwitting and unbound, but a hostage all the same. I let you live; he fought for us. That was our deal. And he kept his end, right TO his end!"}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "No...NO!"}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Phew... Well, I don't know about you, but I feel MUCH better having that off my chest. Maybe I will give this truth telling a try more often! Yes, I shall resolve to do so! In any case, good-bye, friends! I wish you safe travels, and so sorry about Yen'fay... Oops! I broke my resolution twice already! Tee hee hee!"}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "N-no, this isn't... This can't be...

I'm so sorry!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Say'ri, you did all you could. Your brother knew that... You are blameless in this. Excellus and the empire are at fault here. And they will be made to answer for it, I promise you."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "...... Sir Chrom, I... Pray, forgive me. You have done so much for this land while I can give nothing in return. Or worse... What help I offered turned against us..."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "WE'RE the Resistance now, and we've yet to lose a battle! Yen'fay would be proud.

Lucina\u2014fetch a healer, at once!"}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "I'll be fine, gods damn me... Gods damn me for outliving that one-eyed clod! That big, bald oaf! That...that...Aaaaaargh!"}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "That's twice now I have failed..."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "I'll kill him! I'll cut that dastard Walhart down myself! I swear it before the gods!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "No, Flavia...for now, you need to rest and to heal. When the time is right, we will avenge Basilio. You have my word."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "...Then know that I will hold you to it..."}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "...Why did I let him go..."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "Chrom, there's something else. Something important. Basilio asked I give you this..."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Wait... Is that...? Ah... I can feel its power resonating through my whole body..."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "It's Gules, one of the Gemstones you need. Don't ask me why in hell's name the oaf hid it from you. He always did love his surprises, damn him."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Whatever his reasons, I accept his gift now, and gladly."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "It's hard to believe he's truly gone... The larger the man, the larger the void left in his wake..."}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "And Khan Basilio was a titan. There is no replacing him. I should have tried harder to convince him..."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "The scouts have reported back. Walhart's army...has retreated to the imperial capital."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "Retreated?!"}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "It seems the dynast turncloaks are withdrawing their soldiers as well."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "I don't believe it..."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "Steiger and Yen'fay have fallen; it's no shock Walhart might pull back to regroup. And of course the dynasts now see cracks forming in the empire..."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Maybe they'll reconsider which side they will fight for?"}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "Possibly, if they can see an advantage in it for themselves. With them or not, it seems a decisive battle is upon us."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "To think, how quickly our fortunes have shifted..."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "We have Basilio to thank for it. For all of it. His sacrifice made it all possible... If only there had been some other way..."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "No second guessing! Basilio would have hated that. You did your duty as best you were able, same as he. Now clear the doubts out of that clever head of yours\u2014we're going to need it. The fate of Valm\u2014and all our homelands\u2014hangs on this next battle. For the sake of history and all our fallen comrades... We will bring this empire crashing down!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Shepherds! Comrades! Soldiers! We make for the capital! This \"Conqueror's\" reign ends now!"}]}
