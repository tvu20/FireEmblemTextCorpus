Well this spider has woven other webs in secret you could not even\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Walhart", "line": "You mean how you blackmailed Yen'fay to keep his loyalty?

If you...knew all of that...w-why..."}, {"speaker": "Walhart", "line": "Why haven't I killed you? ...I've asked myself the same thing, several times... But you're no threat to me. And I admit, you have your uses. Besides, I'm not one for court jesters, but you do...amuse me."}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Amuse you? I AMUSE you, like I'm a jester?! Are you AMUSED now? With a million swords at your door, come for your head?! You've lost! Lost, and you are going to DIE! All of you, ALL OF YOU! But not me!

Walhart and my sister were complete opposites. One gave her life to stop a war. The other took lives to create one. And yet they both inspired those around them; both walked a path to end all war. Both lived, and died, trying to unite the people."}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "Yes, Father, but as they say, the method is the message.

There will be plenty of time for reflection now that the war is done."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "Sir Chrom, a thousand thanks from every Valmese couldn't repay what you did for us.

It seems the fell dragon will soon threaten us all. I would feel safer knowing the Gemstone was in your hands."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Then so it will be. Thank you, Say'ri."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Are we packed and saddled? Our business in Valm is finished, but we have another task ahead. One perhaps even more dire than we faced here...

When I met all the Shepherds? And Sumia... Ha ha! Oh, what a day! ...Actually, that's my first memory, in a way."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Heh, I suppose so. I wish all our memories since could have been as joyful."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "I know... So much needless bloodshed. So many days of pain and doubt and fighting... We would have never made it without you there to guide us, you know."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Funny.

And I've been reading more about the Awakening ritual. It seems that whoever attempts the rite must brave Naga's fire. If both body and spirit survive the agony, they are blessed with the dragon's power. Otherwise, the candidate...dies."}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "What?! No! ...Er, that is...

I'm sure of it."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Milord, I have returned. (Frederick enters)"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Yes, Frederick? Did you find it?"}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "I believe so, sire. King Validar has extended an invitation. He says Plegia has been guarding Sable, and now he wishes to return it to you."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Validar..."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "They sent word to me, milord. They must have caught wind of my search... In any case, Validar asks that you visit him in person, that he might formally present it. Perhaps needless to say, milord, but I don't like this one bit."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Neither do I, Frederick the Wary. Neither do I. At best, it's selfish political maneuvering at a time when the world can ill afford it. At worst, our run-in with those Risen last visit was no accident... But we will meet with him. Send word at once."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Milord, are you...certain that's wise?"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "No, but we haven't time to be certain. ...And my sister never refused a diplomatic gesture, no matter how foul smelling. If he doesn't give us the stone, he may at least reveal where it is. ...Don't worry, Frederick. I'm not walking into this blindly. We will make certain everyone is armed to the teeth."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Then the Fire Emblem, milord\u2014you ought at least leave it behind."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Unless that's what Validar expects, and he comes to steal it with my best men away... No, it's safest with me, for now. We'll learn the truth of Validar's motive soon enough..."}]}
