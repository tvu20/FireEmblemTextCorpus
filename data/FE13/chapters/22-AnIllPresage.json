I'll just be backing away slowly then..."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Sire!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Frederick! Have the scouts returned?"}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Yes, milord, and with grim news. Validar has moved to a great altar to Grima known as the Dragon's Table. What's more, it seems all the Grimleal in Plegia are headed there as well. It's as if they're being drawn by some unseen force..."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Any idea what it all means?"}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Who can say, sire? They speak only gibberish and plod on as if possessed."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "The cataclysm in Lucina's future... This shows all the signs of leading to it. Damn! This destiny is a stubborn business..."}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "We cannot give up."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "And we will not. We make for this Dragon's Table, and quickly!

And yet you rush here... Are you so eager to meet the fell dragon yourself? Or perhaps your own fatal destiny\u2014you would have that realized first? Ha ha!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "To hell with your destiny. I'll write a new ending."}, {"speaker": "Aversa", "line": "Oh ho ho, so now you believe you can change fate? And here I thought your exalted sister had delusions of grandeur..."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "We've done it already."}, {"speaker": "Aversa", "line": "Your victory over sad little Gangrel? Or perhaps Walhart's defeat? Those were meant to happen. They were preordained. You are just another fool in motley, capering on the stage!"}, {"speaker": "Lissa", "line": "But...what about Emmeryn!"}, {"speaker": "Aversa", "line": "You changed only the method of her death. Either way, she was planted in the ground..."}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "But that was Gangrel's will... Not yours... Not Validar's..."}, {"speaker": "Aversa", "line": "You aren't listening. All of this\u2014every word and action\u2014has been orchestrated... Gangrel held the exalt in contempt, yes, so Validar and I used him. In life AND death. The king's demise threw Plegia into chaos. It drove the people to Grima... Now their life force and rancor can be laid before the fell dragon en masse."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "You couldn't mean..."}, {"speaker": "Aversa", "line": "It is called the Table for a reason, you naive little man. It is where Grima feeds! The Grimleal have gladly offered themselves to him for ages. Even now, they pray for his return... Today the Table overflows with bounty, and their prayers will be answered!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "I will never allow that to happen!"}, {"speaker": "Aversa", "line": "But it already HAS happened in our future. This moment was set a millennium ago."}, {"speaker": "Lucina", "line": "How could anyone give their life willingly to that...thing? That monster!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "I will stop you! I will stop Grima!"}, {"speaker": "Aversa", "line": "Goodness! Now you're starting to sound like Walhart, the big bully... He intended to destroy Grima as well, you know. ...Our thanks, incidentally, for taking him off the stage for us."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Rrgh... That's why you gave us your ships and treasure but no soldiers... Get rid of Walhart, but keep the faithful Plegians to set your god's Table..."}, {"speaker": "Validar", "line": "Aversa, it is time.

I might say as much about your relationship to the prince... And please, don't lump me in with that half-witted little toad. Excellus was nothing but a pawn on our board. Another actor on our stage.
