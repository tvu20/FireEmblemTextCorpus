Should I carry you?"}, {"speaker": "Lissa", "line": "You can carry me! ...No, seriously. I would really be okay with you carrying me."}, {"speaker": "Hierarch", "line": "Hmm\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "Is something troubling you, Hierarch? You keep glancing up at the peaks."}, {"speaker": "Hierarch", "line": "Hmm? Oh, I'm just a b-bit nervous I'm afraid. Gh-ghastly times, these!"}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "Chrom, who is that?"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "The hierarch? He's been a friend of House Ylisse for many years. He guided Emmeryn during the early years of her rule.

I am the man King Gangrel told you about! Did you not receive orders to take me into your protection?"}, {"speaker": "Vasto", "line": "I've orders to protect a man, true... But I see no man here! ...Only a pig! A rasher of traitorous bacon that sold out his own sovereign! And what do we do with little piggies, mmm?"}, {"speaker": "Hierarch", "line": "Well, you... I mean, perhaps... You let them go free?"}, {"speaker": "Vasto", "line": "Oh, are you a chicken now? Bawk bawk! We've a whole barnyard in our midst! Well, it don't matter what you are. The axe will fall just the same!"}, {"speaker": "Hierarch", "line": "Eeeeeeeeeeeek!"}, {"speaker": "Vasto", "line": "Right! Now for the main event. By moon's end, they'll be erecting statues of me in the capital! Ho there! Ylisseans! Give me the Fire Emblem and your wench of a ruler, and spare yourselves a gory end!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Phila, take Emmeryn to the rear of the column.

But it would be false... Gangrel himself led his might against us! The end was upon us when my knight-sisters begged me fly and warn the exalt... I should have stayed... I should have stayed! Ah, gods, I can still hear the screams\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Phila", "line": "Peace, Cordelia. You did your duty. The sisters rightly prized your youth. You've many years yet to keep their legacy alive."}, {"speaker": "Cordelia", "line": "But I abandoned them! I'm weak... Their legacy deserves better."}, {"speaker": "Phila", "line": "Sometimes fleeing takes the most courage. They knew that. Now pull yourself together.

No, Emm."}, {"speaker": "Emmeryn", "line": "No part of House Ylisse matters more than the Emblem. It possesses tremendous power. But too much blood has been shed over it already.

This is absurd!"}, {"speaker": "Emmeryn", "line": "Chrom, you don't\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Walking to your own death will not bring peace to anyone! Ylisse needs you. WE need you! Be selfish for once in your life!"}, {"speaker": "Emmeryn", "line": "...... I love you, Chrom. Both you and Lissa are my everything. As for the peace I seek... You cannot see who it is for.

I know you will come."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "...This is a terrible plan."}, {"speaker": "Emmeryn", "line": "The blood of the first exalt flows strong in us. You and I will keep Ylisse safe.

Ah..."}], "dialogue": [{"speaker": "Lissa", "line": "B-but she's safe inside the castle, right? Phila and the others will protect her! And Khan Flavia is assembling her best troops as we speak.

Captain Phila said sometimes a good slap will break someone out of their doldrums."}, {"speaker": "Lissa", "line": "Sumia, when you slap someone, you do it with an open palm. You just punched Chrom in the face!"}, {"speaker": "Sumia", "line": "Um... It's the thought that counts?"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Gods, that seriously hurt\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "Ha ha! What's wrong, my dear prince? Sometimes love hurts! You're lucky to have strong women like these, and not just dainty flowers about. In any case, I bring good news. The Feroxi army has finally mobilized. Every last man is itching to fight. I must say, I'm looking forward to savoring a skirmish or two myself."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "...Wait. You're coming along?"}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "Of course! A khan must have her fun. I'm even bringing my insignificant other."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "Your who?"}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "Basilio. The oaf isn't good for much, but he might stop a few stray arrows."}, {"speaker": "Basilio", "line": "Chrom! Good gods, I've been looking for you everywhere!"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Is something wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Basilio", "line": "Our scouts have reported back. Dark news, I'm afraid... Ylisstol...has fallen."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "What?!"}, {"speaker": "Basilio", "line": "The Plegians captured your exalt and retreated back across their lines. Gangrel has declared she's to be publicly executed within the moon."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "E-executed?!"}, {"speaker": "Lissa", "line": "Ooooh\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "Lissa? Lissa!"}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "The dastard's not even trying to be subtle anymore."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "I agree. It's an obvious trap."}, {"speaker": "Basilio", "line": "The Mad King knew our scouts would relay this information back. It's clearly a provocation\u2014a hot brand to the buttocks! We should consider our options carefully before jumping to any\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Shepherds! We march to Plegia!"}, {"speaker": "Basilio", "line": "*Ahem* Well, that would be ONE option, yes... But perhaps we've seen enough royalty waltzing into traps for one war already, eh?"}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "I don't care if it's a trap, Basilio. He's going to murder my sister!"}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "Peace, Chrom. Breathe a moment. No one's suggesting we don't act. We're simply saying we should act WISELY. We'll need guts AND wits in equal measure if we're to save your sister."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "The khans are right. I'll think of something, Chrom. I promise."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "...All right, Robin. I leave it to you to formulate our strategy."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "Are you certain you're up to the task, Robin? It won't be easy. You hold the exalt's life in one hand, and all of ours in the other."}, {"speaker": "Robin", "line": "A responsibility I do not take lightly. But I am equal to the challenge."}, {"speaker": "Flavia", "line": "Ha ha! You've got stones, at least. I like that!"}, {"speaker": "Basilio", "line": "No hesitation, no mincing words... He's/She's either a genius or a fool! I suppose we'll find out once we march. Hold on to your tassets, Ylisseans. We've an exalt to save!"}]}
