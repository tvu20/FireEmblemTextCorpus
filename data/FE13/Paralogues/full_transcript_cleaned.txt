well youre nothing if not optimistic  wherever or whenever you came from im glad you made it here morgan
me too
/***EOF***/
turn around and get lost swine this land belongs to the stonewall knights if you need a second notice ill write it down on your mens corpses
ya har a pile of corpses could still outfight you sorry lot this is our territory and no one gives orders to the riders of dawn
what do you make of that
mercenaries from the look rival bands squabbling over some petty matter a common enough sight in these dark times milord but if it comes to bloodletting the nearby villages will pay for it
then lets make sure it doesnt
stick em fulla holes boys
time to fertilize the fields soldiers
well diplomacy is probably out
seems our best option is to end the fighting as quickly as possible allying ourselves with one side or the other would certainly expedite things
a band of riders or a band of knights  time to make our choice
more sellswords ha your timing is right impeccable ill buy your steel and see youre well compensated for the trouble
well robin shall we back the knights
ya har theres a sensible lad come fight with us instead ill pay you twice what that fool would
robin
 so its neither is it which means you aim to fight them both
i should have known  are you sure about this there may be more of them in hiding you know  but ill leave the final choice to you
so be it shepherds to arms
that scent  it smells like  ho you there
gyah wh what do you want
you are a taguel
yeah well so are  gods m mother
mother
gah you nearly gave me heart failure id given up on ever finding you you wouldnt believe how dangerous it is here all these swords and brigands  anyway ive found you that makes the trip back in time more than worth it
so you came with that man spawn lucina did you hmm  explain to me why my son consorts with common thugs
huh h hey i didnt have a choice in the matter you were nowhere to be found and roaming around alone is a recipe for  extinction id figure id be safe if i took up with some strong allies and so i  wait are you angry because you look kind of ang 
of course i am angry no son of mine will survive by taking the path of the coward youre coming with me im going to teach you some taguel pride starting right now
you there hold
gyah d dont surprise me like that i could die of heart failure
 i was standing right in front of you ought i have waved first or would that have been too threatening
oh arent we the jester people die from much lesser things you know its no laughing matter what if you scare me and i trip and fall and cut my head open what then
er right look if youre so worried about death maybe you should just surrender i have no desire to spill unnecessary blood
wait surrender is an option wh why didnt you say so
so this is extinction 
greetings traveler were backers of the stonewall knights try this lance out itll put those dastard riders in their place
every time this lot has a go our fields get trampled and our houses destroyed aint no matter to us which side wins so long as its over quickly here then take this and get those sorry lunkheads outta here
our village suffered enough with one band of sellswords strutting about but two here ill give ya this if you just make em stop fighting
welcome friend were supporters of the riders of dawn here take this hammer itll send those pesky knights running for the hills
youll never breach the impenetrable forces of the stonewall knights
youll never stop the unending march of the riders of dawn
ill send your fat men and their fat man armor sailing through the sky
horse and rider both will be red smears across our shields
the fighting is over milord that should spare the villages from any further damage
good thought i still dont understand why they had to fight in the first place
competition milord a sad consequence of this war farm the land and your fields are pillaged open a shop and your goods are stolen its little wonder men take up steel and become mercenaries  or worse theres only so much gold to go around and so they fight for dominance
seems theyll continue to do so until its safe to be a farmer or merchant again all the more reason for us to end things as quickly as possible
well put milord shall we be on our way
by the by our erstwhile allies send their regards and a reward to match wars an expensive proposition but i wager blood money spends the same as any other ill see its added to our tally
thank you frederick
you
gyah y you scared me dont go sneaking up behind people youll give them whiplash 
what is your name
yarne dont you remember youre the one who gave it to me
 so you truly are my child
um im a taguel right i kind of have to be
i suppose blood does not lie i am pleased to see you my son you represent a new hope for our race
no pressure there 
you are living proof that man and taguel can coexist
hey i didnt do anything special i was just born youre the one who proved all that bridging the gap stuff youre the one who married a human er thanks for doing that by the way even if i cant take credit for it im proud of my heritage
it gladdens me to see my son value pride  may you keep it always
/***EOF***/
blast  it seems all hope is lost still hold fast ill treat your wounds 
ngh  its t too late 
whats happened here
nothing but death ahead travelers id turn back if i were you  whatever your business here it will have to wait
just tell us what happened
bandits have blocked the road ahead theyre demanding a kings ransom in illicit tolls for all who wish to pass
they think to profiteer on refugees despicable
our caravans livelihood is at stake well do no business in this country now 
the flow of goods must be secured milord or the people are likely to starve
then well secure it you and your caravan can wait here well let you know when its safe
vincent darling
yes victor
i daresay weve come across a village vincent
and what a thriving little hamlet it is victor
indeed i think itll make for a fine bit of pillaging vincent
it most certainly will victor
well then i believe its my turn to do the honors isnt it vincent
i do believe it is victor oh but try not to kill them all this time hmm it tends to cut into profits
hate to be the bearer of bad news but im afraid this village is closed
you we have business you and i and i aim to settle the debt vincent will be avenged today
oh dear have we met
playing dumb wont save you girly the gold you net from the slavers will build vincent the finest grave in the land
careful love us traders are known to make some very deep cuts
that village is in danger one must ride ahead and warn them of whats coming
 anna what are you doing here
my thanks stranger its nice to see a friendly face for once
stranger now im confused arent you  i mean  anyway never mind the important thing is that youre safe you seem to have things well in hand but i hope you wont mind a little company just until we sort these rogues out
aw youre worried thats adorable i welcome the assistance
ugh well that was careless  sorry friends looks like ive got to close up shop for today
that peddler woman was fighting to protect the village you say that kind of warmth is more than welcome in these cold lands here please use this to heal her if shes hurt
give up now i was born a victor and victory will be mine
i  i see an open field vincent  such beautiful flowers 
ah i see now you must have met one of my sisters
sisters gods you look identical
yes theres a strong family resemblance oh and were all traveling merchants
 with the same name
yes actually
your holiday feasts must be very confusing how do you tell each other apart
heh thats part of the secret anyway happy shopping and may the gods of the open road keep you

mmm  the air is sweet here its so calming
makes you want to just flop down and take a huge nap doesnt it
tempting 
odd it seems like anywhere else to me 
this is nagas cradle it is said the divine dragon once called this place home here the voice will enact a holy rite to commune with naga and regain her power
  
lady tiki
  
 lady tiki
pray be silent milady the voice is currently performing the rite in doing so she will draw the divine dragons power from the land unto herself
forgive me i didnt realize i thought she was sleeping  she looks so peaceful what do you think she sees does she perchance dream
i imagine she   uh oh is that what i think it is sayri lucina enemies approach us from the south wed better get ready or the voice here is in for a rude awakening
the voice is defenseless in this state we must become her shield until the rite is complete we await your strategy robin make us as a wall of steel
  
are you unharmed lady tiki
yes thanks to you i apologize for the delay but the rite has borne fruit
youve taken in the power of the divine dragon
some of it yes  its strange this power had always isolated me many were the days i wept alone cursing the charge placed before me 
lady tiki 
but now my power has a purpose and the world needs it to avoid a ruinous future and so i shall offer it freely allow me to join you
 are you certain
i am ive had quite enough of living in solitude thank you besides ive always longed to better know this world now i can help you save it
for all the talk of power she was a gentle soul and far too fragile 
indeed but i fear theres no time to grieve sayri we must keep moving well try to bring her peace by securing it for the world
/***EOF***/
send the new recruits along then get to rounding up another half dozen or so
w wait what are you doing
just what it looks like a wyvern rider without a wyvern to sit on is just a bloke in a lizard hat
wyverns are the sacred protectors of this land not glorified horses to be muzzled
id muzzle you had i the time as it stands ill take a quicker path to quiet gnight
gwargh
n no  run
your orders sir
if word spreads itll only get more tedious sooo yes better just kill everyone
where does this road lead
to wyvern valley milord home to valms greatest feral wyvern population
that sounds interesting well have to be sure and keep our distance
shame my minervas fit to burst shes excited others of her kind are near
oh she doesnt look that excited to me not that i can really tell the difference 
oh its easy she just looks even cuter than normal dont you girl dont you look cuter whos a goooood wyvern
ill uh leave you to her then
sir over here please help my friends will die if you dont
 no
wh what but sir my friends
im not fit to fight for anyone
th then theyre lost 
you there whats happened
my people are fleeing for their lives from a pack of armed brigands sir and now weve gotten separated  oh the horror of it all
well todays your lucky day well aid you and your friends
you will oh thank you please sir give em what for
wait youre not one of the villagers
no  i am gerome a traveler
and a fellow wyvern rider i see this is a piece of good news we fight to keep these villagers alive will you aid us
why no man can stop fate
these people will be killed by spears traveler not fate
heh spoken like one who has yet to witness fates implacable cruelty
so you do nothing then save wandering the land in the fog of cowardice and your wyvern has she seen enough does she also yearn to surrender
   you would know better than i
what does that mean
nothing ill fight if you wish it death will always have its due but perhaps it will accept a few substitutions come my dear minerva join me on one final flight 
are you with the villagers who are you
 i am gerome a traveler
these people are in desperate straits will you help us
it is not for me to interfere in such matters death will always have its due
you would leave innocents to die and lay the blame on fate
ive seen too much of fates cruel work to doubt it
so you would surrender rather than struggle against such cruelty  i cannot understand such thinking a bleak past doesnt justify condemning the future to bleakness as well nonetheless i cannot force your hand join us if you will
what does he know of bleak futures it is a fool who breaks himself against fates tide that said i suppose im as big a fool as any  sigh very well then come my dear minerva join me on one final flight 
death always has its due  go minerva  be free 
seems these newcomers have spine send word to the boys at the hold tell em weve got spines that need breaking
wyvern or man everyones all snarl and fire until they learn the feel of the lash
our saviors and its more than lives you rescued  youve saved my hope in humanity too i thank you for it here sir a token of my gratitude
thanks to you as well friend
take care now well pray for a safe journey for you and your troops
do you have a moment
what is it
i was hoping you might introduce me to your wyvern
why
to see which of ours is cuter not very sporting of me when mine is the finest in the world i know
 do as you please
i will then thank you     hee hee oh but you are cute shes nearly a match with minerva  nearly so in every way wait what sorcery is this they they look identical
thats because they are identical theyre one and the same
 m minerva how is that possible
you could examine her from tip to tail looking for scars and marks if you like  or you could just look at this ring
i i know that ring so then youre 
i am though i had not intended that we meet
why not
i came back in time so i might release minerva not to seek out parents to whom ive already bidden farewell
you crossed the bounds of time just to set minerva free whatever for
in the future i know she is among the last of her kind i i could not leave her to that solitude
she is lucky indeed to know someone of such kindness  as i imagine am i
stay your words ive no intention of getting close to you fate will not be mocked this war may claim your life anew and ill not weep twice for losing the same mother my burden is heavy enough
but yet you carry it still
thats enough
thank you gerome
/***EOF***/
dishonorable cur you killed my master and now you will face me
if that pile of pudding was your master id advise you to just keep walking
craven dog  you claimed a hostage hed never have lost in a fair fight
nor would he have wanted this kjelle if i lose you as well i 
you wont lose me i swear it and i swear your husband will be avenged
if you want to run headlong into the grave girl i wont stop you we can duel in the ruins ahead
what do you make of this chrom
i hope she knows what shes getting into
sir please you have to do something
whats the matter
its my friend sir i fear shes walking into a terrible trap that scoundrel cassius would never fight an honest duel my husband took a similar stand against his tyranny not long ago the brute took a girl hostage and then cut my husband down as he lowered his weapon sniff i cant let her suffer the same fate  id die i would
all right well see what we can do
coward you promised me a duel you soulless blackheart
indeed i did consider all these men my seconds heh still im not a monster ill spare your life if you get on your knees and beg
id sooner die
well we can arrange that too have at her boys
hey you got a second
ahh
what i got something on my face
n no you just remind me of someone forgive me i have no time to talk
dont worry it wont take long so listen these lowlifes have no honour you know that right if you meet em head on youll just end up with a sword in your back
head on is how i live
 ooh i like you and thats all the more reason i cant let you charge off on your own
dont try to stop me
im not stopping you im coming with you you just focus on finishing your duel and ill kill any idiot who gets in the way
r right
excuse me 
wha  die fiend y you parried my spear  how did you do that
i get a lot of practice now can you please stop trying to skewer me for a second were not your enemies a friend sent us to help you there are too many for you to fight alone no matter your skill well take care of the rabble while you fight your duel
you would do this for a stranger
is that a problem
n no of course not thank you
excuse me 
wha  die fiend y you parried my spear but how did you  wait do i know you i feel as if weve met but  no thats impossible
i hate to interrupt your musing but could you perhaps lower your spear weve been sent here to help you they are too many for you to fight alone well take care of the rabble while you fight your duel
you would do this for a stranger
is that a problem
n no of course not thank you
most people think a man who fights dirty is too weak to win otherwise heh heh  suits me just fine a cocky fool is an easy target
if you believe in gods youd better pray to them now
my my arent we confident
i dont fear you coward
aye i suppose not most fools assume that liars and sneaks like me are weak they want us to be weak see they need it it lets them hold on to the fantasy that right prevails in the end heh  they can think what they want a cocky fool is an easy target truth is in the end its the clever ones who always survive
a man who takes hostages in order to win a duel has no claim to cleverness even an animal would not stoop so low but enough ive no more words to waste on the likes of you my master will have vengeance
wrong girl your master will have company
kjelle thank the gods youre safe
i kept my promise your husband can rest in peace now
i may have a way to thank you this was his and im sure he would have wanted you to have it
this is a precious keepsake its rightful place is with you
ill not forget my husband for lack of a memento dear now please take it
youre certain
absolutely
then thank you
just swear to take care of yourself kjelle swear youll stay safe
i swear it
looks like the good guys won after all aint that a kick in the teeth
thank you for your help but i fear other tasks yet lie ahead of me i still have to find my parents
aw hell your parents are missing thats rough kid any idea where they might have gone
i have a ring my father gave my mother but precious little else to go on
mind if i take a look
no of course not
well ill be damned  kid this is my ring
your ring but then 
hah i get it youre one of the kids who came back with lucina yeah which means ive got a new lead for you on the parent front kiddo  im your mom
y you

n no of course not i mean  you look as beautiful now as when i knew you

um  th thank you for the warning sir b but 
thats no warning lamb im a wolf and youve been snatched now come quietly scars tend to lower the sale price
slavers milord such damnable scum 
well have to hurry if we hope to catch them

spare me your tales brigand i have nothing to say to someone who would impersonate my mothers dearest friend
your mother
you heard me how dare you besmirch my mother sumias name

wha  but how could you know
that you came from the future lucina told me all about it
lucys here
in the flesh
then youre the real chrom
last i checked
ugh im so sorry ive always been gullible ever since i was a little girl but  hey this means the other chrom lied oh im going to kill him for this im going to plant a flying hoof right in his stupid liar face

this cant go on elder we barely have enough to get us by as it is
their leader is a former valmese general well be crushed if we resist 
whats that about valm

my name is chrom
the ruler of ylisse
elder he may be able to help us
um i can hear you but tell me your problem and ill see what i can do
oh thank you sir
urgent news sir armed soldiers approach their leader claims to be chrom of ylisse
dammit why would he come here well if they insist on dogging me ive got hounds of my own to welcome them with
im not your dog scum
no only a stray mutt that refuses to stop yapping but youll be a good dog and do as i say if you ever want  
yes yes if i ever want to see it again im well aware
i trust youre equally aware of your position holland
  
loquacious as ever i see youll fight for me or ill have that lazy tongue pried from your head now then chrom may have the fire emblem in his possession  and if i claim that ive practically claimed the throne so go out there kill anything that moves and get me that emblem
looks like this is the castle the villagers told us about lets reclaim whats been stolen and return it to the villagers
all this grief over something so small  once i get what i came for im out of here maybe i can convince holland to come with me
 oh gods its you
have we met if so im afraid ive quite forgotten
well excuse me for being so forgettable
look theres no time for this if youre a friend speak now if not then stay out of chroms way or ill have to cut you down
chrom chrom chrom its always chrom with you
 im sorry
you should be and i dont care about your stupid chrom so you can just drop it  i only want to talk to holland
holland
yes holland that sad sack over there watch my back so i can get to him safely and then ill help your stupid army
o okay
oh and hollands not here of his own will so dont you dare hurt him
whats a child doing here
child im not a child you oaf im  wait are you the enemy general
i dont know are we enemies
youre chrom arent you youre lucinas father
thats right  and i suppose you came back here with my daughter
oh good now i wont have to waste time explaining the situation  weird i didnt think youd be so funny looking
youre a real charmer but charm or not if you can fight youre welcome to join our cause
not the snappiest pick up line ive heard but i suppose it gets the job done but i cant leave until i reclaim my property from nelson well talk then
actually were here to take stolen goods back to the village if i promise to add yours to the list will that persuade you
mmm  maybe but youll have to help my friend holland too hes a bit of a sad sack but he doesnt want to be here either
will he listen to reason
he will if i talk to him he listens to pretty much whatever i say dont worry he hates nelson too just be sure not to hurt him
well be careful
holland no you idiot now youll never get to see your wife again or meet your new child  i guess i shouldnt be surprised families never stay together 
holland
severa what are you doing here if he knows you left your post 
im leaving holland and youre coming with me
severa i  i cant you know i cant i have a wife if i dont earn nelsons coin shell starve i know its blood money but  
your wife is pregnant holland you know that dont you
of course i know that and its none of your concern
do you love your child holland do you love your wife
of course i do
then stop making excuses i know that parents will do anything for their children  but i also know how it feels when a child loses her parents this worlds got far too many kids whove gone through that if you stay youll be killed or worse and your child deserves better
severa i  im sorry i didnt know that must have been hard for you    youre right my child deserves better lets get out of here
really
yes really but we have to hurry
what are those useless fools doing get them somebody get them
damn  useless fools all of you
and what does that make the man cowering behind them
bah ill use your corpse to clean the blood from my boots
traitorous wench
youve got to be loyal before you can be a traitor you idiot and youre one to talk extorting a poor innocent girl like me its time you learned just how deadly this innocent girl can be
youve saved the village from starvation youre a true hero of the people sir
yes here it is
is that a ring
its my ring and ill thank you to stop staring so lustily at it its worth more to me than anything in the world to me  that rat nelson stole it one night while i was sleeping
well im glad you were able to get it back
 hmph
oh  you
wh what do you want
just to thank you for helping us you fought bravely er 
severa  my names severa
it suits you somehow oh and my name  
cordelia i know
er yes thats  but how did you  im sorry did i introduce myself before
i guess you must have if i know your name gods 
i  i see well thank you all the same severa
you already said that and besides its not like i did anything special i was just fighting to get back whats rightfully mine
are you referring to that ring oh goodness it looks exactly like  ah i see that would explain how you know my name youre a friend of lucinas arent you  and youre my child isnt that right
mutter grumble  lonely 
what was that
i said i thought youd might be lonely so i came here to see you  youre welcome
thats very sweet
d dont mock me you dont care you dont care at all
how could you possibly think that im thrilled beyond words to meet you
 then whyd you leave me you said you had to go off to fight for what really mattered and you never came back you picked chrom over me
you have me at a disadvantage severa i cant answer for my future self but when i said i was fighting for what mattered i probably meant you id want nothing more than to build a world where you could grow up happy and strong at least thats what i want right now
you think i dont know that  i mean i do know that but 
im sorry i wasnt a better mother to you
well youre still my mother which makes you the best mother in the world
and the luckiest it seems
oh mom i missed you so much i  im sorry i was so mean  i just  i didnt want to lose you again  promise you wont leave okay promise
i promise

milord look risen
ugh and theres a village just ahead come on
help heeelp open the gates the dead walk the earth if youve any kindness in you open the gates were from woodham up the road you know us please open the  gods no  no theyre here aaaiiieeeeee
hmm  the townsfolk of this village are renowned for their hospitality how could they turn away refugees fearing for their lives
lets worry about saving those lives first we can ask questions later
shepherds are always welcome here please take this with you
shepherds are always welcome here please take this with you
listen there were refugees here and you turned them away why
were a peaceful town sir we have no weapons nor any want for them we survive by barring our gates to those who might bring us harm friend or foe harsh as it may be i cant have my people dying on account of other folks problems 
  
are you all right
oh thank goodness youve come are you here to help us
well hold them off run
u understood if we make it out alive ill repay you i swear
ive not the words to thank you nor the treasure to pay you but here take this i didnt think people like you still existed ill ill never forget this
do you suppose the village will continue to bar its gates to refugees
as long as they view the risen as someone elses problem then yes
they claim to love peace  yet the uneasy peace found behind a barricade is nothing id want peace begins when the fighting is over and the barricades come down i pray they can see the truth of that before its too late

 a mirage village
or rumors of one at any rate people claim to have spied a desert village that sometimes appears during sandstorms tales speak of a legendary goddess staff that sleeps there but who can really say
that sounds like it could be helpful it may be nothing more than idle talk but it still bears further investigation
just take care sir the sands are home to armed barbarians every year sees a few villagers go chasing the myth and finding the grave instead ill not stop you but be sure youre well armed and fully prepared
here we are boys the golden oasis they say the villages around here are filled to burstin with rare treasure kick down every door ya see dont let a single coin slip by
eureka its you
 curious i have no recollection of making your acquaintance though few things are as unreliable as the human memory
ah forgive me i forgot that you have not met me before my name is laurent are you here in search of the mirage village
that is my cause yes
mine as well though i fear my efforts thus far yield precious little progress still an excess of evidence exists for the village to be baseless rumor alone 
an assumption on your part that
might i accompany you in your search i feel certain that your help will lay exposed that which has eluded me alone
mmm i worry your hypothesis lacks a certain scientific rigor  and yet there exists the possibility i am in error on this count  so yes you are welcome to join us
excelsior i assure you ill not be a burden
chrom is that you
er yes and you are 
ah apologies i am laurent a traveling mage and scholar and perhaps more saliently i am miriels son
wait you mean our miriel oh right so then you must have traveled back and  er right
excellent your comprehension spares me the botheration of further explication
 yep youre miriels kid all right so have you come all this way in search of your mother
just so she wrote of a mirage village in one of her records i thought it might offer some clue to her current whereabouts and acquiring the goddess staff is a worthy motive besides
any luck with that
nay sir much to my vexation staff and village both elude me
i suppose it wouldnt be a legend if you could just stumble upon it in the market
well put and yet not all is lost meeting you here is success enough i was quickly reaching the limits of what one man can do alone might i lend my might to your cause i assure you i will not be a burden
of course wed love to have you
excelsior
that mirage village must be located very near to here  though i fear my own search for it has borne naught but ill fruit no doubt mother would have this mystery unraveled in moments were she here 
not many make it out this far you must be near exhausted from the sands here then take this as a reward for your efforts
 a mirage village no im afraid were quite the ordinary one ha ha ha perhaps youll find what you seek further west 
not many make it out this far you must be near exhausted from the sands here then take this as a reward for your efforts  a mirage village no everyone can see us just fine ha ha ha perhaps youll find what you seek on the far side of the oasis 
not many make it out this far you must be near exhausted from the sands here then take this as a reward for your efforts  a mirage village yes my mum used to sing cradle songs of such a thing find the last tree north of the oasis shore  then two steps north and one step more er or something like that its not like the place really exists anyway
well well this village does not often play host to outsiders  few hold faith in that which cannot be seen to exist yet i sense such faith in you here then claim what you have come for i hold my own faith that you will use it with wisdom
wheres that magic mirage village at talk or ill make you vanish too
the battle is won and the sun is fading wed best make tracks
just what was that place in the end something beyond our ken i suppose  maybe a small proof that faith even in the intangible can still be rewarded like faith in a better future perhaps  heh thats treasure enough for me
might i have a word
i dont see why not
tell me honestly how would you assess my performance
you have certain natural deficiencies but you compensate for them well i surmise this is the product of considerable time and effort
hah the best response yet youre as perspicacious as you are blunt mother
mother
indeed i am your future progeny
do you have concrete evidence to substantiate this proposition
i have a ring which is the same as yours quite literally
 fascinating it does appear identical
do two instances of a unique object coexisting constitute sufficient proof
to be sure time travel is one viable hypothesis to explain the rings but the possibility also exists that you pilfered the ring from said time traveler as a means of identification i fear it inconclusive
 an astute criticism im uncertain that any truly conclusive case can be mounted to prove my claim but i intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the matter if necessary a single minded pursuit of the truth may be the best proof of my heredity
this is a reasonable assumption but im afraid a unilateral investigation is hardly credible
then how should  
however i have no material evidence to suggest you are not as you claim my son i shall conduct an inquiry of my own well investigate the matter until a clear conclusion emerges  together until then i will grant the fundamental assumption that you are in fact my child
 thank you mother

i dont quite know how to reply to that
er please dont look at me so intently it makes me terribly bashful
what w wait dont go drat hes gone he totally stole my line too still its weird i didnt have a problem talking to him maybe his shyness countered my own
well then i should think five kills would be enough to impress a simple village girl though six might earn me a sweet kiss  hmmm  that is tempting
you all right
me hah it takes more than that to wound a rogue this charming now then who are you not an enemy it seems
im chrom leader of the shepherds we came to deal with bandits so it appears our purpose is shared
chrom then youre lucinas 
whats that

p please dont stare at me like that i get so terribly shy
arent you the one whos been staring at me and why did that line seem so familiar
er but yes we share a common foe and im grateful for the help can i trust you to defend this place
i dont know what are you planning
i aim to crush the rascals who make trouble for the village naturally and once the lot of them are sorted its off to tea with a beauty of the fields heh heh heh  right then if thats decided ill be on my way put the kettle on snookums i wont be long now
hes nothing if not eager 
well then i should think five kills would be enough to impress a simple village girl though six might earn me a sweet kiss  hmmm  that is tempting
you all right
me hah it takes more then that to wound a rogue this charming now then who are you not an enemy it seems

oh good she was so terribly eager to see you ah but forgive me i still havent introduced myself i am inigo lucinas younger brother and a crown prince of ylisse myself if you need further proof i bear a brand in the opposite eye as lucina
hmm yep thats a brand all right
um could i ask you to stop staring now i get a bit bashful
ah right sorry
aha ha not to worry now then its back into the fray with me father then its off for tea with a farm girl  and perhaps a bit more dont wait up aha ha ha
oh gods i raised a philanderer  well he seems content enough heh a son who knew

all who defy the will of grima will be purged in the flames of destruction
lord grima  rain down retribution 
thats the last of the bandits the hold is reclaimed
the villagers will sleep better for our good works milord
i cant begin to thank you good sir
actually inigo did most of the heavy lifting on this one
he is so terribly brave  part of me wishes i could have been there to witness it er but yes please accept this gift from all us villagers
your kindness flatters me if bandits ever trouble you again you need but call and well come running rebuilding a town is hard work but i trust youll be just fine
well do our best
um  olivia might i have a moment
wh what with me why  wait how did you know my name
a little bird tweeted it out so is that a yes
um all right i guess
 er yes you see  what i mean to say is  goodness this is much harder than chatting up other girls ive met i suppose it would be quickest to just show you this 
m my ring but  im wearing it how did you 
indeed how does inigo have your ring when there is only one in all the world unless it is your ring and i brought it back from the future
what you mean like lucina 
exactly i knew my mother was a dancer you see so ive been scouring the land looking for all the dancers i could find not the worst job in the world mind heh heh heh  but now ive finally found you mother and my dancing is all the better for it
oh you dance
er sort of yes that is to say i try my best but some people dont appreciate male dancers not that i care im content to just shake my hips for the ladies
oh dont listen to them i think its wonderful id  love to watch you dance sometime
n no impossible id be far too embarrassed for that besides id rather watch you dance
what n no i couldnt possibly
im shyer than you are mother
you are not

at last teatime has arrived
