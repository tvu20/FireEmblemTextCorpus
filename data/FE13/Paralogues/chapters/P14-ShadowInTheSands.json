It may be nothing more than idle talk, but it still bears further investigation."}, {"speaker": "Elder", "line": "Just take care, sir. The sands are home to armed barbarians.

I'm uncertain that any truly conclusive case can be mounted to prove my claim. But I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the matter, if necessary.
