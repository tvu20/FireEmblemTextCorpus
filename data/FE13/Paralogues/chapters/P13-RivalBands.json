A pile of corpses could still outfight you sorry lot!

Rival bands squabbling over some petty matter. A common enough sight in these dark times, milord.

Farm the land, and your fields are pillaged. Open a shop, and your goods are stolen. It's little wonder men take up steel and become mercenaries. ...Or worse. There's only so much gold to go around, and so they fight for dominance."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "Seems they'll continue to do so until it's safe to be a farmer or merchant again.

Shall we be on our way?"}, {"speaker": "Frederick", "line": "By the by, our erstwhile allies send their regards and a reward to match.

I was just born. You're the one who proved all that bridging-the-gap stuff. You're the one who married a human. Er, thanks for doing that, by the way. Even if I can't take credit for it, I'm proud of my heritage."}, {"speaker": "Panne", "line": "It gladdens me to see my son value pride... May you keep it always."}]}
