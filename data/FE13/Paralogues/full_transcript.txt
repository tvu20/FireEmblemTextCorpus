Chrom: What's wrong?
Merchant: Oh! Sirs, please! Help her! A young merchant girl is being set upon by bandits!
Chrom: We're on our way.



Vincent: You! We have business, you and I, and I aim to settle the debt. Victor will be avenged today!
Anna: Oh, dear. Have we met?
Vincent: Playing dumb won't save you, girly. The gold you net from the slavers will build Victor the finest grave in the land!
Anna: Careful, love. Prices aren't the only thing I can cut in half.

Anna: Hello there, handsome! Am I being rescued?
Chrom: Well, that was the plan, but you seem to be holding up just fine. Can you still fight?
Anna: I could stand to open a few more rogues, sure. Or locks, for that matter.
Chrom: A thief, is it?
Anna: Locksmith, thank you very much! But yes. Door or chest, I'll have it smiling wide in a trice. And it looks like there bandits have quite the hoard built up.
Chrom: ...Huh. Well then, I think we're in business.

@Character-Falls 
Anna: Ugh. Well, that was careless... Sorry, friends. Looks like I've got to close up shop for the day.

Chrom: Yes, I remember you.
Anna: Oh? ...Mmm, I'm afraid I'm drawing a blank.
Chrom: Huh? Oh, then I must be... I'm sorry. I thought you... Wait, what am I saying? I KNOW we helped you. I'm sure of it!
Anna: Oh! Hee hee! You must have met one of my sisters.
Chrom: Sisters? Gods, you look identical.
Anna: Yes, there's a strong family resemblance. Oh, and we're all traveling merchants.
Chrom: ...With the same name?
Anna: Yes, actually. That's part of the secret!
Chrom: Your family gatherings must be chaotic.
Anna: True, but aren't everyone's? Still, I can't just send you on your way after helping TWO of us. So let me come along and aid you in return. I can be quite useful. You'll never make a loss with me in tow—I guarantee it!

Robin: Is this the place?
Chrom: Yeah, it's got to be. The townsfolk spoke of ruins in these parts that carry the legacy of the divine dragon. Of course, they neglected to mention that the place is crawling with Risen... I suppose we're just gonna have to earn this treasure the old-fashioned way.

Robin: You...don't look like a treasure hunter. What brings you here?
Morgan: There you are, Mother! I was beginning to think we got separated.
Robin: ...I'm sorry, what?
Morgan: Well, no harm done. At least we can head home now. ...Goodness, the air here agrees with you! You look a decade younger, at least.
Robin: Wait. Let's go back to the Mother thing. ...Did you travel back from the future with Lucina?
Morgan: Huh? Who's Lucina? And did you seriously just ask me if I came from the future? ...Why are you looking at me like that? Hello? It's me! Morgan! ...Your son? Love of your life and strapping young lad and all that? Wow, you're really acting strange today. Let's go home and get you to bed. Hmm, but which way is home? Is it— Ngh! M-my head!
Robin: Easy—don't try to force it! Just stay calm and listen to me. I know this sounds mad, but I believe that you came here from the future.
Morgan: Are you out of your mind? That's not even possible!
Robin: Actually, it is. Think about it. You said I looked younger, but look again. Closely. Do I look like I'm of an age where I could have a child as old as you? At this point in time, in OUR time, you still haven't been born.
Morgan: Y-you do look younger, but...
Robin: It's hard, I know. And you don't have to believe me right this minute. But you must come with me. It's dangerous alone, especially if your memory is gone. I was in the same position once, you know. If Chrom hadn't found me lying in that field, who knows what would've happened to me...
Morgan: Wait, you woke up in the middle of a field, too? Hah! Like mother, like son, huh? Oh, that's too funny!
Robin: ...Glad to see you inherited my blithe outlook. Just try to stay close, will you?
Morgan: Yes, ma'am!

%Chrom,Morgan
Morgan: Mmm? Who are you?
Chrom: I would ask you the same. More importantly, why are you here? This is hardly a safe place to be wandering alone.
Morgan: I... I don't know, frankly. I woke up...sprawled in a field. I can't recall anything before that.
Chrom: That sounds familiar.
Morgan: I... I think I remember my name? ...Morgan? Yes, that's it. My name is Morgan.
Chrom: I'm Chrom. And finding amnesiacs is apparently my special talent. I met a good friend, Robin, under the same circumstances.
Morgan: Robin?! Is this friend of yours perchance a tactician?
Chrom: She is. Do you know her?
Morgan: Yes, I know her! She's my mother! ...Wait a second. You found my mother lying here unconscious?
Chrom: Well, not HERE. But yes, we found her lying in a field, memory-free. This was quite a while ago, mind you. So if you're her son, I take it you came from the future?
Morgan: ...From the future? Are you kidding, sir?! People can't travel through time! If that were possible, I— Ngh! M-my head!
Chrom: Woah, easy there. Try to stay calm. Listen, why don't you just come with us for now? You can speak to Robin later and maybe clear this up.

Morgan: Yes, I know her! She's my mother!
Chrom: Mother?! Then you're our... You're my... Morgan, stay calm and listen to me. Robin is my wife. Which means you're likely my son who came here from the future.
Morgan: ...What?! But I... The future?! Is... Is that why I have no memory? But wait, I remember my mother. So why don't I remember you?
Chrom: I don't know. Do you recall a sister named Lucina?
Morgan: No, nothing like that.
Chrom: I suppose it's a blessing you at least remember your mother. Maybe something will come back once you've met with her and Lucina. Until then, you'd best come with me. ...And stay close. I don't want you hurt.
Morgan: All right, thank you. And don't worry—I can defend myself. You just lead the way.

Morgan: The future I came from is in ruins... You're sure about that?
Robin: One possible future is in ruins, yes. But you may hail from another path. We're fighting now to ensure that no one's future is lost. Unfortunately, if you join us, it'll mean more fighting for you, too.
Morgan: I understand... I'm sorry, but even after hearing all that, I still don't remember anything but you.
Robin: Don't apologize. We'll pull your memory back bit by bit if we have to. Besides, if you start apologizing, I'll have to as well. My past is still full of holes, but I'm getting along. And you will too.

Robin: Hah! You really do take after me.
Morgan: You know, now that you mention it... There is one other thing I remember.

Dalen: Ya-har! A pile of corpses could still outfight you sorry lot! This is our territory, and no one gives orders to the Riders of Dawn!

Chrom: What do you make of that?
Frederick: Mercenaries, from the look. Rival bands squabbling over some petty matter. A common enough sight in these dark times, milord. But if it comes to bloodletting, the nearby villages will pay for it.
Chrom: Then let's make sure it doesn't.
Gyral: Stick 'em full'a holes, boys!
Dalen: Time to fertilize the fields, soldiers!
Chrom: Well, diplomacy is probably out.
Frederick: Seems our best option is to end the fighting as quickly as possible. Allying ourselves with one side or the other would certainly expedite things.
Chrom: A band of riders or a band of knights... Time to make our choice.

@Battle 
Gyral: More sellswords? Ha! Your timing is right impeccable. I'll buy your steel and see you're well compensated for the trouble!
Chrom: Well, Robin? Shall we back the knights?

Dalen: Ya-har! There's a sensible lad. Come fight with us, instead! I'll pay you twice what that fool would!
Chrom: Robin?

Panne: So you came with that man-spawn Lucina, did you? Hmm... Explain to me why my son consorts with common thugs?
Yarne: Huh? H-hey, I didn't have a choice in the matter! You were nowhere to be found, and roaming around alone is a recipe for... extinction. I'd figure I'd be safe if I took up with some strong allies, and so I... Wait, are you angry? Because you look kind of ang—

@End 
Frederick: The fighting is over, milord. That should spare the villages from any further damage.
Chrom: Good. Thought I still don't understand why they had to fight in the first place.
Frederick: Competition, milord. A sad consequence of this war. Farm the land, and your fields are pillaged. Open a shop, and your goods are stolen. It's little wonder men take up steel and become mercenaries. ...Or worse. There's only so much gold to go around, and so they fight for dominance.
Chrom: Seems they'll continue to do so until it's safe to be a farmer or merchant again. All the more reason for us to end things as quickly as possible.
Frederick: Well put, milord. Shall we be on our way?

Frederick: By the by, our erstwhile allies send their regards and a reward to match. War's an expensive proposition, but I wager blood money spends the same as any other. I'll see it's added to our tally.
Chrom: Thank you, Frederick.

Panne: You.
Yarne: Gyah! Y-you scared me! Don't go sneaking up behind people! You'll give them whiplash...

Yarne: Yarne. Don't you remember? You're the one who gave it to me.
Panne: ...So you truly are my child?
Yarne: Um, I'm a taguel, right? I kind of have to be.
Panne: I suppose blood does not lie. I am pleased to see you, my son. You represent a new hope for our race.
Yarne: No pressure there...
Panne: You are living proof that man and taguel can coexist.
Yarne: Hey, I didn't do anything special. I was just born. You're the one who proved all that bridging-the-gap stuff. You're the one who married a human. Er, thanks for doing that, by the way. Even if I can't take credit for it, I'm proud of my heritage.

Donnel: I wish I was strong as you sirs and madams! Kick that scum out single handed, I would!

Lucina: ...Are you certain?
Tiki: I am. I've had quite enough of living in solitude, thank you. Besides, I've always longed to better know this world. Now I can help you save it.

Say'ri: For all the talk of power, she was a gentle soul, and far too fragile...
Chrom: Indeed. But I fear there's no time to grieve, Say'ri. We must keep moving. We'll try to bring her peace by securing it for the world.

@Intro 
Morristan: Send the new recruits along, then get to rounding up another half dozen or so.
Elder: W-wait, what are you doing?!
Morristan: Just what it looks like. A wyvern rider without a wyvern to sit on is just a bloke in a lizard hat.
Elder: Wyverns are the sacred protectors of this land, not glorified horses to be muzzled!
Morristan: I'd muzzle you, had I the time. As it stands, I'll take a quicker path to quiet. G'night! 
Elder: Gwargh! 
Villager: N-no...! Run!
Soldier: Your orders, sir?
Morristan: If word spreads, it'll only get more tedious. Sooo...yes. Better just kill everyone.

Chrom: Where does this road lead?
Frederick: To Wyvern Valley, milord. Home to Valm's greatest feral wyvern population.
Chrom: That sounds...interesting. We'll have to be sure and keep our distance.
Cherche: Shame. My Minerva's fit to burst. She's excited others of her kind are near.
Chrom: Oh? She doesn't look that excited to me. Not that I can really tell the difference...
Cherche: Oh, it's easy. She just looks even cuter than normal. Don't you, girl? Don't you look cuter? Who's a goooood wyvern?!
Chrom: I'll, uh...leave you to her, then.

Villager: Sir, over here! Please help! My friends will die if you don't!
Gerome: ...No.
Villager: Wh-what?! But, sir, my friends!
Gerome: I'm not fit to fight for anyone.
Villager: Th-then...they're lost...

Chrom: You there! What's happened?
Villager: My people are fleeing for their lives from a pack of armed brigands, sir! And now we've gotten separated... Oh, the horror of it all!
Chrom: Well, today's your lucky day. We'll aid you and your friends.
Villager: You will?! Oh, thank you! Please, sir! Give 'em what for!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Cherche,Gerome
Cherche: Wait. You're not one of the villagers.
Gerome: No. ...I am Gerome. A traveler.
Cherche: And a fellow wyvern rider, I see. This is a piece of good news! We fight to keep these villagers alive. Will you aid us?
Gerome: Why? No man can stop fate.
Cherche: These people will be killed by spears, traveler. Not fate.
Gerome: Heh. Spoken like one who has yet to witness fate's implacable cruelty.
Cherche: So you do nothing, then, save wandering the land in the fog of cowardice? And your wyvern? Has she seen enough? Does she also yearn to surrender?
Gerome: ...... You would know better than I.
Cherche: What does that mean?
Gerome: Nothing. I'll fight if you wish it. Death will always have its due, but perhaps it will accept a few substitutions. Come, my dear Minerva. Join me on one final flight...

%Chrom,Gerome
Chrom: Are you with the villagers? Who are you?
Gerome: ...I am Gerome. A traveler.
Chrom: These people are in desperate straits. Will you help us?
Gerome: It is not for me to interfere in such matters. Death will always have its due.
Chrom: You would leave innocents to die and lay the blame on fate?
Gerome: I've seen too much of fate's cruel work to doubt it.
Chrom: So you would surrender rather than struggle against such cruelty... I cannot understand such thinking. A bleak past doesn't justify condemning the future to bleakness as well. Nonetheless, I cannot force your hand. Join us if you will. 
Gerome: What does he know of bleak futures? It is a fool who breaks himself against fate's tide. That said, I suppose I'm as big a fool as any... *sigh* Very well, then. Come, my dear Minerva. Join me on one final flight...

@Character-Falls 
Gerome: Death...always has its...due... Go, Minerva... Be...free...

@Battle 
Morristan: Seems these newcomers have spine. Send word to the boys at the hold. Tell 'em we've got spines that need breaking.

@Boss 
Morristan: Wyvern or man, everyone's all snarl and fire until they learn the feel of the lash!

@End 
Villager: Our saviors! And it's more than lives you rescued... You've saved my hope in humanity, too. I thank you for it. Here, sir. A token of my gratitude
Chrom: Thanks to you as well, friend.
Villager: Take care, now. We'll pray for a safe journey for you and your troops.

Cherche: Do you have a moment?
Gerome: What is it?
Cherche: I was hoping you might introduce me to your wyvern.
Gerome: Why?
Cherche: To see which of ours is cuter. Not very sporting of me when mine is the finest in the world, I know.
Gerome: ...Do as you please.
Cherche: I will, then! Thank you. ...... ...Hee hee! Oh, but you ARE cute! She's nearly a match with Minerva! ...Nearly so in every way. Wait, what sorcery is this? They...they look IDENTICAL!
Gerome: That's because they are identical. They're one and the same.
Cherche: ...M-Minerva? How is that possible?
Gerome: You could examine her from tip to tail looking for scars and marks if you like. ...Or you could just look at this ring.
Cherche: I...I know that ring. So then you're...
Gerome: I am, though I had not intended that we meet.
Cherche: Why not?
Gerome: I came back in time so I might release Minerva. Not to seek out parents to whom I've already bidden farewell.
Cherche: You crossed the bounds of time just to set Minerva free? Whatever for?!
Gerome: In the future I know, she is among the last of her kind. I...I could not leave her to that solitude.
Cherche: She is lucky indeed to know someone of such kindness. ...As, I imagine, am I.
Gerome: Stay your words. I've no intention of getting close to you. Fate will not be mocked. This war may claim your life anew, and I'll not weep twice for losing the same mother. My burden is heavy enough.
Cherche: But yet you carry it still.
Gerome: That's enough. 
Cherche: Thank you, Gerome.

Kjelle: Dishonorable cur! You killed my master, and now you will face me!
Cassius: If that pile of pudding was your master, I'd advise you to just keep walking.
Kjelle: Craven dog... You claimed a hostage! He'd never have lost in a fair fight!
Maiden: Nor would he have wanted this, Kjelle. If I lose you as well, I...
Kjelle: You won't lose me. I swear it. And I swear your husband will be avenged!
Cassius: If you want to run headlong into the grave, girl, I won't stop you. We can duel in the ruins ahead.

Robin: What do you make of this, Chrom?
Chrom: I hope she knows what she's getting into.
Maiden: Sir! Please! You have to do something!
Chrom: What's the matter?
Maiden: It's my friend, sir. I fear she's walking into a terrible trap! That scoundrel Cassius would never fight an honest duel. My husband took a similar stand against his tyranny not long ago. The brute took a girl hostage and then cut my husband down as he lowered his weapon! *Sniff* I can't let her suffer the same fate... I'd die, I would!
Chrom: All right. We'll see what we can do.

@Battle 
Kjelle: Coward! You promised me a duel, you soulless blackheart!
Cassius: Indeed I did. Consider all these men my seconds, heh. Still, I'm not a monster. I'll spare your life if you get on your knees and beg.
Kjelle: I'd sooner die!
Cassius: Well, we can arrange that, too. Have at her, boys!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Sully,Kjelle
Sully: Hey. You got a second?
Kjelle: Ahh!
Sully: What? I got something on my face?
Kjelle: N-no, you just...remind me of someone. Forgive me. I have no time to talk.
Sully: Don't worry. It won't take long. So listen. These lowlifes have no honour. You know that, right? If you meet 'em head-on, you'll just end up with a sword in your back.
Kjelle: Head-on is how I live.
Sully: ...Ooh, I like you. And that's all the more reason I can't let you charge off on your own.
Kjelle: Don't try to stop me!
Sully: I'm not stopping you. I'm coming with you. You just focus on finishing your duel, and I'll kill any idiot who gets in the way.
Kjelle: R-right!

%Chrom,Kjelle
Chrom: Excuse me—
Kjelle: Wha—?! Die, fiend! Y-you parried my spear. ...How did you do that?
Chrom: I get a lot of practice. Now can you please stop trying to skewer me for a second? We're not your enemies. A friend sent us to help you. There are too many for you to fight alone, no matter your skill. We'll take care of the rabble while you fight your duel.
Kjelle: You would do this for a stranger?
Chrom: Is that a problem?
Kjelle: N-no, of course not. Thank you.

%Chrom,Kjelle
Chrom: Excuse me—
Kjelle: Wha—?! Die, fiend! Y-you parried my spear. But how did you... Wait. Do I know you? I feel as if we've met, but... No, that's impossible.
Chrom: I hate to interrupt your musing, but could you perhaps lower your spear? We've been sent here to help you. They are too many for you to fight alone. We'll take care of the rabble while you fight your duel.
Kjelle: You would do this for a stranger?
Chrom: Is that a problem?
Kjelle: N-no, of course not. Thank you.

@Boss 
Cassius: Most people think a man who fights dirty is too weak to win otherwise. Heh heh... Suits me just fine. A cocky fool is an easy target!

%Kjelle,Cassius
Kjelle: If you believe in gods, you'd better pray to them now!
Cassius: My, my. Aren't we confident?
Kjelle: I don't fear you, coward!
Cassius: Aye, I suppose not. Most fools assume that liars and sneaks like me are weak. They want us to be weak, see? They NEED it. It lets them hold on to the fantasy that right prevails in the end. Heh... They can think what they want. A cocky fool is an easy target. Truth is, in the end, it's the clever ones who always survive.
Kjelle: A man who takes hostages in order to win a duel has no claim to cleverness. Even an animal would not stoop so low! But enough. I've no more words to waste on the likes of you. My master will have vengeance!
Cassius: Wrong, girl. Your master will have COMPANY!

@End 
Maiden: Kjelle! Thank the gods you're safe!
Kjelle: I kept my promise. Your husband can rest in peace now.
Maiden: I may have a way to thank you. This was his, and I'm sure he would have wanted you to have it.
Kjelle: This is a precious keepsake. Its rightful place is with you.
Maiden: I'll not forget my husband for lack of a memento, dear. Now please, take it.
Kjelle: You're certain?
Maiden: Absolutely.
Kjelle: Then...thank you.
Maiden: Just swear to take care of yourself, Kjelle. Swear you'll stay safe.
Kjelle: I swear it.

Sully: Looks like the good guys won after all. Ain't that a kick in the teeth?
Kjelle: Thank you for your help, but I fear other tasks yet lie ahead of me. I still have to find my parents.
Sully: Aw, hell. Your parents are missing? That's rough, kid. Any idea where they might have gone?
Kjelle: I have a ring my father gave my mother, but precious little else to go on.
Sully: Mind if I take a look?
Kjelle: No, of course not.
Sully: Well, I'll be damned... Kid? This is MY ring.
Kjelle: Your ring? But then...
Sully: Hah! I get it. You're one of the kids who came back with Lucina, yeah? Which means...I've got a new lead for you on the parent front, kiddo. ...I'm your mom.
Kjelle: Y-you?!
Sully: You expecting someone prettier?
Kjelle: N-no! Of course not! I mean... You look as beautiful now as when I knew you.
Sully: Har! So I'm not all wrinkled or missing a hand or anything? That's a relief.
Kjelle: You were a beautiful and vibrant woman, despite the ill times we lived in. You taught me how to be strong. You taught me to survive.
Sully: All right, kid, sit down. I want to know every last detail about the future.
Kjelle: You bet!
Sully: ...Is that how you address you mother?
Kjelle: I mean, y-yes! Yes ma'am!
Sully: Much better.
Kjelle: Hee hee. You always were tough on me.
Sully: That's right. Any child of mine is gonna have to learn to respect their elders!
Kjelle: ...It's good to see you, Mother.

Ezra: All alone are you lamb? Off searching for dear old mum? How very sweet. But the world's a dangerous place my dear, full of wolves waiting to snatch you up.
Noire: Um... th-thank you for the warning, sir, b-but...
Ezra: That's no warning, lamb. I'm a wolf, and you've been snatched! Now come quietly. Scars tend to lower the sale price.
Frederick: Slavers, milord. Such damnable scum...
Chrom: We'll have to hurry if we hope to catch them.
Tharja: Or we could stay here and just let me go to work on them. A curse to wither them away, perhaps? A slow death over a year? Oh, fie. Let's make it two.
Chrom: I think their captive would likely appreciate something a bit more immediate. Shepherds! Saving the girl is our top priority! Now move out!

@Battle 
Noire: It's over... My life is over... Mother, I'll be by your side soon...

Noire: So this is how it ends... Killed... or worse. A clean death would be a mercy compared to what awaits... Huh? What's this? An old bow? Hmm, the string's still taut. I suppose I could use this to try and fight my way out. B-but those bandits are so strong and scary and... W-wait! My talisman! Let me just grab my talisman and then... ...... ...I AM THE FIRE AND FURY! ALL WHO DEFY ME WILL PERISH! REPENT, SCUM! REPENT THOUGH IT WILL SAVE YOU NOT! REPENT AND DESPAIR! BWAAA HA HA HA HA!

Tharja: What do you want?
Noire: I, um... I mean... Er... H-here, please look at this.
Tharja: Nice ring. Looks just like mine. You messing around with alchemy? Or is this something... darker?
Noire: Wha--? N-no! It's nothing of the sort! It's just...
Tharja: Tell me the truth, girl. You don't want to see what happens if you lie to me.
Noire: P-please, just give me... I n-need a moment... M-my talisman... Wh-where is my talisman... ......
Tharja: ......
Noire: I AM BLOOD AND THUNDER! I AM A RIGHTEOUS FURY! ...I AM YOUR FUTURE DAUGHTER!
Tharja: You are trying my patience.
Noire: INSOLENCE! I speak the truth! The ring I bear also hails from the future. A memento of you, my departed mother!
Tharja: And that bizarre talisman?
Noire: Your own handiwork! Wrought to steel the mewling heart of your coward daughter! In its strength did I find blessed escape from grief and solitude! Fear of death and killing, too, it drove from me, until I became an avatar of retribution! Only by clinging to it have I survived the crushing desolation of a ruinated future! BWAA HA HA HA HA!
Tharja: Oh, give me that.
Noire: Um, w-wait! I need that! Without it, I can't--
Tharja: Survive? You can and will. And not by becoming some avatar of retribution. Just be my daughter. Leave the retribution to me.
Noire: M-Mother...
Tharja: My, this is a nasty little number. The future me is good. ...And very, very bad. Hee hee. I can't wait.
Noire: M-Mother, you're f-frightening me! ...A-again!
Tharja: This little trinket will advance my research in the dark arts nicely... Hmm... You have my blood, right? I'm going to need a bit of it back.
Noire: Aaaaiiieee! I... I mean... BLEED ME DRY AND I SHALL BE AS THUNDER STILL!

Nah: Whew, good thing you spoke up there... I was about to melt you with my breath.
Chrom: Huh? Your breath seems fine to me...? ...Oh. I get it. You're a manakete. So perhaps you'd like to tell me your name?
Nah: Nah.
Chrom: Look, if I somehow offended you, I apologize. But you could at least-
Nah: No, NAH. N-A-H. That's my name. Ugh, why does this always happen...
Chrom: Er, right. Let's discuss it later, okay? For now, just stay behind me.
Nah: Behind you? I can turn into a dragon, you know. I'm pretty strong.
Chrom: Dragonkin or no, you're still a child, and I won't have you taking unnecessary risks. Now let's get you out of here.

Nah: I'm sure. And thank you. You won't regret it.

Nah: Can I ask you something, Nowi? Does this look familiar?
Nowi: Whoa, you have the same ring as me! What a crazy coincidence!
Nah: It's not a coincidence. This is your ring. It's a memento of my mother. From... the future. It keeps me safe, now that... Now that you're gone.
Nowi: Nah...
Nah: No, I'm serious. It does.
Nowi: Huh? Oh, hee hee! You did it to yourself that time! But no, I think it's very sweet. And now that you're with me, you don't have to hold back.
Nah: I wasn't holding back. I fought as hard as I could...
Nowi: No, you fought brilliantly, Nah. But that's not what I meant. I was talking about your tears. If you're sad, you can talk to me.
Nah: No, I... I have to be strong. Everyone expects me to. I can turn into a dragon, you know? And that's not... normal. So I have to put on a brave face and protect everyone, just like you do.
Nowi: Your mother cries all the time, dear. ...Aaaaaall the time. Trust me on this—holding things back won't make you stronger. Just be you, Nah. That's enough.
Nah: I... This whole time, I...
Nowi: I know it's been pretty scary, but you made it through!
Nah: *Sniff* Mother, I... Oh, it was awful... I thought I was going to DIE... *Sob* Waaaaaah!

Cynthia: Oh, but you WILL! Isn’t that great?! I came from the FUTURE, Mother! See? Our rings match up and everything! It’s ‘cause you gave it to me! Or you will. I mean, later. Before I come back here, but after I... Gods, this is confusing!
Sumia: You...you’re my daughter...?
Cynthia: I sure am! I missed you so, Mother. Come here. Give me a hug— Whoops!  Ooh. That one’s gonna bruise... Er, don’t worry about me. I’m fine!
Sumia: ...Well, we’re definitely related. Hold on. You dropped something. ...A spearhead?
Cynthia: S-sorry! I’ll take that back!
Sumia: Why are you carrying that around?
Cynthia: Because it hasn’t been made yet. You promised me we’d make it together.
Sumia: I did?
Cynthia: But you broke your promise the day... The day you never came home. How could you leave me, Mother? You were a legend! You were invincible!
Sumia: Wait, are you saying I...died? I’m so sorry, love. I guess I’m not much of a legend after all.
Cynthia: ...You are to me.
Sumia: ...I may not be invincible, but at least I was blessed with a wonderful child. Had we decided what sort of haft to give the spear? We can pick up the materials in the next town.
Cynthia: W-we can?
Sumia: I made a promise, didn’t I?

Villager: This can't go on, Elder! We barely have enough to get us by as it is!
Elder: Their leader is a former Valmese general! We'll be crushed if we resist...
Chrom: What's that about Valm?
Villager: Who are you?
Chrom: My name is Chrom.
Elder: The ruler of Ylisse?!
Villager: Elder! He may be able to help us!
Chrom: Um, I can hear you. But tell me your problem, and I'll see what I can do.
Elder: Oh, thank you, sir!

Soldier: Urgent news, sir! Armed soldiers approach! Their leader claims to be Chrom of Ylisse!
Nelson: Dammit! Why would he come here? Well, if they insist on dogging me, I've got hounds of my own to welcome them with.
Severa: I'm not your dog, scum!
Nelson: No, only a stray mutt that refuses to stop yapping. But you'll be a good dog and do as I say if you ever want--
Severa: Yes, yes, if I ever want to see it again. I'm well aware.
Nelson: I trust you're equally aware of your position, Holland?
Holland: ......
Nelson: Loquacious as ever, I see. You'll fight for me, or I'll have that lazy tongue pried from your head. Now, then, Chrom may have the Fire Emblem in his possession... And if I claim that, I've practically claimed the throne. So go out there, kill anything that moves, and get me that Emblem!

@Battle 
Chrom: Looks like this is the castle the villagers told us about. Let's reclaim what's been stolen and return it to the villagers.
Severa: All this grief over something so small... Once I get what I came for, I'm out of here. Maybe I can convince Holland to come with me.

Cordelia: Have we met? If so, I'm afraid I've quite forgotten.
Severa: Well, excuse me for being so forgettable!
Cordelia: Look, there's no time for this. If you're a friend, speak now. If not, then stay out of Chrom's way or I'll have to cut you down.
Severa: Chrom, Chrom, Chrom! It's ALWAYS Chrom with you!
Cordelia: ...I'm sorry?
Severa: You should be! And I don't care about your stupid Chrom, so you can just drop it! ...I only want to talk to Holland.
Cordelia: Holland?
Severa: Yes, Holland! That sad sack over there. Watch my back so I can get to him safely, and then I'll help your stupid army!
Cordelia: O...okay?
Severa: Oh, and Holland's not here of his own will, so don't you dare hurt him!

%Chrom,Severa
Chrom: What's a child doing here?
Severa: Child? I'm not a child, you oaf! I'm... Wait, are you the enemy general?
Chrom: I don't know. Are we enemies?
Severa: You're Chrom, aren't you? You're Lucina's father.
Chrom: That's right. ...And I suppose you came back here with my daughter?
Severa: Oh, good. Now I won't have to waste time explaining the situation. ...Weird. I didn't think you'd be so funny looking.
Chrom: You're a real charmer. But charm or not, if you can fight, you're welcome to join our cause.
Severa: Not the snappiest pick-up line I've heard, but I suppose it gets the job done. But I can't leave until I reclaim my property from Nelson. We'll talk then.
Chrom: Actually, we're here to take stolen goods back to the village. If I promise to add yours to the list, will that persuade you?
Severa: Mmm... Maybe. But you'll have to help my friend Holland, too. He's a bit of a sad sack, but he doesn't want to be here either.
Chrom: Will he listen to reason?
Severa: He will if I talk to him. He listens to pretty much whatever I say. Don't worry, he hates Nelson, too. Just be sure not to hurt him.
Chrom: We'll be careful.

@Battle 
Severa: Holland, no! You idiot! Now you'll never get to see your wife again or meet your new child... I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Families never stay together...

Severa: Holland!
Holland: Severa! What are you doing here? If he knows you left your post...
Severa: I'm leaving, Holland, and you're coming with me.
Holland: Severa, I... I can't. You know I can't. I have a wife. If I don't earn Nelson's coin, she'll starve. I know it's blood money, but--
Severa: Your wife is PREGNANT, Holland! You know that, don't you?!
Holland: Of course I know that! And it's none of your concern!
Severa: Do you love your child, Holland? Do you love your wife?
Holland: Of course I do!
Severa: Then stop making excuses! I know that parents will do anything for their children... But I also know how it feels when a child loses her parents. This world's got far too many kids who've gone through that. If you stay, you'll be killed or worse. And your child deserves better!
Holland: Severa, I... I'm sorry. I didn't know. That must have been hard for you. ...... You're right. My child deserves better. Let's get out of here.
Severa: Really?!
Holland: Yes, really. But we have to hurry!

Severa: It's my ring, and I'll thank you to stop staring so lustily at it! It's worth more to me than anything in the world to me... That rat Nelson stole it one night while I was sleeping.
Chrom: Well, I'm glad you were able to get it back.
Severa: ...Hmph.

Cordelia: Oh. ...You.
Severa: Wh-what do you want?!
Cordelia: Just to thank you for helping us. You fought bravely, er...
Severa: Severa. ...My name's Severa.
Cordelia: It suits you somehow. Oh, and my name--
Severa: Cordelia. I know.
Cordelia: Er, yes, that's... But how did you...? I'm sorry, did I introduce myself before?
Severa: I guess you must have if I know your name. Gods...
Cordelia: I... I see. Well, thank you all the same, Severa.
Severa: You already said that! And besides, it's not like I did anything special. I was just fighting to get back what's rightfully mine.
Cordelia: Are you referring to that ring? Oh, goodness. It looks exactly like... Ah I see. That would explain how you know my name. You're a friend of Lucina's, aren't you? ...And you're my child. Isn't that right?
Severa: *Mutter* *grumble* ...lonely...
Cordelia: What was that?
Severa: I SAID, I thought you'd might be lonely, so I came here to see you! ...You're welcome.
Cordelia: That's very sweet.
Severa: D-don't mock me! You don't care! You don't care at all!
Cordelia: How could you possibly think that? I'm thrilled beyond words to meet you.
Severa: ...Then why'd you leave me? You said you had to go off to fight for what really mattered, and you never came back! You picked Chrom over me!
Cordelia: You have me at a disadvantage, Severa. I can't answer for my future self. But when I said I was fighting for what mattered, I probably meant you. I'd want nothing more than to build a world where you could grow up happy and strong. At least, that's what I want right now.
Severa: You think I don't know that...? I mean, I DO know that, but...
Cordelia: I'm sorry I wasn't a better mother to you.
Severa: Well, you're still MY mother, which makes you the best mother in the world.
Cordelia: And the luckiest, it seems.
Severa: Oh, Mom, I missed you so much! I... I'm sorry I was so mean... I just... I didn't want to lose you again... Promise you won't leave, okay? Promise!
Cordelia: I promise.

Chrom: Let's worry about saving those lives first. We can ask questions later.

@Battle 
Elder: Shepherds are always welcome here. Please, take this with you.

Elder: Shepherds are always welcome here. Please, take this with you.
Chrom: Listen. There were refugees here and you turned them away. Why?
Elder: We're a peaceful town, sir. We have no weapons, nor any want for them. We survive by barring our gates to those who might bring us harm—friend or foe. Harsh as it may be, I can't have my people dying on account of other folks' problems...
Chrom: ......

Chrom: Are you all right?!
Villager: Oh, thank goodness you've come! Are you here to help us?
Chrom: We'll hold them off! Run!

Frederick: Do you suppose the village will continue to bar its gates to refugees?
Chrom: As long as they view the Risen as someone else's problem, then yes.
Frederick: They claim to love peace... Yet the uneasy peace found behind a barricade is nothing I'd want. Peace begins when the fighting is over and the barricades come down. I pray they can see the truth of that before it's too late...

Chrom: ...A mirage village?
Elder: Or rumors of one, at any rate. People claim to have spied a desert village that sometimes appears during sandstorms. Tales speak of a legendary Goddess Staff that sleeps there, but who can really say?
Chrom: That sounds like it could be helpful. It may be nothing more than idle talk, but it still bears further investigation.
Elder: Just take care, sir. The sands are home to armed barbarians. Every year sees a few villagers go chasing the myth and finding the grave instead. I'll not stop you, but be sure you're well armed and fully prepared.

Laurent: Eureka! It's you!
Miriel: ...Curious. I have no recollection of making your acquaintance. Though few things are as unreliable as the human memory.
Laurent: Ah, forgive me. I forgot that you have not met me before. My name is Laurent. Are you here in search of the mirage village?
Miriel: That is my cause, yes.
Laurent: Mine as well, though I fear my efforts thus far yield precious little progress. Still, an excess of evidence exists for the village to be baseless rumor alone...
Miriel: An assumption on your part, that.
Laurent: Might I accompany you in your search? I feel certain that your help will lay exposed that which has eluded me alone.
Miriel: Mmm. I worry your hypothesis lacks a certain scientific rigor... And yet, there exists the possibility I am in error on this count... So...yes. You are welcome to join us.
Laurent: Excelsior! I assure you, I'll not be a burden.

%Chrom,Laurent
Laurent: Chrom? Is that you?
Chrom: Er, yes. And you are...?
Laurent: Ah, apologies! I am Laurent, a traveling mage and scholar. And perhaps more saliently, I am Miriel's son.
Chrom: Wait, you mean OUR Miriel? Oh, right. So then you must have traveled back and... Er, right?
Laurent: Excellent! Your comprehension spares me the botheration of further explication.
Chrom: ...Yep. You're Miriel's kid all right. So have you come all this way in search of your mother?
Laurent: Just so. She wrote of a mirage village in one of her records. I thought it might offer some clue to her current whereabouts. And acquiring the Goddess Staff is a worthy motive, besides.
Chrom: Any luck with that?
Laurent: Nay, sir. Much to my vexation, staff and village both elude me.
Chrom: I suppose it wouldn't be a legend if you could just stumble upon it in the market.
Laurent: Well put! And yet, not all is lost. Meeting you here is success enough. I was quickly reaching the limits of what one man can do alone. Might I lend my might to your cause? I assure you I will not be a burden.
Chrom: Of course. We'd love to have you.
Laurent: Excelsior!

@Visit
Laurent: That mirage village must be located very near to here... Though I fear my own search for it has borne naught but ill fruit. No doubt Mother would have this mystery unraveled in moments, were she here...

Elder: Not many make it out this far. You must be near exhausted from the sands. Here, then. Take this as a reward for your efforts.

Elder: ...A mirage village? No, I'm afraid we're quite the ordinary one! Ha ha ha! Perhaps you'll find what you seek further west...

Elder: Not many make it out this far. You must be near exhausted from the sands. Here, then. Take this as a reward for your efforts. ...A mirage village? No, everyone can see us just fine! Ha ha ha! Perhaps you'll find what you seek on the far side of the oasis...

Elder: Not many make it out this far. You must be near exhausted from the sands. Here, then. Take this as a reward for your efforts. ...A mirage village? Yes, my mum used to sing cradle songs of such a thing. Find the last tree north of the oasis shore... Then two steps north and one step more! Er, or something like that. It's not like the place really exists, anyway.

Elder: Well, well. This village does not often play host to outsiders... Few hold faith in that which cannot be seen to exist, yet I sense such faith in you. Here, then. Claim what you have come for. I hold my own faith that you will use it with wisdom.

@Boss 
Nombry: Where's that magic mirage village at? Talk, or I'll make you vanish, too!

@End 
Chrom: The battle is won, and the sun is fading. We'd best make tracks.

Chrom: Just what was that place, in the end? Something beyond our ken, I suppose... Maybe a small proof that faith, even in the intangible, can still be rewarded? Like faith in a better future, perhaps. ...Heh. That's treasure enough for me.

Laurent: Might I have a word?
Miriel: I don't see why not.
Laurent: Tell me honestly—how would you assess my performance?
Miriel: You have certain natural deficiencies, but you compensate for them well. I surmise this is the product of considerable time and effort.
Laurent: Hah! The best response yet! You're as perspicacious as you are blunt, Mother.
Miriel: Mother?
Laurent: Indeed. I am your future progeny.
Miriel: Do you have concrete evidence to substantiate this proposition?
Laurent: I have a ring which is the same as yours. Quite literally.
Miriel: ...Fascinating. It does appear identical.
Laurent: Do two instances of a unique object coexisting constitute sufficient proof?
Miriel: To be sure, time travel is one viable hypothesis to explain the rings. But the possibility also exists that you pilfered the ring from said time traveler. As a means of identification, I fear it inconclusive.
Laurent: ...An astute criticism. I'm uncertain that any truly conclusive case can be mounted to prove my claim. But I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the matter, if necessary. A single-minded pursuit of the truth may be the best proof of my heredity.
Miriel: This is a reasonable assumption. But I'm afraid a unilateral investigation is hardly credible.
Laurent: Then how should--
Miriel: However, I have no material evidence to suggest you are not, as you claim, my son. I shall conduct an inquiry of my own. We'll investigate the matter until a clear conclusion emerges. ...Together. Until then, I will grant the fundamental assumption that you are, in fact, my child.
Laurent: ...Thank you, Mother.

Villager: You have our thanks for your bravery. I'm afraid this medicine is all I can offer in return, but I pray it keeps you safe.

Villager: You're a kind soul to fight for strangers so. Here, you must take this.
Owain: By the ghost of Ike! I've found it at last! The fated mate of my sword hand! ...The divine blade, Mystletainn!
Villager: Er, I'm afraid this is a blade of extremely common make, sir. I was using it to dig a well, but I figured you might--
Owain: Come, Mystletainn! Destiny beckons!
Villager: I also used it to cut small vegetables before it got dull. ...Er, hello?
Owain: The blade of legend and song... I feel its power coursing through me! At last, my sword hand lays calm. Come, Mystletainn. Destiny beckons! The rest of these rogues are ours alone!

@Boss 
Gecko: This treasure's mine! Cross me, and I'll decorate this place with your bones!

@End 
Villager: We owe you a great debt for protecting our village. Truly, from all of us, thank you.

Lissa: Where did he get off to? Lucina said she saw him go this way. ..... Ugh, maybe I should just forget it. If he doesn't have one, either.....  Aaah!
Ruffian: Keh heh! Let's have all your coin girly! Unless you wanna lose that pretty head.
Lissa: Stay back!
Owain: No one hurts the mother of Owain! SACRED...STOOOOOONES! 
Ruffian: Guhaaargh! 
Owain: Mother, are you all right?!
Lissa: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm... Holy crow! Your arm!
Owain: This? Hah! It's nothing but a torn sleeve.
Lissa: ...No, I mean, HOLY CROW! LOOK AT THAT THING ON YOUR ARM!
Owain: Oh right! Sorry. Guess I should have shown you before. It's my Brand. The one carried by House Ylisse. So no more need to worry, eh?
Lissa: Th-then you know? That I don't...
Owain: That your Brand never surfaced? Yes, you told me as much. You said it always weighed on you... You should have seen how happy you were the day mine appeared! You were sobbing and laughing for an hour without pause!
Lissa: I was kind of hoping to grow out of the crying thing...
Owain: Yes, well. No more worrying. It was by chance alone that your Brand never surfaced. We're all family, linked by blood. You really are Chrom's sister. My Brand proves our lineage.
Lissa: Thank you. Just... *sniff* Thank you, Owain.
Owain: You're welcome!
Lissa: Heh... *sniff*
Owain: And as scions of the hero, it falls on us to ensure my dark future doesn't come true. Come, Mother! We shall fight together! Uh-oh... Argh... Too much...passion! Sword hand...getting hungry...again!
Lissa: You know, maybe you should have that looked at.

@Intro 
Robin: *Huff, huff* Why do mountains... have to... be so steep?
Olivia: Here. Have some water.
Robin: Thank you, Olivia. You're a lifesaver.
Olivia: Oh, hardly. I just flail around and pretend to dance, mostly. Anyway, I've started looking for new ways to be useful.
Robin: Your dancing is spectacular! It never fails to pick me up.
Olivia: Ha! I dance like a ham someone rolled down the stairs. Just thinking of people watching me makes me cringe...
Chrom: We're near the bandit's camp, Robin. They've ravaged surrounding towns with impunity for too long. It ends today.
Robin: Right.

Inigo: Not today, rogue! 
Brigand: Nraugh! 
Inigo: All safe now, buttercup.
Maiden: I-Inigo?!
Inigo: The crying part is over, love. Now give us a smile. And perhaps a wink if a fellow can be greedy?
Maiden: Inigo, you stupid fool! That bandit you slew has---
Inigo: Dozens of friends who will be terribly cross with me? Aye. Worry not! I'll mop up the lot of them and be back in time for tea.
Maiden: You mustn't! They'll kill you!
Inigo: Ho ho! Don't be silly. I'd never let anyone ruin this perfect face. Surely you want them gone as well, yes? So that you may rebuild in peace?
Maiden: Of course, but...
Inigo: Then let us have no more frowns! A smile like yours is not a treasure to be locked in the king's dungeons! I'll meet you in town once I've sorted those pesky bandits. Perhaps then we can discuss my... reward. Ho ho!

@Battle 
Chrom: Their hold is just ahead. It should be... Wait, what's that? Gods, that man is fighting them alone. Come, let's lend him a hand!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Olivia,Inigo
Olivia: Are... Are you all right?
Inigo: ...GYAAARRGH!
Olivia: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! Wh-what's wrong?!
Inigo: S-sorry! ...Sorry. You just surprised me.
Olivia: I'd say we're even on that count!
Inigo: I shouldn't have shouted, but... Er, yes. Can we please start over? ...Ahem! It was your ravishing beauty that caught me so off guard, milady!
Olivia: I don't quite know how to reply to that!
Inigo: Er, please don't look at me so...intently. It makes me terribly bashful.
Olivia: What?! W-wait! Don't go! Drat he's gone. He totally stole my line, too. Still it's weird, I didn't have a problem talking to him. Maybe his shyness countered my own?
Inigo: Well, then. I should think five kills would be enough to impress a simple village girl. Though six might earn me a sweet kiss... Hmmm... That IS tempting.

%Chrom,Inigo
Chrom: You all right?
Inigo: Me? Hah! It takes more than that to wound a rogue this charming! Now then, who are you? Not an enemy, it seems?
Chrom: I'm Chrom, leader of the Shepherds. We came to deal with bandits, so it appears our purpose is shared.
Inigo: Chrom?! Then you're Lucina's...
Chrom: What's that?
Inigo: ......
Chrom: What?
Inigo: P-please don't stare at me like that. I get so...terribly shy.
Chrom: Aren't you the one who's been staring at me? And why did that line seem so familiar?
Inigo: Er, but yes! We share a common foe, and I'm grateful for the help. Can I trust you to defend this place?
Chrom: I don't know. What are you planning?
Inigo: I aim to crush the rascals who make trouble for the village, naturally! And once the lot of them are sorted, it's off to tea with a beauty of the fields. Heh heh heh... Right then! If that's decided, I'll be on my way. Put the kettle on, snookums! I won't be long now!
Chrom: He's nothing if not eager...
Inigo: Well, then. I should think five kills would be enough to impress a simple village girl. Though six might earn me a sweet kiss... Hmmm... That IS tempting.

%Chrom,Inigo
Chrom: You all right?
Inigo: Me? Hah! It takes more then that to wound a rogue this charming! Now then, who are you? Not an enemy, it seems.
Chrom: I'm Chrom, leader of the Shepherds. We came to deal with the bandits, so it appears our purpose is shared.
Inigo: Chrom?! Then you...You're my father.
Chrom: What? You, too?!
Inigo: Then you've already met Lucina?!
Chrom: Yes, she's with us now.
Inigo: Oh, good. She was so terribly eager to see you! Ah, but forgive me. I still haven't introduced myself. I am Inigo, Lucina's younger brother and a crown prince of Ylisse myself. If you need further proof, I bear a Brand in the opposite eye as Lucina.
Chrom: Hmm...Yep. That's a Brand all right.
Inigo: Um, could I ask you to stop staring now? I get a bit...bashful.
Chrom: Ah, right. Sorry
Inigo: Aha ha! Not to worry. Now, then. It's back into the fray with me, Father. Then it's off for tea with a farm girl! ...And perhaps a bit more. Don't wait up! Aha ha ha!
Chrom: Oh gods. I raised a philanderer. ...Well, he seems content enough. Heh. A son. Who knew?
Inigo: Well, then. I should think five kills would be enough to impress a simple village girl. Though six might earn me a sweet kiss... Hmm... That IS tempting...

@Boss 
Jamil: All who defy the will of Grima will be purged in the flames of destruction!

Jamil: Lord Grima... Rain down...retribution...

@End 
Chrom: That's the last of the bandits. The hold is reclaimed.
Frederick: The villagers will sleep better for our good works, milord.

Maiden: I can't begin to thank you, good sir
Chrom: Actually, Inigo did most of the heavy lifting on this one.
Maiden: He is so terribly brave... Part of me wishes I could have been there to witness it. Er, but yes. Please accept this gift from all us villagers.
Chrom: Your kindness flatters me. If bandits ever trouble you again, you need but call and we'll come running. Rebuilding a town is hard work, but I trust you'll be just fine.
Maiden: We'll do our best!

Inigo: Um... Olivia? Might I have a moment?
Olivia: Wh-what? With me? Why?! ...Wait, how did you know my name?
Inigo: A little bird tweeted it out. So is that a yes?
Olivia: Um, all right, I guess.
Inigo: ...Er, yes. You see... What I mean to say is... Goodness, this is much harder than chatting up other girls I've met. I suppose it would be quickest to just show you this...
Olivia: M-my ring? But... I'm wearing it! How did you...?
Inigo: Indeed. How does Inigo have your ring when there is only one in all the world? Unless it IS your ring and I brought it back from the future!
Olivia: What? You mean like Lucina...?
Inigo: Exactly. I knew my mother was a dancer you see. So I've been scouring the land looking for all the dancers I could find. Not the worst job in the world, mind. Heh heh heh... But now I've finally found you Mother! And my dancing is all the better for it!
Olivia: Oh! You dance?
Inigo: Er sort of, yes. That is to say, I try my best. But some people don't appreciate male dancers. Not that I care! I'm content to just shake my hips for the ladies.
Olivia: Oh, don't listen to them! I think it's wonderful. I'd... love to watch you dance sometime.
Inigo: N-no! Impossible! I'd be far too embarrassed for that! Besides, I'd rather watch you dance.
Olivia: What?! N-no! I couldn't possibly!
Inigo: I'm shyer than you are, Mother!
Olivia: You are not!
Inigo: ......
Olivia: ......
Chrom: Would you two stop it already? Now I'm the one who's getting embarrassed...

Inigo: At last, teatime has arrived!
Chrom: We're leaving, Inigo.
Inigo: What, right now? B-but... teatime!
Chrom: War is hell, Inigo. Now come with us or be left behind.
Inigo: Fine, fine! I'm coming. ...I suppose there'll be more buttercups blooming along the road ahead.
