If we can strike down their commander, the fortress will be ours. So\u2014Khan Flavia, your men will take on the forces surrounded the castle. That should create an opening for a smaller team led by Chrom and I. ...I regret to say this will put you at the forefront of the battle, Sir Chrom."}, {"speaker": "Chrom", "line": "I wouldn't have it any other way."}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "Then it's settled. Other Resistance forces are on the way. With luck, they'll arrive in time to help. Let's cleave them a proud trail of imperial blood to find us by!"}, {"speaker": "Pheros", "line": "Hmph. Such arrogance... They truly mean to assault Steiger in such meager numbers? Perhaps they expect a woman's garrison to be a softer target,..

Are you certain their reinforcements are from the Resistance?"}, {"speaker": "Say'Ri", "line": "Aye, sir, I'm ashamed to say I am. I know some of them by name. ...B-but why would they turn cloak against us now?!"}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Oooh, it seems we've touched a nerve! I do so enjoy inappropriate touching...

I can handle this myself."}, {"speaker": "Excellus", "line": "Why yes, of course you can, General! I can see you're doing SO well already. You're obviously just...waiting to crush the Ylisseans? Toying with them, like a cat! I only brought these rebels so they might learn from your shining example! They were so anxious to join the cause..."}, {"speaker": "Pheros", "line": "Because you threatened them? Tortured them? ...Or perhaps their families?

Why General, it's almost as if you aren't happy to see me! And after I came all this way to help you... I brought friends, you know. Well... perhaps \"friends\" isn't the word...
