Caeda: Kris, may I have your opinion on something? I'm worried...
Kris: About Prince Marth? Or about our next battle?
Caeda: Both of them. This is just a rumor, but... It seems Lang has hired the swordsman Navarre.
Kris: Navarre... I've heard that name before. He's a remarkable swordsman, right?
Caeda: Yes. But Navarre was our ally in the last war, so I'm sure he'll understand if I talk to him.
Caeda: Or, if you will not, then turn it on me now instead...
Navarre: ...Nay, I'll turn no blade of mine on a woman.
Kris: S-so that's how you persuaded him...?
Caeda: Hmm? Yes, why? Kris, if you happen to meet Navarre, let me talk to him... please.

Jagen: Grust has been liberated. All that's left now is to seize Olbern Keep. Therein lies Lang, oppressor of the people, the one who led General Lorenz to death, and kidnapper of the Grustian children... It's time for us to punish him for his sins. And then we shall return to Altea, and reclaim our homeland from Archanea.
