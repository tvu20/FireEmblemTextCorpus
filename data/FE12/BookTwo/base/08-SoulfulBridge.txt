Caeda: In the previous war, there was a man named Roger among our allies. He was a very nice man and listened to me even though we fought on opposing sides when we first met.
Caeda: Tell me: do you believe in love? Oh, listen to me. I'm sure you already have a sweetheart back in Grust.
Kris: D-did you really say that to him...?
Caeda: Kris, should we meet Roger again, I'll try to talk to him.

Jagen: Never mind the orbs; the Fane of Raman was devoid of anything. And now, even though our homeland Altea stands before our eyes, the Archanean army pursues us from both directions. It is a difficult situation, but we must escape this crisis somehow.
