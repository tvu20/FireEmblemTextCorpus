Jagen: Another attack from those assassins... We've finally reclaimed our homeland, yet we don't get even a moment of rest. But, being attacked by assassins in Altea... It reminds me of your knighthood ceremony. You and that assassin, Katarina, spent your days training in the same 7th Platoon... However, this is no time for sentimentality. Kris, you are to protect Prince Marth, just like you did that day.
