Kris: Sire, according to the intel from our scouts, this will be the next battlefield.
Marth: That's a lot of villages. We have to fight to prevent the villagers from being harmed by rogues. That reminds me, I believe Julian and Lena lived around here.
Kris: Hmm? Julian and Lena... Allies from the previous war?
Marth: Yes. I should tell you about them, Kris. Julian and Lena are now working in a convent, taking care of orphans. I wonder if they tied the knot yet. Julian is an ex-thief, and Lena is a very kind cleric. Julian risked his life to rescue Lena, who had been captured by bandits. That was when I met them.
Lena: Julian, you go ahead. Save yourself!
Julian: Uh-uh, honey. No can do. I didn't betray my boys back there so you could zap me on out of here alone.
Marth: Oh right, Lena also has an older brother called Matthis. He's apparently in the Macedonian army.
Kris: By Macedonian army, do you mean that Matthis might be among our enemies?
Marth: Yes. I'd rather not fight him if I could. If we had Julian or Lena with us, we could perhaps persuade him...

Jagen: We made it through the bordering forest. At last, it is time to quell the Macedonian rebellion and rescue Princess Minerva. But that aside, I do wonder why Princess Nyna entrusted Prince Marth with the Fire Emblem... The emblem is to be given to one who fights in the name of justice; in the name of House Archanea. Hardin should have delivered peace to Archanea... Appointing Lang as commander and now this drama? Just what has happened to Hardin? Oh well. Prince Marth said he'd go see the princess once this battle is over. Everything will become clear once the time comes. But now, we must focus on quelling the rebellion in Macedon.
