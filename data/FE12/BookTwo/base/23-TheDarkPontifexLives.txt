Kris: Sir Jagen, in the innermost room, he-- the Dark Pontifex Gharnef is waiting!
Jagen: Kris, listen well. Gharnef cannot be damaged by regular weapons. The Imhullu tome he possesses has the power to block our attacks. Only the Starlight tome can pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil. If we don't have Starlight, then we'll have no choice but to try and seize the throne without fighting Gharnef...

Jagen: This Dragon's Altar is awash with a rather ominous presence. Here, the Dark Pontifex Gharnef is planning to revive the Shadow Dragon Medeus. We must rescue the kidnapped clerics... Let's hurry, Kris.
