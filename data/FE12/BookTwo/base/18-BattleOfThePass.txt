Jagen: Besides the Archanean army, Emperor Hardin has one other strong set of troops under his command. They're the Aurelian Knights... A powerful army nicknamed the Wolfguard.
Kris: The Wolfguard...
Jagen: Yes. In the previous war... the Wolfguard fought as Hardin's subordinates. They were reliable allies back then, but since Hardin is now our enemy, so is the Wolfguard. They have sworn loyalty to Hardin, and would die for him. Kris, their loyalty is comparable to yours.
Kris: ...!
Jagen: Take good care once they arrive on the battlefield, Kris.

Jagen: The palace is almost within sight. By crossing the mountains, we avoided pointless battles as much as we could. We must defeat Gharnef and rescue Princess Elice and the other kidnapped clerics. And we ought to do something about Hardin, who's now being controlled by the Darksphere.
