Linde: Khadein, the realm of magic... To think I'd come here like this.
Kris: Are you familiar with Khadein, Linde? If there's anything we should pay attention to during battle, I'd like you to tell me.
Linde: Oh, yes... As you can see, Khadein is a desert. Most people get their feet caught up in the sand and have a hard time moving. But as mages dress lightly, they can move around like normal in the desert. Of course that goes for enemy mages too, so do be careful.
Kris: Got it... That was useful. Thank you, Linde.

Jagen: After hearing that our homeland Altea had been crushed by Archanea, we rushed to its aid. However, we were stopped in our tracks by Emperor Hardin of Archanea and now we must run away from Altea's direction. This is just too much for these old bones to bear... Hardin is protected by an arcane power... We won't be able to save our homeland if we don't do something about him. Right now, we have no choice but to take refuge in Khadein and search for a method to defeat Hardin.
