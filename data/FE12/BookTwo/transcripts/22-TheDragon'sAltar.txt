@Opening 
A stone bridge leading up the tall rocky mountain. This stone bridge seems to stretch to the heavens, as it spirals around. From the rocks fearful roaring and breathing sounds can be heard, as if the mountain was alive. The Dragon's Table... It is asn ancient ruin of the dragon tribe, and the place where the Divine Dragon King, Naga, sealed away the Earth Dragons. Now, after a period of 600 years, the Earth Dragons are currently awakening, and countless evil demons are being born...

@Intro 
Marth: ...... That's, uh, certainly one heck of a hat... A gift from Ymir, I presume?
Kris: Yes. It keeps me warm. Although I'm worried that it'll stand out...
Marth: I should be, if I were you. If you stepped out on the battlefield wearing that, you'd be a popular target...

@Battle 
Gotoh: Prince Marth, in this altar lurks many savage barbarians and mage dragons long gone mad. They have fallen under Gharnef's spell and will attack you given the chance. Gharnef's servants-- the heretic priests possess great power. They are not to be taken lightly. If you let this battle drag on, it may become fiercer than you can handle. Do not stop. Make for the end at once! Once you defeat Gharnef, retrieve the Falchion that he stole from your Altea. As you well know, without the Falchion, defeating Medeus will be nigh impossible...
Marth: I understand, Lord Gotoh. My friends and I shall sally forth to the deepest depths of the altar!
Gotoh: It would be wise to bring this ally with you. She has deigned to lend you her strength.
Nagi: ......
Marth: You're...
Kris: Another ally from the previous war, sire?
Marth: No, I don't believe we've ever met. But, why...? I have the strangest feeling that I know her...
Nagi: My name... is Nagi. I will... stop the enemy... You must hurry to the throne room... Go... This time... everything... must end......

@End 
Kris: Sire! Look, stairs! They probably lead further in. We must hurry, sire!
Marth: Right, Kris! ...By the way, do you intend to wear that hat from here on out?
Kris: Actually, I'm not entirely sure. It's very warm, as Sir Ymir said, but I stick out like a sore thumb...
Marth: Indeed, the enemies looked surprised. Well, what is your decision? Are you going to take it off?
^start 
Kris: Yes, I think I will remove it for this battle.
Marth: Excellent choice. Well, let's hurry!

Kris: No, I rather like it. It's so toasty.
Marth: I-I see. Well then, let's go!
