@Opening 
Marth and the others once again moved out from Altea, and headed towards the imperial capital of Millennium Court. But, along their way, they passed through the Kingdom of Gra, a land allied to Archanea. In the previous war Gra sided with the Dolhr Empire, which resulted in their king, Jiol, dying in battle and the destruction of the kingdom. The country was once a part of Altea, but they sided with Archanea after listening to Hardin's orders. Hardin found King Jiol's daughter, Princess Sheena, and allowed her to ascend the throne, and he then ordered reinforcements from Gra. Sheena received wild support from the citizens of Gra. To them, Sheena was their only hope. The youths all volunteered to become soldiers. They were happy to move out and have the chance to defeat their bitter enemy, Altea. But their dreams were shattered in an instant... Before the fast approaching Altean elites, Gra's soldiers lost all morale, and fled for their lives.

@Intro 
Jagen: Gra's army is renowned for its mighty armor knights and generals. The late king Jiol--our enemy in the last war--was a general himself.
Kris: I see. An army with strong defenses...
Jagen: In the past, yes. I hear that Gra's army now consists of new recruits. Hardly worthy enemies. Speaking of strong defenses, Kris...
^start
Jagen: Your defense is truly overwhelming. Only a fool would dare approach you. Even Gra at it's prime could not compete with your defense. This battle has already been decided.

Jagen: Your defense is quite impressive. No man in Gra could match your defense. This battle has already been decided.

Jagen: Erm, your defense... could do with a little more work. This is quite worrisome. Kris, the enemies may be new recruits, but don't underestimate them.
^end 

@Battle 
Samson: Princess Sheena, it seems the Altean army has arrived.
Sheena: Really...? It's already the end. Samson, I have brought you much trouble. I need to watch the final days of my Kingdom of Gra. You may leave now.
Samson: Princess, isn't it already enough? Shouldn't you despise King Jiol for forcefully taking your mother? Isn't that why you hid at Millennium Court and stayed away from this country? Right now you are just being tricked by Hardin, and being used by him.
Sheena: Perhaps. I heard that the people of Gra wished for the restoration of the country, and that's why I agreed to help him. However Hardin is only interested in using us. He would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him. Still, I will not leave! How can I just abandon those fighting for my sake!?
Samson: Impossible... How can our fresh recruits resist Altea's elites...? Fine, if you're staying, I will also stay to the end. This could be interesting.
Sheena: Samson... Why are you doing this? Aren't you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold? I no longer have money to give you...
Samson: I don't know why either. It's just... Sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do. Also, I want to see how that kid fights this battle. If he truly is a hero, perhaps your mind may be changed...

Sheema: What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!

Samson: Prince Marth... How unfortunate. I thought you a better man.

Sheema: What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!

@Visit 
Old man: Hardin sent troops here to prevent Gra from rebelling. The Archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight. 

Woman: Princess Sheena is the child of King Jiol's second wife. But, she is different from the king. She is a very kind person. The princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers. Is there no way to save her?

Woman: The soldiers here are all foreigners. There's nobody else to protect this country, because the knights of this country all died. Right now, the actions of the Archanea soldiers are deplorable. Their just the same as thieves... Those lowlifes!

Young woman: Ah... Please leave me. I already have nothing to give you.
Marth: Ah, please don't get us wrong. We aren't here to steal.
Young woman: But, didn't you all come here from Altea for revenge?
Marth: No, we don't want to fight Gra, because Gra and Altea were originally like one family.
Young woman: Is that true...? Then, I will give my most important treasure... to... you

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Sheena 
Marth: You are Princess Sheena? It's great to see you safe. I don't view Gra as an enemy. Gra and my country were originally one country. The country may have divided after Anri's death, but we always got on well as allies. But, in the previous war, I felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did. Princess Sheena, please allow us to be friends once again. I don't want to fight Gra.
Sheena: Prince Marth... Once I heard that you didn't attack my fleeing soldiers, I was really surprised. You truly are the second coming of King Anri. I trust you. Please... Treat the citizens of Gra... as if they were your citizens. I will hand my whole country to your care... Prince Marth.

%Sheena,Samson 
Samson: That's great Sheena. Now I can finally leave without worry.
Sheena: Samson... Can you not leave...?
Samson: You don't need me anymore. From now on Prince Marth will protect you.
Sheena: Don't leave! I don't want you to leave...
Samson: Huh, what? Why keep me? It doesn't seem like you. ...Fine. If you say you need me, I won't go anywhere else. I will protect you wherever you may go. Is that fine with you?
Sheena: Yes...

@Recruit-Visit 
Tomas: Prince Marth, I've been waiting for you. I'm Tomas, an Archanean soldier--or was. I've since retired from the army. The Archaneans here just want to sacrifice the defenceless Gra soldiers. This act of brutality by my former homeland... I cannot tolerate. Please, Prince Marth. Let me fight with you in some way.

@Recruit-Battle 
Sheena: You... You dare treat my citizens like that... Die!

Sheena: Forgive me, citizens of Gra.

Samson: Prince Marth... I thought you were a noble person, but you're just a murderer... You disappoint me.*

Samson: Sheena...

@End 
Jagen: Sire, to keep fighting like this is pointless. All we are accomplishing is buying Hardin more time.
Marth: My thoughts exactly. If we continue like this, more blood will be spilt for naught. Kris, do you have any sort of plan?
Kris: According to our information, the enemy's primary force is concentrated along the highway. I wonder if we can avoid that route, by passing through the mountains?
Jagen: Hmph, we'd have to cross Adria Pass... But the steep mountains make it dangerous for an army of our size.
Kris: That's true, and I fear the enemy may have prepared an ambush as well. Our bravery could be our undoing. But it is the fastest possible route. If we could just break through there, we'd be in walking distance of the palace.
Marth: I am prepared for the danger. We managed to conquer the same perilous road that Anri walked. Compared to that... Jagen, Kris. We can overcome this challenge. Order the advance!
Frost: Oof... Seems I've finally caught up.
Kris: Hmm, and you are?
Frost: My name is Frost. I am a priest of Macedon. When Macedon was taken over by those warmonging rebels... You came and saved our country. Thanks to you, my family's now safe. I have come to return the favor.
Kris: I see. But hasn't it been some time since Prince Marth freed Macedon...?
Frost: Your army marched at speed and this old geezer just couldn't keep up. Eventually I lost sight of you... But then I heard that Marth had freed Altea as well, and I finally managed to catch up with you here, in Gra. I am old now, but I can still fight. Please, allow me to to join you.
