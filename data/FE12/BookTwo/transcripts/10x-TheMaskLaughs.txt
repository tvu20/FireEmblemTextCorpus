Legion: Uwee hee hee. Who knowses? We sure don't. But really, poor yous! You'll be killed by us, and won't even knows why!
Horace: My life isn't my own. Ever since I became a knight, my life is for my liege and my people. I cannot be defeated by cowards like you.

@Boss 
Legion: Uwee hee hee!!! Are we real or are we false? Try us and see!!!

Legion: Uwee hee... hee... how did you... know...?

@End 
Kris: Sire, the remaining enemies have fled. Victory is ours.
Marth: Good work. But either way, that was a strange enemy. Were they even human...?
Jagen: I've heard rumors about them. Those wicked assassins crushed their souls when they were young, and raised them as living puppets who follow orders without question...
Marth: How pitiful... Kris. I wonder if Katarina was raised under such circumstances, as well...
Kris: ...
Marth: However, we can't do anything about that now. Let us go ahead. To Anri's Way, where Lord Gotoh awaits.

Kris: Sir Jagen, I've found something most odd inside the castle. It's this mask. It seems like a different type from the one those assassins wore, but what's it for...?
Jagen: Heh... This is a mask for use in a masquerade ball, I believe.
Kris: Masquerade ball?
Jagen: Yes. Noblemen once donned these masks in order to conceal their identities. They were probably used in this old castle a long time ago. So, it's unrelated to the assassins.
Kris: I see... But, it sure is a strange mask.
Jagen: What of it? Don't tell me you intend to wear it?
^start 
Kris: Yes. For some reason, I feel like giving it a try.
Jagen: You are an odd one. Well, do as you wish.

Kris: No, I'll leave it where I found it.
Jagen: Yes, good idea.
^end

Katarina: Lady Eremiya... I have a report. Legion, he...
Eremiya: I see, so he failed. Even though I took such good care of him... Such a troublesome child.
Katarina: Lady Eremiya, the Altean army is strong. Now that Legion has been defeated... Perhaps we should refrain from pursuing them.
Eremiya: No. Crushing Altea was an order of his.
Katarina: But...
Clarisse: What? Reese, don't tell me you're afraid?
Katarina: Clarisse...
Clarisse: Lady Eremiya, please allow me the honor. I'll take care of them.
Eremiya: My, you're a good girl, Clarisse. Would you?
Clarisse: Anything for you, Lady Eremiya.
Katarina: ... Lady Eremiya, about the remaining Legion brothers...
Eremiya: Ah, those. Get rid of all of them.
Katarina: Lady Eremiya...!
Eremiya: They can't fight now that they've lost Legion, can they? So, they're useless now. Broken junk is to be discarded.
Katarina: B-but, Lady Eremiya... They were with us in the orphanage... with you too, Lady Eremiya...
Eremiya: So what?
Katarina: ...
Clarisse: Reese, you sure are useless, aren't you? Don't worry, Lady Eremiya. I'll get rid of them.
Eremiya: My, Clarisse is such a good little girl. Completely different from a certain failure.
Clarisse: Ah, Lady Eremiya... Your praise makes me happy.
Katarina: ...
