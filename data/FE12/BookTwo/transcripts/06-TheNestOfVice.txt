@Opening
Grust has been liberated.

All that remains is Olbern Keep, where General Lang remains barricaded. Lang used his influence to steal belongings, daughters, and lives from the people of Grust. Was there ever a man as cruel as he is?

"I cannot forgive him. I shall take him down without fail!" Prince Marth raised his sword to the skies and ordered firmly: "Altean knights, charge!!"

@Intro 
Jagen: Kris, you should be aware that Lang is a general with high defense. To defeat him, you would do well to attack with magic or a special weapon like an armorslayer.
Kris: Duly noted.
Jagen: If you plan to defeat him with strength alone, you'd have to be extremely powerful.
^start
Jagen: Kris, your strength is simply tremendous. Against a blow from you, Lang's armor would crumple like paper. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.
Kris: Yes sir!

Jagen: Kris, your strength is quite impressive. You might just be able to defeat Lang. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.

Jagen: Kris, you are, sadly, not very strong. But you could fight using your other talents. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.
^end 

Lang: Heh heh heh... So the Alteans have come. Reinforcements are arriving soon; if we can hold out a little longer, we can make a pincer attack. Swordsman Navarre. When they open that door, you make your move. There is no need for restraint; slice them to pieces!
Navarre: Yeah... sure. Though the knights of Altea are hardly worthy enemies.
Lang: Oh-ho! That's my Navarre. They say not even Ogma of Talys is your equal.
Navarre: What? Ogma?! N... Naturally... A guy like him is no match for me.
Lang: I see. Glad to hear it. Then I'll leave this place in your capable hands, Navarre!

@Battle
Jagen: Sire, there seems to be movement near the front of the castle. And it would appear to be moving towards our forces.
Marth: Are they enemy reinforcements? Or allies to our cause...?
Jagen: I do not know, but... I do hope they are allies.

Frey: Sire!
Marth: Frey! Thank goodness you're safe.
Frey: You too, sire. Norne and I escaped from Altea Castle and we rode here as fast as we could.
Norne: But the rest of our forces were scattered... I'm sorry we couldn't all make it.
Marth: You don't have to apologize, I'm just glad that you're safe. The others can take care of themselves.
Frey: Sire. From here on we shall accompany you. Please give us your orders.
Norne: Oh, and please be careful! I caught a glimpse of enemy troops approachin' the castle behind us. I expect they'll be enterin' the castle soon.
Marth: Enemy reinforcements? I understand. Thank you.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Caeda,Samuel
Caeda: Navarre, please hear me out! Lend your sword to our case, just once more!
Navarre: What? Who are you? I'll have no business with women or children... But, there's a first for everything... (Whoa, she's smoking!) What business do you have with me?
Caeda: ...... Y-you're not Navarre! Who are you?
Samuel: Yikes, I've been exposed, huh? I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as Samuel. Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this famous "Navarre" swordsman guy. I got tired of it after a while, so I decided to pose as him and got myself hired. But I don't like this General Lang guy either. If you're alright with it, I'll lend you my sword.
Caeda: Yes... You'll do just fine...

%Ogma,Samuel 
Ogma: Navarre... You bastard...
Navarre: Stay away... This evening, my killing edge hungers for blood...
Ogma: Do you mean to kill me, no matter what? Hmph, very well. I knew that we'd have to settle our score eventually.
Samuel: Wait... Stay your blade! ...I'm no Navarre, I'm just a sham. I... it's me, Samuel. Have you forgotten, Ogma?
Ogma: Samuel?! Samuel, the gladiator from Knorda?
Samuel: Yes, I was a slave gladiator at the time, and you really helped me out. Even when everyone was making their escape, you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught...
Ogma: ......
Samuel: I heard everything from my friends. How you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse. How, by chance, the young Princess Talys, tears in her eyes, stood up for you and saved you. And that's why you swore your blade to Talys. Or rather... to the princess...
Ogma: Enough... Say no more! No more. It's in the past now... No more...
Samuel: ...Ogma... Anyway, I want to repay you! I'm following you from now on, okay?

@Recruit-Battle 
Navarre: I pity your soul. But I can at least grant you a quick death. Take this! My killing edge!!

Samuel: Doh, I shouldn't have said that I was Navarre...

@Boss 
Lang: W-wait, please! I'm sorry... Please forgive me... I've only done as the Emperor ordered me to. I didn't agree with him, but I had no choice. So... so please, s-spare my life... I'll do anything you say. Yes... Just like this... Mwahaha! You shouldn't have let your guard down! You fool... Now die!

Lang: Urgh... Impossible... I have been defeated...

%Marth,Lang
Marth: General Lang, I have--with my own eyes--witnessed a number of your crimes. I cannot forgive you. But if you have something to say, I will listen.
Lang: S-silence... silence! You damned country-boy prince! You're a fool for coming here! Just die already!
Marth: Is that your answer? Then prepare yourself!

%Kris,Lang
Lang: Y-you! You're that impertinent little girl/boy from before...!
Kris: Lang! You have oppressed countless people, and insulted my liege. You can only atone for these sins with your life!
Lang: W... Why you!

@End 
Marth: Lord Wendell! Thank goodness you're unharmed.
Wendell: Lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned. Even though I told him that I must fulfill a mission assigned to me by Archsage Gotoh...
Marth: A mission from Lord Gotoh?
Wendell: That's correct... You have seen the "Starsphere"--the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface. In order to pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil, Lord Gotoh created a sacred spell named "Starlight" from that orb.
Wendell: Unfortunately, the strain on the Starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards, which scattered into the sky. Lord Gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power, and that if even one of them is lost, the world will fall into irreparable ruin. By any means possible, we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the Starsphere.
Marth: Is... Is this a joke? That the world could just end... This is all very hard to take in. But aren't these the star shards? If so, we already have a few. After we retake Altea, we'd be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs.
Wendell: Of course... Your country was only just invaded by the Empire... I understand, Prince... I too shall fight to restore Altea, then. Thinking about it, my meeting with you is like a sign from Lord Gotoh himself. In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate. But, please, let's stop by the Fane of Raman. We may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple.
Marth: Understood. If it's the Fane of Raman, we can go there on our way to Altea!

Marth: General Lang has been defeated. And now the people of Grust no longer have to suffer.
Kris: That's right, sire.
Marth: Kris, since leaving Altea, we've had a great deal of fights... Looking back at them now...

^start 
Marth: None of our companions were hurt and none of them died. That's what I'm happiest about. Kris, it's because you've been here. Thank you so much.

Marth: It couldn't be helped, but... Some of our comrades were injured or passed on. I don't want to lose anyone from now. I know we can do it if you're there. Kris, please, help me.

Marth: All I remember is seeing our companions fall, one by one... Enough! I don't want any of our comrades to suffer that pain. Kris, please, help me.
^end 

^locked 
Jagen: Sire, some new information has come in from the patrol. Just ahead, the enemy seems to be preparing some kind of ambush. It's not the Archanean Empire, but likely, I fear, mercenaries hired with coin.
Marth: Mercenaries, is it...? Do we continue as we are or take a longer, safer route? Personally, I'd rather not detour. We have to return to Altea as soon as possible.
Jagen: Hmph, if you would allow me to speak as your tactician... I think we ought to stay here and fight. We will be facing mercenaries. The Altean knights would never lose to mere mercenaries.
Marth: Kris, your thoughts?
Kris: I agree with Sir Jagen.
Marth: I see, thank you. Jagen, Kris! The whole army shall move on as they were. We'll hit the mercenaries head-on!
