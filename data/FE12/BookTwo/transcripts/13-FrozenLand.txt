@Opening 
This truly is an unimaginably treacherous journey. 5000 meters... No, higher than that. Looking down, a sea of clouds can be seen. They have reached the summit of the cold mountain peak. Breathing is difficult... Dizziness is felt... Their vitality is fast approaching its limits.

@Intro
Jagen: Well, Kris, is everyone making good use of the drill grounds? Of course, if you win often, you'll be that much stronger. Kris, you...
^start
Jagen: Oho-ho, you... You've done very well, haven't you?
Kris: Yes, I go there often.
Jagen: I see. Then there is nothing I have to add. I should recommend the drill grounds to the others.

Jagen: Oho-ho, you... You've been winning quite often, eh? Not bad at all.
Kris: Thank you. But I hope to improve further.
Jagen: That's the spirit! I should recommend the drill grounds to the others.

Jagen: Hmm, you... It seems you haven't won much yet. Are you purposely avoiding the drill grounds?
Kris: S-sorry, I don't really have the money, so...
Jagen: Well, it's fine if you're not struggling now, but when things get tough, that experience will be the clincher. Just remember, if you ever feel that your foes are too strong, there is a place where you can hone your skills.

Marth: Xane, we've already climbed this high. It's so cold... Even breathing is hard.
Xane: We're almost there. Look, can you see over there? That's the Ice Dragons' Temple where Gotoh is.
Marth: But, that was quite a shock. Tiki is actually the daughter of the Divine Dragon King. Also, both Gotoh and you are Divine Dragons.
Xane: Ah... When the Divine Dragons fought the Earth Dragons they over-exhausted their dragonstones, and so practically became extinct. Aside from Naga, only Gotoh, me and the just born Tiki survived. However, after the war we discarded our dragonstones, so we could no longer become dragons again. Even so, I still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans. Gotoh followed Naga's orders to protect humans, but that's got nothing to do with me. I don't like humans. They scorned the Manaketes, even though they had lost their power, and treated them like filth. I can fully understand why Medeus and the others hated humans so much. The Earth Dragon King, Medeus, tricked his own tribe and became a Manakete by himself. He used to follow Naga's orders and guarded the Dragons' Altar. However the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive. They even started to attack the Manaketes that lived in peace. The Manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans, and gathered at the Dolhr region. They formed their own kingdom of Manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans. To save the humans, Gotoh handed the Falchion to Anri and he created an academy of magic at Khadein. But whoever won wasn't any of my concern.
Marth: Then, why are you helping me? I'm also a human...
Xane: You're different from the others. You don't seem like an unreliable person either...
Marth: Mmm... Thank you, Xane.
Xane: Don't... don't be silly. I'll get embarrassed. Anyway, let's head to the temple, but be careful of the Ice Dragons. Although they're also wild dragons, they will instinctively try to protect their temple. Poor guys...

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Beck 
Marth: You, you're Beck! To think we'd meet here of all places!
Beck: Me too, Prince Marth. Boy am I surprised to see you. It's been far too long. After the war, I was travelin' the continent. And, um, somehow...
Marth: ...You landed up here? Well, thank goodness. There's no way you would have joined the barbarians. Beck, we're fighting another war. Why don't you come with us?
Beck: I don't have my ballista any more. Just my horse-buddy right 'ere. But if you're fine with that, then sure. I'll help you princey.

@Recruit-Battle 
Beck: What's the point of war?

Beck: D-damn... it... You too... Pony...?

@End 
Marth: Hey, Xane. Gotoh didn't really mention anyting about the five orbs, but I thought they were very important. Do you know anything about them?
Xane: Gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didn't say anything. I will tell you. However, after I've told you, you'll probably think it was better off not knowing. The orbs rest on the shield that seals the Earth Dragons... Basically they are part of the Shield of Seals. Since ancient times, the Divine Dragons have passed down these sacred jewels, each possessing different powers. To put it simply, the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal. So if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken.
Marth: Hmm, is that so? But, how come the orbs were scattered?
Xane: Because the shield was broken. The Shield of Seals was displayed at the Fane of Raman, and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it...
Marth: When did that happen?
Xane: Around 600 years ago. To recover the shield, Gotoh spend many years searching the lands. In the end, he only found the five orbs, with the shield nowhere to be seen. Not only that, but the five orbs, which he painfully collected, were scattered again after Raman was attacked in the previous war.
Marth: Really? ...So that was why Gotoh was looking for the lost jewels... the orbs?
Xane: Yep, the Starsphere, Lightsphere and Geosphere... as well as the Darksphere and Lifesphere. The Lightsphere is in Gotoh's possession, that Starsphere was shattered and the Darksphere was given to Hardin by Gharnef.
Marth: The Geosphere is in Altea and all that remains is the Lifesphere.
Xane: Ah... Anyway, let's enter the temple. From now on I will also help you fight. Well, let's go!

^locked 
Jagen: Sire, please wait. Kris, you as well.
Jagen: I just received a distressing message. People have been sighted not far behind us. There seems to be a battle underway.
Marth: Out here? Could it be the barbarians? Or perhaps it's the assassins...
Jagen: In any case, this area is almost entirely uninhabited. So it can't be any old people... To make matters worse, the snow is becoming heavier... Fighting will be difficult in this weather.
Marth: But if there are allies...
Kris: Indeed. We cannot abandon them. If there are allies that is...
Marth: Then we'll just have to find out for ourselves, before the battle is over. Let's go!
