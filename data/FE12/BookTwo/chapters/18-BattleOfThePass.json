Going through Adria Pass, one will soon reach the city of Pales. Hurry, we can't let the enemy spot us! We must charge straight through!! Marth and the others were anxious, but they carried on advancing across the narrow mountain road. But they didn't expect, in the middle of the cliff, to be ambushed by an unfathomable enemy. They were the northern Kingdom of Aurelis' elite squad, the \"Wolfguard\", who had headed south to aid Archanea."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Kris, if we can get through this pass we will be on Archanea's doorstep.

The battles we've faced up to now... have been nothing short of difficult. And in those battles..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "We've managed to keep everyone alive. With the strength of all our comrades, we can accomplish something worthy of Anri... I'm so proud of everyone."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Sire......"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "It's thanks to our friends that our country is free; I cannot help but think of the fallen.

Can we really fight this battle?"}, {"speaker": "Wolf", "line": "Roshea! What are you trying to say? Look, the Altean army is marching long the narrow mountain road. Now's our only chance to defeat them."}, {"speaker": "Vyland", "line": "Yes, Roshea. We swore that we could sacrifice our lives for Lord Hardin. Lord Hardin was the one who freed us plains people from slavery. If we don't fight Altea now, Millennium Court will fall. Do you want Lord Hardin to be defeated by them?"}, {"speaker": "Sedgar", "line": "That's right! Prince Marth wants to destroy Archanea, and conquer the world. And that's why he joined forces with Macedon to crust Grust. Now he even has Gra under his rule. If we don't do something, the whole world will fall under his control."}, {"speaker": "Roshea", "line": "I still don't believe it. I cannot believe Prince Marth would have such ambitions."}, {"speaker": "Wolf", "line": "What? Are you saying that Emperor Hardin lied? Do you think that he would stoop to such a low!? Enough, Roshea!! You disappoint me, if you want to betray us then go ahead. Sedgar, Vyland, let's go. If we're too slow, they will pass us."}, {"speaker": "Roshea", "line": "Hey, wait! I won't betray you. I understand... I'll go."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "The Wolfguard of Aurelis! Must we fight them as well...?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Sire, please hold on. We've just received word from a messenger of King Aurelis. It seems Aurelis has no plans to war... According to the messenger, King Aurelis wishes to parley with you in the village."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "What? What could this mean? That the Wolfguard is moving independent of Aurelis's orders?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "I don't know, but... Depending on how negotiations go, it's possible the Wolfguard may signal a retreat."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I see. It would benefit us all if we could avoid pointless fighting. Let's hurry to the village!"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "King Aurelis", "line": "Oh, Prince Marth. It is good to see you."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Huh, aren't you King Aurelis?! What are you doing here?"}, {"speaker": "King Aurelis", "line": "I came here to stop my country's army. Also I must apologise to your highness. I believed Hardin's words and followed Archanea, but I now realize my wrongs. Archanea's Empress Nyna secretly sent me a letter, saying that Hardin isn't normal and is ill... My country will remain neutral, and its knights will return to Aurelis. I hope you won't attack my men anymore."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I understand, your highness. I don't want to fight with you. Please forgive me for taking so many of your knights' lives."}, {"speaker": "King Aurelis", "line": "Oh! You really are like what the rumors say. My body is frail and I have no children, and even Hardin, my younger brother, has completely changed. Prince Marth, please protect Aurelis in my place. I will hand my whole country to you. I give this jewel to you as a gift. This is a magical jewel containing the divine power of life. I spent a lot of gold to buy it from a travelling merchant. I believe it will be useful to you. Don't worry about Hardin. Since he is a knight, it is natural for him to die in battle. That is his fate. Well, Prince Marth, I will go on ahead. I hop you will all be safe..."}], "recruit-battle": [{"speaker": "Roshea", "line": "I am Roshea of the Aurelis knights. I don't want to fight, but I can't betray my companions.
