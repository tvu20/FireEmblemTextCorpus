It began when the fearsome Shadow Dragon, Medeus, launched a sudden invasion. The Kingdom of Archanea, protector of the lands, clashed with Medeus's forces. But against such superior might, Archanea was overwhelmed and trembled in defeat. Nyna, princess of Archanea, had no choice but to flee from her beloved homeland. To rescue Archanea, the Kingdom of Altea, its allied nation, sallied forth. However, it too was defeated by Medeus. With its king lost to war, Altea fell to ruins...", "From his exiled shores Marth, young prince of Altea, swore he would retake his homeland. Marth never forgot his oath. Years later, he rallied an army at Talys to defeat Medeus. Starting with Caeda, Talys's princess, Marth gathered together many allies. Duke Hardin, Nyna's guardian, also became one of his trusted comrades. With Archanea's treasured \"Fire Emblem\" awarded to him by Nyna, Marth led the Archanean League, as its commander.", "In the following battles, the League wrestled back control of both Archanea and Altea. Finally, after a long and fierce battle with Shadow Dragon Medeus's forces... Marth vanquished the Shadow Dragon... And thus did peace return to the world. These are the events that transpired one year ago."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Kris, we have been designated as members of the 7th Platoon. I'm glad we were grouped together."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "As am I. Who else do we have in our platoon?"}, {"speaker": "Luke", "line": "I'm Luke! Or if you prefer, you can call me Luke, the Paladin of Dawn!"}, {"speaker": "Roderick", "line": "I am Roderick. It is a pleasure to meet you. So, is that everyone?"}, {"speaker": "Ryan", "line": "U-um... I'm a new recruit, too. My name is Ryan. I'm an archer."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "It looks like that's all five of us. Well, what's the plan for today?"}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "There was an order from Sir Jagen. Today's mission is to decide who the new commander will be."}, {"speaker": "Roderick", "line": "Luke, how should we go about this?"}, {"speaker": "Luke", "line": "Roderick, you wait at the back. I'll fight alone! It's just Kris and that kid, right? If that's all, I should be able to handle it. I'll show them my true strength."}, {"speaker": "Roderick", "line": "You're at it again...? Fine, have it your way. But I think underestimating your opponent will get you into trouble."}, {"speaker": "Luke", "line": "Commander? Gotcha! Well, I'll be commander if you guys all insist!"}, {"speaker": "Roderick", "line": "Nobody's insisting anything, Luke..."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Excuse me. I'd like to recommend Kris."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Katarina...?"}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Kris is a really strong individual.

Kris, if you beat me, I'll cede the position to you."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Huh? H-how has it come to this?"}, {"speaker": "Luke", "line": "It's a challenge, man-to-man! Kris, you're not afraid to fight me, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Don't be silly. Kris won't lose to you."}, {"speaker": "Roderick", "line": "So we'll decide with a battle. That'll let us know who's got the skill to be commander."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "I'm sorry, Kris. That was selfish of me... But I couldn't stand hearing them make fun of you..."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "It's okay. When my grandfather trained me, he used to say the same thing. He said that the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Huh. Y-your grandfather sure sounds colorful... Anyway, our opponents are Luke and Roderick. It's been decided that Ryan will be on our team."}, {"speaker": "Ryan", "line": "Y-yes. I'll do my best."}, {"speaker": "Luke", "line": "Commander? Gotcha! Oh, what's that? Luke should be the one? Yes, I completely agree!"}, {"speaker": "Roderick", "line": "Don't make up our words..."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Excuse me.

I was so confident in my skills! How did I wind up losing?!"}, {"speaker": "Roderick", "line": "Because we didn't fight together. We took turns fighting Kris one-on-one.

Even if we are weak individually, we can become stronger by working together with our friends."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "That's right.

Now that you're the commander, how about I give you a cool title?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "A title?"}, {"speaker": "Luke", "line": "Yeah. All the legendary heroes have their own awesome title! Hm, let's see... Looking at your eyes... It's got to be Kris the Ordinary!"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "I don't really understand... Nor do I think it's something worth celebrating."}, {"speaker": "Luke", "line": "Aw, don't worry about it! Kris the Ordinary!"}]}
