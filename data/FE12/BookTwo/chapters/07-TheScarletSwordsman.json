Our homeland Altea's position is important, but perhaps I brood far too much and offend people."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "You worry about these things too, Sir Jagen? You needn't worry. Your concern for Prince Marth is more than evident. You're very strict, Sir Jagen, but also very kind."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Is that so...? Ho ho, if you cheer me on enough, I may even age backwards!"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Sir Jagen, when you look at me, what kind of person do you see?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Hmm, well...

That's all."}, {"speaker": "Phina", "line": "Hmmm... But really, it's 'cause I'm cute, right? At any rate, I'm glad. My name's Phina. I'm a dancer from Warren. People say that once they see my dancing, they feel instantly refreshed! I can show you, if you like. Oh, I should tell you my story: I got separated from my troupe, and wandered into this forest. And then, those horrible thieves came and tried to take me by force... But it's okay now. You seem kind of scary, but actually you're very kind. However, your appearance is... Your face isn't bad, but your dress sense is kind of lacking. And, ugh, what's with your hair? You know, nowadays..."}, {"speaker": "Navarre", "line": "Just stop talking! Anyway, don't stray too far.

One day, terrible monsters descended and the humans were massacred, pushed to the brink of extinction. The few who survived prayed to the gods for salvation. The gods heard their prayers, and a gigantic warrior was sent down to earth. The warrior carried a gleaming blade of light in his right hand, and in his left hand, a shield embedded with five orbs. Then, after a fierce battle, he eradicated the monsters and returned to the heavens. He was our guardian deity, Naga, and this temple is dedicated to him. \"He was the avatar of the gods: our guardian deity...\""}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "With the blade of light and the five orbs...

Is that okay?"}, {"speaker": "Wendell", "line": "Yes, I have many of these hats, so there's no need to worry. Well then, would you like to try it on?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Yes, please, if it's not a bother."}, {"speaker": "Wendell", "line": "No, no, don't be shy. Here you go. And do remember to watch your health."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "You're a good person, Lord Wendell. I want to be more like you... Oh yeah, if I wear this hat for a while, I wonder if my hair will start to look like his? And then, maybe I'll be a bit more like Lord Wendell!"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "No thank you, but I appreciate the gesture. I'll be just fine."}, {"speaker": "Wendell", "line": "I understand. But, do remember to watch your health."}]}
