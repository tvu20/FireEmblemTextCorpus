They were ready to begin the battle to reclaim their homeland. The commander of Archanea's army, General Eibel, had ordered the Gra Knights to charge, to buy time. At the same time he prepared many dishonorable tactics, and waited for the chance to defeat Altea's army in one swift blow. Before his fond homeland, Marth's battles were about to begin once again. \"We will reclaim our captical of Anri!! We will reclaim our homeland!!\" Prince Marth's voice resounded through Altea's skies.
