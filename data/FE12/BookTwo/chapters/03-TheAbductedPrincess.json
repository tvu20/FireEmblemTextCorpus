A century ago, the dragonkin rulers sent many slaves to these wild forests, to excavate ruins and build a country. Many slaves were forced to work to their limits, barely fed, and then slaughtered.", "A young man stood up against such tragic conditions. Iote was his name. He and his companions fled to the forests and fought, astride wyverns, to free the slaves. After Dolhr's demise, the slaves established their own country in these now abundant lands. And the hero Iote was chosen as their first king. And so was born the Kingdom of Macedon, later feared as the domain of dracoknights.", "However, the might Macedon was stripped of Prince Michalis, said to be the second coming of Iote, and is now on the brink of losing Princess Minerva, the so-called \"Red Dragon.\""], "intro": [{"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Hah!

Most admirable, Kris."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Ah, Sir Jagen."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "A strong offense and a tough defense are obviously important, but... You cannot afford to neglect your skill. Without the skill to deliver it, it matters not how mighty your attack is if it does not reach the enemy. Speaking of which..."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Your skill is like that of an expert... I have nothing to add. Keep up the good work."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Thank you, Sir Jagen."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Your skill is not bad. Don't fall behind the other knights. The experience you gain from training and combat, will help elevate your skill further. Be ever diligent."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Yes, Sir Jagen."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Your skill is still insufficient... It ought to be better than this. You may or may not have the talent for it, but don't give up... The more experience you gain from training and combat, the more you can refine your skill.

We're going to join their ranks to help save Princess Minerva. Please take Lena and escape to safety, quickly!"}, {"speaker": "Julian", "line": "No can do, Palla. Lena's disappeared... I'm not leaving by myself."}, {"speaker": "Palla", "line": "What? Lena as well... Princess Maria is missing too; why is it only clerics...?"}, {"speaker": "Julian", "line": "Anyway, I'm staying in the village to see if I can't find any information. Sorry, Palla. Give my best to Prince Marth."}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Villager", "line": "This is just between you and me, but I heard that armory is in league with the rebels.

They say that Prince Michalis is dead, and Princess Maria is nowhere to be found... On top of that, they say that Princess Minerva has been captured and that her life is in peril.

Come home already, will ya?"}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "Have you noticed the large drawbridge behind this village? Normally it's separated by the river, but if you use this key here, you can cross the bridge. Just, once you cross the drawbridge, the enemies on the other side will come and attack you at once. If you want to advance safely, you might be better off taking the long detour that goes right around the mountain. Here, take the key.

We Talysian mercenaries wanted to join you's army, so we came all the way here. Princess Caeda's our lady, and the guy who's gonna be her man is important to us too.

I don't know what to do."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Wait, Julian, tell me what happened, in detail."}, {"speaker": "Julian", "line": "Lena's been missing since last night. The villagers speak of some sort of strange priest prowling around lately. It seems that somehow, Lena was taken by this man."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "A priest...? Julian, as it turns out, Princess Maria has gone missing as well. I have a terrible feeling about this. Anyway, staying here won't solve anything. Come with us. I'm worried for Lena, too.

My castle was attacked and the Grustian prince and princess were kidnapped. The perpatrator fled to Macedon, it seems.

I see... I see. As I suspected, it was YOUR doing. The person who kidnapped Grust's prince and princess was the mercenary, Ogma. On your orders, no less!"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I didn't know of this. But if I had the choice, I would have done exactly as you suggested. Back at Grust, even though they were meant to be our enemies, I should have helped those children."}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "You! You clearly speak words of treason! Perhaps I should report this to the Emperor!"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Do as you will. But you're not the only person who intends to visit the palace.

You have endured well until now. Lang, my liege might forgive your frequent rudeness to him, but I will not. Come, draw your sword.

Once the Emperor gets wind of this, I'll crush your puny little Altea!"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Jagen... you're a bag of surprises. To think you'd stand up against Lang like that."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Sire, are you underestimating me in my old age? Bwahaha... I'm not about to let youngsters like Kris hog all the glory just yet. Still, I'll admit it was somewhat foolish to contest with Lang, even if he did push my lord at every turn."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Sire, Sir Jagen. What is our next plan of action?"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "According to Lang, Ogma is on his way to Macedon. He probably intends to visit the village where Lord Wendell resides."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Lord Wendell?"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Lord Wendell is a pontifex of Khadein; he fought as our ally in the last war. I hear he's living in Macedon now. It also happens that the children that Ogma saved were raised by Lord Wendell So I'm sure it would be the perfect time to pay him a visit."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Yes, understood."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "But, I worry about Lang... I pray that nothing bad shall happen..."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Kris, are you aware that we've been searching for the assassins who besieged Altea a year ago...?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Ah! I assume, since you're mentioning it, that you've found a new lead?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "We're not certain, but we've received information that might lead us to them. A few days ago, I heard of a suspicious group heading towards Macedon's northern mountains."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "The northern mountains? What could they be after up there?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Rumors say they are pursuing our former allies in the War of Shadows... And I don't believe they're after a friendly chat with them either."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I see. Then we cannot ignore this lead, especially if lives are at stake. Jagen, Kris, we shall pursue the enemy."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Agreed. Let us prepare to march, with haste."}]}
