It seems there is a battle ongoing."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Alright. Jagen, Kris, let us hurry with our preparations!"}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "So I'm surrounded... How sad, I guess this is the end of the road for me..."}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "Alright, he's right where we want him. Now to savor his pain as we slowly draw the life from his tormented soul..."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "Clarisse... The Altean army has arrived."}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "Tsk! What a nuisance. Reese, I hate to admit it but you were right about this outcome. Alteans never abandon their comrades... You sure learned a lot about that trash from your time staying with them."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "..."}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "My job is to kill, one by one, everyone who sided with Marth in the previous war. Because if his allies live, they'll eventually join him, one after another. And that would be dangerous."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "... Clarisse, are you really up for the task?"}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "I don't need to get MY hands dirty, do I? My underlings can get the job done. We're hardly dealing with strong enemies."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "You'll die if you underestimate Kris and the others, Clarisse. I served as Kris's tactician, but I wasn't much help as one; I didn't give them the advice a tactician should give. Even without me, Kris and the others are strong."}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "What? Have you become attached to the Alteans after your little frolic with them? Then, just sit there and watch. Watch hard and well as I kill your beloved companions. Oh yes, and please... don't get in my way, okay?"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "Alright, I'm leaving the rest to you. Others are coming to help you soon, so hurry and kill them already. If by some chance those rats aren't dead when I return... I'll make sure YOU'RE dead, got it?"}], "recruit-talk": [{"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "Oh, my savior Kris. Thank you kindly for coming to my rescue. I cannot fight, but I can heal your wounded. Take me with you and you'll be very glad you did.", "recruiter": "Kris", "recruit": "Wrys"}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "Wait... what? Where did you lot come from!?"}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "Tsk! This is bad... To think I'd run from the likes of you... I'll remember this!"}], "end": [{"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Sire, are you unhurt?"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Yes, I'm alright. Thank you, Kris."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "We've repelled the assassins, but we cannot afford to linger here."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I agree. I'm worried about Ogma. Let us hurry to Lord Wendell's place!"}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "...Hmm. The Alteans are better than I expected. Oh well. We can always snuff them out later. I'll let them live for now."}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "I warned you. The Altean army is strong..."}, {"speaker": "Clarisse", "line": "Gosh, Reese. You can be annoying sometimes. Whose side are you supposed to be on? Don't tell me you're thinking of betraying Lady Eremiya?"}, {"speaker": "Katarina", "line": "...No. That thought could never cross my mind. We all live for Lady Eremiya. For her sake, I must defeat Kris... I know that well enough."}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "Greetings, Kris, my friend. It's been a while since we last had a decent conversation."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Yes. Ever since the knight training, eh, Father Wrys?"}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "Indeed, and you've become even stronger than you were then... ...Oh, did your hair grow a little?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Really? Well, it is true I haven't had the time to take care of it since we left Altea..."}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "You know, a haircut like mine is astonishingly easy to take care of."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "I-I can imagine..."}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "If you so wish, I could shave your head, so it's like mine."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Eh?"}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "As I'm a monk, I'm quite used to shaving heads. It's quite alright. If you don't like it, you can just let your hair grow and have your previous haircut back. What do you say? Would you allow me to shave your head?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Yes, please."}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "Very well. Then, give me a moment to prepare. ...Are you really sure?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Y-yes..."}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "Then, please sit down. Now, close your eyes..."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "I-I think I'll pass."}, {"speaker": "Wrys", "line": "I see. It's a pity, but perhaps it's for the best. In any case, Kris, I'm counting on you from now on."}]}
