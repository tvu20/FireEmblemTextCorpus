This stone bridge seems to stretch to the heavens, as it spirals around. From the rocks fearful roaring and breathing sounds can be heard, as if the mountain was alive. The Dragon's Table... It is asn ancient ruin of the dragon tribe, and the place where the Divine Dragon King, Naga, sealed away the Earth Dragons. Now, after a period of 600 years, the Earth Dragons are currently awakening, and countless evil demons are being born..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Marth", "line": "......

They have fallen under Gharnef's spell and will attack you given the chance. Gharnef's servants-- the heretic priests possess great power. They are not to be taken lightly. If you let this battle drag on, it may become fiercer than you can handle. Do not stop. Make for the end at once! Once you defeat Gharnef, retrieve the Falchion that he stole from your Altea. As you well know, without the Falchion, defeating Medeus will be nigh impossible..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I understand, Lord Gotoh.
