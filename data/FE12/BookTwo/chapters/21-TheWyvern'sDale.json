It is an undeveloped region populated with wyverns, and ruled by barbarians. But, there is no time to stop, because the fate of the world is in Marth's hands!"], "intro": [{"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Jagen, where are we? Macedon? Or Dolhr?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Both--we are precisely on the border. I hear this place is home to Macedon's great wyverns. But since the area is overrun with barbarians, even the Macedonian soldiers dare not set foot in here."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "I see. You learn something new every day..."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "According to our scouts, a large number of wyverns and barbarians have gathered nearby. It's like Anri's Way... No, it's worse. Sire, please be careful."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Got it. Let's go, Kris. I need to know what's happened to my sister and the others... I have a dreadful feeling about this."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "There you are, Marth!"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "You're...!"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Who are you?! A barbarian of this dale? Please stand back, sire."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "It's alright, Kris. This is Ymir, another ally from the last war. When I met him, he was holding off an entire army to protect some villagers. He's a kind and brave man."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "Yeah, the name's Ymir. I heard Marth was fightin' here and figured I'd come along too."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "I-I see... How rude of me, Sir Ymir. Please forgive my insolence."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "Oh, it's okay. My face is a bit on the scary side, I gotta admit. What's your name?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Ah, yes. I am the Altean Royal Guard, Kris."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "Kris! What a name! It's a real pleasure to meet you."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Likewise."}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Young Man", "line": "On the other side of the mountains is a small hill, called the Dragon's Table. Recently, there have been eerie roaring sounds coming from there. Grandfather and the others are afraid a demon is about to awaken. You mustn't get to close to that place."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "This is the Wyvern's Dale. Don't go any further. Otherwise I fear you'll be burnt to death by the wyverns."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Prince Michalis!? What are you doing here? And you've suffered a grave wound. What happened?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "...Marth... ...I have been waiting... for you..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Huh!?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "...Take this..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "...! This is the Starlight tome. You're giving it to me!?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "That's right... Gharnef... Only with this spell can he be harmed. I managed to take it back from his possession..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Gharnef!? Where is he now?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "The Dragon's Table... Ha... I was careless... I could be... Defeated by Gharnef... Marth... Good luck... I'm already finished. If Minerva is still around... Tell her to... In my place... Rescue Maria..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Michalis!"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Your highness... I leave Maria's fate to you... Urgh."}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "............ Brother...? Could it be... Is it really you...?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "...Minerva...?"}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "Ah! You're wounded! I'll go get help!"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Don't bother... This wound is beyond help. I'd rather you call for... Prince Marth. I have... something I must pass on to him."}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "The prince will be here soon. Hold on, Brother! I'll tend to your wound..."}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Heh... To think I'd need your help in the end... Guh... ngh...!"}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "Brother!"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Minerva... I have something to ask of you. Should I die... Give this tome to Prince Marth. This is as far as I can go... I leave the rest... to you..."}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "B--Brother... Michalis...! No... This isn't like you! When did you become so weak!? The brother I knew was strong and noble... He always found his own way, never relying on anyone else... Do you hear me? I won't accept this! You're going to pass this on yourself, without the help of your younger sister."}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Hmph... Am I being scolded now...?"}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "Brother, listen to me... You cannot die here. You have to live...!"}], "end": [{"speaker": "Marth", "line": "So this is the Dragon's Altar. The place where divine dragon Naga banished the earth dragons..."}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "Indeed. Medeus, the altar's guardian, could not tolerate the human race's atrocities against the Manaketes. Thus, he gathered the surviving dragonkin, forming the Dolhrian Empire. All to obliterate mankind. He was vanquished by Anri once and then defeated a second time by you. However earth dragons boast tremendous life force, and cannot be completely eliminated so easily... Even now, they sleep at this altar."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "You mean to say they'll awaken?!"}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "Not exactly. Even sleeping earth dragons should not awaken for centuries or so. The next time Medeus awakens though, he will rise as a terrifying Shadow Dragon... No, wait...! Perhaps...? Yes, I see... So that's why Gharnef..."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "What's the matter, Lord Gotoh?"}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "Prince Marth. I have finally realized the reason why Gharnef kidnapped the clerics. He intends to use them to resurrect Medeus. To hasten the awakening of a dragon requires the life force of pure, maiden women. Knowing this, Gharnef kidnapped them."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "So that means Elice and the others are in this very altar?"}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "Indubitably... Marth, you must hurry. They are in grave danger! Medeus's awakening... is only a matter of time!!"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Sir Ymir, please forgive me for earlier."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "It's fine. I don't mind at all. It's rare to see someone like me anyway. But it's so warm dressin' like this. Why doesn't anybody else do this? I don't get it."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Oh, is it warm?"}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "Yeah, it's great during winter. Hey! Why don't you try wearin' this for a change? It's a hat made from animal hide. Just wear it! You're gonna see how amazin' it is right away."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "This is... Wow, it is a pretty great hat."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "See, it fits you well. Do you want to wear it for a bit?"}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Yes, I'd love to."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "Whoa! I'm so stoked you said that! It'll look great on you! No doubt about it."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "Oh no, I don't think it suits me."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "That so...? Too bad. But, oh well."}, {"speaker": "Kris", "line": "I'm sorry. After you went to all that trouble too..."}, {"speaker": "Ymir", "line": "It's fine, it's fine. I don't mind at all."}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "Brother...... Brother... why...? Why here...? I--I never wanted to fight you...! I just wanted things to be like they used to... With you and Maria... Brother...... Michalis... Bro...ther......!"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "...Your tears... How long has it been since I saw them last...?"}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "What...? M-Michalis?! Are you...?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "I don't plan on dying in front of you, Minerva. I'd be an endless laughing stock. The Michalis you knew... would never die in a place like this. Am I right?"}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "Brother...! Oh, Brother!"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Hmph, don't get the wrong idea. You and I are still enemies... That will not change. The incompetence of your army sickens me, so you leave me with no choice but to help."}, {"speaker": "Minerva", "line": "Thank goodness... You've finally returned to your old self. I understand. Until the Shadow Dragon breathes his last, let us borrow your strength."}]}
