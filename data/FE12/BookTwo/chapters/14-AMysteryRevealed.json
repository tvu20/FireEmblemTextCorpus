Tiki was created as the daughter of the Divine Dragon King, Naga, and slept in the temple because of the king's will. The king's fear of Tiki's power was that of a loving mother's. If Tiki was to awaken, her tremendous power would eventually cause the destruction of the world... That is what the Divine Dragon King feared. However, Bantu, the king's servant, became attached to Tiki after watching over her for a period of hundreds of years became(sic). He awoke her from her sleep, and took her away. So Tiki only had 10 human years' worth of memory... \"That is so sad, Tiki...\" Marth was too bewildered to think."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Marth", "line": "This is the Ice Dragons' Temple.

The Emblem shield you're carrying is the stolen Shield of Seals. To be honest, it was only recently that I noticed; its exterior had completely changed... After stealing it from the Fane of Raman, the thief removed its jewels and sold them off as treasures. The money was used to fund an army, which, along with three stolen weapons, was used to conquer the world. The thief that went on to become the king of Archanea had the shield, which brought him such good fortune, it became the emblem of his royal family. Now do you understand, Marth?

No... No... When I awoke I was all alone in the dark room... I felt so strange, but also very scared... So very scared... But I couldn't leave that room. I cried many times, and then Uncle Bantu would come to comfort me as usual. One day he took me away, and took me to a human village.
