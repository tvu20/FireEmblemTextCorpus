2565|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Marth|The blizzard has gotten worse. I can barely see anything in front of me... Kris, I think I can see somebody ahead. Is that...|
2566|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Kris|Ah! Sire, please stay behind me. I feel the presence of enemies. Several are currently targeting us.|
2567|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Marth|What!? But, we can't see anything like this. How should we fight back?|
2568|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Kris|We've no choice but to directly engage the enemy. It will probably be a dangerous battle, unlike any we've faced previously.|
2569|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Marth|Indeed. We should select those who'll fight with prudence.|
2570|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Marth|Athena! What brings you here!?|
2571|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Athena|Huff... huff... They are coming after you, Prince Marth. Ve vanted to varn you...|
2572|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Marth|Ah! I see. So you wanted to help me... Thank you, Athena. It's fine now; I'll handle the rest. We'll defeat the enemy!|
2573|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|That wench... How dare she get in our way. If she hadn't spotted us, I could have shot the prince dead. Tsk! Oh well. As long as this blizzard carries on... This battle is mine. You can't see anything, can you? But we can. Now it's time for you to die, blind and blissfully ignorant.|
2574|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|You want to escape from this darkness? I'm afraid I won't let you. You won't see the sunlight ever again.|
2575|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|How... how dare you... I'll... I'll kill... anybody in my way... Just watch me... I'll kill... I'll kill you all!|
2576|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Kris|Sire, we have routed the enemy.|
2577|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Jagen|We have accomplished our objective. There is no need to remain here. Let us continue to the Ice Dragon Shrine.|
2578|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Marth|Indeed. The sooner we meet Lord Gotoh, the better. Let's go.|
2579|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|Unh... Ugh... Lady... Eremiya... I'm... alone... once again...|
2580|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Clarisse...|
2581|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|R-Reese...! Why... are you here...? Don't tell me... You came here to laugh at pathetic old me?|
2582|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Come on, hold on to me. Let's return to the hideout, together.|
2583|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|Wha...?|
2584|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|You can't walk around wounded like this. And you'll freeze to death if you don't find shelter soon.|
2585|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|Why...? Why would you... go so far to help me...! I've always treated... you like dirt and yet you...|
2586|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Because you're my little sister.|
2587|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|...Pfft. You know I'm not your sister. We're both orphans, remember...? We've always been alone...|
2588|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|But, we were raised together by Lady Eremiya... I don't mind if you hate me. But, I don't want to lose you... If I were to lose this one bond... I'd be alone in the dark, again... And the same goes for you.|
2589|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|...Reese...|
2590|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Please, hold onto me.|
2591|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|B-bah... This will be the first and last time I'm gonna obey you, you hear me...?|
2592|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Eremiya|...Yes, I am aware of Altea's actions. We will begin the next phase of our plan. Your wish is our command, Master Gharnef...|
2593|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Lady Eremiya...!|
2594|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Eremiya|Clarisse failed, didn't she?|
2595|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Y-yes... She's severely wounded... We need to have her treated!|
2596|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Eremiya|Dispose of her.|
2597|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|B-but, Lady Eremiya!|
2598|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Eremiya|She's of no use to me wounded like this. Just leave her and she'll die by herself.|
2599|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|...|
2600|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|What's with that face...? It's natural... that I'd die if I failed... I knew... this would happen... but, but...|
2601|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Clarisse...|
2602|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|Go away. I don't want... you to see me like this.|
2603|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|...Very well.|
2604|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|...... Reese... Wait... Don't go... I changed my mind... stay with me. I don't want... to be alone...|
2605|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|Clarisse... I'm right here. I'll always be by your side. After all, I'm your big sister.|
2606|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Clarisse|Bah! You have to be annoying, till the end... ...Sis... ter... ... ... ...|
2607|FE12BookTwo|13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness|Katarina|...Clarisse...|
2608|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|Gra's army is renowned for its mighty armor knights and generals. The late king Jiol--our enemy in the last war--was a general himself.|
2609|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Kris|I see. An army with strong defenses...|
2610|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|In the past, yes. I hear that Gra's army now consists of new recruits. Hardly worthy enemies. Speaking of strong defenses, Kris...|
2611|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|Your defense is truly overwhelming. Only a fool would dare approach you. Even Gra at it's prime could not compete with your defense. This battle has already been decided.|
2612|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|Your defense is quite impressive. No man in Gra could match your defense. This battle has already been decided.|
2613|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|Erm, your defense... could do with a little more work. This is quite worrisome. Kris, the enemies may be new recruits, but don't underestimate them.|
2614|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Princess Sheena, it seems the Altean army has arrived.|
2615|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Really...? It's already the end. Samson, I have brought you much trouble. I need to watch the final days of my Kingdom of Gra. You may leave now.|
2616|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Princess, isn't it already enough? Shouldn't you despise King Jiol for forcefully taking your mother? Isn't that why you hid at Millennium Court and stayed away from this country? Right now you are just being tricked by Hardin, and being used by him.|
2617|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Perhaps. I heard that the people of Gra wished for the restoration of the country, and that's why I agreed to help him. However Hardin is only interested in using us. He would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him. Still, I will not leave! How can I just abandon those fighting for my sake!?|
2618|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Impossible... How can our fresh recruits resist Altea's elites...? Fine, if you're staying, I will also stay to the end. This could be interesting.|
2619|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Samson... Why are you doing this? Aren't you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold? I no longer have money to give you...|
2620|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|I don't know why either. It's just... Sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do. Also, I want to see how that kid fights this battle. If he truly is a hero, perhaps your mind may be changed...|
2621|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheema|What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!|
2622|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Prince Marth... How unfortunate. I thought you a better man.|
2623|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheema|What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!|
2624|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Old Man|Hardin sent troops here to prevent Gra from rebelling. The Archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight.|
2625|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Woman|Princess Sheena is the child of King Jiol's second wife. But, she is different from the king. She is a very kind person. The princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers. Is there no way to save her?|
2626|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Woman|The soldiers here are all foreigners. There's nobody else to protect this country, because the knights of this country all died. Right now, the actions of the Archanea soldiers are deplorable. Their just the same as thieves... Those lowlifes!|
2627|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Young Woman|Ah... Please leave me. I already have nothing to give you.|
2628|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|Ah, please don't get us wrong. We aren't here to steal.|
2629|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Young Woman|But, didn't you all come here from Altea for revenge?|
2630|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|No, we don't want to fight Gra, because Gra and Altea were originally like one family.|
2631|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Young Woman|Is that true...? Then, I will give my most important treasure... to... you|
2632|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|You are Princess Sheena? It's great to see you safe. I don't view Gra as an enemy. Gra and my country were originally one country. The country may have divided after Anri's death, but we always got on well as allies. But, in the previous war, I felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did. Princess Sheena, please allow us to be friends once again. I don't want to fight Gra.|
2633|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Prince Marth... Once I heard that you didn't attack my fleeing soldiers, I was really surprised. You truly are the second coming of King Anri. I trust you. Please... Treat the citizens of Gra... as if they were your citizens. I will hand my whole country to your care... Prince Marth.|
2634|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|That's great Sheena. Now I can finally leave without worry.|
2635|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Samson... Can you not leave...?|
2636|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|You don't need me anymore. From now on Prince Marth will protect you.|
2637|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Don't leave! I don't want you to leave...|
2638|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Huh, what? Why keep me? It doesn't seem like you. ...Fine. If you say you need me, I won't go anywhere else. I will protect you wherever you may go. Is that fine with you?|
2639|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Yes...|
2640|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Tomas|Prince Marth, I've been waiting for you. I'm Tomas, an Archanean soldier--or was. I've since retired from the army. The Archaneans here just want to sacrifice the defenceless Gra soldiers. This act of brutality by my former homeland... I cannot tolerate. Please, Prince Marth. Let me fight with you in some way.|
2641|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|You... You dare treat my citizens like that... Die!|
2642|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Sheena|Forgive me, citizens of Gra.|
2643|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Prince Marth... I thought you were a noble person, but you're just a murderer... You disappoint me.*|
2644|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Samson|Sheena...|
2645|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|Sire, to keep fighting like this is pointless. All we are accomplishing is buying Hardin more time.|
2646|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|My thoughts exactly. If we continue like this, more blood will be spilt for naught. Kris, do you have any sort of plan?|
2647|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Kris|According to our information, the enemy's primary force is concentrated along the highway. I wonder if we can avoid that route, by passing through the mountains?|
2648|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Jagen|Hmph, we'd have to cross Adria Pass... But the steep mountains make it dangerous for an army of our size.|
2649|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Kris|That's true, and I fear the enemy may have prepared an ambush as well. Our bravery could be our undoing. But it is the fastest possible route. If we could just break through there, we'd be in walking distance of the palace.|
2650|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Marth|I am prepared for the danger. We managed to conquer the same perilous road that Anri walked. Compared to that... Jagen, Kris. We can overcome this challenge. Order the advance!|
2651|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Frost|Oof... Seems I've finally caught up.|
2652|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Kris|Hmm, and you are?|
2653|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Frost|My name is Frost. I am a priest of Macedon. When Macedon was taken over by those warmonging rebels... You came and saved our country. Thanks to you, my family's now safe. I have come to return the favor.|
2654|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Kris|I see. But hasn't it been some time since Prince Marth freed Macedon...?|
2655|FE12BookTwo|17-Gra'sSunSets|Frost|Your army marched at speed and this old geezer just couldn't keep up. Eventually I lost sight of you... But then I heard that Marth had freed Altea as well, and I finally managed to catch up with you here, in Gra. I am old now, but I can still fight. Please, allow me to to join you.|
2656|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Huh? Kris, what's with the hat?|
2657|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|This? Lord Wendell gave it to me so that my cold wouldn't get any worse.|
2658|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|From Lord Wendell, I see... Chiasmir Bridge has a strong sea wind, so it's good to have a hat to keep warm. It suits you, Kris.|
2659|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Really? Thank you, sire.|
2660|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Cain|Sire, you're safe! Kris! you too! You've guarded Prince Marth well.|
2661|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Sir Cain! You made it!|
2662|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|I'm truly glad that you came back unharmed, Cain.|
2663|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Cain|Yeah, somehow I managed to shake off the enemy and escape here. But the enemy is already approaching from the north.|
2664|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Don't worry. We will crush them.|
2665|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Cain|No, not this time. Hardin is being protected by a mysterious power: we can't lay a finger on him. So even if we fight him now, we haven't a chance of winning. Please, head to the northwestern fortress. There's a boat across the river, which we can use to escape to the Khadein desert.|
2666|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jagen|Sire, the free company to the south will probably make their move soon. Indeed, now's not the time to fight. For the time being, let's do as Cain suggests and make our escape. After that, we'll think of something...|
2667|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|I see... I don't like it, but we haven't a choice... Everyone, hurry to the northwest fortress!|
2668|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Villager|If ya ask me, archers'll always get along well with archers.|
2669|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|Oh look, if it isn't Prince Marth. Long time no see, Lad. It seems so noisy out; I wonder what's happened?|
2670|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Ah, Bantu! Fancy meeting you in a place like this. How is Tiki?|
2671|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|Oh, she is no longer by my side. Lord Gotoh took her to the Ice Dragon's Temple again.|
2672|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|The Ice Dragon's temple? Where's that? I've never heard of such a place...|
2673|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|It's in the icy lands, far north of here. But it's no place for humans. Besides the hero Anri, no man has been there yet.|
2674|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Anri?! Are you, perchance, referring to the "Realm of the Gods" from Anri's legends?|
2675|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Bantu|I'm not at liberty to say anything more. If you want to know more, you should ask Lord Gotoh. Anyhow, I have a favor to ask of you. My precious firestone was stolen by thieves. If you can get it back for me, I'll show you how it works. Thank you, Prince Marth.|
2676|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|...Hasten the preparations of the troops within the fortress. I want Marth cornered like a rat...|
2677|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Heh heh heh... Prince, your struggle is in vain. But let us continue this game for a while. Just know that you're fast running out of time. Soon, I will kill you myself...|
2678|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Heh heh heh... Prince Marth, it's been far too long.|
2679|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Hardin... Why did you attack our country? What would compel you to do such an act? I... I can't believe this. Have you really changed this much?|
2680|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Prince, I am the ruler of this continent and the Emperor of Archanea. I will show no quarter to anyone who opposes me. That includes you, Prince... I must destroy this foul world... It is beyond salvation. Traitors, playtime is over. You will all die here. All soldiers, attack! Do not leave a single traitor standing!|
2681|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Caeda|Good day, sir.|
2682|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|Ack! You, y-you're... Caeda!|
2683|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Caeda|Thank goodness, Roger. It's nice to see you again.|
2684|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|Uh... Uhm, you should know, I've no plans to betray Archanea. I was just thinking about that time when you asked me "do you believe in love?" But I'm different from who I was back then.|
2685|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Ceada|Really? But you still seem like a nice man. That's why I wanted to speak with you again.|
2686|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|Uhh...|
2687|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Caeda|May I just ask, why are you fighting for Archanea?|
2688|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|Be-because Archanea has already taken over the world. Resistance is futile: no one can win. My life is precious to me. If I side with whoever's stronger, then I'm guaranteed to live longer...|
2689|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Caeda|I see.|
2690|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|A-are you disappointed with me?|
2691|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Caeda|No, never. As I thought, you're fighting for what you believe in. You're not different. You're the same, kind man as when I first met you and I'm happy for that.|
2692|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|Uhhh... Wait- you're leaving?!|
2693|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Caeda|Yes. I too must fight for what I believe in. But I'll make a request to Marth so that we don't have to fight you. I'm happy that we could talk again, Roger.|
2694|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|W-wait! ...As I thought, you're still very kind. Dare I say, we don't have girls quite like you back in Grust or Archanea. Um, perhaps... I suppose I could... Aw heck, I'm going with you again!|
2695|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Wait, Sir Jeorge. I wish to speak with you.|
2696|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|Prince Marth... Please, lower your weapon. I don't want to fight you.|
2697|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|I know. As do I. You taught Gordin how to use a bow. And you were an instructor to the junior knights of Altea. You've been a great boon to Altea: I could never fight you, Sir Jeorge.|
2698|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|Prince... I pledge allegiance to Princess Nyna. But I can tolerate Hardin no longer... Taking other countries by force, executing "rebels" without reason...|
2699|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|...Hardin was my friend. But he has changed beyond recognition. If he is committing any sort of crime, then I shall stop him. Jeorge, please, help me.|
2700|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|...I understand, Prince. To return the kingdom of Archanea to what it was once before... I will take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland.|
2701|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Master! Please, wait!|
2702|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|Hm...? Gordin? Long time no see. You seem to have gotten a little sturdier, but has your bow arm improved any?|
2703|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Yes, at the moment, I... They call me Altea's master of bows. It's thanks to you, Master, that I've been able to progress this far.|
2704|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|And? Did you come here because you wanted to challenge your old teacher?|
2705|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|N-no! It's not like that... ...I might be asking the impossible, but I'd like you to fight alongside us again, sir.|
2706|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|......|
2707|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Please! Master!!|
2708|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|I pledged allegiance to Princess Nyna, but as for Hardin... I've had it with him. Taking other countries by force, executing "rebels" without reason. The Archanean army I see now is just a collection of hired thugs. There's not even a shred of chivalry left. To return the kingdom of Archanea to what it was once before... I must take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland. Gordin. Convey that to Prince Marth.|
2709|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Gordin|Thank you, Master!!|
2710|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|I don't want to fight you guys, but it's not as if I have a choice...|
2711|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Roger|Ugh... I just wanted to meet her... once more... once more...|
2712|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Astram|You traitors! I'll show you the might of Mercurius!!|
2713|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Astram|Midia... My love...|
2714|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|You wouldn't have needed to die if you hadn't come so close, fools...|
2715|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jeorge|What fools...|
2716|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Rebel soldiers... Come to die, have you? I'll show you the terror of Gradivus!|
2717|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Prince Marth! I'll bury you with these very hands!|
2718|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Who are you? Your face is unknown to me.|
2719|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Kris. I am Prince Marth's Royal Guard. Emperor Hardin of Archanea, the prince told me you were once a trusted friend. Why would you do something like this?|
2720|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Kris, is it...? What does it matter to you? You will die here regardless.|
2721|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|Who are you? Your face is unknown to me.|
2722|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Kris. I am Prince Marth's Royal Guard. Emperor Hardin of Archanea, I never knew you in the past. But I do know this: you are now the prince's enemy.|
2723|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Hardin|You may come, Kris. But no one may even scratch me. You will soon know to fear... the power of the Darksphere...|
2724|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jagen|Please hurry, sire. The enemy is closing in on us.|
2725|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|But everyone is still fighting. I can't just leave them behind.|
2726|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Worry not, sire. I will remain here. I will regroup with everyone later.|
2727|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Marth|Kris! But...|
2728|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Jagen|Sire, you of all people know that Kris is more than capable. As long as Kris is there, everyone will escape safely and reunite with you at once. Now sire, to the boat!|
2729|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|I will be the rear guard. Everyone, hurry up and escape! Lord Wendell, you too!|
2730|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Oh, right. I just remembered. I should probably return this hat...|
2731|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Oh, yeah. I just remembered. I should probably return this hat...|
2732|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Wendell|I don't mind if you keep it for a little longer. Do you wish to give it back?|
2733|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Yes. Thank you, it was most comfortable.|
2734|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Wendell|No no, 'twas nothing. ...By the way, should I be hurrying too?|
2735|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Erm... Yes, hurry up and escape!|
2736|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|No... If it's all right with you, I'd like to hold on to it a little longer.|
2737|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Wendell|Yes, that would be splendid. ...By the way, should I be hurrying too?|
2738|FE12BookTwo|08-SoulfulBridge|Kris|Erm... Yes, hurry up and escape!|
2739|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Marth|The war is, at long last, over. Thank you, my friends. My words cannot express my thanks...|
2740|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Kris|Sire, you did it...|
2741|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Luke|I did it! And thus marks the end of the Legend of the Knight Luke!|
2742|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Rody|The war is over. I can return to my motherland at last.|
2743|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Cecille|Prince Marth... Kris... Everyone...|
2744|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Gordon|Prince Marth really did it! Now, peace will reign forever...|
2745|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Ryan|W-we really did it...|
2746|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Draug|I'm sure the people throughout the lands will be joyous.|
2747|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Arran|My dream has been fulfilled... Now, I can go without regrets...|
2748|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Malicia|Granny... We did it. We did it!|
2749|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Catria|Prince Marth... I'm glad...|
2750|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Warren|And now... back to my old life.|
2751|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Cord|Time to celebrate our victory. I'mma go wild tonight!|
2752|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Linde|Darkness may return time and time again... But the light will forever shine on.|
2753|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Palla|It was a long war. But now, finally...|
2754|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Bord|Jus' tonight, I'm gonna drink until I fall and then some!|
2755|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Julian|It's over, at last...|
2756|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Matthis|What? It's over? I'm not... dead?|
2757|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Wrys|The most important thing is that peace has returned.|
2758|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Ogma|The war is over. I must inform King Talys of the good news...|
2759|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Yumina|Father, mother... It's finally over...|
2760|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Yubello|Lorenz... I'll keep on working hard.|
2761|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Sirius|...|
2762|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Castor|Mother, I'm comin' back soon.|
2763|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caeda|I'm glad... Marth is safe...|
2764|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Barst|Yeah! Time to drink the night away for a change.|
2765|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Rickard|Heh heh, I wonder how much treasure I can get my hands on?|
2766|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Frey|Splendid battle, sire.|
2767|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Norne|Was I of use, I wonder?|
2768|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Samto|Oh yeah, now I'll become famous, too.|
2769|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Wendell|Lord Gotoh... People have once again overcome their fate...|
2770|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caesar|Please hang in there. I'll be back soon, I promise...|
2771|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Radd|We can save her now...|
2772|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Navarre|Prince Marth... well done.|
2773|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Feena|Shall I show everyone my victory dance?|
2774|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Cain|A splendid battle, and a splendid victory!|
2775|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Bantu|With the war past us, I shall watch over the world quietly...|
2776|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Roger|New world, new encounters... Sounds good to me.|
2777|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Jeorge|Now, Archanea will return to its former glory...|
2778|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Minerva|Splendid work, Prince Marth. You've managed the feat that nobody else could have done...|
2779|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Etzel|The era of war is over... The peaceful world she wanted will now come to fruition...|
2780|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Merric|As long as Prince Marth and the others are around... No age of darkness threatens us.|
2781|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Elrean|Alone, I couldn't possibly accomplish something like this. So this is the power of friendship...|
2782|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Dice|Once I get my reward from the prince, I'mma gamble like no tomorrow.|
2783|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Maris|Its over, it's really over. Y'know, I'm lookin' forward to my reward.|
2784|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Horace|My people will surely be overjoyed...|
2785|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Jake|Anna, we did it. I'll tell you all about it, later!|
2786|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Darros|Well, whadya know? A hopeless guy like me was o' use to Prince Marth...|
2787|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Robert|The people will be oppressed no longer.|
2788|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Belf|General Camus, the Shadow Dragon has been vanquished. It's all over now.|
2789|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Leiden|If only General Camus were here to see us... That's my only regret.|
2790|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Beck|Well, I reckon it's time I start a new journey...|
2791|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Athena|Ve von. Ve must thank every vun.|
2792|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Xane|A world of men, huh? Well, I guess it ain't so bad...|
2793|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Tiki|Yay! I'm so happy!|
2794|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Est|It's finally over. Abel, I...|
2795|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Dolph|This war may be over. But the battle for our motherland's true peace begins now.|
2796|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Abel|The war is over at last. The days of peace and tranquility will soon return...|
2797|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Macellan|Now, the people of Archanea need suffer no longer.|
2798|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Astram|So I was mistaken... I must work to make amends.|
2799|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Katarina|Prince Marth... Kris... I'm so happy...|
2800|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Tomas|Archanea and Gra... will surely improve now... That's what I want to believe.|
2801|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Sheema|My country's fate will finally change... You have my thanks, Prince Marth.|
2802|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Samson|...'Twas a good battle.|
2803|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Frost|Now my family will finally be able to live in peace.|
2804|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Roshea|Coyote... Did you see us...?|
2805|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Vyland|I still have my doubts. But, it was better this way...|
2806|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Sedgar|Coyote...|
2807|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Wolf|...|
2808|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Midia|My nation has collapsed... But even so, I shall continue to live as a knight of Archanea.|
2809|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Ymir|Marth is amazing. I worked hard, too.|
2810|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Michalis|It was obvious we'd prevail. You had me on your side, after all.|
2811|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Nagi|This is... good...|
2812|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Lena|Julian... It was only because you were there that I could...|
2813|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Maria|Michalis... Minerva... Can we be a happy family again...?|
2814|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Nyna|Camus... you're...|
2815|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Elice|Merric... Thank you...|
2816|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Gotoh|Marth, brave prince of Altea. Thanks to your valiant efforts, Shadow Dragon Medeus has been completely obliterated. Medeus's servants--the earth dragons-- have once again returned to darkness. As long as the Binding Shield exists, they will never see the light again. Marth, the chosen Prince of Light, descendant of the hero Anri. You have not only saved mankind, but us dragonkin as well...|
2817|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Tiki|Mar-Mar!! Does this mean I don't need to go back to the Ice Dragon Shrine anymore? I'm so happy! I love being with everyone, after all. I don't want to be all alone ever again. This is like... a dream come true. I'm so happy, so very happy. I love you, Mar-Mar!!|
2818|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Malicia|Honestly, Tiki, for how long do you plan on hogging Prince Marth? Prince Marth looks like he's enjoying it too. Doesn't he worry that you might get mad, Princess Caeda?|
2819|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caeda|Please Malicia, you're so silly. But you're right, Marth looks happy...|
2820|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Malicia|Who wouldn't? Especially after having a heavy burden lifted from their shoulders? Prince Marth has always been forced to carry such a heavy responsibility. It must have been hard on him. But Princess, you didn't have an easy time either, am I right? With everyone surrounding Marth day and night, you could seldom talk to him. You must have felt lonely.|
2821|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caeda|Yes I did... but it's alright. As long as Marth is safe, I have no other wish. You see, I prayed to God. When I found out Marth had been tasked with such an important mission, I asked for God to take my life, should Marth ever have to sacrifice his... That's all I could do for Marth.|
2822|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Malicia|...Sigh, I give up. There's no way I could compare to you, Princess. But, you'll have to wait no longer. Because your prince has finally come back to you. Look, Princess, he's looking over here. Be brave!|
2823|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caeda|Marth...|
2824|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Marth|Caeda, it's finally over. I've made you suffer, too. Please accept my apologies.|
2825|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caeda|No, I'm the one who ought to apologize... I wasn't any help to you.|
2826|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Marth|Don't be silly. I've only come this far because you were by my side, Caeda. And besides, the hard part begins now. The seven kingdoms of Archanea are to be unified. And everyone expects me to accept responsibility of the new kingdom. However, there's no way I could handle such a position by myself. Caeda, I want your assistance. I need you.|
2827|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caeda|Marth, let me tell you something... When I left Talys, I made a vow. I swore that I would go wherever you went, and that I'd trust you no matter what happened. So, no matter how painful the war was, I was able to endure. Because, Marth... I...|
2828|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Jagen|Sire... You've done such a magnificent job. I'm speechless for words.|
2829|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Arran|The fact I could devote my last moments to fight under Prince Marth's banner is my life's pride.|
2830|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Cain|Truly! We're honored to be by the prince's side.|
2831|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Abel|Yes. Even though I'm no knight now... fighting together with Prince Marth was my honor.|
2832|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Elice|Marth... Please be happy from now on...|
2833|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Draug|Seems we'll be busy from now on! All the kingdoms need to be rebuilt, so we have a mountain of work to do.|
2834|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Frey|True. And yet, we can see hope in the eyes of all people.|
2835|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Gordon|If we work hard now, we can turn the world onto the right path... That's what I truly believe.|
2836|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Norne|I'm sure the people of this world have received that hope. Because of Prince Marth...|
2837|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Ryan|W-we've won? It feels so unreal... Somebody pinch me--ouch!|
2838|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Luke|Hey, you asked for it! But truly, our battles will be told as legends for generations to come!|
2839|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Rody|Getting carried away, I see... But, I'm glad everyone from the 7th Platoon is safe.|
2840|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Cecil|Yup. The fact we can laugh together as friends like this is what pleases me the most. And Katarina, that you includes you of course.|
2841|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Katarina|Yes... I feel everyone's happiness as well. Kris...|
2842|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Kris|Yes, we'll be together forever.|
2843|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Wrys|The bonds of people are truly a wondrous sight, no matter your age.|
2844|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Yubello|Ah, Sir Sirius? Where did he go? He was here until a moment ago...|
2845|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Yumina|It's okay, Yubello. We must become stronger from here on. I'm sure Sirius wanted that, too...|
2846|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Roger|I gotta return to Grust and work hard to rebuild my motherland. Say Malicia, you, er, wanna go back with me?|
2847|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Malicia|Sorry, but this girl's taken. I have to look for my prince, after all!|
2848|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Belf|Robert, Leiden. Let's move out.|
2849|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Robert|Understood. We shall now become knights who protect the weak.|
2850|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Leiden|That's what General Camus would have wanted us to do.|
2851|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Minerva|Palla, Catria, Est. The war is finally over. You've done well.|
2852|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Palla|Commander, your ideal world where all can live in peace... It may finally become a reality.|
2853|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Catria|I agree. As long as Prince Marth is here, I'm sure it will...|
2854|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Est|Oh, that's right. Let's all go to Altea. We must thank Prince Marth!|
2855|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Maria|Ooh, I would love that! I want to see his dashingness too!|
2856|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Matthis|Lena! I was worried about you. Tell me, did Julian make any distasteful advances on you?|
2857|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Julian|Hey, and why would I do somethin' like that? C'mon, at a time like this...!|
2858|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Lena|Teehee, I see you two have been getting along while I was away.|
2859|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Rickard|Chief, don't you leave me behind! We vowed to stay together, didn't we?|
2860|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Warren|...I don't like the noise. But, I've discovered the worth of friendship. Thanks.|
2861|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caeda|Ogma, fellow Talysians. I must express my gratitude to you all for protecting Marth in my stead...|
2862|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Cord|Princess, we'd go through hell and high water for you and yer husband.|
2863|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Bord|Well, that and Ogma asked us to. Right, boss?|
2864|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Ogma|Yeah. Bord, Cord, you did well. Barst, you helped a lot too.|
2865|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Barst|It was nothin'. I just wanted to live my days in peace again.|
2866|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Castor|It's time I return to me hometown. Thankfully, I've saved up a lot of gold.|
2867|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Darros|I should try and earn money too, but by doing honest work instead.|
2868|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Linde|Princess Nyna! Oh, Princess, I'm so glad you're safe...|
2869|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Nyna|Linde... I apologize for making you worry.|
2870|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Astram|Midia, I'm sorry. I was overtaken by anger and forgot what was most important.|
2871|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Midia|You needn't apologize, Astram. Just don't ever leave my side again...|
2872|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Jeorge|Good heavens, it seems we're in the way here. Sir Horace, where might you off to?|
2873|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Horace|I must inform the people about the advent of peace.|
2874|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Dolph|Macellan, I shall not return to the military.|
2875|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Macellan|Yeah, we oughta try and rebuild Archanea as part of its people.|
2876|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Tomas|I'm coming along too. For the people of Archanea...|
2877|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Radd|It's over at last. Now, we can save her. Aren't you glad, Caesar?|
2878|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Caesar|Of course. And I have you to thank, Radd.|
2879|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Navarre|...|
2880|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Feena|W-Wait, Navarre! Where're you going? Don't forget me! Wait for meeee!|
2881|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Samto|Navarre! I want to become your disciple. Wait for meee!|
2882|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Jake|Well, s'bout time I went back to Anna. Beck, what're you going to do?|
2883|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Beck|I was reckonin' about a new journey. Let us meet by Anna's shop again, someday.|
2884|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Ymir|I'm goin' back to the village. Everyone is waitin' for me.|
2885|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Athena|Ve... Ve finally repaid favor. This voman vill return to her country...|
2886|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Frost|I'm heading back home to my family. You two are really close, aren't you? You kinda remind me of my family.|
2887|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Dice|That we are. Oh yeah, this 'ole family talk reminds me: I can't stay gamblin' forever. Gotta find a man for mah hardworkin' gal. Right, Maris?|
2888|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Maris|Quit yer nonsense, Pops! I don't want no man!|
2889|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Wolf|...So it's over.|
2890|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Sedgar|Yeah. Everything is...|
2891|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Roshea|Coyote, did we do the right thing...?|
2892|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Vyland|No, Roshea. Never question yourself.|
2893|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Wolf|That's right. We must continue to fight. To clear Coyote's name.|
2894|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Wendell|At last, a world without war is born. Merric, Elrean, you both did well.|
2895|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Elrean|Teacher! The words you spoke to me... I think I understand them now. I must apologize to Merric...|
2896|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Merric|Elrean... No apology is needed; I'm your friend. Ever since the day we met.|
2897|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Etzel|Seeing the bonds of people dissolving the conflicts between them... 'Tis a promising new world indeed.|
2898|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Sheema|The war is over. Samson, will you... stay with me from now on?|
2899|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Samson|Didn't I already give you my answer, Sheema? I'll go anywhere you wish.|
2900|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Tiki|Ban-Ban! Let's go to the village together again. It's been so long, I wanna see everyone!|
2901|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Bantu|Ooh, indeed. Once they see your smile, I'm sure they'll all be happy, too.|
2902|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Xane|Those guys are so carefree. But I suppose I can start slacking off as well.|
2903|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Nagi|Indeed. I, too, can finally... return to my eternal sleep...|
2904|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Marth|Thank you, Kris. For protecting and supporting me. No amount of thanks would be enough. But, among the people, your deeds are being told as things I've done alone... That just will not do. Once we return to the castle, I'll...|
2905|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Kris|If you allow me, sire... I have no need for a name. I don't want stories to be told of me.|
2906|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Marth|Kris...?|
2907|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Kris|Sire. With this war now over, a hero will be needed. A hero called Prince Marth. There are still hostilities between people who have fought for so long. Those won't disappear easily. In order to have everyone's agreement, a king everyone recognizes-- a godlike hero is needed. And that hero must be you, sire, and you alone.|
2908|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Marth|But then, what you've done so far will be...|
2909|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Kris|Even if the world doesn't know, you do, sire, and that's enough for me. I shall stay by your side. I shall be your shadow.|
2910|FE12BookTwo|XX-Epilogue|Marth|Kris... You're... ...Why, I wonder? Ever since we met, I felt a special connection with you. Fate sent you to me... I can't help but think that. Thank you, Kris. Please stay with me. Kris, you're my other half, my true friend...|
2911|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Marth|Kris, just ahead is the Dark Pontifex, Gharnef--possibly the strongest sorcerer alive... or dead. Kris...|
2912|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Marth|Your resistance to magic is impeccable. You might just be our strongest hope of defeating Gharnef. Yes. If you are there, then... we stand to win.|
2913|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Kris|Sire... I'm honored. I'll give it my all!|
2914|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Gharnef|So you've come, boy. How many times must you get in my way? Enough! I tire of our games!!|
2915|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Marth|Gharnef, what have you done with my sister and the others?! Release them at once!|
2916|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Gharnef|Heh heh heh... I've allowed them the honor of being sacrifices for the Shadow Dragon's resurrection. You will never see them again. Emperor Medeus will soon be reborn in his true and darkest form. And they will usher in a new era. 'Tis a pity. Their souls couldn't bear the suffering and shattered into pieces... Even I am powerless to help them. Shame, really. I have them to thank for the Shadow Dragon's awakening. Not even the Binding Shield can stop him now. I applaud you for coming this far. But... little prince... you will go no further. I will kill you here, and you will die knowing that you are nothing!!|
2917|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Gharnef|Heh heh heh... Perhaps... a taste of Imhullu's might is necessary.|
2918|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Gharnef|Heh heh... You're too late... The end is nigh...|
2919|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Gharnef|Your blade is blunt before me, Marth... I'll smash you and the Binding Shield into pieces!!|
2920|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Marth|I do not intend to fall here. Out of my way, Gharnef!|
2921|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Gharnef|Heh heh heh... Allow me demonstrate Imhullu's might...|
2922|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Kris|I will not let Prince Marth die. I won't...!|
2923|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Gharnef|Heh heh heh... Allow me demonstrate Imhullu's might...|
2924|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Kris|I will not let Prince Marth die. I won't let the likes of you lay even a finger on him...!|
2925|FE12BookTwo|23-TheDarkPontifexLives|Kris|Sire, this way. More stairs!|
2926|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|This place... It's incredible... I feel as though I'm burning up just by standing here.|
2927|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|This is Flame Barrel... The fire dragons' graveyard. It's where the fire dragons who've degenerated into savage beasts come to wait for their death.|
2928|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Degenerated, you say...? What do you mean by that?|
2929|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|I'm not sure if you're aware, but the dragon tribe is dyin'. Those who don't confine their true, dragon form in a stone eventually lose all reason and become monsters.|
2930|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|So that's why they become Manaketes? Xane, if you know something about the dragon tribe, please tell me.|
2931|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|If you really wanna know... Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragon tribe settled down on this continent, and created a civilization. They possessed intellect and abilities far exceedin' those of humans. But suddenly, outta nowhere, their day of destruction came. At first, they couldn't bear children. Then they began to lose their minds, goin' berserk one after the next. The elders warned that the end of dragons as a species was approachin'. There was no longer any way to prevent it. However, there was one way they could survive: to discard their identities as dragons and live on as humans. The dragons fell into a panic. Those who believed the elders sealed their forms within stones and became humans. But those who couldn't throw away their pride as a dragon; those who adamantly refused to become human... They eventually lost their minds and became naught but beasts...|
2932|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Those fire dragons before us...|
2933|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Yeah, they're a livin' example. And it's not just them. There are many others. But they've all gone feral now. There's no way for them to go back... Worse still, they've been manipulated and degraded like cattle by the fire clans who rule over this valley. Well, princey. Whadya say we get out of here? The clansmen around here ain't friendly; if we hang around, we'll end up as bait for their dragon pets.|
2934|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Darros! What brings you here?! I thought you had washed your hands of your pirating days...|
2935|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Darros|Prince Marth... Forgive me. I was lookin' t'start anew, but there be no place t'go for an outcast like me... To resume and continue these crimes; 'tis dishonorable indeed.|
2936|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|I see... Darros, you cannot stay here. Come with us.|
2937|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Darros|Prince Marth... Ye would still accept a fool like me...? Prince, I... This time, I be changin' for sure. Me life is yours!|
2938|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Darros|Please forgive me. I never wanted this.|
2939|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Darros|Of course... 'Course I'd die... for what I've done...|
2940|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Phew! And that be the end of the fire dragons' valley. How you doin', princey?|
2941|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|I'm fine... I think. Xane, I believe you said that there were other feral dragon tribes.|
2942|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Yeah. In addition to this valley, there's the Wyvern's Dale, the Ice Dragon Shrine and the Dragon's Altar...|
2943|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|The Dragon's Altar?|
2944|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|It's a dragon graveyard in the mountains of Macedon. There, the earth dragons sleep. A long time ago... Thousands of years ago in fact... The mighty earth dragons lost their minds and attacked the humans. 'Course, the humans barely stood a chance. Most were annihilated, and the rest pushed into the desolate corners of the continent. And then... the divine dragon Naga, strongest of them all, waged a war for humanity. It was a fierce battle, but Naga emerged victorious in the end, and sealed the earth dragons below Dolhr, in a deep sleep. And so that the power of the seal would not wither, she created the "shield of the five orbs" and placed it in the Fane of Raman.|
2945|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|I see... I understand now. In other words, our guardian deity Naga depicted in legend was the divine dragon that saved humanity. But then, what about the divine sword Falchion?|
2946|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Naga took pity on you humans, with no way of protecting yourselves, so she created it from one of her fangs. Then, together with the shield, she sealed it in the fane, and had the remainin' dragon houses watch over humanity. She put the newly born Tiki to sleep and thus ended her 5,000-year life. 'Cause of all this, Gotoh's tryin' his best to carry out Naga's order.|
2947|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Wait, Xane... Are you telling me...!?|
2948|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Xane|Yes: Gotoh is a divine dragon. And guess what? So am I.|
2949|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Jagen|Blast... This heat is absurd. I wasn't sweating this much in the desert... I'm usually tolerant of heat, but this is simply unbearable... But Kris, you seem...|
2950|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Jagen|You seem... unfazed. Are you not hot?|
2951|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Kris|I have confidence in my strength. Sir Jagen, it seems that our companions are catching up to us. I'll go and carry them over here.|
2952|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Jagen|What strength... It's as though you're invulnerable. Your reliability is astounding.|
2953|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|||
2954|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|||
2955|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Kris|Yes, I've still some strength in me. Sir Jagen, it seems that our companions are catching up to us. I'll go and support them.|
2956|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Jagen|Good. I'm depending on you.|
2957|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Jagen|You seem a little dizzy... Are you holding out alright?|
2958|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Kris|No... I-I'm... not doing so well... Still... If I could just use my strength... Oh no, I feel all weak...|
2959|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Jagen|Kris, are you well?! Oomph, how troublesome... You'd best hold onto me.|
2960|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Kris|I-I'm sorry...|
2961|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Belf|Please pardon my sudden rudeness, but might you be Prince Marth?|
2962|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|Who are you...?|
2963|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Belf|I am Belf, and these men here are Robert and Leiden. We rushed here because we wish to join your battle.|
2964|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Robert|We were once knights of the Sable Order of Grust, but we have now separated from our homeland.|
2965|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Leiden|We threw away our ranks as knights, and now live to protect those who are powerless.|
2966|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|The Sable Order of Grust... But in the previous war, we fought against the Sable Order as enemies. Despite that, you're willing to join our army?|
2967|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Belf|Our general wished for us to protect the weak, regardless of nationality. He is gone now, so we would like to fulfill his final wish.|
2968|FE12BookTwo|12-GraveyardOfFireDragons|Marth|............ I see. You seem to speak truly. Very well. I'd like you to fight alongside us.|
2969|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Kris, may I have a moment? Wh-what in the blazes!? M-may I ask, what happened to your hair?|
2970|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Kris|Father Wrys cut my hair for me. Is something wrong, sire?|
2971|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|He, uh, certainly did. Well, if you like it, then wonderful. ...... W-well then, let's begin the war council.|
2972|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Kris|Yes, sire.|
2973|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|Yuliya, Jubelo. This place is notorious for the Macedonian Vikings. If we could, we'd stay the hell away, but the village where Lord Wendell resides is just past this area.|
2974|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jubelo|Mister Ogma... I'm scared... Can we go back...?|
2975|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Yuliya|Jubelo! Get a hold of yourself! You're a man, are you not? Show some spine! You can use a Fire tome, can't you? So... fight with it!|
2976|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jubelo|But Master Wendell said that we mustn't fight... Besides, I don't like fighting.|
2977|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Yuliya|Ugh, stop complaining! It's just you and me now. You have to stay strong, because I... sniff... I don't know what we're supposed to do...|
2978|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jubelo|Oh... I'm sorry, Yuliya... I'll do my best, so... please don't cry!|
2979|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|Damn... This can't be good... We've been spotted. Kids, we've got no choice; we're going to have to cut through. Do not leave my side!|
2980|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Boy|D'you know of a staff called Rescue? I hear you can bring faraway allies right next to you in a flash! It'd be so cool if it were true!|
2981|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Girl|Oh, those "Star Shards" are so shiny and pretty. If you hold on to them, something good might happen to you.|
2982|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Villager|These days, all them bandits and pirates've been doin' as they please. Geez. This wouldn't 'ave 'appened if it weren't for all them political tomfoolery.|
2983|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Villager|Oh, you're... you're... the prince of Altea! How nice of you to drop by, sir!|
2984|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|I heard Lord Wendell was living here.|
2985|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Villager|Yes, that, er... was correct... Yesterday, a group of Archanean soldiers suddenly came and took the pontifex away. Although, Prince... He did leave his magic tome behind. I believe it's wind magic. Please, take it with you.|
2986|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Well, if it isn't Castor! What brings you to a place like this?|
2987|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|Ah, Prince Marth! Erm... Actually, I need money for medicine for me sick mother. But I couldn't find any work in Talys, so I moved here instead.|
2988|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|I see... That's terrible... I do hope your mother gets better. Well, goodbye then...|
2989|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|......... Wait!! Me mother, she's really sick... I need money, sir...|
2990|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Hm? Oh right, here. It's only a little, but I hope it helps.|
2991|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|Uhm... Thank you, Prince Marth. You don't have to be so kind to a guy like me...|
2992|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Castor... That's a bit much... It's only natural to help someone in need.|
2993|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Castor|No, Prince Marth! You've done so much for me. I want to help you. Please, let me fight alongside you. You have my life at your disposal!!|
2994|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Guile|Gahahaha! Won't be long now 'til my boys, hidden in the forts, all spring out 'n' attack. I can almost see the precious looks on their bewildered faces!|
2995|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|And just who the hell are you? Are you in league with the pirates?|
2996|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|I am Sirius, a mere traveler.|
2997|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|Oh, I see. I'm a little bit worked up right now. Sorry about the mix-up.|
2998|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|Those children...|
2999|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|I'm taking care of them. Do you know them?|
3000|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|No, I don't... But I do know that, as things stand, you won't escape with them. As I understand it, the Altean army should arrive here, provided you reach the southern village. Please, allow me to distract the bandits, while you make your escape to safety.|
3001|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|I see. So Prince Marth is here, eh? Got it, thanks. I've got to ask though. Why help a group of complete strangers like us?|
3002|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|I want to save the children. That is... all.|
3003|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Ogma|I see... Sirius... You said your name was Sirius, right? Let's meet again after we both get out of here! There's someone I need to take care of... The guy in charge of Grust's occupation, Commander Lang. I want to avenge a man named Lorenz... You--join me...! If I've got you on my side, then I'll be that much stronger.|
3004|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|Yes... That would be interesting. But first, you have to survive. Hurry and go!|
3005|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|Touch me and I'll strike you down.|
3006|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Sirius|How foolish of me...|
3007|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Guile|I'm sorry! ...I wasn't thinking! Gahaha, just kidding! I'll be smashing your pretty head in!!|
3008|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Guile|I won't... forget this!|
3009|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Caeda|Marth!!|
3010|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Caeda? Did something happen? Why are you here?|
3011|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Caeda|Marth... Altea... Altea was attacked by the imperial army. The Archanean League... Gra and Aurelis ambushed us. Our forces were annihilated and we lost the castle...|
3012|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Wh-what did you say?! This can't be happening! Altea is...|
3013|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Kris|Damn! Our homeland has fallen to the enemy...|
3014|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|This is terrible beyond words... That which I feared the most has come to pass. Emperor Hardin likely heard Lang's story, and had us branded traitors.|
3015|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|I refuse to believe it. Hardin would never attack Altea! You're telling me that he believed Lang and truly thought that I wished to instigate a rebellion? Never!|
3016|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|No, I agree with you, sire. This attack was too soon. It happened far too quickly. For an attack of this scale, a great number of preparations had to have been in place. It is likely... that the Grust campaign was a setup. As was the situation in Macedon. It's quite simple, really. They had you leave Altea, with your elite knights in tow, and then proceeded to attack our weakened defenses. Hardin had this planned right from the start.|
3017|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|That's preposterous! Are you implying that Hardin--with no provocation whatsoever--decided to attack his fellow nation? Are you seriously suggesting this was all an elaborate trap? No! I won't accept it... Hardin... why?|
3018|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|Sire... Princess Caeda, what of the others? Is Princess Elice safe?|
3019|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Caeda|Elice, she... She gave herself up in order to let me escape with this message. Marth... I'm so sorry. She wanted me to warn you, no matter what... Sniff...|
3020|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Marth|Caeda... Don't cry. I understand. Just knowing you're safe makes me happy. I should be the one apologizing. I shouldn't have left... You needn't have to go through this. We will take back Altea. Even if we have to fight Hardin, we WILL reclaim our homeland!|
3021|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|Oh, by the way, Kris. About that hairstyle of yours... Have you decided to keep it that way?|
3022|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Kris|...Do you think it looks funny? Well, it'll grow back eventually, if I leave it alone... Do you think I should return it to normal?|
3023|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|Well, it's your decision to make. You should do as you please. So what will it be? Are you going to go back to the hairstyle you had before?|
3024|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Kris|Yeah. I'll have to apologize to Father Wrys later, but I think I'll change it back to normal.|
3025|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|Yes. I do believe that would be a good idea.|
3026|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Kris|No, it's alright. I'm quite fond of my new hair... Or lack of it, rather.|
3027|FE12BookTwo|04-JoyAndSorrow|Jagen|I-is that so? Well, if that's your wish, then I can hardly complain.|
3028|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Hah! Hyah!|
3029|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|I see you train without the need for sleep. Most admirable, Kris.|
3030|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Ah, Sir Jagen.|
3031|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|A strong offense and a tough defense are obviously important, but... You cannot afford to neglect your skill. Without the skill to deliver it, it matters not how mighty your attack is if it does not reach the enemy. Speaking of which...|
3032|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Your skill is like that of an expert... I have nothing to add. Keep up the good work.|
3033|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Thank you, Sir Jagen.|
3034|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Your skill is not bad. Don't fall behind the other knights. The experience you gain from training and combat, will help elevate your skill further. Be ever diligent.|
3035|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Yes, Sir Jagen.|
3036|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Your skill is still insufficient... It ought to be better than this. You may or may not have the talent for it, but don't give up... The more experience you gain from training and combat, the more you can refine your skill. Be ever diligent.|
3037|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Y-yes, Sir Jagen.|
3038|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Palla|Julian, good news! Catria finally brought the Altean army for us! We're going to join their ranks to help save Princess Minerva. Please take Lena and escape to safety, quickly!|
3039|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|No can do, Palla. Lena's disappeared... I'm not leaving by myself.|
3040|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Palla|What? Lena as well... Princess Maria is missing too; why is it only clerics...?|
3041|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Anyway, I'm staying in the village to see if I can't find any information. Sorry, Palla. Give my best to Prince Marth.|
3042|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|This is just between you and me, but I heard that armory is in league with the rebels. If you're going to enter you should be careful not to get jumped.|
3043|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|I wonder what's going to happen to Macedon? They say that Prince Michalis is dead, and Princess Maria is nowhere to be found... On top of that, they say that Princess Minerva has been captured and that her life is in peril. I just hope... that this country doesn't end up like Grust...|
3044|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|You know, a little while ago, a paladin came here; said he was on a journey. He was wearing a mask, but I'm sure that underneath, he was a good person. He was kind, yet wrapped in a veil of sorrow. I wonder if I'll ever see him again...|
3045|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|The pegasus knight trio must be lonely without Est. And I was such a fan of their "Triangle Attack!" too... Oh, Est... Come home already, will ya?|
3046|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Villager|Have you noticed the large drawbridge behind this village? Normally it's separated by the river, but if you use this key here, you can cross the bridge. Just, once you cross the drawbridge, the enemies on the other side will come and attack you at once. If you want to advance safely, you might be better off taking the long detour that goes right around the mountain. Here, take the key. No matter which path you take, do take care of yourself, m'kay?|
3047|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|You, you're Bord! You've come to Macedon as well?|
3048|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Bord|Long time no see, Prince. Cord already joined with you's guys, right? We Talysian mercenaries wanted to join you's army, so we came all the way here. Princess Caeda's our lady, and the guy who's gonna be her man is important to us too. Prince Marth, I'll protect you with my life.|
3049|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Hey, Prince, it's been a while, hasn't it? It's me, Julian!|
3050|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Julian? I'd heard that you'd gone to Macedon with Lena, but to think we'd cross paths here... How is Lena? Of course, she's with you, right?|
3051|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Well, er, how should I say this... Lena suddenly up and vanished... I... I don't know what to do.|
3052|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Wait, Julian, tell me what happened, in detail.|
3053|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Lena's been missing since last night. The villagers speak of some sort of strange priest prowling around lately. It seems that somehow, Lena was taken by this man.|
3054|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|A priest...? Julian, as it turns out, Princess Maria has gone missing as well. I have a terrible feeling about this. Anyway, staying here won't solve anything. Come with us. I'm worried for Lena, too. We'll all help to look for her.|
3055|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Prince Marth... Thank you. Nothing would please me more.|
3056|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Michalis|Rucke, I'm impressed a spineless coward like you could throw this country into so much chaos. I'll hazard a guess that Hardin talked you into this?|
3057|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Rucke|Wha-! ...Y-you're... B-but how...|
3058|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Michalis|Thought I was dead? Haha... My death was but a trifle. Hand Minerva over to me, Rucke. I no longer have plans for this country. Do with it as you please. However, I won't rest until I've disposed of "him" with my own hands.|
3059|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Rucke|U-uhh... but, Princess Minerva is barely breathing... Nobody could save her now...|
3060|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Michalis|Do you want me to shove this spear down your throat? I said bring her to me.|
3061|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Rucke|Y-yes, of course. S-somebody, bring the princess here!|
3062|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Michalis|It's been a while, Minerva. That ungainly appearance doesn't suit you. Losing Maria; your subordinates abandoning you... Is this the ideal country you dreamed of?|
3063|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Minerva|Mi... Michalis... How...?|
3064|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Hey! Cut it out. Why must you always insist on pointing your sword at us? I pity Lena for having to put up with your stupidity.|
3065|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Oh, it's you, Julian. Are you still trying to worm your way into Lena's good books? No way, I won't hand my cute lil' sister to a thieving rat like you.|
3066|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|You can relax... Lena and I would never work out. But even if it's just a little, I wanted to help her in any way I could.|
3067|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Ooh, you finally realized where you stand. Attaboy, Julian!|
3068|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Julian|Er, that's not the kind of thing I want to be hearing from you... Well, whatever. If you're worried about Lena, then come with me.|
3069|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Oh, alright, thanks. You see, they forced me to join the rebel army, but you know I hate fighting. Alright, lil' brother. Let's join forces and look for our cute lil' Lena!|
3070|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Lena... Where are you? What I would give to hear your voice just once before I die...|
3071|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Matthis|Lena... F-forgive... your foolish big brother...|
3072|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Rucke|D-damn it... Why is the Altean army here...? You're all going down with me. Die!|
3073|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Rucke|The Altean knights... As I expected...|
3074|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Sire, the rebels have fled the castle, but I regret to inform you that Princess Minerva was nowhere to be found.|
3075|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|What could have happened? She was supposed to be held inside the castle...|
3076|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|Oh-hoh, I knew this task was unworthy. Excellent work, Prince Marth. We'll take care of Macedon from here. Now, let us discuss your next mission.|
3077|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|General Lang, what in the world do you want this time?|
3078|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|Well, you see... My castle was attacked and the Grustian prince and princess were kidnapped. The perpatrator fled to Macedon, it seems. Prince Marth, you are to capture him and return the children to me!|
3079|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|You're asking me to send those children to their doom!|
3080|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|You're in no position to defy me. Now, off to work you go, my prince.|
3081|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|You...! Your rudeness towards my liege has gone too far...! Shut up! Prince Marth is not your minion!|
3082|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|What did you say?! Know your place, Altean soldier! Marth, it seems that your countrymen are devoid of manners!|
3083|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|...I apologize on his/her behalf. But it is as Kris says: General Lang, I will no longer follow your orders from here.|
3084|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Sire...!|
3085|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|What! Do you mean to defy my orders?! I see... I see. As I suspected, it was YOUR doing. The person who kidnapped Grust's prince and princess was the mercenary, Ogma. On your orders, no less!|
3086|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|I didn't know of this. But if I had the choice, I would have done exactly as you suggested. Back at Grust, even though they were meant to be our enemies, I should have helped those children.|
3087|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|You! You clearly speak words of treason! Perhaps I should report this to the Emperor!|
3088|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Do as you will. But you're not the only person who intends to visit the palace. I will speak to Emperor Hardin and Princess Nyna and inform them of your crimes. Forgive me, Jagen. But I cannot stand for this any longer.|
3089|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|I understand. You have endured well until now. Lang, my liege might forgive your frequent rudeness to him, but I will not. Come, draw your sword. Even though I, Jagen, am old and senile, I will not lose to the likes of you.|
3090|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Lang|Wh... what did you say?! Damn you... I'll remember this!! Once the Emperor gets wind of this, I'll crush your puny little Altea!|
3091|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Jagen... you're a bag of surprises. To think you'd stand up against Lang like that.|
3092|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Sire, are you underestimating me in my old age? Bwahaha... I'm not about to let youngsters like Kris hog all the glory just yet. Still, I'll admit it was somewhat foolish to contest with Lang, even if he did push my lord at every turn.|
3093|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Sire, Sir Jagen. What is our next plan of action?|
3094|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|According to Lang, Ogma is on his way to Macedon. He probably intends to visit the village where Lord Wendell resides.|
3095|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Lord Wendell?|
3096|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|Lord Wendell is a pontifex of Khadein; he fought as our ally in the last war. I hear he's living in Macedon now. It also happens that the children that Ogma saved were raised by Lord Wendell So I'm sure it would be the perfect time to pay him a visit.|
3097|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Yes, understood.|
3098|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|But, I worry about Lang... I pray that nothing bad shall happen...|
3099|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Kris, are you aware that we've been searching for the assassins who besieged Altea a year ago...?|
3100|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Kris|Ah! I assume, since you're mentioning it, that you've found a new lead?|
3101|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|We're not certain, but we've received information that might lead us to them. A few days ago, I heard of a suspicious group heading towards Macedon's northern mountains.|
3102|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|The northern mountains? What could they be after up there?|
3103|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Rumors say they are pursuing our former allies in the War of Shadows... And I don't believe they're after a friendly chat with them either.|
3104|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Marth|I see. Then we cannot ignore this lead, especially if lives are at stake. Jagen, Kris, we shall pursue the enemy.|
3105|FE12BookTwo|03-TheAbductedPrincess|Jagen|Agreed. Let us prepare to march, with haste.|
3106|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|...... That's, uh, certainly one heck of a hat... A gift from Ymir, I presume?|
3107|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Kris|Yes. It keeps me warm. Although I'm worried that it'll stand out...|
3108|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|I should be, if I were you. If you stepped out on the battlefield wearing that, you'd be a popular target...|
3109|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Gotoh|Prince Marth, in this altar lurks many savage barbarians and mage dragons long gone mad. They have fallen under Gharnef's spell and will attack you given the chance. Gharnef's servants-- the heretic priests possess great power. They are not to be taken lightly. If you let this battle drag on, it may become fiercer than you can handle. Do not stop. Make for the end at once! Once you defeat Gharnef, retrieve the Falchion that he stole from your Altea. As you well know, without the Falchion, defeating Medeus will be nigh impossible...|
3110|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|I understand, Lord Gotoh. My friends and I shall sally forth to the deepest depths of the altar!|
3111|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Gotoh|It would be wise to bring this ally with you. She has deigned to lend you her strength.|
3112|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Nagi|......|
3113|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|You're...|
3114|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Kris|Another ally from the previous war, sire?|
3115|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|No, I don't believe we've ever met. But, why...? I have the strangest feeling that I know her...|
3116|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Nagi|My name... is Nagi. I will... stop the enemy... You must hurry to the throne room... Go... This time... everything... must end......|
3117|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Kris|Sire! Look, stairs! They probably lead further in. We must hurry, sire!|
3118|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|Right, Kris! ...By the way, do you intend to wear that hat from here on out?|
3119|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Kris|Actually, I'm not entirely sure. It's very warm, as Sir Ymir said, but I stick out like a sore thumb...|
3120|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|Indeed, the enemies looked surprised. Well, what is your decision? Are you going to take it off?|
3121|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Kris|Yes, I think I will remove it for this battle.|
3122|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|Excellent choice. Well, let's hurry!|
3123|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Kris|No, I rather like it. It's so toasty.|
3124|FE12BookTwo|22-TheDragon'sAltar|Marth|I-I see. Well then, let's go!|
3125|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|As expected, the Archanean army is extremely powerful. We must approach with great caution.|
3126|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Kris|It seems that Hardin has assembled his entire army for the battle.|
3127|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Jagen|Even so, the people have lost their faith in Emperor Hardin. They welcome us as liberators. It is certainly very reassuring. This is our final battle. It may drag on but all the same, I would ask that you take utmost care.|
3128|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Kris, the enemy is the Archanean imperial army. The continent's strongest and most renowned military force. It's strange, but I'm not afraid. Kris, if you're here, then everything will be okay. Everyone, let's go!|
3129|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|As expected, the Archanean army is extremely powerful. We must approach with great caution.|
3130|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Kris|It seems that Hardin has assembled his entire army for the battle.|
3131|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Jagen|Even so, the people have lost their faith in Emperor Hardin. They welcome us as liberators. It is certainly very reassuring. This is our final battle. It may drag on but all the same, I would ask that you take utmost care.|
3132|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Kris, the enemy is the Archanean imperial army. The continent's strongest and most renowned military force. I'm not worried though... I know how strong you are, Kris. You won't lose to anyone.|
3133|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Kris|Yes, sire! Please leave it to me!|
3134|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Everyone, let's go!|
3135|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|I knew it. You intend to invade Coyote's palace. The king forbade us from interfering... But I will do anything to protect Coyote! I'll defy his edict if I have to!|
3136|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Roshea|Prince Marth... It is I, Roshea of the Wolfguard. I received King Aurelis's pardon and have been waiting for you. I am truly sorry for the battle of the pass. I realize that an apology means little, so I will now fight under your banner. But... the other Wolfguard members have all sided with the Archanean army. I wonder if I could persuade them. Vyland, at the least... Vyland might listen to what I have to say.|
3137|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Woman|Emperor Hardin was once a kind man, but he suddenly changed into such a frightening Emperor... Ah... If I say things like this, I will get killed as well.|
3138|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Young Man|Midia is the pride of Archanea. She was the daughter of th highest officer of Archanea, Duke Owen. This rebellion only came about because she could not stand and watch us suffer. No matter what, you must rescue her.|
3139|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Young Woman|We thought that Nyna and Hardin's marriage would finally bring peace to the world, yet this happened. Oh deities... What should we do...?|
3140|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Old Man|Midia is really pitiful. She only just retired as a knight to live together with Astram, and now she has been separated again. She's still a young girl, it's so sad. What can you do to help her...?|
3141|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Man|The Archanea army has changed. The troops are all bloodthirsty savages now. What is going on with this country?|
3142|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Old Man|Oh, this is so sad. Those that opposed Emperor Hardin have all been killed... Could the Emperor be possessed by a demon...?|
3143|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Roshea|Vyland! Why are you here? The king told us not to interfere. Aha! Have you decided to join the Altean army like me?|
3144|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|Roshea, I came to bring you back. Why have you turned to the Alteans? We are Coyote's subordinates. Open your eyes! You're being deceived!|
3145|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Roshea|You're wrong, Vyland. The time I spent with the Alteans was short, but I know one thing for sure. It's not as Coyote says. They're not evil people.|
3146|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|Roshea...|
3147|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Roshea|Vyland, please. I don't want to fight all of you. Especially you, Vyland...|
3148|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|............ Well, Roshea... You were always the kindest out of us in the Wolfguard.. You've always been able to tell which were the good guys, and which were the bad. I can't fight you, Roshea. If you, our brother-in-arms, are this sure, then I believe you. I am your ally from now on.|
3149|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Roshea|Vyland...!|
3150|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|Sedgar, hold on. It's me, Vyland.|
3151|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|What's the meaning of this, Vyland? Don't tell me you've defected!?|
3152|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|Listen, Sedgar. I--I don't know. What am I supposed to do? I loved Coyote like a brother. All I wanted was to fight for him. But... But he has changed for the worse. It's as though he's someone else now...|
3153|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|......|
3154|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|I wanted to serve him, always. That's why I've been turning a blind eye. I shut myself, trying to remember the Coyote who loved us so long ago. It really hurt to face the truth. That Coyote's not who he used to be... I just don't know anymore. Hey, Sedgar... What the hell am I supposed to do?|
3155|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|Vyland... I too... I feel the same way. I know he's gone insane, but I looked the other way and blocked my senses. One day, he'll go back to being our Coyote... That's what I kept telling myself.|
3156|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Vyland|Roshea has gone over to the Alteans. I cannot fight him. Sedgar, you should come too. I don't know what's right anymore. But I don't want to fight you, either.|
3157|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|Yes... Even though Coyote's madness was clear to me, I did nothing. I have to make this right.|
3158|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|Wolf! Hold your fire!|
3159|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Wolf|Sedgar! What are you doing?! So you've chosen to betray Coyote?!|
3160|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|No, it's not like that! This is for Coyote's own good! Something's wrong with Coyote. Even you must know that!|
3161|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Wolf|That changes nothing! I will die at Coyote's side! I swore as much! Though all of you might betray us. Though I might be alone. I will not abandon him!|
3162|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|Even though you disobey his heart?|
3163|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Wolf|What do you mean!?|
3164|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|Wolf, do you remember what Coyote said to you, the day you became commander of the Wolfguard?|
3165|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Wolf|......!|
3166|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|"If I should wander from the path of the righteous, please... lead me back onto it." That's what he said.|
3167|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Wolf|I should never have forgotten. The words of Coyote himself... But, to tell me that time has come... That we must... That we must defeat Coyote...|
3168|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Sedgar|We have to remind Coyote of the day we swore allegiance to him. No matter how painful it may be... That is our only recourse. I never wanted to believe it would come to this...|
3169|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Wolf|Enough, Sedgar! For goodness sake... It would have been better had I died at Adria Pass... I am the commander of the Wolfguard... The life that Coyote gave me... I will not waste it. Even if that should lead to Coyote's death...|
3170|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Nehring|What...? Our Archanea has been defeated? But as long as I'm here, I won't let you enter the castle!|
3171|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Nehring|Glory to the Emperor...|
3172|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Oh, Lord Marth. I've been waiting for you.|
3173|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Boah!? You've suffered a grave wound... What happened?|
3174|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Mmm... It was truly frightening... I suppose the Archanea royal family is indeed under a curse. You should know about Hardin and Nyna's marriage, two years ago. To restore Archanea, a king was required, and only two people were suitable. King Aurelis's younger brother, Hardin, and Altea's Prince Marth, you... Those were the choices, and we pleaded for Nyna to make the final decision. Originally, she wanted to wait a while longer, but we begged for her to make up her mind immediately. In the end she said that choosing Prince Marth as her husband would hurt Princess Caeda, so she finally decided on Hardin.|
3175|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Wait a second, wasn't that a little harsh on Nyna? I understand that Archanea needed a king, but Nyna, she already...|
3176|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|You are referring to Grust's Lord Camus? But that would be unspeakable... Unthinkable in fact. Princess Nyna was the sole successor of the royal bloodline of Archanea. I felt bad as well, but for this country we had no other choice. However, Lord Hardin was very happy. Compared to ascending Archanea's throne, he seemed happier about the fact that Nyna chose him for her husband.|
3177|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|I also understand Hardin's feelings. He could sacrifice his own life for Nyna. But, did he know about Camus? If he did, I don't believe he would be so happy.|
3178|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Mmm... Of course we kept that a secret, and we also persuaded Nyna to hide it as best as she could. But, Lord Hardin was a very sensitive man. He quickly found out that Nyna's heart had no place for him. He felt very painful... He locked himself in his room, and didn't allow anybody to see him. Taking advantage of his broken heart, Gharnef appeared. He took on the guise of a merchant to approach Hardin, and showed him the Darksphere. The distraught Hardin was quickly consumed by the orb. From that day on, he completely changed. It was because I was only focused on restoring this country that I committed such a horrendous mistake. Please, forgive me, Prince Marth...|
3179|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|I can't believe all that happened. ..... Where is Nyna now?|
3180|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|When Hardin discovered that she had taken the Fire Emblem, he had her confined in her room. After that, she would still communicate in secret with me. However, Hardin found out and then wounded me. He also handed Nyna over to Gharnef.|
3181|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Marth|Gharnef...!?|
3182|FE12BookTwo|19-TheFinalBattle|Boah|Mmm... Gharnef had always wanted to take Nyna. He said that the resurrection of the dark dragon required the blood of noble clerics... And so... He took Nyna... To use her as a live sacrifice... Lord Marth, I'm already done for. I will give my Thoron and Physic to you. I beg of you, please rescue Nyna. Even if Archanea is destroyed it no longer matters... I only wish for Nyna to be safe...|
3183|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Huh...? W-who's there?|
3184|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Sire, it's me, Kris.|
3185|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Oh, it's just you.... You had me startled for a moment. Especially with that mask on you...|
3186|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Is it that strange?|
3187|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Well... perhaps a little. Do you mean to fight like that?|
3188|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Yes.|
3189|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|I-I see.|
3190|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Jagen, where in the world are we...?|
3191|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jagen|This is the path depicted in the Anri Saga. The first obstacle in Anri's Way: the Desert of Death. With its scorching sun, raging sandstorm, savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns that soar and dominate the skies. As the city of illusion shimmers in the distance, we can only stand and gaze... Or so the legend has it.|
3192|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|So Anri came through here as well. And by himself, too...|
3193|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jagen|That's right. Your ancestor and Altea's founder, King Anri... To save Princess Artemis, he set out on a journey to seek the Divine Blade Falchion.|
3194|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|King Anri was strong. I wouldn't be able to cross through here alone. I'm truly grateful to those who offered to accompany me through this desert.|
3195|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|I think everybody wishes to follow you, sire. Everyone wants to be with you. Wherever you go, they will follow. That's what I believe. It's because of your kindness, sire.|
3196|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Thank you. I don't have Anri's power. But I have all of you. Wonderful companions like you, Kris. That's how I can keep going. Let's go, Kris.|
3197|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Understood.|
3198|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Caeda|Jake! What are you doing all the way out here...?|
3199|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jake|Is that you, Caeda? Hey, long time no see. I'm here to meet my beloved Anna.|
3200|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Caeda|Huh? Anna lives in a place like this?|
3201|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jake|Oh, you didn't know? Anna's running a secret shop out here. It's a tiny bit troublesome coming here, but y'know, love conquers all barriers! Your turn Caeda. What're you doing in the desert?|
3202|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Ceada|Listen, Jake. We're fighting for the peace of the continent again. Could you help us, like old times...?|
3203|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jake|I dunno, I kinda lost my ballista, so I doubt I'd be much use to you.|
3204|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Caeda|That's not true. You'd help us a lot just by being there...|
3205|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jake|Aw, shucks. How could I say no when you say it like that? I bet Anna's worried about the war too. Alrighty, I'll join you then.|
3206|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jake|What?! M-more bandits?|
3207|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Jake|Anna... I'm... sorry...|
3208|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Tiki|Mar-Mar!! It's been aaages. It's me, Tiki! I've wanted to see you for so long.|
3209|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Huh... Tiki?! You came to welcome us? Oh, I see... you've been living with Lord Gotoh, haven't you?|
3210|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Sire, do you know this little girl?|
3211|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Yes. This is Tiki, a companion of ours during the war. Tiki was a great boon to our cause. She mowed down legions of enemy dragons with her tremendous power.|
3212|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|What?! This little girl did that...?|
3213|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|But you've certainly grown since last time. I'm glad to see you're well.|
3214|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Tiki|Yeah... But I was so lonely. 'Cause you never came to see me...|
3215|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|I'm sorry. But I could never forget about you. I had intended to invite you back to Altea once things had calmed down.|
3216|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Tiki|Mar-Mar... I... I love you!|
3217|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|What......?!|
3218|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Xane|...Gotcha!|
3219|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Xa... Xane!!!|
3220|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|What the...?! T-the little girl is now a man!|
3221|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Xane|Oopsy daisy. Took you by surprise, didn't I? Particularly you over there, newbie. I'm Xane. A friend of Marth's. Transformin' into other people's a special ability of mine. Hey princey, my Tiki impression was pretty darn tootin', wasn't it? Did I provide some comic relief? Well, shall we get goin'? You wanted to see Lord Gotoh, right?|
3222|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Xane, how do you know Lord Gotoh? Just who are you?|
3223|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Xane|Well, lemme see. I don't think that really matters right now. Hey, put that jaw back in place and follow me.|
3224|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Kris, I noticed you fighting with that mask on.|
3225|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Yes. The desert sun was strong, but it acted as a shield. Nevertheless, I suppose there's little point in wearing it now.|
3226|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|I see. Are you going to remove it then?|
3227|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Yes. I think I shall.|
3228|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|Yes, that's probably a good idea.|
3229|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|No. I'll keep fighting with it on.|
3230|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|I-is that so...? Does it not bother you in any way?|
3231|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Kris|Not at all. I can fight just fine with it on.|
3232|FE12BookTwo|11-Anri'sWay|Marth|I-I see. Well, if that's what you've decided then I have no problems with it.|
3233|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Jagen|Sire, Lord Horace should be inside this fort.|
3234|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|It seems the enemy has already infiltrated the building. Please be careful, sire.|
3235|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Marth|All right. Let us fight with caution.|
3236|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Legion|Uwee hee hee... Horaces, was it? Youses a stubborn ones... Yous already killed three of our brotherses. But there are mores of us... moreses, moreses, moreses! How longs can you last? Uwee hee!|
3237|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Horace|Who the hell are you? Who gave you the orders to attack me?|
3238|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Legion|Uwee hee hee. Who knowses? We sure don't. But really, poor yous! You'll be killed by us, and won't even knows why!|
3239|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Horace|My life isn't my own. Ever since I became a knight, my life is for my liege and my people. I cannot be defeated by cowards like you.|
3240|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Legion|Uwee hee hee! Bring it on!! We are Legion. There are manys of us and ones of us, all in oneses. Want to knows how to defeats us, hmm? Simple. Just kills the real Legion. But can you findses the real Legion?! Uwee hee hee!!!|
3241|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Horace|You are Kris, Prince Marth's Royal Guard, correct? 'Tis an honor to meet you. I am Horace, an Archanean knight in the service of Princess Nyna. Prince Marth saved me in the previous war. For Princess Nyna's sake, please allow me the privilege of fighting alongside you.|
3242|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Legion|Uwee hee hee! You can kills us and kills us again. But there are mores of our brotherses... moreses, moreses, moreses of us! As longs as the real Legion is still standing, there'll be no end to the Legion... Uwee hee!!!|
3243|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Legion|Uwee hee hee!!! Are we real or are we false? Try us and see!!!|
3244|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Legion|Uwee hee... hee... how did you... know...?|
3245|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|Sire, the remaining enemies have fled. Victory is ours.|
3246|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Marth|Good work. But either way, that was a strange enemy. Were they even human...?|
3247|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Jagen|I've heard rumors about them. Those wicked assassins crushed their souls when they were young, and raised them as living puppets who follow orders without question...|
3248|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Marth|How pitiful... Kris. I wonder if Katarina was raised under such circumstances, as well...|
3249|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|...|
3250|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Marth|However, we can't do anything about that now. Let us go ahead. To Anri's Way, where Lord Gotoh awaits.|
3251|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|Sir Jagen, I've found something most odd inside the castle. It's this mask. It seems like a different type from the one those assassins wore, but what's it for...?|
3252|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Jagen|Heh... This is a mask for use in a masquerade ball, I believe.|
3253|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|Masquerade ball?|
3254|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Jagen|Yes. Noblemen once donned these masks in order to conceal their identities. They were probably used in this old castle a long time ago. So, it's unrelated to the assassins.|
3255|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|I see... But, it sure is a strange mask.|
3256|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Jagen|What of it? Don't tell me you intend to wear it?|
3257|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|Yes. For some reason, I feel like giving it a try.|
3258|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Jagen|You are an odd one. Well, do as you wish.|
3259|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Kris|No, I'll leave it where I found it.|
3260|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Jagen|Yes, good idea.|
3261|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|Lady Eremiya... I have a report. Legion, he...|
3262|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Eremiya|I see, so he failed. Even though I took such good care of him... Such a troublesome child.|
3263|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|Lady Eremiya, the Altean army is strong. Now that Legion has been defeated... Perhaps we should refrain from pursuing them.|
3264|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Eremiya|No. Crushing Altea was an order of his.|
3265|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|But...|
3266|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Clarisse|What? Reese, don't tell me you're afraid?|
3267|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|Clarisse...|
3268|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Clarisse|Lady Eremiya, please allow me the honor. I'll take care of them.|
3269|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Eremiya|My, you're a good girl, Clarisse. Would you?|
3270|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Clarisse|Anything for you, Lady Eremiya.|
3271|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|... Lady Eremiya, about the remaining Legion brothers...|
3272|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Eremiya|Ah, those. Get rid of all of them.|
3273|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|Lady Eremiya...!|
3274|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Eremiya|They can't fight now that they've lost Legion, can they? So, they're useless now. Broken junk is to be discarded.|
3275|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|B-but, Lady Eremiya... They were with us in the orphanage... with you too, Lady Eremiya...|
3276|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Eremiya|So what?|
3277|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|...|
3278|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Clarisse|Reese, you sure are useless, aren't you? Don't worry, Lady Eremiya. I'll get rid of them.|
3279|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Eremiya|My, Clarisse is such a good little girl. Completely different from a certain failure.|
3280|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Clarisse|Ah, Lady Eremiya... Your praise makes me happy.|
3281|FE12BookTwo|10x-TheMaskLaughs|Katarina|...|
3282|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Jagen|Sire! We've been ambushed by the enemy! Enemy troops are waiting for us ahead.|
3283|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Alright. Jagen, Kris, make preparation for battle.|
3284|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Yes, immediately.|
3285|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Yes, at once.|
3286|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|We did it, Caesar! Our ambush was a success. They're completely surrounded. Tactical victory is ours.|
3287|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|I see. However, don't lower your guard. Our enemy is the Altean army... We know how strong they are.|
3288|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|But Caesar, are you really fine with this? We did fight under Altea's banner in the previous war...|
3289|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|We're mercenaries. We have no liege. I need gold, and will do anything for it. Even selling my soul to the devil.|
3290|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|Gold, huh... Indeed, when we get the reward from Emperor Hardin... I'm sure we could save her. Alright, let's do it, Caesar!|
3291|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|Radd, there's no need for you to follow me. My sister is my business. The Altean army is strong. You'll die if you're careless.|
3292|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|I'm doing this for my own interests too. So I'll tag along with you, Caesar. As I always have, and always will.|
3293|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|Very well. Then, let's go!|
3294|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Clarisse|Legion, you're ready, I presume?|
3295|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Legion|Yes, yes, yesss! It's finally time for us allses! Uwee hee hee!!! Togethers with those mercenaries, we'll gives Marth a royal funeral!|
3296|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Clarisse|It seems some of those mercenaries were Marth's allies in the previous war. I do wonder if they'll be of any use.|
3297|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Legion|So whats? Doesn't matters. If they're uselesses, all we have to do is kills him ourselves.|
3298|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Clarisse|Bah, I don't like you getting the best part. Oh well, do whatever you want.|
3299|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|The time for words is gone. Fighting is all we can do, now.|
3300|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|Can't I... even save... one little sister...?|
3301|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|I am Radd, deputy commander of this mercenary band. Here I come...|
3302|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|Caesar... Please... stay alive...|
3303|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Legion|Uwee hee hee! Come on! Come on! Come on! Timeses to fight!!!|
3304|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Legion|We won't dies... even if you kill mes... Uwee...hee...|
3305|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|You win, Prince Marth. I should have known you weren't a foe we could defeat with petty tricks. I surrender. Kill me or whatever; I'm all yours.|
3306|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Caesar, I'd like to hire you and Radd if possible. I want you to come with us. You and Radd fought by my side in the previous war. You're both my comrades.|
3307|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|Prince, forgive me, but we're mercenaries. All we did in the previous war was fulfill our duties as hired swords.|
3308|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|It might have been just a job for you two... But not to me. Both of you are my precious comrades. You were then, and still are now.|
3309|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|Prince... I appreciate your willingness to say such kind words to mercenaries like us. However, at the end of the day, we're hired swords. Therefore, we ask for gold. Prince, Archanea occupies your country. It's obvious you don't have the extra resources needed to pay us.|
3310|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Well, you have a point...|
3311|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Gold shouldn't be an issue. Prince Marth will reclaim Altea, our homeland. Altea may be occupied by Archanea now, but we shall defeat them. And then, you'll have the gold you seek.|
3312|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|Do you... honestly think you stand a chance? Against a powerful kingdom like Archanea?|
3313|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Of course. Besides, I'm sure you don't have a choice, at this point. Since you've failed your mission, Archanea won't pay you the gold you seek anymore. If you're a hired sword working for gold, following Prince Marth would serve your interests better. Am I wrong?|
3314|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|...Indeed, your argument is sound. As we've failed, we have no other options. Prince Marth, Radd and I are now your hired swords. We shall accompany you for as long as you wish us to.|
3315|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Thank you, Caesar.|
3316|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|No... Caesar...|
3317|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Radd... You have my condolences. Radd, I'd like to hire you if possible. I want you to come with us. You and Caesar fought by our side in the previous war. You're both my comrades.|
3318|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|...Me, work for you? Sure thing, Prince Marth. But I hate you guys. I could just feign joining you, Prince, and then try and kill you, y'know?|
3319|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|I don't mind.|
3320|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|Eh...?|
3321|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Sire...!|
3322|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Radd, listen to me. Caesar is dead... We killed him. And that's why I ask this of you. I don't want this... I don't want comrades killing each other!|
3323|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|...Prince Marth...|
3324|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Radd. This is the first time we meet. I don't know your connection with Caesar. However, I know this. Caesar's death... pains Prince Marth as much as it pains you...|
3325|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|...|
3326|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Radd, Prince Marth will be even sadder if you die, too. We don't want to repeat that tragedy again. So, please...|
3327|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Radd|...Alright. Prince Marth, if you so wish, then I'll tag along with you. I'll accept the money once this war is over. For Caesar's sake, too, I must save that girl...|
3328|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Thank you, Radd.|
3329|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|We lose, Prince Marth. I should have known you weren't a foe we could defeat with petty tricks. Kill me. Send me to where Radd is waiting.|
3330|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Caesar, I'd like to hire you, if possible. I want you to come with us. You and Radd fought by my side in the previous war. You're both my comrades.|
3331|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|Prince, forgive me, but we're mercenaries. All we did in the previous war was fulfill our duties as hired swords. Besides, do you think I'd just agree? Now that Radd's been killed...|
3332|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|That's right, Radd is dead... We killed him. But that's exactly why I'm asking this of you. I don't want this... I don't want comrades killing each other anymore!|
3333|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|...Prince Marth...|
3334|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Mercenary commander Caesar. This is the first time we meet. I don't know your connection with Radd. However, I know this. Radd's death... pains Prince Marth as much as it pains you...|
3335|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|...|
3336|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Caesar, Prince Marth will be even sadder if you die, too. We don't want to repeat that tragedy again. So, please...|
3337|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Caesar|...Very well. While I'm not fully convinced... This was something I brought upon myself. I have no right to blame others for it. Prince Marth, from now on I'm in your service. I shall accompany you for as long as you wish it.|
3338|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Thank you, Caesar.|
3339|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Kris|Sire, the battle is over.|
3340|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Kris, Caesar and Radd were... our comrades in the previous war. Jeorge too, to think we'd be fighting our former comrades like this...|
3341|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Jagen|Sire, you must be strong. Now that Archanea has become our enemy, we'll have to face this kind of situation many times over. But don't worry, sire. You will always have Kris and me--your loyal retainers--by your side.|
3342|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Marth|Thank you, Jagen, Kris. It's only because you're with me that I can walk forward. Let us go, to the Fane of Raman.|
3343|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Clarisse|Oh dear. Legion, it seems your clone died.|
3344|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Legion|Legion was no clone. Legion was our brotherses. We are allses brotherses.|
3345|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Clarisse|Ugh, whatever. So, are you the real Legion? Or just another clone?|
3346|FE12BookTwo|06x-MercenarySquad|Legion|Who knows? Legion doesn't knowses. Uwee hee hee! The Alteans are strong-strong. Next times, we'll bring ALL our brotherses. Real Legion and brotherses, together we'll kills Marth. Uwee hee!|
3347|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|By the way, Kris. I have something I'd like to ask you.|
3348|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Yes, Sir Jagen?|
3349|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|From your perspective, what kind of person am I?|
3350|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|What kind... of person?|
3351|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|I keep wondering about how I should have acted towards Lang... Our homeland Altea's position is important, but perhaps I brood far too much and offend people.|
3352|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|You worry about these things too, Sir Jagen? You needn't worry. Your concern for Prince Marth is more than evident. You're very strict, Sir Jagen, but also very kind.|
3353|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Is that so...? Ho ho, if you cheer me on enough, I may even age backwards!|
3354|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Sir Jagen, when you look at me, what kind of person do you see?|
3355|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Hmm, well... You're very capable as a Royal Guard...|
3356|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|And you have an aura that attracts people.|
3357|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|And you're wise, almost foresighted.|
3358|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|And I can feel a hidden genius somewhere.|
3359|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|And you have a kind heart.|
3360|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|And you have an indisputably strong heart.|
3361|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|That's the kind of person you are.|
3362|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|What an honor.|
3363|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Well, we'd best begin the war council. Let us go, Kris.|
3364|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Yes, Sir Jagen.|
3365|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Huff... huff... Please... help me... The thieves... They're going to...|
3366|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|...|
3367|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|No, it can't be! You're... one of them... as well? Oh, fine... Do your worst! If you're going to kill me, do it fast!!|
3368|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|Girl... Get behind me. The Altean army is marching towards the south of this forest. I'll take you to them.|
3369|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Huh? You're going to help me? You mean, you're not with the thieves?|
3370|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|Until just now, I was. But, I've changed my mind.|
3371|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Why...?|
3372|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|There's someone in the Altean army that I want to see. That's all.|
3373|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Hmmm... But really, it's 'cause I'm cute, right? At any rate, I'm glad. My name's Phina. I'm a dancer from Warren. People say that once they see my dancing, they feel instantly refreshed! I can show you, if you like. Oh, I should tell you my story: I got separated from my troupe, and wandered into this forest. And then, those horrible thieves came and tried to take me by force... But it's okay now. You seem kind of scary, but actually you're very kind. However, your appearance is... Your face isn't bad, but your dress sense is kind of lacking. And, ugh, what's with your hair? You know, nowadays...|
3374|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Navarre|Just stop talking! Anyway, don't stray too far. We'll cut our way to the west corner, and then escape through there. If you want to live, then shut up and come with me.|
3375|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Phina|Ah... Y-yes, sorry...|
3376|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|The ancient Fane of Raman is just a treasure trove to thieves. You can see 'em carrying the stolen treasure all over the place. I hope they get cursed or something...|
3377|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|The ones protecting the bridge are Astram's free company: powerful men who stop at nothing. As a wise man once said: "Let sleeping dogs lie", eh?|
3378|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|I wonder if you've seen that young lady's dance? Marvelous, isn't it? Makes a tired body feel healthy again in the blink of an eye!|
3379|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Villager|You must never go near that cave. I heard a rumor that in that cave dwells a terrible fire dragon.|
3380|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Soldier|Captain Astram, we've sighted the Altean army to the south! Shall we attack?|
3381|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Astram|Our mission is to hold the bridge. Leaving the bridge will not be permitted. Only attack if the enemy approaches.|
3382|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Soldier|Yes sir. But what about the troops in the fort? I hear they will march out soon.|
3383|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Astram|They were bought with coin by the Emperor. Let them do as they please. Either way, they won't win. WE will be the ones to stop the Altean army.|
3384|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Sire, please exercise caution! Reports indicate that a fire dragon has emerged from the cave to the west!|
3385|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Astram|Traitors! I'll show you the might of the Mercurius!|
3386|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Astram|Midia... My love...|
3387|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Dahl|Tryin' to take a cut from a thief's plunderin'... You people ain't even human!|
3388|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Dahl|Murderers... the lot of you...|
3389|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Sire, we've driven away the thieves, but the temple was completely ransacked; anything that wasn't nailed down is gone. I'm sure even Guardian Deity Naga would be furious. 'Tis truly the end of civilzation.|
3390|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Marth|Jagen, do you know the legend of Naga?|
3391|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Yes; only vaguely, however. Kris, do you know of it?|
3392|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|No, not really...|
3393|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Unknown among the youth, I see... Then, sire, allow me the honor.|
3394|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|It's said that a thousand years ago... when there was not one king in the lands, people lived in small villages. One day, terrible monsters descended and the humans were massacred, pushed to the brink of extinction. The few who survived prayed to the gods for salvation. The gods heard their prayers, and a gigantic warrior was sent down to earth. The warrior carried a gleaming blade of light in his right hand, and in his left hand, a shield embedded with five orbs. Then, after a fierce battle, he eradicated the monsters and returned to the heavens. He was our guardian deity, Naga, and this temple is dedicated to him. "He was the avatar of the gods: our guardian deity..."|
3395|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Marth|With the blade of light and the five orbs... That is the legend of Naga...|
3396|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Jagen|Well then, sire. We have to cross the Chiasmir Bridge soon. We must hurry; if the enemy takes it, getting across will be nigh impossible.|
3397|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Marth|Alright then, inform the whole army: We cross Chiasmir Bridge at once. We haven't a moment to waste!|
3398|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Yes sir!|
3399|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Lord Wendell, we're off to Chiasmir Bridge. I... A-achoo!|
3400|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Wendell|Oh dear, are you alright? Have you caught a cold?|
3401|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Perhaps. It's too early to tell.|
3402|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Wendell|Don't push yourself too hard, and remember to keep yourself warm. Oh I know, shall I lend you one of the hats that I'm wearing?|
3403|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Huh? Is that okay?|
3404|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Wendell|Yes, I have many of these hats, so there's no need to worry. Well then, would you like to try it on?|
3405|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|Yes, please, if it's not a bother.|
3406|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Wendell|No, no, don't be shy. Here you go. And do remember to watch your health.|
3407|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|You're a good person, Lord Wendell. I want to be more like you... Oh yeah, if I wear this hat for a while, I wonder if my hair will start to look like his? And then, maybe I'll be a bit more like Lord Wendell!|
3408|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Kris|No thank you, but I appreciate the gesture. I'll be just fine.|
3409|FE12BookTwo|07-TheScarletSwordsman|Wendell|I understand. But, do remember to watch your health.|
3410|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Jagen|Sire, we have detected an enemy presence in the mountains. It seems there is a battle ongoing.|
3411|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Marth|Alright. Jagen, Kris, let us hurry with our preparations!|
3412|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|So I'm surrounded... How sad, I guess this is the end of the road for me...|
3413|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|Alright, he's right where we want him. Now to savor his pain as we slowly draw the life from his tormented soul...|
3414|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Katarina|Clarisse... The Altean army has arrived.|
3415|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|Tsk! What a nuisance. Reese, I hate to admit it but you were right about this outcome. Alteans never abandon their comrades... You sure learned a lot about that trash from your time staying with them.|
3416|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Katarina|...|
3417|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|My job is to kill, one by one, everyone who sided with Marth in the previous war. Because if his allies live, they'll eventually join him, one after another. And that would be dangerous.|
3418|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Katarina|... Clarisse, are you really up for the task?|
3419|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|I don't need to get MY hands dirty, do I? My underlings can get the job done. We're hardly dealing with strong enemies.|
3420|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Katarina|You'll die if you underestimate Kris and the others, Clarisse. I served as Kris's tactician, but I wasn't much help as one; I didn't give them the advice a tactician should give. Even without me, Kris and the others are strong.|
3421|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|What? Have you become attached to the Alteans after your little frolic with them? Then, just sit there and watch. Watch hard and well as I kill your beloved companions. Oh yes, and please... don't get in my way, okay?|
3422|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|Alright, I'm leaving the rest to you. Others are coming to help you soon, so hurry and kill them already. If by some chance those rats aren't dead when I return... I'll make sure YOU'RE dead, got it?|
3423|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|Oh, my savior Kris. Thank you kindly for coming to my rescue. I cannot fight, but I can heal your wounded. Take me with you and you'll be very glad you did.|
3424|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|Wait... what? Where did you lot come from!?|
3425|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|Tsk! This is bad... To think I'd run from the likes of you... I'll remember this!|
3426|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|Sire, are you unhurt?|
3427|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Marth|Yes, I'm alright. Thank you, Kris.|
3428|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Jagen|We've repelled the assassins, but we cannot afford to linger here.|
3429|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Marth|I agree. I'm worried about Ogma. Let us hurry to Lord Wendell's place!|
3430|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|...Hmm. The Alteans are better than I expected. Oh well. We can always snuff them out later. I'll let them live for now.|
3431|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Katarina|I warned you. The Altean army is strong...|
3432|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Clarisse|Gosh, Reese. You can be annoying sometimes. Whose side are you supposed to be on? Don't tell me you're thinking of betraying Lady Eremiya?|
3433|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Katarina|...No. That thought could never cross my mind. We all live for Lady Eremiya. For her sake, I must defeat Kris... I know that well enough.|
3434|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|Greetings, Kris, my friend. It's been a while since we last had a decent conversation.|
3435|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|Yes. Ever since the knight training, eh, Father Wrys?|
3436|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|Indeed, and you've become even stronger than you were then... ...Oh, did your hair grow a little?|
3437|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|Really? Well, it is true I haven't had the time to take care of it since we left Altea...|
3438|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|You know, a haircut like mine is astonishingly easy to take care of.|
3439|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|I-I can imagine...|
3440|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|If you so wish, I could shave your head, so it's like mine.|
3441|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|Eh?|
3442|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|As I'm a monk, I'm quite used to shaving heads. It's quite alright. If you don't like it, you can just let your hair grow and have your previous haircut back. What do you say? Would you allow me to shave your head?|
3443|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|Yes, please.|
3444|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|Very well. Then, give me a moment to prepare. ...Are you really sure?|
3445|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|Y-yes...|
3446|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|Then, please sit down. Now, close your eyes...|
3447|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Kris|I-I think I'll pass.|
3448|FE12BookTwo|03x-ShadowsBehindTheScenes|Wrys|I see. It's a pity, but perhaps it's for the best. In any case, Kris, I'm counting on you from now on.|
3449|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Your highness, we've entered the castle! But don't forget that Hardin is being protected by the Darksphere. To fight him , you must have the Lightsphere!! Be sure to let the person fighting him carry it.|
3450|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Midia, even you betrayed me. Archanea's paladins have lost their touch.|
3451|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Midia|You fool!! Don't you see it? What you're doing isn't normal. Where did you take Nyna to? Bring her back to us now!!|
3452|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Nyna! That woman betrayed me. I just wanted to destroy Grust. And she had to go and give the Emblem to that boy... Those who betray me must die. Midia, you're no exception!!|
3453|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Midia|If you want to take my life, go ahead. But Hardin... Do you know how much suffering you've caused because of your stupid jealousy? Just open your eyes and see!|
3454|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Stupid jealousy...? Haha... You can say what you like. This world is corrupt and full of annoying people. Is this kind of world even worth anything? It would be far better for it to be destroyed. Midia, you shall watch here... As Prince Marth dies by hand!!|
3455|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Marth...? As a servant of the Empire, you dared to invade Millennium Court. I am disappointed in you. So Altea's Prince of Light is just a lowlife.|
3456|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Hardin! Your are being controlled by the Darksphere, and have lost your just heart!! Please, you must return to normal!|
3457|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Hahaha...! You are so naive, Marth. I attacked Altea solely because of my hatred of you. In the previous war, it was only because you were the descendant of Anri that Nyna gave the Emblem to you, and chose you to become the leader of the alliance. Prince of Light... What nonsense! If you hadn't received my support you would have died long ago, so don't act all big, Marth!! From that day on, I hated you. I kept silent for Nyna, but I knew I would have to deal with you eventually. This has nothing to do with the orb!|
3458|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Hardin... Is that true... Your hatred of me... I didn't know...|
3459|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Ha... That's why you're just a boy. Marth! Come to me, so I can use my Gradivus to pierce your heart!! In this tiny continent, I am the only hero that is needed!|
3460|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Rebels... Did you come here to get yourselves killed? I'll show you to fear my Gradivus!!|
3461|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|Marth... Your highness... I have finally awakened... From my deep dream... Your highness... I am deeply sorry... I fought with my inner demon. However I was too weak... I resisted with all my might... But I still lost... I hoped for your highness' hand to end my life... That way I could be saved... Your highness... Nyna... Please take care of Nyna... She... I hope you... can tell her... In the... end... I still... loved her... I hope... She can... forgive me...|
3462|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|So you've come, Marth!! I'll run you through, just as you wish!|
3463|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Hardin, that's enough!|
3464|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|I've no quarrel with you... Bring Marth to me!!|
3465|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Kris|Sir Hardin... To defeat you is my duty. Prepare yourself.|
3466|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Hardin|I've no quarrel with you... Bring Marth to me!!|
3467|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Kris|Dark Emperor Hardin... Look nowhere else, I am your opponent!|
3468|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Kris|Sire, the battle is over. We have won.|
3469|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Yes, and with this, finally...|
3470|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Sire! Look over there! Your sister and the others...|
3471|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Elice! And Princess Nyna...! Lena, Maria; you're all safe!|
3472|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|Marth, I'm so happy you made it... Ngh...!!|
3473|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Gharnef|You--you carry the Binding Shield...! Gah! My magic has been dispelled? Withdraw, my priests. At this rate, he will... Let us hurry the Shadow Dragon's return!|
3474|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Gharnef...!|
3475|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Kris|That man was the Dark Pontifex Gharnef! His servants were impersonating the princesses.|
3476|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|What was he playing at? He mentioned something about the Shadow Dragon's return... So as we suspected, my sister and the other clerics must be in Gharnef's hands...|
3477|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Forgive my interruption, sire, but Lord Gotoh has arrived.|
3478|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Lord Gotoh? Take me straight to him!|
3479|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Gotoh|Excellent work, Prince Marth. You managed to obtain all of the orbs. Thanks to your efforts, the lost Binding Shield is finally complete.|
3480|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Incredible! It felt as though the shield itself pulled in all the orbs... So this is the fabled Binding Shield. But what now, Lord Gotoh? From Gharnef's actions, it would seem he has the noble clerics imprisoned. I worry for their safety.|
3481|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Gotoh|Hmm... I understand how you feel... However, we have a far greater task to accomplish--we must seal away the earth dragons. Soon they will awaken from their slumber. They will rise up from the ground, destroying everything in their wake, and turn this world into a living hell. Go, Marth. Entomb the awakened dragons once more!|
3482|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Marth, it's finally over. Now, the world is safe. Look, the princesses are over there...|
3483|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Sister! And there's Princess Nyna... And Lena and Maria as well. It's great to see that everybody is safe.|
3484|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|Marth, you finally came. I am so happy... I will need your help to restore Archanea.|
3485|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Elice|You really worked hard, Marth. You are my pride.|
3486|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Lena|Lord Marth, with our combined strength we have already vanquished Gharnef. Please relax.|
3487|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Maria|The world is safe now. Your highness, please hurry back to Altea.|
3488|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Really? It's good to see everybody well. But you all don't look too good...|
3489|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|Everybody is tired from battling Gharnef. But it doesn't matter now, so please don't worry.|
3490|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Really...? Nyna, I am sorry about Hardin. I couldn't save him.|
3491|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Nyna|It's fine. He was devoured by his own ambitions, so it is not unexpected that he was lost. Well, Marth, you should hurry back to your homeland. Everybody is probably worried about you. With your remaining time, you must live well. As long as there are still people in this world, your name will never be forgotten.|
3492|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Kris, new information regarding the assassins has reached the palace. As you may have guessed, they were dispatched by Hardin and Gharnef. The head of the organization is a woman named Eremiah.|
3493|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Kris|Eremiah... And where is she now?|
3494|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Here, in Archanea. Apparently, she runs an orphanage in the mountains.|
3495|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|An orphanage?|
3496|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Jagen|Yes, so it would seem. However, it's an orphanage in name only. She confines the children to a basement devoid of light, and teaches them all manner of wicked things....|
3497|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Kris|......Sire. Please, let me go. I'll crush them-- I won't allow such a travesty to stand.|
3498|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|I understand, Kris. I, too, cannot allow a situation like this to carry on.|
3499|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Katarina|...Please, wait.|
3500|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|Katarina? Were you listening the whole time?|
3501|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Katarina|There's a hidden passage to where Lady Eremiah is... I'll show you the way.|
3502|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|......|
3503|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Katarina|Please, allow me to go. I'll be fine. I don't believe for a moment that this will atone for everything I've done... But while I live I want to help in any way that I can.|
3504|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Kris|......Sire. Please, let me go. I'll crush them-- I won't allow such a travesty to stand.|
3505|FE12BookTwo|20-DarkEmperor|Marth|I understand, Kris. I, too, cannot allow a situation like this to carry on. Let's go to the orphanage then.|
3506|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|Well, Kris, is everyone making good use of the drill grounds? Of course, if you win often, you'll be that much stronger. Kris, you...|
3507|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|Oho-ho, you... You've done very well, haven't you?|
3508|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Kris|Yes, I go there often.|
3509|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|I see. Then there is nothing I have to add. I should recommend the drill grounds to the others.|
3510|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|Oho-ho, you... You've been winning quite often, eh? Not bad at all.|
3511|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Kris|Thank you. But I hope to improve further.|
3512|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|That's the spirit! I should recommend the drill grounds to the others.|
3513|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|Hmm, you... It seems you haven't won much yet. Are you purposely avoiding the drill grounds?|
3514|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Kris|S-sorry, I don't really have the money, so...|
3515|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|Well, it's fine if you're not struggling now, but when things get tough, that experience will be the clincher. Just remember, if you ever feel that your foes are too strong, there is a place where you can hone your skills.|
3516|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Xane, we've already climbed this high. It's so cold... Even breathing is hard.|
3517|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|We're almost there. Look, can you see over there? That's the Ice Dragons' Temple where Gotoh is.|
3518|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|But, that was quite a shock. Tiki is actually the daughter of the Divine Dragon King. Also, both Gotoh and you are Divine Dragons.|
3519|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Ah... When the Divine Dragons fought the Earth Dragons they over-exhausted their dragonstones, and so practically became extinct. Aside from Naga, only Gotoh, me and the just born Tiki survived. However, after the war we discarded our dragonstones, so we could no longer become dragons again. Even so, I still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans. Gotoh followed Naga's orders to protect humans, but that's got nothing to do with me. I don't like humans. They scorned the Manaketes, even though they had lost their power, and treated them like filth. I can fully understand why Medeus and the others hated humans so much. The Earth Dragon King, Medeus, tricked his own tribe and became a Manakete by himself. He used to follow Naga's orders and guarded the Dragons' Altar. However the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive. They even started to attack the Manaketes that lived in peace. The Manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans, and gathered at the Dolhr region. They formed their own kingdom of Manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans. To save the humans, Gotoh handed the Falchion to Anri and he created an academy of magic at Khadein. But whoever won wasn't any of my concern.|
3520|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Then, why are you helping me? I'm also a human...|
3521|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|You're different from the others. You don't seem like an unreliable person either...|
3522|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Mmm... Thank you, Xane.|
3523|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Don't... don't be silly. I'll get embarrassed. Anyway, let's head to the temple, but be careful of the Ice Dragons. Although they're also wild dragons, they will instinctively try to protect their temple. Poor guys...|
3524|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|You, you're Beck! To think we'd meet here of all places!|
3525|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Beck|Me too, Prince Marth. Boy am I surprised to see you. It's been far too long. After the war, I was travelin' the continent. And, um, somehow...|
3526|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|...You landed up here? Well, thank goodness. There's no way you would have joined the barbarians. Beck, we're fighting another war. Why don't you come with us?|
3527|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Beck|I don't have my ballista any more. Just my horse-buddy right 'ere. But if you're fine with that, then sure. I'll help you princey.|
3528|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Beck|What's the point of war?|
3529|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Beck|D-damn... it... You too... Pony...?|
3530|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Hey, Xane. Gotoh didn't really mention anyting about the five orbs, but I thought they were very important. Do you know anything about them?|
3531|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didn't say anything. I will tell you. However, after I've told you, you'll probably think it was better off not knowing. The orbs rest on the shield that seals the Earth Dragons... Basically they are part of the Shield of Seals. Since ancient times, the Divine Dragons have passed down these sacred jewels, each possessing different powers. To put it simply, the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal. So if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken.|
3532|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Hmm, is that so? But, how come the orbs were scattered?|
3533|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Because the shield was broken. The Shield of Seals was displayed at the Fane of Raman, and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it...|
3534|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|When did that happen?|
3535|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Around 600 years ago. To recover the shield, Gotoh spend many years searching the lands. In the end, he only found the five orbs, with the shield nowhere to be seen. Not only that, but the five orbs, which he painfully collected, were scattered again after Raman was attacked in the previous war.|
3536|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Really? ...So that was why Gotoh was looking for the lost jewels... the orbs?|
3537|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Yep, the Starsphere, Lightsphere and Geosphere... as well as the Darksphere and Lifesphere. The Lightsphere is in Gotoh's possession, that Starsphere was shattered and the Darksphere was given to Hardin by Gharnef.|
3538|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|The Geosphere is in Altea and all that remains is the Lifesphere.|
3539|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Xane|Ah... Anyway, let's enter the temple. From now on I will also help you fight. Well, let's go!|
3540|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|Sire, please wait. Kris, you as well.|
3541|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|I just received a distressing message. People have been sighted not far behind us. There seems to be a battle underway.|
3542|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Out here? Could it be the barbarians? Or perhaps it's the assassins...|
3543|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Jagen|In any case, this area is almost entirely uninhabited. So it can't be any old people... To make matters worse, the snow is becoming heavier... Fighting will be difficult in this weather.|
3544|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|But if there are allies...|
3545|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Kris|Indeed. We cannot abandon them. If there are allies that is...|
3546|FE12BookTwo|13-FrozenLand|Marth|Then we'll just have to find out for ourselves, before the battle is over. Let's go!|
3547|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Luke|Ahh... This forest sure is nice and peaceful.|
3548|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Yeah.|
3549|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Luke|Just walking around here makes me feel rejuvenated, in a way.|
3550|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Yeah, same here.|
3551|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Luke|Oh, by the way. We're lost, aren't we?|
3552|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|......|
3553|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Luke|Hey, Kris the Ordinary! Wasn't this supposed to be, y'know, a shortcut!? Well?!|
3554|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Um... I'm sorry... I really did think it was... But we're definitely lost.|
3555|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Luke|WHAAAAAT?! You don't need to tell me that! I figured that one out ages ago!|
3556|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|Everyone, please, we mustn't fight. We need to work together in times of crisis...!|
3557|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Roderick|She's right. There's no point in crying over spilt milk. Rather, let's find a way home. Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen, our new mission: find our way back to Altea Castle. Of course, we should try not to wander around aimlessly while we find our way.|
3558|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Luke|Argh, we've totally fallen behind the others. ...Altean knights, lost in Altea. Sir Jagen is going to kill us...|
3559|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|I-I'm really very sorry...|
3560|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|It's fine. If we march all night, we can make up for lost time. Ah...! Please, wait! Could that be...?|
3561|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Ryan|W-what's wrong?|
3562|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|Over there! That village is under attack!|
3563|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Bandit|Gahahaha! Steal, burn, loot, pillage! Kill everyone who tries to flee! Gahahahaha!|
3564|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Legion|Yes, yes, that's it, that's it. Uwee hee hee! ...The more you alls riot, the smoother our jobses will be! Uwee hee!!|
3565|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Bandits, here...?! We can't just ignore this. Everyone, move out!|
3566|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Merric|Bandits... Prince Marth would be saddened if he saw this...|
3567|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Hey! Who are you? You don't look like you're in league with the bandits...|
3568|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Merric|You've got [color] hair... I gather you're the commanding officer? Very well, I shall join you. The name's Merric. I'm a mage from Khadein. Your orders, please!|
3569|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Merric|You've got blue hair... just like Marth's... I gather you're the commanding officer? Very well, I shall join you. The name's Merric. I'm a mage from Khadein. Your orders, please!|
3570|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Bandit|Gahahaha! Just die already!|
3571|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Bandit|Ga...ha...ha...|
3572|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Merric|I'm glad everyone's safe. Might you be Altean knights?|
3573|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|Hm, Kris, maybe this Merric is a friend of Prince Marth... That's it! He must be Merric the wind mage. I heard he even fought alongside Prince Marth during the War of Shadows. Wow, I-I'm a little nervous now...|
3574|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Merric|Prince Marth summoned me to help train the new knights. But, sadly, I seem to be rather lost. Would it be alright if you would show me the way to Altea Castle?|
3575|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|T-to Altea Castle?|
3576|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Legion|Uwee hee hee... Just as planned.|
3577|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Clarisse|Legion.|
3578|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Legion|Ooh, Clarisse. Didn't youses have somethings else to do?|
3579|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Clarisse|Quiet, you. It was easier than taking candy from a baby. I don't waste my time like you lot. You and Reese had better end this quick! It's not hard.|
3580|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Legion|Whatever. In the ends, our sneaking around is going to gets us results. We've gots a plan... We'll kills Marth... without fail.|
3581|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Luke|Finally... Altea Castle. We're back at last.|
3582|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|......|
3583|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|Huh? What's the matter, Kris? Is there something bothering you?|
3584|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Katarina, did you see him? Among the bandits... There was a funny man with a mask. I didn't count him amongst the dead. It's a little worrying...|
3585|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|...A masked man, huh? I'm sorry. I didn't see him... Well, it's okay. We did beat them in the end! Heehee, all this worrying's gotten me hungry... Come on, Kris, let's go and find something to eat.|
3586|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|I'm just a little tired and hungry, is all.|
3587|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|Ooh, is that all? To be honest, I'm a bit hungry as well... Kris, let's go and find something to eat.|
3588|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Marth|Please, come in.|
3589|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Commander Kris and Katarina, of the 7th Platoon, reporting as ordered, sire.|
3590|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Marth|Please, calm yourselves. You may stand at ease.|
3591|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|Yet you summoned us so suddenly, milord... Is it to do with the bandits we subjugated? Are you, sire, reprimanding us for disobeying our orders?|
3592|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Marth|Not at all--it's quite the opposite. Your actions have saved many. As ruler, my duty is to protect my people, and I am truly grateful for what you did.|
3593|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Katarina|We're honored to be of service, but that was tougher than any of our training. Phew...|
3594|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Marth|Kris, and you as well, Katarina... I hear from Jagen that you've been exemplary cadets.|
3595|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Is that so, sire? Sir Jagen never intimated as much...|
3596|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Marth|I've seen your skill, and I agree wholeheartedly with him. Why, the both of you are suitable for the Altean army. Should the two of you pass your test, I'd love it if you would become my Royal Guards.|
3597|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|Royal Guards, sire?|
3598|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Marth|Though the stories tell of me as a great hero, it is not so. There is only so much that I can do by myself. That much, I know to be true. The War of Shadows was won with the aid of comrades who wished for the same future as I. 'Twas not a lone romp across the land. I realized, whether in peace or war, I need people I can trust--young, dynamic soldiers who can support and guide me.|
3599|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Kris|B-but the Royal Guard exists to protect the king... It is a role of immense importance... Are we even fit for such an esteemed duty?|
3600|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue5|Marth|Yes, I believe so. I want you to be my Royal Guard. Jagen feels the same as I. But... don't feel obliged to promise me; I won't think ill of you if you decline. And so, I ask this of you once more. You need not answer right away. It's quite alright. Please think it over carefully.|
3601|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|So this is the School of Khadein... The sanctuary of those who study magic.|
3602|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Indeed. Merric studied here since he was a child. I personally have no magical ability, but as for you, Kris...|
3603|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|You're incredible. I don't think you'd lose to even Merric.|
3604|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|I wonder if I could study here, in Khadein?|
3605|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Actually, I think they'd want you to teach.|
3606|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|You have potential. I'm sure you'd qualify to study here.|
3607|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|Thank you, sire.|
3608|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|You too, hm...? You're not very good at magic either.|
3609|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|Yeah... I'm not really cut out for it.|
3610|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Well, everyone has their own talents. I wouldn't worry too much about it.|
3611|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Merric. It's time to put an end to this.|
3612|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Merric|Wait, Arlen! Why do we have to fight? We were both Master Wendell's pupils: we're friends, are we not? Why do you despise me so?|
3613|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|I was Master Wendell's disciple before you, and I was the stronger one. Even so, Master Wendell gave you Excalibur. He should have given it to me! Clearly, I was the only one worthy to be his successor, yet he...|
3614|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Merric|But I have no intention of succeeding Master Wendell. I hold no ill feelings for Khadein, but once I finish studying I plan to go home. Back in Altea, there is somebody I must protect for the rest of my life... So, Arlen, please! Why don't you join us so we can take back Altea?|
3615|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Altea, you say?! Why should we help a country that rebelled against the empire and attempted to invade their fair nation? The mage corps of Khadein have sworn allegiance to Emperor Hardin. Oh, I see... I knew it was you... YOU dragged the Altean army here!|
3616|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Merric|No!! That's not how it is!|
3617|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Shut your mouth, traitor!! I won't listen to your lies any longer! Your Excalibur and my Thoron; we'll put them to the test!|
3618|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|Arlen! What are you doing?!|
3619|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Master Wendell...|
3620|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|You still don't understand my decision, do you? Indeed, as a mage, your power surpasses mine. But you lack compassion. That is why I did not grant you Excalibur.|
3621|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|... Compassion...?|
3622|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|I had decided that you were to be my successor when the time came. To think you would harbor a grudge towards me... Does that not make you the same as Gharnef?|
3623|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|The same as Gharnef...? Teacher! What are you saying?|
3624|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|Arlen, listen to me... Gharnef, along with Pontifex Miloah, were Lord Gotoh's best pupils. But Lord Gotoh saw Gharnef's weakness, and so he left Khadein and the Aura tome to Pontifex Miloah. Gharnef, overcome by jealousy, stole the Darksphere from Lord Gotoh, and created the Imhullu tome. As a result... His heart was trapped within the Darksphere for all eternity. Wrath and envy led him to ruin. Do you understand now, Arlen...?|
3625|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|...Teacher... ...Teacher! I'm so sorry. I... I was wrong. Please... find it in your heart to forgive me!|
3626|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|Arlen, you will use that power of yours for the good of the people. Understand?|
3627|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|I won't lose to someone like Merric. Anyone who sides with him is my enemy. Thunder, strike them down! Thoron!!|
3628|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Master Wendell...|
3629|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Arlen|Why does everyone side with HIM...? Even though... even though I'm stronger!|
3630|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Wendell|How horrible... Consumed by your hatred, you have forgotten what is truly important.|
3631|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|Sire, we've rescued the clerics.|
3632|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|Sire, we've rescued the clerics that were threatened by the enemy.|
3633|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Excellent. Good work, Kris.|
3634|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|As thanks, they have offered to give us this.|
3635|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Marth... Do you hear me?|
3636|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Lord Gotoh! Yes, I can. You are speaking to me through magic, are you not? Lord Gotoh, I must ask: what has happened to cause Hardin to suddenly change so much?|
3637|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Hmm... The Darksphere is the culprit... Hardin's soul is trapped within the Darksphere...|
3638|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|The Darksphere? What on earth is that?|
3639|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Light, Star, Earth, Life and Darkness... In this world, there exist five sacred orbs. The Darksphere is that which complements the Lightsphere; in battle, it possesses the enemy's mind, negating their attacks. But the Darksphere also amplifies wrath and envy, and can turn their owner into a demon. Hardin must have obtained the Darksphere from somewhere... And now his heart has been lost to it.|
3640|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|But why? He should have been happy after his union with beloved Princess Nyna, so why the envy?|
3641|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Prince... Humans are never simple creatures... In any case, the only object that can overcome Hardin's Darksphere is the Lightsphere. If you want to do something about him, then you had best come and get it from me.|
3642|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Huh? Really, Lord Gotoh? If we have the Lightsphere, then we can save Hardin?|
3643|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|Well... If his heart is not completely consumed, then perhaps.|
3644|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Lord Gotoh! Please, lend the Lightsphere to me.|
3645|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Gotoh|If you come in person to the Ice Dragon's Temple where I reside, then you shall have it. But that will be no easy task. So, Marth. Do you have the courage to walk the path that Anri walked?|
3646|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Yes, I do! I will go!! Please, allow me to go! I must have the Lightsphere!|
3647|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Jagen|Kris, may I have a word? As this army's tactician, I have been observing each and every of our battles. If I were to sum up your recent style of fighting, I would say...|
3648|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Jagen|Most impressive! To the end. All of your comrades support each other, and you fight as one, so as to not lose each other. With Prince Marth as our core... and your support, we shall not falter.|
3649|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|It is an honor, Sir Jagen.|
3650|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Jagen|Excellent! There is no other word. At times we lose comrades... But even so, we have always prevailed. With Prince Marth as our core... and your support, we shall not falter.|
3651|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|It is an honor, Sir Jagen.|
3652|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Jagen|Unsatisfactory... It pains me to say it. But your comrades have fallen, one after another... At this rate, I worry for the future. You must protect them from now on. Their lives are in your hands, Kris.|
3653|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|Yes, Sir Jagen.|
3654|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Malice|Hey, can I talk to you for a second? I came here 'cause I heard Marth's group was passing by, but, erm...|
3655|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|Sorry, who are you?|
3656|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Malice|I'm Malice. A mercenary, and not a cheap one. I'd like to ask you something: is yer prince okay with paying gold? Oh, of course, it's okay if I have to wait until this war's over. So, erm... If you, er, paid us, say... 590 gold for our services, that ought to do, I think.|
3657|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Kris|Huh? If it's only that much, then Prince Marth would gladly pay...|
3658|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Malice|Phew! The rumors are true. He's completely different from all our employers up till now. Right, Pops?|
3659|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Dice|He IS different. Looks like we hit the jackpot coming to this desert. I'm Dice. On behalf of the both of us, it's great to be in your service.|
3660|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Jagen|Sire, we've just received new information. It concerns the assassins' movements... Lord Horace, who thought to ally with us, is in peril.|
3661|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Lord Horace...! Kris, Lord Horace is an Archanean knight in Princess Nyna's service. He was our ally.|
3662|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|Lord Horace! I am Marth of Altea. I ask that you lay down your arms...|
3663|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Horace|...... Is Princess Nyna... safe?|
3664|FE12BookTwo|10-TwoSorcerors|Marth|We cannot abandon Lord Horace. Jagen, Kris, let's hurry!|
3665|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Luke|Sigh.|
3666|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Ryan|What's wrong, Luke?|
3667|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Luke|Don't you think it's a crying shame that there aren't any cute and caring clerics around?|
3668|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Ryan|W-what do you mean...?|
3669|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Luke|Well, a knight thrives on romance, right? Like if I were wounded in battle, and a lovely cleric came to my aid... Hey, Kris the Ordinary. If we had a cleric like that with us, I bet we'd all fight twice as hard!|
3670|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Well, I don't know about the romantic part... But it would make our lives easier if we had a healer on our side. Unfortunately, I don't think there are any healers around, Luke. It might be a good idea for us to ask someone for assistance on this matter.|
3671|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|Kris, everyone, please listen. I bring good news. They've found us someone who can support our platoon! It appears we might be joined by a healer.|
3672|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Luke|She's finally here! My lovely cleric! Out of my way! Let me at her!|
3673|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Wrys|Pleased to meet you! I am Wrys, a humble curate. I cannot fight, but this staff I carry can heal your wounded.|
3674|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Luke|........|
3675|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Wrys|Yes, yes, I heard the whole thing from Sir Jagen. If you like, I could lend you my services as a healer. ...Oh my, has something terrible happened? Your face looks awfully pale... Have you been taken by illness, my boy?|
3676|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|It's nothing... He's just overwhelmed with joy right now.|
3677|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Ah, no, it's nothing... (Be careful what you wish for, Luke!)|
3678|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|Pay no heed to Luke; we're all fine. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Wrys.|
3679|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|Well then, let's continue the combat training. Everyone, you had better be prepared! I've decided that you will have a rather unusual instructor for today's practical training.|
3680|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|This is Miss Athena, a foreign myrmidon who helped us in the last war.|
3681|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Athena|Ve are indebted to this country, and ve vish to return the favor. Any voman would do the same. Ve are bad at teaching. But if ve are using swords, ve will not lose.|
3682|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|Athena is a myrmidon with excellent speed and an opponent whom you must be very cautious of. Kris, do your best!|
3683|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|This is General Jeorge, who is visiting from the kingdom of Archanea.|
3684|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Jeorge|I came to instruct Gordin in archery, but once I heard your story, my curiosity was piqued, to say the least. So I asked a big favor: to be allowed to take part.|
3685|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|Sir Jeorge... A true master of the bow and arrow, they call him greatest archer on the continent. Kris, do your best!|
3686|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Athena|Ve vill challenge you!|
3687|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Athena|...Ve give up.|
3688|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Jeorge|I am Jeorge, a bow knight of Archanea. Let me see how you fare in battle.|
3689|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Jeorge|...That was magnificent...|
3690|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Athena|You are strong. Especially you. You, vat is your name?|
3691|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|The name's Kris. Junior knight Kris.|
3692|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Athena|Kris... Ve vill remember that. You, you are our friend. Ve vill aid you if you vant.|
3693|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Jeorge|Not bad at all. That was a splendid fight. You, what is your name?|
3694|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|The name's Kris. Junior knight Kris.|
3695|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Jeorge|Kris... I'll remember that name. I'm afraid I cannot join your cause, but... Gordin, could you go in my stead?|
3696|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Gordin|Yes sir. I'll gladly fill in for you.|
3697|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Jeorge|Kris, you are someone I'd like to fight alongside one day. I look forward to the day we can meet again.|
3698|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|Today's training is now over. With that, I shall give you an interim report.|
3699|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Interim report...?|
3700|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|From the very first test until now, I have evaluated your manner of combat. The more of your allies that have been injured and forced to withdraw, the poorer your score. Get ready to listen up!|
3701|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Yes sir.|
3702|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|Commander Kris of the 7th Platoon! Of the twenty junior knight platoons, you place...|
3703|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|First! Wonderful work, Kris! You are most talented!|
3704|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|A-amazing! We did it! We did it, Kris! It's all thanks to you, Kris.|
3705|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|But don't let your guard down. Placing first doesn't give you an excuse to start slacking off. That is all! You may return to the castle!|
3706|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|Third! Impressive, Kris! I'd say that you've placed rather high.|
3707|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|We did it! We did it, Kris! It's thanks to you, Kris.|
3708|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|But don't let your guard down. You are still in-training--so from now on, you must aim even higher. That is all! You may return to the castle!|
3709|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|Tenth. Just in the middle, Kris. I've got nothing good to say, at this rate.|
3710|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|I'm sorry, Kris. It's because I can't do anything...|
3711|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|But don't give up. You are still in the middle of training, so I expect more effort from now on. That is all! You may return to the castle!|
3712|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|Last... Kris... None placed worse than you...|
3713|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Katarina|I, I-I'm terribly sorry, Kris... It's because I can't do anything...|
3714|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Cain|...But don't give up. You are still in the middle of training, so from now on try as hard as you can. That is all! You may return to the castle!|
3715|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|...Wow, this castle is absolutely massive. It's a huge difference to the house in my hometown... Now, where were the 7th Platoon's chambers again...?|
3716|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|Oh my... You are a junior knight, are you not?|
3717|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Ah, yes. I'm Kris. I came here hoping to become an Altean knight. And you are...?|
3718|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|I am Elice. Marth's elder sister.|
3719|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Oh! Prince Marth's elder sister... Please excuse my lack of manners.|
3720|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|It's alright, Kris... I think it's very admirable that you've come to help Marth.|
3721|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|It is an honor to serve Prince Marth, the Hero King.|
3722|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|"The Hero King"... you say? It does seem that our people have grown fond of calling him that. But the truth of the matter is that Marth... Marth is just a weak, vulnerable child...|
3723|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Prince Marth is weak...?|
3724|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|Yes. Of course, he was the hero who triumphed in the battle against the Shadow Dragon. However, behind his heroic face, Marth is an idealistic child who firmly clings on to his beliefs. And as you too must know, the real world... cannot be saved with just ideals.|
3725|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Yes...|
3726|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|Even as we speak, somewhere unknown to us, our people's lives are being lost... Marth cannot save those people.|
3727|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|Yes, that's true... Even the most excellent of kings is not an omnipotent god. A king is no more than human, and there are limits to what he can do.|
3728|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|Yes. Precisely. Most people realize this and can come to terms with that reality. But Marth cannot do that... He truly thinks that he can save everyone. In war, losing just one companion is unbearable for him... He suppresses his feelings with all his willpower, but I know that inside, his heart breaks and bleeds...|
3729|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Kris|......|
3730|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue4|Elice|In this cruel world, it will become increasingly difficult for him to continue to hold these ideals... Kris, if some day you should achieve knighthood... Please, protect him somehow and keep his ideals safe...|
3731|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Jagen|Macedon's main force consists of pegasus knights and dracoknights... Both are fast and highly mobile units. In particular, there are the Whitewings, who fought under our banner in the last war... There aren't many in these lands who could match their terrifying speeds.|
3732|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|I would have loved to witness their prowess...|
3733|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Jagen|Kris, while we're on the subject of speed...|
3734|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Jagen|Your speed can be summed up as exemplary. Even the Whitewings would have trouble keeping up with you. As I'd expect of an Altean Royal Guard.|
3735|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|It is an honor to receive such praise, Sir Jagen.|
3736|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Jagen|Your speed is satisfactory. But the Whitewings would simply fly straight over you.|
3737|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|I see... I'll be more careful, Sir Jagen.|
3738|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Jagen|Your speed is, sadly, terribly lacking. The Whitewings would probably reach their destination in half your time...|
3739|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|I-I see... I-I'll be more careful, Sir Jagen.|
3740|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Anna|Hello there Kris.|
3741|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|Hm? You're...? Why do I feel like we've met somewhere before...?|
3742|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Anna|Oh, don't worry about little old me. The important thing is that I came here to share a wonderful tip with you. Have you heard about "How's Everyone"?|
3743|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|How's... everyone?|
3744|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Anna|"How's Everyone" is all the rage! By checking it, you can see how everyone in your army is faring. You can watch your allies train, discover useful items, or even listen to their thoughts... So if you ever want to know how everyone is, then take a look at "How's Everyone." Easy, right?|
3745|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|I... see. Thanks, I guess.|
3746|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Anna|The more time passes, the more things you'll be able to see. If you ever feel the urge, then go ahead and take a peek! Well, I'll be off now. Buh-bye!|
3747|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Prince Marth!! Thank goodness you've come to Macedon!|
3748|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Catria?! I received word that there was a rebellion in Macedon. Are you unharmed?|
3749|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Yes, I'm fine. My older sister Palla and I managed to escape somehow. But Princess Minerva was captured by the rebels. Prince Marth, please... You have to rescue Princess Minerva! At this rate, her life will be in danger!|
3750|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Of course I will help her. Catria, please take us to where she is.|
3751|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Yes, my lord! But first we have to break through these woods. General Rumel's dragon knight squad is lurking within this area. If we approach from the front, we'll be easy pickings for them.|
3752|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|I see...So you're suggesting we flank them from the left or right. Thank you, Catria. Leave it to us!|
3753|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Warren's a bit of an idiot. Just 'cause they paid him well, he went ahead and joined the rebel army! Ahh, to think a fool like him was once acquainted with the fair Catria...|
3754|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Look out for those pilfering thieves. If they take off with your precious treasure, you won't ever get it back. Never let them escape from your sight.|
3755|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Because of the last war, every nation has been forced to lead hard lives. The only well-off country is Archanea, ruled by Emperor Hardin.|
3756|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Some dirty thieves took our village treasure, the Lady Sword, and ran off with it. Only women can wield the incredible power of that sword. Please, prise it back from their filthy hands.|
3757|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Villager|Beware when dracoknights are around. Even from a far-off distance, they can move all at once and swoop down on you!|
3758|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Cord|O'er here! Prince Marth!|
3759|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|You're... Cord! What are you doing so far from Talys?|
3760|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Cord|I couldn't sit still when I heard you's fighting again, so I came to join in. We're Talys's mercenaries, right? If ya died, Princess Caeda'd cry. Prince Marth, lemme fight too. I'll join you's army.|
3761|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Warren?! Even a good man like you has sided with the rebel army...|
3762|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|Catria the White, huh? It's been a while. You know I'm just a common hunter. If they pay me enough, I'll do anything.|
3763|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Catria|Warren, listen to me! Princess Minerva endeavored to create a country where its people could live at ease. She exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute to accomplish that goal. But General Rucke, despite knowing this, roused the soldiers into a coup d'etat. Can't you see? He's just trying to make this country into his own! And you can honestly say you're okay with that?|
3764|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|...I see. Well, I don't like the military acting as if they owned the place... Alright then. If you're going to help the princess, then so will I.|
3765|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|No hard feelings. I don't have anything against you, but this is the way I live. Forgive me!|
3766|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Warren|Damn it... I should've seen this coming...|
3767|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Rumel|Taste the terror of Macedon's fearless dracoknight squad!|
3768|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Rumel|General Rucke, I leave the rest to you...|
3769|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Jagen|Sire, we found someone most unusual confined in one of the fortress rooms.|
3770|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Hm? ...Linde! How did you wind up in a dangerous place like this?|
3771|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|Sire, do you know this woman?|
3772|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Yes, this is Linde. Her natural talent for magic helped us a great deal in the last war.|
3773|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|Prince Marth! Thank heavens. What a pleasant surprise meeting you here. I desperately needed to see you again, so I set out to find you. But the Macedonian soldiers found me suspicious and they dragged me to this fortress...|
3774|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Is that so? I'm glad you're safe. But, why were you looking for me? Shouldn't you be by Princess Nyna's side?|
3775|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|I was requested by Princess Nyna to deliver you this.|
3776|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Huh? This...! This is the Fire Emblem! The royal heirlom of Archanea: the Emblem Shield!|
3777|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Kris|The Fire Emblem... I heard that in the last war, Princess Nyna entrusted you with it, sire...|
3778|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Indeed. I looked after this as Archanea's representative in the last war. But why give this to me now? Especially at a time when Archanea has so much influence under Emperor Hardin's reign? In this peaceful age, why is Princess Nyna giving me the "Champion's Proof"...?|
3779|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|I don't understand either. Princess Nyna didn't explain why, just that I had to give it to you... I remember her eyes seemed so sad... I think she may have been crying...|
3780|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Marth|Princess Nyna crying?! What on earth has been happening...? Linde, after this battle ends, I will go see Princess Nyna. Until then, I want you to remain with us.|
3781|FE12BookTwo|02-RebellionAtMacedon|Linde|Yes, Prince Marth!!|
3782|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|Hmmm...|
3783|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ryan|What's the matter now, Luke?|
3784|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|Guys, guys, guys, I need an opinion! How's my hair look?|
3785|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Roderick|Your... hair?|
3786|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|I'm a soldier of love, seeking out only the most beautiful women, but I... haven't gotten any dates yet.|
3787|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|I'm sorry to say, most of the girls here think of you as small fry. I mean, people think Ryan is a "cutie," or Roderick is "Ohmigosh, so cool!" Quite a few people seem to secretly lust after Kris too.|
3788|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|Exactly! I didn't get it at first. I thought, "what am I doing wrong?" That's when I realized: it's my hair!|
3789|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|I'm not sure what leap of logic led you to that particular conclusion...|
3790|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|Well, for example, I'll fix up my hair like you do! And then...|
3791|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|They'll see me as brave... and beautiful, just like Kris, right?|
3792|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Roderick|Err... Luke, you're a guy. How does mimicking Kris automatically make you gallant...?|
3793|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|Luke, maybe if you did something about that attitude of yours, you'd be more popular. Oh, it's time. Apparently, today, Sir Jagen wishes to have a word with us before training.|
3794|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|My feminine grace'll win hearts, just like Kris!|
3795|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ryan|Your "feminine grace" is scaring me actually...|
3796|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|Luke, maybe if you did something about that attitude of yours, you'd be more popular. Oh, it's time. Apparently, today, Sir Jagen wishes to have a word with us before training.|
3797|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|N-no, let's not actually. The girls would run away in fear if I had Kris's hairdo...|
3798|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|...How rude! What's wrong with my hair, exactly?|
3799|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|I-I think your hair looks great, Kris... Oh, it's time. Apparently, today, Sir Jagen wishes to have a word with us before training.|
3800|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|They'll see me as brave... and handsome, just like Kris, right?|
3801|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Roderick|Not possible...|
3802|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|Luke, maybe if you did something about that attitude of yours, you'd be more popular. Oh, it's time. Apparently, today, Sir Jagen wishes to have a word with us before training.|
3803|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|They'd see me as gentle and quiet, like softly falling rain! Just like Kris, right?|
3804|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ryan|Umm... If you say so?|
3805|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|Luke, maybe if you did something about that attitude of yours, you'd be more popular. Oh, it's time. Apparently, today, Sir Jagen wishes to have a word with us before training.|
3806|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Luke|N-no, let's not actually. The girls would run away in fear if I had Kris's hairdo...|
3807|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|...How rude! What's wrong with my hair, exactly?|
3808|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|I-I think your hair looks great, Kris... Oh, it's time. Apparently, today, Sir Jagen wishes to have a word with us before training.|
3809|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Jagen|Three months have passed since you first came here. During this time, I've witnessed many a platoon desert because they couldn't stomach the harsh training. Not to mention platoons that failed due to miserable results... Of all who remain, there are only twenty names.|
3810|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|Eep, the requirements are incredibly strict!|
3811|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|True. But we still remain in the game. That's what matters. As long as we keep working hard...|
3812|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Jagen|From now on, the practical training will be far more gruelling. As such, we will be introducing lectures to advise you.|
3813|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|Lectures?|
3814|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Frey|I am Frey, the knight in charge of lecturing. In my lectures, you will learn essential knowledge that all knights should possess.|
3815|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Jagen|From here on, this is the real thing. Prepare to be pushed to your limits.|
3816|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Frey|Now, firstly, I'll talk about the preparations you need to make before a battle. Before you fight your enemy on the battlefield, you must ensure that you are sufficiently prepared.|
3817|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Frey|Selecting those who will fight, organizing their weapons and items... Kris, you will do all these things, as part of your role as commander.|
3818|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|I understand. I'll do my best.|
3819|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Frey|One more important thing: Pay attention to party members who wish to speak with you. Talking to your party members will often yield tactical advice. The more stars displayed, the more important a conversation is. When you come to a new battlefield, it's always a good idea to check if anybody has something to say.|
3820|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Cain|Well then, let us begin today's mock battle. From here on, I will prepare an instructor based on your performances until now. The 7th Platoon's opponent, today, is...|
3821|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Draug|I am Draug, armor knight of Altea. Your opponent is none other than me.|
3822|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|Draug is an armor knight famed for his sturdy defense. Kris, he'll be a formidable enemy.|
3823|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Draug|These soldiers are your opponents. You must defeat all of them if you wish to fight me.|
3824|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Cain|Well then, let's begin today's practical training! Your opponents from here on will be the toughest yet, so show me that fighting spirit of yours! The 7th Platoon's opponent, today, is...|
3825|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ogma|I will serve as your opponent.|
3826|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|What? We-we have to fight Ogma...? Kris, Ogma is a hero from the last war... He'll make for a formidable enemy.|
3827|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ogma|The soldiers here will be your opponents, first. If you defeat all of them, I'll step up to fight.|
3828|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Cecil|Huff... puff... I-I made it. Hey, where's this Commander Kris person?|
3829|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|That would be me, but who are you?|
3830|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Cecil|I'm Cecil, a junior knight like you! I know it's very sudden, but I was invited by Katarina to join your group.|
3831|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|...Very sudden indeed. But, the more the merrier. Could we talk after the battle?|
3832|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Cecil|Sure, I'm glad you understand. Oh yeah, I brought along some strong weapons that Katarina prepared for you! Just give me the orders and I'll give you them to replace your worn out ones.|
3833|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Draug|You're not bad at all. But I won't be beaten so easily.|
3834|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ogma|Not bad. As promised, I will fight.|
3835|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Draug|I keep hearing about your abilities. Please, allow me to judge for myself whether or not you're the real deal.|
3836|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Draug|S-so you managed to penetrate my armor...|
3837|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ogma|Don't think of this as simply training. Come at me without restraint!|
3838|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ogma|...Not bad. That's quite some skill you've got.|
3839|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Draug|How...? Even my defense couldn't withstand such a tremendous onslaught. Commander Kris, if you have need of an armor knight's strength, you may call on me.|
3840|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|We did it, Kris! Good job!|
3841|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Ogma|Such great power. Looks like Altea is blessed with good knights. Kris, if you have need of my power you need only ask.|
3842|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|We did it, Kris! Good job!|
3843|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|Excuse me, Kris, do you have a moment?|
3844|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|Huh? Of course. What is it?|
3845|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|That Royal Guard position that Prince Marth offered us. Did you think about it? I... I'd like to be a Royal Guard, if you're in with me. Together, we'd be an unstoppable team... When I imagine a future like that, I feel very happy. ...Um, what about you, Kris? Do you, perhaps, feel the same as I...?|
3846|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|Um, I'm sorry. I haven't really thought about it yet...|
3847|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|...I-is that so? Yes, I... So it was just me after all... I'm sorry. Good night, Kris.|
3848|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|Yeah, I think it would be nice.|
3849|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Kris|Yes, of course.|
3850|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue6|Katarina|R-really? I'm so glad... Well, this is a little awkward... I should get to bed. Good night, Kris. Good luck for tomorrow.|
3851|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|Sire, am I glad to see you!|
3852|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Kris! Thank goodness. Is everyone else okay?|
3853|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|Yes, everyone who survived is here.|
3854|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Amazing. I don't know how you all managed to escape that onslaught...|
3855|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|We were most fortunate. A sandstorm was brewing as we were making our escape... Thanks to the obscuring sands, the enemy lost sight of us, and we were able to escape with ease. Even during normal battles, I seem to have lucky moments like that.|
3856|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|I see. Kris, you must be loved by the goddess of fortune.|
3857|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|It would be my honor.|
3858|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|Your thoughts are mine. But somehow we were able to shake off the enemy and escape.|
3859|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|I see. Thank you, Kris.|
3860|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|Me neither. The way was blocked by earth and sand, and we lost our way as well... B-but somehow... Somehow we escaped.|
3861|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|How horrible for you... Even during normal battles, Kris, unlucky things always seem to befall you. I have to wonder if the goddess of fortune hates you?|
3862|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|It would certainly seem that way...|
3863|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|Minerva, if you wait in this village, you will most certainly run into Marth. I don't like him, but he is indeed noble. Join forces with him.|
3864|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Brother, what are you going to do now? Won't you come with me...?|
3865|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|I have no intention of doing that. I only wish to find Maria and bring her home to Macedon.|
3866|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|You've changed, Brother... Or should I say, you've returned to how you used to be. As I thought, back then you were being controlled by Gharnef's dark magic.|
3867|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|No, no magic could bend my will. I wished to crush the arrogant Archanea, and establish Macedonian supremacy over this continent. But Father, without bending his ear to me, distanced himself from me and later had me banished.|
3868|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Are you saying that's why you murdered Father? What a fool you were... Didn't you realize that was Gharnef's plotting all along? Yes, Father was strict with you. But it was only because he loved you. Why couldn't you see that?|
3869|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Michalis|Enough, Minerva. Do you take me for a fool? After I was defeated, I wandered the gap between life and death. When I had come to, in front of me, I was Maria--her eyes full of tears--praying to the gods. While I treated her like a pawn, Maria, she shed tears for me... Minerva, I'm going now. I have to save Maria. At least that can be my atonement!|
3870|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Michalis...|
3871|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|Sire. How shall we proceed from here?|
3872|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Hmm... I want to go home to Altea, but if we can't prevail against Hardin, then we can't go back. What in the world are we supposed to do...?|
3873|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|We need to find out the secret of the strange power that's protecting Hardin. Forgive me, sire. As your Royal Guard, I was supposed to strike down your foes...|
3874|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|No, it's not your fault, Kris. I too felt a strange presence emanating from Hardin, almost like...|
3875|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|Sire, it's an emergency! I have just come into some new information. The Khadein mage corps has launched an offensive against us.|
3876|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|What!? Even Khadein means to be our enemy... Merric, what are you...|
3877|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|Sir Jagen, what should we do?|
3878|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|At this rate, it seems we have no choice. Sire, we need to break into the sanctuary, but you must be prepared to make sacrifices. If we don't hurry, Archanea's pursuit force will reach our rear and we'll be trapped.|
3879|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|I understand. We've no choice. Everyone, let's break into the sanctuary! But avoid needless fights if possible!|
3880|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|An update, sire! The Archanea army is, at present, approaching from the south.|
3881|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|I see. Hasten the march; don't let them catch up!|
3882|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Astram|Do not think you can escape, Alteans. I'll turn this desert into your graveyard.|
3883|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Soldier|Do not think you can escape, Alteans. We will avenge Captain Astram!|
3884|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Villager|A swordslayer will demonstrate your might against a mercenary or a hero. You should definitely get one if you can.|
3885|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Villager|From here on north, you won't see no more shops. If you're going that way, you should stock up now.|
3886|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Villager|The person commanding Khadein's mage corps is a young man named Arlen. He's not a bad man, but he can be a bit uncooperative. Seems he regards his old rival, Merric, with disdain. Hmm... I reckon only Lord Wendell could talk some sense into him.|
3887|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Huh? Princess Minerva, why are you here?|
3888|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|My brother... Michalis, he helped me.|
3889|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Really? That's good to hear. I was so worried once I heard that Prince Michalis had taken you. But, for him to rescue you: what in the world happened?|
3890|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Maria saved Michalis's life. She's kind, unlike myself... Maria's kindness was able to touch the heart of even a man like Michalis.|
3891|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|But, isn't that what you wanted? That's why you deliberately avoided killing Michalis. Am I wrong, Princess?|
3892|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Minerva|Hmm......|
3893|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|I can understand. No one can sever the ties between family so easily. Princess, please lift your spirits. I would like you to fight with us again, just like before. I would like Macedon's strength and yours in order to put a stop to Hardin's designs.|
3894|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|You're... Etzel! Why are you here?|
3895|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Etzel|I have my ties to Khadein as well. "Prince Marth has succumbed to his ambitions and invaded Archanea." When I was told that, there was no way I could sit still!|
3896|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|......|
3897|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Etzel|But... No matter how I put it, I just couldn't imagine you'd become that sort of person. Prince Marth, you said to me long ago that you wanted to let the era of war end. Do you still stand by those words?|
3898|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Yes, I do. I do not seek to fight.|
3899|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Etzel|...I see. I, too, do not seek as such. Allow me to join you once more.|
3900|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Etzel|I don't want to fight you, but I owe Khadein. What a troublesome ordeal I am in...|
3901|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Etzel|This war... will... someday...|
3902|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Yodel|I will not forgive intruders upon our holy sanctuary! Earth, show your fury! Bolganone!!|
3903|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Yodel|Arlen... Was this really what you wanted...?|
3904|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Jagen|The atmosphere inside the building seems somewhat strange.|
3905|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Indeed, something seems to be happening. Kris, Merric's inside there. You met him during your training, right?|
3906|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Kris|Yes. Sir Merric really helped us with his magical prowess. So Sir Merric is here... We must hurry, sire.|
3907|FE12BookTwo|09-SanctuaryOfSorcery|Marth|Yes, let's go!|
3908|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jagen|Kris, it's been decided that we're going to war with Archanea. Archanea will not be an easy opponent. They have one of the most powerful militaries on the continent.|
3909|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Kris|We're ready to face anything, sir. Although... we still lack experience, I admit. We have to grow stronger...|
3910|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jagen|Indeed. Kris, are you aware of the "drill grounds" that operate across the continent?|
3911|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Kris|Drill grounds, sir?|
3912|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jagen|It costs a bit of money, but if you go practice in one, you can get stronger. It might be a good idea to let our more inexperienced men have a go.|
3913|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|Commander Lang. The... A-Altean army has arrived...|
3914|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Lang|You moron. Why are you so panicked? With their nation and name in ruins, the Alteans are of no consequence to us.|
3915|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|But, Sir Jeorge's archers left to quell the rebellion. Can we win with just our troops?|
3916|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Lang|Why didn't you tell me earlier? Call Jeorge back to the castle this instant! While you're there, find that hired sword, Navarre, and bring him here. General Toras! I'm heading inside. You will defend this location till your last breath. Do NOT let the enemy get close. Do I make myself clear?!|
3917|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Soldier|Captain Jeorge. We've received orders to return to the castle immediately.|
3918|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|Orders from Lang, huh? I'm not fond of that man. His treatment of our people is simply intolerable. To work beneath him is an insult. Pay his orders no mind.|
3919|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Soldier|But, Captain! You'll be accused of treason! Captain?! You can't be planning to defect to Altea...|
3920|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|No, that's not an option. If I were to defect now, I'd drag the entire platoon down with me. So for that reason alone, I will absolutely not take any risks that might besmirch our name.|
3921|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Soldier|Captain Jeorge...|
3922|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|Anyway, inform everyone: Do not move from your stations. However, if the enemy approaches, you may engage them.|
3923|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Villager|Y'know, lately I haven't seen that mercenary, Samuel. I thought that he might have joined your ranks, but I guess not... He's as lax as they get, but you can't go wrong with his skill.|
3924|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Villager|Oh, Alteans, hear our plea! Please, defeat General Lang! As long as that man lives, peace is but a fleeting dream.|
3925|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Elder|Ohh, if isn't Prince Marth! I wonder how my granddaughter Lena is faring, hm? What, you don't know? I see... Th-then... Do you still want this Hammerne staff? At least, if Lena's pupil Marisha were around, I'm sure she could use it... Well, whatever be the case, I've no use for a souvenir. Please, make good use of it.|
3926|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Bandit|Whoo! Ready, boys? Look at all the ruckus! Never a better time to attack that buncha villages!|
3927|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Julian|Hey, Rickard! I see you haven't tired of stealin'.|
3928|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Ah! Chief! How nice to see ya. Well, I was plannin' on workin' with you and makin' loadsa money, but you had to go and quit the business! Fallin' head over heels for that beautiful cleric, and then dumpin' me... That's just too cruel! Did our love really mean that little to you?|
3929|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Julian|Can it, you little fink!! People'll get the wrong idea about us, if you keep talkin' like that. Anyway, forget about thievin' and come with me to fight for justice.|
3930|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Hmm... alright then! I'll follow you anywhere. I do adore ya, Chief!|
3931|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Ogma|Long time no see, Barst.|
3932|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|Captain Ogma! Why are you here...?|
3933|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Ogma|Another war has started. Once again, I fight under Prince Marth's banner. Barst, lend us your strength. We need you.|
3934|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|I got nothing to do with fighting now... Well, that's what I would say if you were anyone else. Captain, I owe you. You've saved our sorry asses on more occasions than one. Captain Ogma. Just say the word. I'll do whatever you want!|
3935|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Bord|Barst! What're you doin' in a place like this?!|
3936|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|Bord? It's been a while. Fighting's a thing of the past for me. I'm just an ordinary woodcutter now. Move along; nothing to see here.|
3937|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Bord|Don't be an idiot. Doncha know? This is Prince Marth's fight. If you ignore his plea, you're a disgrace to the Talysian Mercenaries. Tell me you're no disgrace.|
3938|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|...... You know, all I really want is to live in peace... I suppose I can't just kick back, and chop my wood, with this damn war going on. This needs to end quickly.|
3939|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Bord|Oh yeah! That's my bro!|
3940|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|Yeah, I'll join too. Tell Prince Marth for me.|
3941|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Cord|Barst! What're you doin' here?!|
3942|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|Bord? Long time no see.|
3943|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Cord|I'm not Bord! I'm Cord! You of all people should know that!|
3944|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|It was a joke! Sorry. Look, Cord, I know you came out all this way... But I've got nothing to do with war no more. I'm an ordinary woodcutter now. Just ignore me.|
3945|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Cord|Don't be stupid. Doncha know? Prince Marth's fighting again. If you ignore his plea, you're a disgrace to the Talysian Mercenaries. You wanna be a disgrace, is that it?|
3946|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|...... You know, all I really want is to live in peace... I suppose I can't just kick back, and chop my wood, with this damn war going on. This needs to end quickly.|
3947|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Cord|Heh! That's my bro.|
3948|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|Yeah, I'll join too. Tell Prince Marth for me.|
3949|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|You wouldn't have needed to die if you hadn't come so close...|
3950|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jeorge|Fools...|
3951|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Chief, where aaare ya?|
3952|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Rickard|Tch. Man, I messed up big time.|
3953|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|Oi, quit it! I don't want to get involved in no war!|
3954|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Barst|Damn it... What a world...|
3955|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|Projection 44.5 degrees! Fiiiire!!!|
3956|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Toras|General Lang... Altea is too strong...|
3957|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jagen|Sire, we've finally seized control of Grust. However, a number of enemies are concealed within the castle. Our job here is far from over.|
3958|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Marth|Yes, I know. Lang must be stopped here and now. Or else we forsake the people of Grust.|
3959|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Kris|Sire. I, too, do not intend to let him go. Say the word and with these very hands...|
3960|FE12BookTwo|05-LiberationOfGrust|Jagen|This is Lang we are talking about. We don't know what he's planning. Kris, we must take extra caution when fighting inside the castle!|
3961|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|This is the Ice Dragons' Temple. Anri's final destination...|
3962|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Prince Marth, can you hear me? Come to the front of the center room. I shall await you there.|
3963|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|What!? You found all the shards? Thank you, then the Starsphere can be restored. Please wait a moment...|
3964|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|||
3965|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Marth, this is the Starsphere. You can take this with you as well.|
3966|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Huh? Gotoh, why are you giving such an important item to me?|
3967|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|The only person that can restore the Shield of Seals is you... The Shield, itself, has chosen you.|
3968|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|.....?|
3969|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|You still don't understand? The Emblem shield you're carrying is the stolen Shield of Seals. To be honest, it was only recently that I noticed; its exterior had completely changed... After stealing it from the Fane of Raman, the thief removed its jewels and sold them off as treasures. The money was used to fund an army, which, along with three stolen weapons, was used to conquer the world. The thief that went on to become the king of Archanea had the shield, which brought him such good fortune, it became the emblem of his royal family. Now do you understand, Marth? It is what you are carrying, Archanea's Fire Emblem.|
3970|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|!! What... ...The first king of Archanea was originally a thief!? Is that true...? In that case, I can kind of understand the curse of the Fire Emblem... Then, Gotoh... If I can collect all five orbs, can I restore the Shield of Seals?|
3971|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Mmm... But please hurry up. The shield has already been broken for 600 years... It is almost time for the Earth Dragons, sealed underneath Macedon, to awaken from their slumber. Those evil Earth Dragons number several hundreds... No, several thousands. Once they awaken there will be nothing that we can do... I will leave Tiki in your care. You can find her in the room to the right. That Divine Dragon child should be able to help you battle the Earth Dragons. But, I will state clearly, if the Shield of Seals is not restored, Tiki will be destroyed.|
3972|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Huh...!? Why is that...|
3973|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|That child is still developing. Without the Shield of Seals she will begin to degenerate. Eventually she will become wild and attack humans. I made her sleep, because I felt sad for her. But, if the Shield of Seals is restored I will no longer have to worry, because the shield will protect Tiki. Marth, please take care of Tiki. You must rescue that child from the path of ruin.|
3974|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Is that so. You couldn’t find them all... There’s nothing you can do about it... Please hand your collected shards to me. Tiki is sleeping in the room to the right. But since the shield isn’t restored, I can’t let you see her. That child is still developing. Without the Shield of Seals she will begin to degenerate. Eventually she will become wild and attack humans. I cannot allow Tiki to awaken again. It is for her own good... Marth, once you’ve obtained all the treasures, head to the room to the left. I will be waiting for you...|
3975|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Tiki!? Are you alright...|
3976|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Uh...|
3977|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Tiki, it's me, Marth. Hey, open your eyes!|
3978|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|...Marth... .....! Oh Marth!! You came! You came to see Tiki!!|
3979|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Yes, I hadn't seen Tiki in a long time. Are you feeling well?|
3980|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Uh... No. The bishop told me that I had to sleep again. But I don't want to... Because when I sleep I'm always alone. During my sleep, I dreamt many nightmares. There, I became a wild dragon, like those poor Fire Dragons and Ice Dragons. I attacked humans, and I killed them. No... No... When I awoke I was all alone in the dark room... I felt so strange, but also very scared... So very scared... But I couldn't leave that room. I cried many times, and then Uncle Bantu would come to comfort me as usual. One day he took me away, and took me to a human village. Living in that village was very fun, and everybody treated me well... In the short time, until I was discovered by Gharnef, I felt really happy. I don't want to sleep anymore... I feel that if I close my eyes once more, I will be unable to open them ever again. I don't want that. I want to live with everyone, I don't want to sleep again!|
3981|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Tiki, it's alright now. I will protect you, so don't cry...|
3982|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Really...? I won't need to see those scary dreams again!?|
3983|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|That's right! Once the shield is restored, Tiki can live together with the rest of us. Don't worry, believe in me!|
3984|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Ah! I'm so happy!! Thank you, Marth!|
3985|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|Huh...? Who... who are you...?|
3986|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Tiki|...Ah... Mar...Mar...|
3987|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|I see... So Tiki was pretty happy. It must have been very painful for her. Though it was to protect her, I was far too cruel to her. I suspect she must really hate me... You should go, Marth. I will send you to Altea with my powers.|
3988|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|You should go, Marth. I will send you to Altea with my powers.|
3989|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Lord Gotoh, why don't you come with us?|
3990|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Hmm... At the moment I've one thing I must still investigate. Gharnef has returned.|
3991|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|Gharnef...!? But we killed him!|
3992|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Yes, you killed his body. But his soul was held prisoner by the Darksphere, and within it, his hatred only grew. Afterwards, his former disciples--the heretic bishops--resurrected him. And they seem to be planning something foul.|
3993|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Marth|I see. Very well, Lord Gotoh. We shall split ways here.|
3994|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Gotoh|Indeed. If I find something, then I too will visit Altea afterwards. I'm counting on you, Marth. Everything rests on your shoulders. You must save both our races from the path of destruction.|
3995|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|...Altea, home at last. Though you may be occupied by Archanea... I will get you back, I swear.|
3996|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Boy, what a serious lady. Hey, Kris. You said you're Marth's Royal Guard, right?|
3997|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Yes. My mission is to protect Prince Marth.|
3998|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|I see. But if you really plan on protectin' him, then you need the strength to match your conviction. Hey, do you wanna know a way to get stronger?|
3999|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Hm? You know of a way?|
4000|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|...At long last, Altea. My dearest home... Archanean occupation be damned; I will get you back, I swear it!|
4001|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Boy, what a serious fella. Hey, Kris. You said you're Marth's Royal Guard, right?|
4002|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Yes. My mission is to protect Prince Marth at all costs.|
4003|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|I see. But if you really plan on protectin' him, then you're gonna need the strength to back up your conviction. Hey, do you wanna know a way to get stronger?|
4004|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Huh? Do you know how to?|
4005|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|'Course, just hold on a second.|
4006|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Ta-da! Kris, you know about Tiki, right? Tiki's still a kid, but the real reason she can fight is because of her hairstyle and tiara.|
4007|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Wait, what?! Are you serious?!|
4008|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Yeah, if you wear your hair like this, then you'll be that much stronger. So all you gotta do is wear this tiara, and wear your hair like Tiki. If you do that, then a legendary power will flow through you! ...Well, maybe. So? Do you wanna give it a try?|
4009|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Sure, why not?|
4010|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Alrighty then. I'll be sure to do this properly.|
4011|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Thank you, Sir Xane!|
4012|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|......You aren't doubting me? Is this trust or naivete...?|
4013|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Is something the matter, Sir Xane?|
4014|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Ah, no, it's nothin'. Well, see you around. I'm looking forward to your new look!|
4015|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|No, that's quite alright. I want to protect Prince Marth with my own strength.|
4016|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Hmm, that so? Boring.|
4017|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Kris|Huh? What do you mean "boring"?|
4018|FE12BookTwo|14-AMysteryRevealed|Xane|Ah, no, it's nothin'. Catch you later!|
4019|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|Kris's 7th Platoon! You have fought valiantly thus far. It has been a joy being your instructor!|
4020|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Jagen|Frey, Cain; I have heard reports from both of them. Though your individual strengths vary, there exists no doubt of your excellence. Thus, today we will hold your final practical exam. Make sure that you are thoroughly prepared.|
4021|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|The final preparations have been made! We are now ready to begin! Your opponent in the final exam shall be...|
4022|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|Myself: Cain, knight of Altea! I'll show you the sort of battle that real knights face!|
4023|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Est|Est, ex-Whitewing of Macedon, at your service. I won't go easy on you!|
4024|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|You have come well prepared. But you must be wary that the enemies you see are not always your only ones!|
4025|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Est|I can tell that you aspire to be something great. But you'd better not think that your only enemies are those that you can see.|
4026|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|Now! Reinforcements, attack!|
4027|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Est|Now! Reinforcements, attack!|
4028|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|Here we go! Give it your all!|
4029|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|Impressive...!|
4030|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Est|Here I come! I wonder, can you keep up with me?|
4031|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Est|So... so strong...|
4032|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cain|Congratulations, you won! There is nothing more we can teach you.|
4033|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Est|As I thought...It pains me to say this, but you were really strong. I don't think you can call yourselves apprentices any more!|
4034|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Jagen|Hm. Well then, Kris's 7th Platoon; I will announce the results of the second half of your training right here, right now. As before, your score depends on the amount of companions who were forced to make an early exit. Listen carefully. Your performance has been...|
4035|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Jagen|Most impressive! Even amongst the past Altean knights, there has not been a group with such high credentials as yours! Therefore...|
4036|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Jagen|Ahem, not bad! Compared to other aspiring knights in the past, you have done very well. And so...|
4037|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Jagen|Hmm... This is extremely difficult for me to say. You have many injured... But you deserve credit for winning all your battles until now. Therefore...|
4038|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Jagen|Kris's 7th Platoon, I have decided that you have passed your final test!|
4039|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Ryan|We passed... So that means we're...|
4040|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Luke|Alright, we did it! We can become knights!|
4041|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Cecil|We did it. After this, I'm going to buy myself a nice sword, and a hefty lance... Oooh, it's getting me excited just thinking about it! Heh heh heh heh...|
4042|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Roderick|...Cecil, you're scaring me. But you're not alone in excitement. My lifelong dream has at last been realized.|
4043|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Everyone looks so happy. I guess it's because we're all to be knights! We really did it, Kris.|
4044|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Yeah. It was my grandfather's and my own dearest wish to become an Altean knight. I can now work for Altea and serve Prince Marth. So I've all the reason to be happy.|
4045|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Indeed. I'm happy too...|
4046|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|...... Ah, Kris. What are you doing up so late at night?|
4047|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|I can't seem to sleep. What about you, Katarina?|
4048|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|I... well... There's a lot on my mind, I suppose. ...Kris, have I ever told you about the town I was born in?|
4049|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Now that you mention it, you're never told me anything about your hometown. It wasn't Altea?|
4050|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|I was born in a town called Knorda. Have you ever heard of it? I... know it all too well. In Knorda, I was treated like an animal, beaten for fun. Whenever I couldn't stand the pain, I'd just close my eyes and think of nothing, taking refuge within my heart's confines...|
4051|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Katarina...|
4052|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|...But someone was there to save me. She showed me the meaning of life. I felt that I would do anything for her. Kris, do you have someone like that in your life?|
4053|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Yes. To remain loyal to a lord: that's the sort of knight I aim to be.|
4054|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Yes, that's right. You're also doing it for someone else... Not long now, is it...? It won't be long until we become Altean knights. When that happens... ......... Good night, Kris.|
4055|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Well then, time to get some rest...|
4056|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|U-um, Kris! I'm sorry, I forgot one thing... Please take this, if you would.|
4057|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|What's this? A headband?|
4058|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|It's from Cecil. "Give this to the new platoon commander," she said. Supposedly if you wear this, you'll be more... "psyched". Cecil really wants you to wear it.|
4059|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|So once I put this on, I'll have a hairstyle like Cecil's? But will being like Cecil really suit me?|
4060|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|I'm sure it would. Oh, I know! How about you just try it on? If you try it and it feels a little strange, you can just go back to your original hairstyle.|
4061|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Oh, good point...|
4062|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Well, how about it? Want to change your hairstyle?|
4063|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Alright, let's give it a try. It'll be fun becoming like Cecil.|
4064|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Wonderful! Cecil is sure to be stoked. I look forward to seeing your new look. See you tomorrow then, Kris.|
4065|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|No, let's stop here. My hairstyle is fine as it is.|
4066|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Oh, is that so? That's too bad. I was looking forward to see your new look, too... Ah, I'll go return this then. See you tomorrow, Kris.|
4067|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|Alright, let's give it a try. I'll try arranging my hair so that it's like Cecil's.|
4068|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Wonderful! Cecil is sure to be happy with your decision. I look forward to seeing your new look. See you tomorrow then, Kris.|
4069|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Kris|No, I think I'm alright. My hairstyle is fine as it is.|
4070|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue7|Katarina|Oh, is that so? That's too bad. I was looking forward to see your new look, too... Ah, I'll go return this then. See you tomorrow, Kris.|
4071|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Eremiya|So the Altean army has reclaimed Altea Castle. Master Gharnef is rightfully livid...|
4072|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Lady Eremiya...|
4073|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Eremiya|And yet, Eine. All you can do is stand there, doing nothing. Are you not ashamed of being alive? To die for my sake-- is that not the natural recourse?|
4074|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|...Yes...|
4075|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Eremiya|Eine, you are worthless trash. There is no value in your life. You're a child the world never wanted. Tell me, who was it that saved you? Who should you thank for allowing your wretched existence to continue?|
4076|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|It's all thanks... to you, Lady Eremiya.|
4077|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Eremiya|Kill them.|
4078|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|But... Lady Eremiya...! I... sniff...|
4079|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Eremiya|Silence, worthless puppet. You cannot defy my orders. That's what I've "taught" you since you were little. The words I engraved upon your then-young soul will remain there, forever.|
4080|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|...Sniff... sniff...|
4081|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Eremiya|O-hoh hoh! I'll use you until you break. My little puppet...|
4082|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|Katarina...|
4083|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Kris... Prince Marth...|
4084|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Marth|Katarina, if you have reasons, I would like to hear them. I'm sure we can settle this, without resorting to fighting.|
4085|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|...I'm sorry. I... I have no choice but to do this.|
4086|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|Katarina...|
4087|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Kris. I... had a dream. It was short... but it was a very happy dream. Kris, you and I... Both of us became Royal Guards... We saved many people, received many thanks... And then, the two of us... Kris... I... I'm sorry... I'm talking nonsense. There's no going back for me. ...Let us resume our battle, Kris.|
4088|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Kris... There's nothing left for us to say. You and I are enemies... Please fight me. If you don't, I'll kill you...|
4089|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|Katarina! Listen to me.|
4090|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Kris... Why? Why do you refuse to fight...? You must know that you'll die if you don't kill me... And yet, why do you hesitate...?|
4091|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|Because you're my friend.|
4092|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|...|
4093|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|You can't have forgotten: Our days training as knights... The times we fought together with Luke, Rody, Ryan and Cecille... "Together, we'd be an unstoppable team"... That's what you told me.|
4094|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Kris, that's a wonderful name. We're here for the same reason, then. My name is Katarina. I came because I wish to serve Prince Marth.|
4095|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Thank goodness... Kris, you won. I knew you could do it.|
4096|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|I... I'd like be a Royal Guard, if you're in with me.. Together, we'd be an unstoppable team... When I imagine a future like that, I feel very happy. ...Um, what about you, Kris? Do you, perhaps, feel the same as I...?|
4097|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|That was... That was all... a lie. Everything I did was to deceive you... It was all just a ruse... The truth is... I don't care about you...|
4098|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|If that's the case... Then why are you crying, now?|
4099|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|...I'm... not...|
4100|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|Katarina. You don't belong there. You want to fight alongside me, for Prince Marth. I'm certain of it.|
4101|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|It's... too late for that. I've committed too many unforgivable sins...|
4102|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|Then, you'll just have to start atoning for them. It won't be easy. Many people from both Altea and your organization will turn you a cold shoulder... But, I can promise you this. No matter what happens... I'll stand by your side.|
4103|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Kris...|
4104|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|Return to us, Katarina.|
4105|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|...Sob... sob... ...Kris... Kris... Kris...!|
4106|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|I am a puppet... I exist only to serve Lady Eremiya... My life has no value...|
4107|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Thank... you... ... Now I... won't have to hurt Kris... anymore... Kris... I'm... glad I could meet you... During those days of training... you showed me a beautiful, happy dream... Hey, Kris... Today's training... is about to begin... Look, there's Prince Marth and the others... Don't... wait for me... ... ...|
4108|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|...Prince Marth, I have committed many unforgivable sins. Please, hand me punishment... worthy of my crimes. Please execute me...|
4109|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Marth|Raise your head, Katarina. I have no intention of taking your life.|
4110|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|But... why? I don't deserve to live. Please let me atone with my death...|
4111|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Marth|That's no atonement. You're just running from your sins.|
4112|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Oh...!|
4113|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Marth|If you truly regret what you've done, then live. I want you to atone with your life, not your death.|
4114|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Atone with my life...? But, how? What should I do...? How could I even begin to atone?|
4115|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Marth|I cannot give you that answer. Until now, you've only followed orders, never thinking for yourself. But that's going to change now. You will think for yourself, and find your own answer. That is my punishment to you.|
4116|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Katarina|Prince Marth...|
4117|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Kris|...|
4118|FE12BookTwo|16x-Reunion|Marth|Kris... I've forced you to play a painful role. I won't forgive the villain who led her to this path. Let's go, Kris.|
4119|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Jagen|The 7th Platoon and its commander, Kris, are all present and accounted for, yes? From today forth, you will train together as a team in your bid to become fully-fledged knights. The first half of your training will focus on developing your practical skills. Without further ado, I will introduce the senior knight who is to be your instructor.|
4120|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Cain|I am Cain, the knight in charge of your practical training! To hone your practical skills, we will have a contest in the form of combat. If you let your guard down, it won't be just an injury you'll be walking home with!|
4121|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Jagen|Even amongst the Altean knights, Cain is one of our strongest men. You must all become strong enough to earn his approval.|
4122|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Cain|Well then, let's begin today's training! Your enemies will consist of us Altean knights, as well as brave warriors whom I am proud to call friends. The opponents are determined by the ability of each platoon. 7th Platoon, your opponent is...|
4123|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|My squires, my friends; please go easy on me.|
4124|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Katarina|Oh, it's Princess Caeda! Prince Marth's fiancee! She's so pretty... I feel nervous at the thought of fighting her...|
4125|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|Let us see if you've got the ability. Talys's mercenaries shall fight you first.|
4126|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|I see you know how to fight well. In that case, I will fight you next.|
4127|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|Fear won't help you; approach with confidence and the intent to fight.|
4128|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|You're a mercenary, aren't you...? Tee hee. This looks promising. Come, show me what you can do with your sword!|
4129|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|An armored knight... I'll be at a disadvantage with the way that I fight. But I won't lose so easily! Come, show me what you've got!|
4130|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|You're a cavalier, huh? Looks like you'll be a good match for me. Come, show me what you've got!|
4131|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|So you're a fighter, Kris? Of the lance and the axe, the axe is advantageous... I might be at a slight disadvantage, but I won't lose easily! Come, show me what you've got!|
4132|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|Kris, you're an archer!? The bane of us pegasus knights... B-but I will not sit idly by and lose to you! Show me everything you have!|
4133|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|So you're a mage, Kris? Pegasus knights are resistant to magic, you know. I'm not going to lose this one. Come, show me what you've got!|
4134|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|Kris, you're a myrmidon, huh? Teehee. I feel somewhat drawn to you. We should be friends from now on. But that doesn't mean I'll go easy on you in this fight. Come, Kris, show me what you can do with that sword of yours!|
4135|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|Well, well, Kris, you're a pegasus knight, just like me. Teehee. We have so much in common... But I won't go easy on you for this battle. You and your pegasus... Shall we take to the skies?|
4136|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|Ngh...!|
4137|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|That was a thrilling fight. You are the first squires to have bested me in combat. Promise me that you'll become knights worthy of helping Marth.|
4138|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|Of course, Princess Caeda.|
4139|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Caeda|If you ever need help during the practical training, do call on me. And I'll fight, but as your companion.|
4140|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|Hm? We'd gladly appreciate your help, but I'm not sure if we would be allowed to.|
4141|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Katarina|What should we do? I know, how about we ask Sir Jagen?|
4142|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Jagen|I have no qualms about your proposal. You may borrow the help of friends if they offer as much.|
4143|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Katarina|What a relief. I'm certain Princess Caeda will make a reliable ally.|
4144|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|But, is it really alright to rely on others? I don't see how this fits with our training...|
4145|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Jagen|Hmph. Don't tell me you're still in the dark about Prince Marth's method of fighting in the War of Shadows?|
4146|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|Yes, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar with the details.|
4147|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Jagen|Then I shall tell you. Our victory in the previous war was not just by merit of Altea. Gathering and fighting together with allies of various positions and statuses... This is how Prince Marth fights. No matter when an ally came to our side, they could instantly join the battle with us. That is also a necessary skill for an Altean knight.|
4148|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|I see... I understand now.|
4149|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Katarina|If we can combine our strengths when we fight, I'm sure we can achieve anything. Right, Kris?|
4150|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|Yes, you're right.|
4151|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|No, this I know. The League led by Prince Marth didn't just consist of Altea: It went beyond the frontiers of nationality, and included friend and foe alike...|
4152|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Jagen|Yes. Our victory was not just the accomplishment of us Altean knights. Overcoming status and position; being able to fight together as equals... That is how Prince Marth fights. No matter when an ally came to our side, they could instantly join the battle with us. That is also a necessary skill for an Altean knight.|
4153|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|I see... That will be important to our training. I understand now.|
4154|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Katarina|If we can combine our strengths when we fight, I'm sure we can achieve anything. Right, Kris?|
4155|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue3|Kris|Yes, you're right.|
4156|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Kris, we have been designated as members of the 7th Platoon. I'm glad we were grouped together.|
4157|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|As am I. Who else do we have in our platoon?|
4158|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|I'm Luke! Or if you prefer, you can call me Luke, the Paladin of Dawn!|
4159|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|I am Roderick. It is a pleasure to meet you. So, is that everyone?|
4160|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Ryan|U-um... I'm a new recruit, too. My name is Ryan. I'm an archer.|
4161|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|It looks like that's all five of us. Well, what's the plan for today?|
4162|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|There was an order from Sir Jagen. Today's mission is to decide who the new commander will be.|
4163|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|Luke, how should we go about this?|
4164|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Roderick, you wait at the back. I'll fight alone! It's just Kris and that kid, right? If that's all, I should be able to handle it. I'll show them my true strength.|
4165|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|You're at it again...? Fine, have it your way. But I think underestimating your opponent will get you into trouble.|
4166|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Commander? Gotcha! Well, I'll be commander if you guys all insist!|
4167|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|Nobody's insisting anything, Luke...|
4168|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Excuse me. I'd like to recommend Kris.|
4169|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|Katarina...?|
4170|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Kris is a really strong individual. And he didn't abandon me during the mock combat yesterday, even though I couldn't fight.|
4171|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Alright then, I challenge him! Kris, if you beat me, I'll cede the position to you.|
4172|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Huh? H-how has it come to this?|
4173|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|It's a challenge, man-to-man! Kris, you're not afraid to fight me, are you?|
4174|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Don't be silly. Kris won't lose to you.|
4175|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|So we'll decide with a battle. That'll let us know who's got the skill to be commander.|
4176|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|I'm sorry, Kris. That was selfish of me... But I couldn't stand hearing them make fun of you...|
4177|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|It's okay. When my grandfather trained me, he used to say the same thing. He said that the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting.|
4178|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Huh. Y-your grandfather sure sounds colorful... Anyway, our opponents are Luke and Roderick. It's been decided that Ryan will be on our team.|
4179|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Ryan|Y-yes. I'll do my best.|
4180|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Commander? Gotcha! Oh, what's that? Luke should be the one? Yes, I completely agree!|
4181|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|Don't make up our words...|
4182|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Excuse me. I'd like to recommend Kris.|
4183|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|Katarina...?|
4184|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Kris is a really strong individual. And she didn't abandon me during the mock combat yesterday, even though I couldn't fight.|
4185|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Alright then, I challenge her! Kris, if you beat me, I'll recognize you as leader.|
4186|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Huh? H-how has it come to this?|
4187|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|It's a challenge, man-to-man!|
4188|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|But I'm a woman...|
4189|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Well then it's a man-to-woman challenge!! Kris, you're not afraid to fight me, are you?|
4190|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Don't be silly. Kris won't lose to you.|
4191|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|So we'll decide with a battle. That'll let us know who's got the skill to be commander.|
4192|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|I'm sorry, Kris. That was selfish of me... But I couldn't stand hearing them make fun of you...|
4193|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|It's okay. When my grandfather trained me, he used to say something similar. He said the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting. Well, I'm a girl, but...|
4194|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Anyway, our opponents are Luke and Roderick. It's been decided that Ryan will be on our team.|
4195|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Ryan|Y-yes. I'll do my best.|
4196|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|As I thought, Luke couldn't win alone. I guess I'll have to fight, too.|
4197|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Guah...?! I-impossible... The future hero, Luke, defeated...|
4198|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|Urgh! I see... You are even stronger than I had imagined...|
4199|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Kris, I've heard rumors about you! Sir Jagen said that there was a recruit who stood out from the rest of us!|
4200|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|Is that so?|
4201|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Yeah, that's right! And I bet you're hogging all the attention, overshadowing the rest of us! I'll beat you here to prove I'm the best! Prepare yourself!|
4202|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Sorry, Kris, but I won't hold back just because you're a girl!|
4203|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|That's fine with me.|
4204|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|I'll show you what I've got! Kris, try not to fall in love with me!|
4205|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Kiddo, just stand back and watch! Only Kris is worthy of fighting me!|
4206|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|Kris, I've heard the rumors about you as well. I need to see your ability firsthand, especially if you're to become the commander. I ask you this, as a fellow squire of Altea.|
4207|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Thank goodness... Kris, you won. I knew you could do it.|
4208|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Alright, I'm a man of my word. I'll keep my promise. From here on, the commander'll be Kris. Gah, but I don't get it! I was so confident in my skills! How did I wind up losing?!|
4209|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Roderick|Because we didn't fight together. We took turns fighting Kris one-on-one. That's why we lost to him/her.|
4210|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Ryan|Yeah, my brother once said the same thing... Even if we are weak individually, we can become stronger by working together with our friends.|
4211|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|That's right. Fighting with your friends: That is the way of an Altean knight.|
4212|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|...I see. I thought I could be the victor through my strength alone. But I guess I was wrong. Fighting together is far more important...|
4213|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|Luke... I'm so glad. You understand now.|
4214|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Yeah, it's all clear to me! It looks like being the leader is more trouble than it's worth! So I'll leave this bothersome job to Kris! I'm sure it'll be a joy working under him/her! Kris, I'll be looking forward to your help!|
4215|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Katarina|...Does he really get it?|
4216|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Alright then, Kris! Now that you're the commander, how about I give you a cool title?|
4217|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|A title?|
4218|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Yeah. All the legendary heroes have their own awesome title! Hm, let's see... Looking at your eyes... It's got to be Kris the Ordinary!|
4219|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Kris|I don't really understand... Nor do I think it's something worth celebrating.|
4220|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue2|Luke|Aw, don't worry about it! Kris the Ordinary!|
4221|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Jagen, where are we? Macedon? Or Dolhr?|
4222|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Jagen|Both--we are precisely on the border. I hear this place is home to Macedon's great wyverns. But since the area is overrun with barbarians, even the Macedonian soldiers dare not set foot in here.|
4223|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|I see. You learn something new every day...|
4224|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|According to our scouts, a large number of wyverns and barbarians have gathered nearby. It's like Anri's Way... No, it's worse. Sire, please be careful.|
4225|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Got it. Let's go, Kris. I need to know what's happened to my sister and the others... I have a dreadful feeling about this.|
4226|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|There you are, Marth!|
4227|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|You're...!|
4228|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|Who are you?! A barbarian of this dale? Please stand back, sire.|
4229|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|It's alright, Kris. This is Ymir, another ally from the last war. When I met him, he was holding off an entire army to protect some villagers. He's a kind and brave man.|
4230|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|Yeah, the name's Ymir. I heard Marth was fightin' here and figured I'd come along too.|
4231|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|I-I see... How rude of me, Sir Ymir. Please forgive my insolence.|
4232|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|Oh, it's okay. My face is a bit on the scary side, I gotta admit. What's your name?|
4233|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|Ah, yes. I am the Altean Royal Guard, Kris.|
4234|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|Kris! What a name! It's a real pleasure to meet you.|
4235|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|Likewise.|
4236|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Young Man|On the other side of the mountains is a small hill, called the Dragon's Table. Recently, there have been eerie roaring sounds coming from there. Grandfather and the others are afraid a demon is about to awaken. You mustn't get to close to that place.|
4237|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Man|This is the Wyvern's Dale. Don't go any further. Otherwise I fear you'll be burnt to death by the wyverns.|
4238|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Prince Michalis!? What are you doing here? And you've suffered a grave wound. What happened?|
4239|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|...Marth... ...I have been waiting... for you...|
4240|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Huh!?|
4241|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|...Take this...|
4242|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|...! This is the Starlight tome. You're giving it to me!?|
4243|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|That's right... Gharnef... Only with this spell can he be harmed. I managed to take it back from his possession...|
4244|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Gharnef!? Where is he now?|
4245|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|The Dragon's Table... Ha... I was careless... I could be... Defeated by Gharnef... Marth... Good luck... I'm already finished. If Minerva is still around... Tell her to... In my place... Rescue Maria...|
4246|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|Michalis!|
4247|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|Your highness... I leave Maria's fate to you... Urgh.|
4248|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|............ Brother...? Could it be... Is it really you...?|
4249|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|...Minerva...?|
4250|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|Ah! You're wounded! I'll go get help!|
4251|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|Don't bother... This wound is beyond help. I'd rather you call for... Prince Marth. I have... something I must pass on to him.|
4252|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|The prince will be here soon. Hold on, Brother! I'll tend to your wound...|
4253|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|Heh... To think I'd need your help in the end... Guh... ngh...!|
4254|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|Brother!|
4255|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|Minerva... I have something to ask of you. Should I die... Give this tome to Prince Marth. This is as far as I can go... I leave the rest... to you...|
4256|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|B--Brother... Michalis...! No... This isn't like you! When did you become so weak!? The brother I knew was strong and noble... He always found his own way, never relying on anyone else... Do you hear me? I won't accept this! You're going to pass this on yourself, without the help of your younger sister.|
4257|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|Hmph... Am I being scolded now...?|
4258|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|Brother, listen to me... You cannot die here. You have to live...!|
4259|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|So this is the Dragon's Altar. The place where divine dragon Naga banished the earth dragons...|
4260|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Gotoh|Indeed. Medeus, the altar's guardian, could not tolerate the human race's atrocities against the Manaketes. Thus, he gathered the surviving dragonkin, forming the Dolhrian Empire. All to obliterate mankind. He was vanquished by Anri once and then defeated a second time by you. However earth dragons boast tremendous life force, and cannot be completely eliminated so easily... Even now, they sleep at this altar.|
4261|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|You mean to say they'll awaken?!|
4262|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Gotoh|Not exactly. Even sleeping earth dragons should not awaken for centuries or so. The next time Medeus awakens though, he will rise as a terrifying Shadow Dragon... No, wait...! Perhaps...? Yes, I see... So that's why Gharnef...|
4263|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|What's the matter, Lord Gotoh?|
4264|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Gotoh|Prince Marth. I have finally realized the reason why Gharnef kidnapped the clerics. He intends to use them to resurrect Medeus. To hasten the awakening of a dragon requires the life force of pure, maiden women. Knowing this, Gharnef kidnapped them.|
4265|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Marth|So that means Elice and the others are in this very altar?|
4266|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Gotoh|Indubitably... Marth, you must hurry. They are in grave danger! Medeus's awakening... is only a matter of time!!|
4267|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|Sir Ymir, please forgive me for earlier.|
4268|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|It's fine. I don't mind at all. It's rare to see someone like me anyway. But it's so warm dressin' like this. Why doesn't anybody else do this? I don't get it.|
4269|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|Oh, is it warm?|
4270|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|Yeah, it's great during winter. Hey! Why don't you try wearin' this for a change? It's a hat made from animal hide. Just wear it! You're gonna see how amazin' it is right away.|
4271|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|This is... Wow, it is a pretty great hat.|
4272|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|See, it fits you well. Do you want to wear it for a bit?|
4273|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|Yes, I'd love to.|
4274|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|Whoa! I'm so stoked you said that! It'll look great on you! No doubt about it.|
4275|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|Oh no, I don't think it suits me.|
4276|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|That so...? Too bad. But, oh well.|
4277|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Kris|I'm sorry. After you went to all that trouble too...|
4278|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Ymir|It's fine, it's fine. I don't mind at all.|
4279|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|Brother...... Brother... why...? Why here...? I--I never wanted to fight you...! I just wanted things to be like they used to... With you and Maria... Brother...... Michalis... Bro...ther......!|
4280|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|...Your tears... How long has it been since I saw them last...?|
4281|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|What...? M-Michalis?! Are you...?|
4282|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|I don't plan on dying in front of you, Minerva. I'd be an endless laughing stock. The Michalis you knew... would never die in a place like this. Am I right?|
4283|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|Brother...! Oh, Brother!|
4284|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Michalis|Hmph, don't get the wrong idea. You and I are still enemies... That will not change. The incompetence of your army sickens me, so you leave me with no choice but to help.|
4285|FE12BookTwo|21-TheWyvern'sDale|Minerva|Thank goodness... You've finally returned to your old self. I understand. Until the Shadow Dragon breathes his last, let us borrow your strength.|
4286|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Katarina|Kris, Prince Marth, this is it. Please watch your footing.|
4287|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Kris|It's pitch black. Visiblity's practically non-existent... We'll be in trouble if we have to fight.|
4288|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Katarina|The organization's children were raised in darkness... They have no heart or will of their own. They only move their limbs when ordered, like puppets...|
4289|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Kris|Katarina...|
4290|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Katarina|I'm... not like them anymore. Kris... I want to be of use to you. That feeling is mine and mine alone. Not just some order! But my own truest desire... My treasure. Let's go, Kris.|
4291|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Kris|Sire, this is it. Please watch your footing.|
4292|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Marth|It's pitch black. Did Katarina and the others really live here...?|
4293|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Kris|... It'll be difficult to battle in this darkness... Sire, please exercize caution.|
4294|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|The Altean army is here? Gosh, that junk puppet betrayed me... Who would have expected that she'd wrestle free from my control. But, I bet you didn't know this: There are many puppets here far superior to you, my dear. Come, my sweet little children. The bad men have come. Darkness is our friend. What our enemies cannot see, we can. Let them experience... the feeling of pure terror.|
4295|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|The Altean army is here? Oh, how wonderful. Come, my sweet little children. The bad men have come. Darkness is our friend. What our enemies cannot see, we can. Let them experience... the feeling of pure terror.|
4296|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|My children... were just trash in the end. They couldn't even dispose of this rabble.... It seems I have no choice but to show them how it's properly done.|
4297|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|My... children...|
4298|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Katarina|Lady Eremiya...|
4299|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|Oh my, if it isn't the broken puppet. I wonder... should I call you ungrateful trash or traitorous trash? But I must say, it's very brave of you to show your face in front of me again, Eine.|
4300|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Katarina|Meeting you again... crushes my heart. I'd rather die, frankly... But, if I can be of use to Kris, then I will not run away!|
4301|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|A junk puppet talking like a human being? The only word you're ever allowed to say is "yes". I'll make sure that mouth of yours starts working properly right away.|
4302|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Kris|Sire, we've seized control of the area. The assassins shall target you no longer.|
4303|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Marth|I see, thank you.|
4304|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Jagen|According to the villagers nearby... That woman called Eremiya used to be a kind bishop who looked after war orphans. But during the war, her orphanage was burned down and all the children killed... Ever since then... she changed.|
4305|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Marth|So she was yet another victim of the war? That does not erase her sins, but... 'tis truly a tragedy.|
4306|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Kris|However, at the very least there won't be more victims like Katarina.|
4307|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Marth|Indeed. That's my only comfort. Let us go, Kris! There are still things we must do.|
4308|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Kris|Yes, sire.|
4309|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Gharnef|...Bah! ...So you failed in the end... ...Eremiya.|
4310|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|Master... Gharnef... Forgive... me... For not... fulfilling your order...|
4311|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Gharnef|Oh, you don't need to apologize. The ritual to revive the Shadow Dragon shall soon begin. You and your underlings were useful enough, for capturing the clerics. Heh heh, it was worth the trouble casting that spell on you...|
4312|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|What? A spell... on me...?|
4313|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Gharnef|Yes, don't you remember? But of course. Poor, poor Eremiya. My spell stole that memory as well. Once upon a time, you felt grief. The corpses of the orphans killed in the war haunted your very existence. You wondered what you could have done so that they might have survived...|
4314|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|I... never wanted... to let those children die...|
4315|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Gharnef|And then, I told you. You had to make the children stronger. Twisted, yes, but they became stronger so they wouldn't die, just as you wanted. Well? Have you remembered now?|
4316|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|That's right, I... I made those children...|
4317|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Gharnef|Heh heh... Hypocrites like you and Marth disgust me. Despairing over the orphans' deaths, you fell all too easily under my spell. And then you gathered children, subjecting them to hellish training, just as I told you to. You watched the children cry and scream... and yet, you smiled... Heh heh, 'twas quite a sight.|
4318|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Eremiya|Ah... Ahh... ...Aaaaah... ...My... ...My... children... AAAAAAH!|
4319|FE12BookTwo|20x-DepthOfTheAbyss|Gharnef|Heh heh... Worry not, Eremiya. The despair you feel now is nothing. This world will soon be enveloped in the darkest despair... You had better look forward to it, Marth. Heh heh heh...|
4320|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|Kris, you should be aware that Lang is a general with high defense. To defeat him, you would do well to attack with magic or a special weapon like an armorslayer.|
4321|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Kris|Duly noted.|
4322|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|If you plan to defeat him with strength alone, you'd have to be extremely powerful.|
4323|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|Kris, your strength is simply tremendous. Against a blow from you, Lang's armor would crumple like paper. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.|
4324|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Kris|Yes sir!|
4325|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|Kris, your strength is quite impressive. You might just be able to defeat Lang. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.|
4326|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|Kris, you are, sadly, not very strong. But you could fight using your other talents. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.|
4327|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|Heh heh heh... So the Alteans have come. Reinforcements are arriving soon; if we can hold out a little longer, we can make a pincer attack. Swordsman Navarre. When they open that door, you make your move. There is no need for restraint; slice them to pieces!|
4328|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|Yeah... sure. Though the knights of Altea are hardly worthy enemies.|
4329|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|Oh-ho! That's my Navarre. They say not even Ogma of Talys is your equal.|
4330|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|What? Ogma?! N... Naturally... A guy like him is no match for me.|
4331|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|I see. Glad to hear it. Then I'll leave this place in your capable hands, Navarre!|
4332|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|Sire, there seems to be movement near the front of the castle. And it would appear to be moving towards our forces.|
4333|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Are they enemy reinforcements? Or allies to our cause...?|
4334|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|I do not know, but... I do hope they are allies.|
4335|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Frey|Sire!|
4336|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Frey! Thank goodness you're safe.|
4337|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Frey|You too, sire. Norne and I escaped from Altea Castle and we rode here as fast as we could.|
4338|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Norne|But the rest of our forces were scattered... I'm sorry we couldn't all make it.|
4339|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|You don't have to apologize, I'm just glad that you're safe. The others can take care of themselves.|
4340|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Frey|Sire. From here on we shall accompany you. Please give us your orders.|
4341|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Norne|Oh, and please be careful! I caught a glimpse of enemy troops approachin' the castle behind us. I expect they'll be enterin' the castle soon.|
4342|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Enemy reinforcements? I understand. Thank you.|
4343|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Caeda|Navarre, please hear me out! Lend your sword to our case, just once more!|
4344|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|What? Who are you? I'll have no business with women or children... But, there's a first for everything... (Whoa, she's smoking!) What business do you have with me?|
4345|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Caeda|...... Y-you're not Navarre! Who are you?|
4346|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Yikes, I've been exposed, huh? I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as Samuel. Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this famous "Navarre" swordsman guy. I got tired of it after a while, so I decided to pose as him and got myself hired. But I don't like this General Lang guy either. If you're alright with it, I'll lend you my sword.|
4347|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Caeda|Yes... You'll do just fine...|
4348|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Navarre... You bastard...|
4349|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|Stay away... This evening, my killing edge hungers for blood...|
4350|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Do you mean to kill me, no matter what? Hmph, very well. I knew that we'd have to settle our score eventually.|
4351|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Wait... Stay your blade! ...I'm no Navarre, I'm just a sham. I... it's me, Samuel. Have you forgotten, Ogma?|
4352|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Samuel?! Samuel, the gladiator from Knorda?|
4353|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Yes, I was a slave gladiator at the time, and you really helped me out. Even when everyone was making their escape, you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught...|
4354|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|......|
4355|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|I heard everything from my friends. How you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse. How, by chance, the young Princess Talys, tears in her eyes, stood up for you and saved you. And that's why you swore your blade to Talys. Or rather... to the princess...|
4356|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Ogma|Enough... Say no more! No more. It's in the past now... No more...|
4357|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|...Ogma... Anyway, I want to repay you! I'm following you from now on, okay?|
4358|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Navarre|I pity your soul. But I can at least grant you a quick death. Take this! My killing edge!!|
4359|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Samuel|Doh, I shouldn't have said that I was Navarre...|
4360|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|W-wait, please! I'm sorry... Please forgive me... I've only done as the Emperor ordered me to. I didn't agree with him, but I had no choice. So... so please, s-spare my life... I'll do anything you say. Yes... Just like this... Mwahaha! You shouldn't have let your guard down! You fool... Now die!|
4361|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|Urgh... Impossible... I have been defeated...|
4362|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|General Lang, I have--with my own eyes--witnessed a number of your crimes. I cannot forgive you. But if you have something to say, I will listen.|
4363|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|S-silence... silence! You damned country-boy prince! You're a fool for coming here! Just die already!|
4364|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Is that your answer? Then prepare yourself!|
4365|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|Y-you! You're that impertinent little girl/boy from before...!|
4366|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Kris|Lang! You have oppressed countless people, and insulted my liege. You can only atone for these sins with your life!|
4367|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Lang|W... Why you!|
4368|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Lord Wendell! Thank goodness you're unharmed.|
4369|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|Lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned. Even though I told him that I must fulfill a mission assigned to me by Archsage Gotoh...|
4370|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|A mission from Lord Gotoh?|
4371|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|That's correct... You have seen the "Starsphere"--the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface. In order to pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil, Lord Gotoh created a sacred spell named "Starlight" from that orb.|
4372|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|Unfortunately, the strain on the Starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards, which scattered into the sky. Lord Gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power, and that if even one of them is lost, the world will fall into irreparable ruin. By any means possible, we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the Starsphere.|
4373|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Is... Is this a joke? That the world could just end... This is all very hard to take in. But aren't these the star shards? If so, we already have a few. After we retake Altea, we'd be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs.|
4374|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Wendell|Of course... Your country was only just invaded by the Empire... I understand, Prince... I too shall fight to restore Altea, then. Thinking about it, my meeting with you is like a sign from Lord Gotoh himself. In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate. But, please, let's stop by the Fane of Raman. We may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple.|
4375|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Understood. If it's the Fane of Raman, we can go there on our way to Altea!|
4376|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|General Lang has been defeated. And now the people of Grust no longer have to suffer.|
4377|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Kris|That's right, sire.|
4378|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Kris, since leaving Altea, we've had a great deal of fights... Looking back at them now...|
4379|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|None of our companions were hurt and none of them died. That's what I'm happiest about. Kris, it's because you've been here. Thank you so much.|
4380|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|It couldn't be helped, but... Some of our comrades were injured or passed on. I don't want to lose anyone from now. I know we can do it if you're there. Kris, please, help me.|
4381|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|All I remember is seeing our companions fall, one by one... Enough! I don't want any of our comrades to suffer that pain. Kris, please, help me.|
4382|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|Sire, some new information has come in from the patrol. Just ahead, the enemy seems to be preparing some kind of ambush. It's not the Archanean Empire, but likely, I fear, mercenaries hired with coin.|
4383|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Mercenaries, is it...? Do we continue as we are or take a longer, safer route? Personally, I'd rather not detour. We have to return to Altea as soon as possible.|
4384|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Jagen|Hmph, if you would allow me to speak as your tactician... I think we ought to stay here and fight. We will be facing mercenaries. The Altean knights would never lose to mere mercenaries.|
4385|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|Kris, your thoughts?|
4386|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Kris|I agree with Sir Jagen.|
4387|FE12BookTwo|06-TheNestOfVice|Marth|I see, thank you. Jagen, Kris! The whole army shall move on as they were. We'll hit the mercenaries head-on!|
4388|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|Welcome! Today, another hero will be born. One who will help decide the world's fate... What's your name, hero?|
4389|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|Are you a boy, or a girl?|
4390|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|What's your occupation?|
4391|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|And what do you look like?|
4392|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|I shall now predict your journey using your past, present, and future. Beginning with your past, what sort of circumstances were you born into?|
4393|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|And what about you now? What is your most impressive attribute?|
4394|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|Finally, your future. What kind of future trait do you strive to attain?|
4395|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Anna|With everything now complete, let us begin your story posthaste...|
4396|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Eek!|
4397|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|Hey, are you okay?|
4398|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|I-I'm sorry. I was in a hurry, and... Excuse me, did you come here to become an Altean knight as well?|
4399|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|Yeah. I came here all the way from Sera village when I heard they were recruiting new knights. My name's Kris.|
4400|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Kris? That's a nice name. We're here for the same reason then. My name is Katarina. I came because I wish to serve Prince Marth. But there sure are a lot of hopefuls here. Look, there's one over there and another there...|
4401|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Luke|Here it is! This is where my shining legacy starts! The first chapter of my epic saga to become Altea's greatest knight!|
4402|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Roderick|...Luke, I'm going up ahead.|
4403|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Luke|Hey, wait up, Roderick! Don't leave your partner behind!|
4404|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|There's no doubt those two were knight candidates like us.|
4405|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|We should follow them, Kris. I think the leader of the knights, Sir Jagen, has something to say to all of us.|
4406|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|Altea's gates have opened today so that we may test you as potential knights. Knights will be chosen by their ability, not by their blood. The path is not easy, however. We have gathered a hundred men and women today, and only a handful of you will succeed.|
4407|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|T-this is nerve-wracking.|
4408|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|I'm nervous too, but I've been training hard for this day.|
4409|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|We expect every one of you to show us the results of your arduous training! Apprentices, I want you to gather in pairs! You will be facing real Altean knights in mock combat!|
4410|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Huh?! We have to fight? T-this could be a problem... Kris, would you please partner with me? I'm training to become a tactician.|
4411|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|A tactician?|
4412|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Y-yes. I can give you advice on how to fight, but I can't fight at all...|
4413|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Soldier|Hey, you two! You're up next. Grab your weapons and get into position. Hurry!|
4414|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|Got it! Let's go, Katarina! The test is about to start.|
4415|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Y-yes! Let's do our best.|
4416|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Kris! Let's move to that spot over there.|
4417|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Soldier|So you made it to the right place. I'll be your first opponent. Attack me whenever you like!|
4418|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|...I'm your final opponent for the day. Don't hold back!|
4419|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|Excellent. Show me what you've got!|
4420|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|Urgh... I've been beaten?|
4421|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|Phew... we won, somehow.|
4422|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|Yes... splendid work! I see we can expect much from this year's apprentices.|
4423|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|You did it! We won, Kris! ...But I didn't really do anything... It was all thanks to you that we won, Kris!|
4424|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|Prince Marth wishes to address everyone who passed the test. Sire, if you please.|
4425|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Marth|I humbly thank you all for coming.|
4426|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Ah, it's Prince Marth! He looks so majestic. So that's the face of the hero who saved the world. I love the stories about Prince Marth in the last war. How about you, Kris?|
4427|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|Of course. After all, Prince Marth was the hero who brought an end to the previous war.|
4428|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Yes, he defeated the Shadow Dragon and Dark Pontifex, restoring peace to the world.|
4429|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Jagen|You there, silence! You stand before Prince Marth!|
4430|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Eep!|
4431|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Marth|Everyone. I'm truly happy that so many came to help shoulder Altea's future. With the war over, peace has returned. However, peace isn't something we can simply take for granted: It is my duty, as ruler, to risk my life to protect it. Alone, I am powerless. So, everyone. From now on, I want you to lend me your power, as my knights.|
4432|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Hear hear, Prince Marth! It was wonderful hearing Prince Marth speak, wasn't it, Kris?|
4433|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Kris|Yes, it was. We have to do our best so he can rely on us.|
4434|FE12BookTwo|00-Prologue1|Katarina|Let's keep at it together!|
4435|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Kris, we'll be arriving shortly. This is your first real battle, is it not? Battles will be different from here on out. Defeat on the battlefield means death. Any allies you lose will never return... That is the harsh reality of war. You must take the utmost care not to get yourself killed.|
4436|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Kris|Of course, sire.|
4437|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|You, and everyone else... It would be wonderful if we could end this battle without losing anyone...|
4438|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Kris|Sire...|
4439|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|Sire, we have made arrangements for a transport convoy. We will also have merchants accompanying us, who will sell us weapons and items. I daresay they will be invaluable during battle preparations.|
4440|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Thank you, Jagen. Then let's begin our preparations at once.|
4441|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|Sire, this is General Lang, the commanding officer of the occupational forces.|
4442|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Oho, so you are Prince Marth? Glad you could make it here. Since you've come all this way, I suppose I'll let you have the glory of capturing the rebel leader, General Lorenz.|
4443|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|What?! General Lorenz leads the rebels?! What would possess him to rebel of all things?!|
4444|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Who knows? I haven't the foggiest idea, and frankly I don't care. Prince. You are to kill General Lorenz, and reclaim the children of the Grustian royal family that he's hiding. While you do that... We will slaughter the families of those who participated in this rebellion and raze their homes to the ground.|
4445|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Are you insane?! They're innocent civilians!|
4446|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|"I-insane"!? Young man, are you questioning my orders?! Perhaps Altea, too, plans to rebel against Archanea...?|
4447|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Of course not! That's not...|
4448|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Prince Marth, your tiny country means absolutely nothing to me. Your rude behaviour is merely an irritation. Do not forget that I have the power of the empire behind me: I can crush weak, pesky insects like you any time I wish.|
4449|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Jagen... What in the world is going on here? How could Hardin have entrusted this country to such a vile man?|
4450|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|Sire, I understand how you feel. However, Lorenz has begun a rebellion. That much seems to be true, so we ought to do something about that first. Sire, why don't you try speaking to General Lorenz personally? Allow me to stay by your side and serve as your tactician. Royal Guard Kris! When Prince Marth is in danger on the battlefield, protect him at all costs. That is an order!|
4451|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Kris|Acknowledged.|
4452|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Kris, I have no need to worry if you're here. Let's clean up the bandits, and head to General Lorenz's position!|
4453|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Kris|Yes sir!|
4454|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|After the last war, Princess Nyna let this country keep its sovereignty under the rule of General Lorenz. However, as soon as Hardin became emperor, General Lorenz was banished and Lang's troops came crawling in. Lang stole everything from us. He stole our gold, of course, but he even stole our food and our loved ones... Ah... If only General Camus were here! Then we wouldn't have to live in fear of people like Lang!|
4455|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|There aren't any young girls left in this country. They were all taken away by the imperial troops. They say General Lang keeps the really pretty ones to himself. What a dark, insane chapter in Grust's history...|
4456|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|The late King Grust had two children. Princess Yuliya and Prince Jubelo. They're still young. Maybe thirteen, or fourteen; cute little twins, both of them. In the last war, Gharnef, the Dark Pontifex, kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king. They were taken to Khadein, the city of magic, and locked away in a pitch-black room. At great personal risk, Pontifex Wendell saved them. He took them to a monastery to protect them.|
4457|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|General Lorenz took the royal children from Lord Wendell and raised them in Grust. The empire demanded their extradition, but Lorenz was afraid they would be killed, and hid them. The empire branded Lorenz a traitor, and sent General Lang here. Lang did horrible things to find the royal children. That's why we rose up. But, we lost. And now Lang is going to kill everyone in this entire country!|
4458|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|I heard that General Lorenz lived in Talys when he was young. Talys wasn't unified at the time, so there were a number of noble houses contending for control. Lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch of one house, and together they unified Talys into one country. Lorenz and that patriarch--now the king of Talys--remain close friends to this day.|
4459|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|I only saw him briefly, but that knight, Arran, looked awfully pale. You know, he's probably hit the wall, so to speak. I doubt he'll get any stronger, no matter how much he fights...|
4460|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|Oh... Please, show mercy to just this child. She's only ten years old.|
4461|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Ma'am, please calm yourself. I am not here to take any children.|
4462|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|What... You're not imperial soldiers?|
4463|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|No... We're not. We didn't come to fight. If there's anything you need, please ask. It's not much, but we can give you food.|
4464|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marisha|Wait... Please, take me with you...|
4465|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Huh...? You're... Are you really ten?|
4466|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marisha|No... I'm a grown woman, but Granny lied so that I wouldn't be taken away by the soldiers. Lang's soldiers are all monstrous. But you're different. You have very sweet eyes. Please, take me with you. I want you to take me away from this country, and take me to yours.|
4467|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Villager|It's not safe for her to stay here. Please take her with you, and protect her. You can marry her, too, if you like. Marisha is a beautiful, good-natured lady, just like me! I'm sure she'll make a fine wife.|
4468|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marisha|No-no-no! Granny, it's far too early for that! Now you've made Marisha all flustered!|
4469|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Bandit|Oh? A battle, is it? We're in luck, boys! Let's loot 'em villages before 'ey realize what's hit 'em!|
4470|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Alright, that will do for now... Sir Ogma, please forgive me for getting you involved in this mess.|
4471|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|I am here on King Talys's orders. As such, I will do everything in my power to help.|
4472|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|I see... Then I have a favor to ask of you. I want you to escort these children to Macedon. These children... Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya, are King Grust's orphans. Please. Take them safely to Lord Wendell in Macedon.|
4473|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|Understood... I will guard these two with my life.|
4474|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Thank you, Sir Ogma... Now, Prince Jubelo, Princess Yuliya, you will be leaving with Sir Ogma.|
4475|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|No! I'm not going! I won't leave you behind!|
4476|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Princess... I cannot go. With this wound, I can barely even walk. It saddens me, but you two must go on without me.|
4477|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|You took that grievous wound to protect us... How can you tell us to just leave you behind now?! I will never leave. We will never leave your side, Lorenz!!|
4478|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|What shall I do, General?|
4479|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Hmm... this is most troublesome. Princess Yuliya is not one to change her mind easily... We will remain here.|
4480|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Ogma|In that case, I will find some other way to help you. I will find Lang and bring him down... I will bury him with this sword, I swear on it. General Lorenz, you must hold out until then...!|
4481|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Prince Marth! So it is you... How unfortunate, that I must fight... the Altean army and its prince...|
4482|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Please, wait. I do not wish to fight with you. I heard about everything from the villagers. I've heard of all the atrocities Archanea has committed. I promise, I will inform Emperor Hardin of the truth and rescue Grust. So please, lower your weapons.|
4483|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Prince... I am grateful for the offer. But, I am afraid that I cannot comply. Prince, you know nothing. Do you think that a man of Emperor Hardin's caliber would make a general out of a man as worthless as Lang without good reason? He called for an invasion: to crush the kingdom of Grust and make it a territory of the Empire.|
4484|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|No, it can't be! Hardin would never do something like that.|
4485|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|I know it's hard to believe. But I'm afraid that, ever since he became emperor, he has changed a great deal. He is no longer the Hardin you once knew. Prince, I have one final request of you. In this stronghold, I am protecting the young prince and princess of Grust. Please, find a way to help them. If you can do just that, I will have no regrets.|
4486|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|What... General Lorenz, what are you saying...?!|
4487|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Prince Marth... My life in exchange for theirs... By any means necessary, please help them... This is the last thing I will ask.|
4488|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|General Lorenz!! ......This can't be happening......|
4489|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|What?! You're... the Altean army?! So even Altea has turned on us...|
4490|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lorenz|Forgive me, people of Grust...|
4491|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Elder|Prince Marth... General Lorenz entrusted everything to you. You spared his life, and even heard him out. We, the people of Grust, thank you. Please, let me offer you a token of our gratitude. Here. We're protecting Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya in this stronghold. I beg you, do what you must to protect our last fragments of hope...|
4492|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|You, you're... Grust's royal heirs... Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya?!|
4493|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jubelo|Sniff... Lorenz... He's gone... How can we live on without him?|
4494|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|You monsters!! Stay away! You're going to murder us just like you murdered Lorenz!!|
4495|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|No, you have it all wrong!! We just...|
4496|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Ah... Prince Marth. You finally caught these filthy traitors.|
4497|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|General Lang! Wait, please! These children have done nothing wrong. Allow me to take custody of them.|
4498|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Don't make me laugh. These brats are coming with me to my castle. Besides, my dear prince, you have other, more important, priorities. I have received reports that there has been a military revolt in Macedon, and Princess Minerva has been imprisoned.|
4499|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|What...?! How could that happen to Macedon?! I understand my obligations, General Lang. Still, these children... Let them stay with me, please.|
4500|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Lang|Prince, do not try my patience! Listen up you two! You're coming with me!|
4501|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Yuliya|No, let me go!! Jubelo... help me!!|
4502|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jubelo|Yuliya... Yuliya...!!|
4503|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|Wait!! Lang! Release them at once!|
4504|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Kris|Sire! Give me the order, and I'll get them safely back at once!|
4505|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|Sire, don't do it!! You too, Kris! If we oppose Lang right here, right now, we run the risk of being branded traitors by Archanea.|
4506|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Marth|But Jagen, are you telling me to simply allow Lang to take them?! I cannot stand for that...|
4507|FE12BookTwo|01-TheGrustianExpedition|Jagen|I understand how you feel, sire... But please remain patient for a little longer. If we head to Macedon... then rescue Princess Minerva, Macedon will surely lend us its strength.|
4508|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Kris, if we can get through this pass we will be on Archanea's doorstep. Just hang in there a little longer.|
4509|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|Yes, sire.|
4510|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Despite all the odds, we've surpassed Anri's Way and taken back Altea... The battles we've faced up to now... have been nothing short of difficult. And in those battles...|
4511|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|We've managed to keep everyone alive. With the strength of all our comrades, we can accomplish something worthy of Anri... I'm so proud of everyone.|
4512|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|Sire......|
4513|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|It's thanks to our friends that our country is free; I cannot help but think of the fallen. I want to become stronger for them. From now on, let's live so that no one falls again...|
4514|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|Sire......|
4515|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|...The feeling of pain overwhelms me. When I think of the severely wounded, and the many who have fallen... Perhaps if I had been stronger like Anri, then everyone would still be alive... From now... From now on, I will definitely...|
4516|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|Sire......|
4517|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|Wolf, Sedgar, Vyland. Is this really okay...? Can we really fight this battle?|
4518|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolf|Roshea! What are you trying to say? Look, the Altean army is marching long the narrow mountain road. Now's our only chance to defeat them.|
4519|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Vyland|Yes, Roshea. We swore that we could sacrifice our lives for Lord Hardin. Lord Hardin was the one who freed us plains people from slavery. If we don't fight Altea now, Millennium Court will fall. Do you want Lord Hardin to be defeated by them?|
4520|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Sedgar|That's right! Prince Marth wants to destroy Archanea, and conquer the world. And that's why he joined forces with Macedon to crust Grust. Now he even has Gra under his rule. If we don't do something, the whole world will fall under his control.|
4521|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|I still don't believe it. I cannot believe Prince Marth would have such ambitions.|
4522|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolf|What? Are you saying that Emperor Hardin lied? Do you think that he would stoop to such a low!? Enough, Roshea!! You disappoint me, if you want to betray us then go ahead. Sedgar, Vyland, let's go. If we're too slow, they will pass us.|
4523|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|Hey, wait! I won't betray you. I understand... I'll go.|
4524|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|The Wolfguard of Aurelis! Must we fight them as well...?|
4525|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|Sire, please hold on. We've just received word from a messenger of King Aurelis. It seems Aurelis has no plans to war... According to the messenger, King Aurelis wishes to parley with you in the village.|
4526|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|What? What could this mean? That the Wolfguard is moving independent of Aurelis's orders?|
4527|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|I don't know, but... Depending on how negotiations go, it's possible the Wolfguard may signal a retreat.|
4528|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|I see. It would benefit us all if we could avoid pointless fighting. Let's hurry to the village!|
4529|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|King Aurelis|Oh, Prince Marth. It is good to see you.|
4530|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Huh, aren't you King Aurelis?! What are you doing here?|
4531|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|King Aurelis|I came here to stop my country's army. Also I must apologise to your highness. I believed Hardin's words and followed Archanea, but I now realize my wrongs. Archanea's Empress Nyna secretly sent me a letter, saying that Hardin isn't normal and is ill... My country will remain neutral, and its knights will return to Aurelis. I hope you won't attack my men anymore.|
4532|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|I understand, your highness. I don't want to fight with you. Please forgive me for taking so many of your knights' lives.|
4533|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|King Aurelis|Oh! You really are like what the rumors say. My body is frail and I have no children, and even Hardin, my younger brother, has completely changed. Prince Marth, please protect Aurelis in my place. I will hand my whole country to you. I give this jewel to you as a gift. This is a magical jewel containing the divine power of life. I spent a lot of gold to buy it from a travelling merchant. I believe it will be useful to you. Don't worry about Hardin. Since he is a knight, it is natural for him to die in battle. That is his fate. Well, Prince Marth, I will go on ahead. I hop you will all be safe...|
4534|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Roshea|I am Roshea of the Aurelis knights. I don't want to fight, but I can't betray my companions. Please forgive me...|
4535|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Vyland|As long as we're here, we won't let you get to Millennium Court. If you don't want to die, run back to your country!|
4536|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Sedgar|You... Why are you invading other countries? Have you been blinded by ambition?|
4537|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolf|The leader of Aurelis' knights, Wolf, is here for your head!|
4538|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Wolfguard|Lord Hardin...|
4539|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Kris, we've made it through. The palace is not far. I have only you to thank for this. You do nothing but help me.|
4540|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|No, it's not like that. It was your decision, sire. I just came up with the idea.|
4541|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|That's hardly the whole truth. The times when I'm lost in my thoughts, if you're there, I have confidence. I'm thankful for that; more than anything.|
4542|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|Sire, we've just received urgent news. Apparently a coup d'etat broke out in the palace. The knights and citizens who opposed Emperor Hardin's ways rose in rebellion.|
4543|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|What in the blazes?! What has happened to them now?|
4544|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|Unfortunately, the instigators were all defeated and captured... Rumor has it that the rebels are being executed by the day.|
4545|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Damn it, Hardin... This is absurd. It's decided. We will head for the palace at once and end this. Kris, let's go!!|
4546|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|Yes, sire!|
4547|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Kris, we've made it through. The palace is not far. I have only you to thank for this. You do nothing but help me.|
4548|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|No, not at all. I just made a random suggestion.|
4549|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|That's hardly the whole truth. The times when I'm lost in my thoughts, if you're there, I have confidence. I'm thankful for that; more than anything.|
4550|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|Sire, we've just received urgent news. Apparently a coup d'etat broke out in the palace. The knights and citizens who opposed Emperor Hardin's ways rose in rebellion.|
4551|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|What in the blazes?! What has happened to them now?|
4552|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Jagen|Unfortunately, the instigators were all defeated and captured... Rumor has it that the rebels are being executed by the day.|
4553|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Marth|Damn it, Hardin... I can't believe it. It's decided. We will head for the palace at once and end this. Kris, let's go!!|
4554|FE12BookTwo|18-BattleOfThePass|Kris|Yes, sire!|
4555|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Kris... The final battle is nigh. Medeus awaits us up ahead. It won't be an easy battle... I dare not imagine how many of us will be left standing at the end... Either way, the fate of this world rests on our hands...|
4556|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|Sire... Worry not, sire. We will emerge victorious. That's what the fortune-teller said.|
4557|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Fortune-teller?|
4558|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|When I was a child, I asked our village's fortune-teller for a reading... The old lady held the palm of my hand, and said to me... "Ah, your fate is clear to me, child."|
4559|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|And? What did she say?|
4560|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|She said that I would "grow up to be a legendary hero..."|
4561|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|She said that I would "live out my life quietly..."|
4562|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|She said that I would "follow my calling like an arrow..."|
4563|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|She said that I would "devote my life to the service of others..."|
4564|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|She said that I would "be stupidly rich and famous..."|
4565|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Oh...? I can imagine that happening...|
4566|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|And she said that I'd live until I was a hundred years old...!|
4567|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|'Til a hundred...? That is an awfully long time... Oh, I see...! If the fortune-teller was right, then...|
4568|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|Then we are definitely walking out of this hall victorious. I'm not quite that old yet... So, rest easy, sire.|
4569|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Haha, you're quite right. I... feel much calmer now. Thank you, Kris...|
4570|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|I see my sister and the others... But who are they guarding...? No, it can't be... That's--that's Medeus...!|
4571|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Jagen|With the princesses around him, sire, you'll be unable to strike down Medeus. If we don't do something soon, then the other dragons will awaken, and this battle will rapidly escalate into mayhem.|
4572|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Then, what do you suppose I do? How on earth can we save them?! Tell me, Jagen!|
4573|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Jagen|I... I do not know... But, if we are to defeat Medeus, we must stop at nothing...|
4574|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|What?! ...You can't mean to kill them?!|
4575|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Jagen|It may be... necessary. As they are now, they suffer greatly. We must save them, even if it should cost them their lives...|
4576|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Jagen, this--is this really a decision I must make?|
4577|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Jagen|You are Altea's crown prince, sire. A ruler must be ready for anything, though it may cost them their happiness. That is all.|
4578|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Enough, Jagen. I understand. Still, I cannot accept it. There must be another way. Even till the very end, I will never give up!!|
4579|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Jagen|Kris, I know how Prince Marth feels. Please, I beg of you... Please find a way to save them.|
4580|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|Understood. I will try my best. But if the occasion should arise... Even if Prince Marth himself refuses, I shall release them from their misery... But for now... I don't want to think about it. I still want to hope.|
4581|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Jagen|Kris......|
4582|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Julian|Lena, snap out of it! C'mon, it's me! Julian! What's wrong with you, Lena? I know I'm a good-for-nothing scoundrel, but for you, I'd do anything. I don't want anything else-- I just want to see your smile again. Hey, Lena; could you smile for me? Please...|
4583|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Lena|Oh... Julian...? You came. I knew you'd find me. I knew it. That's why, I could continue struggling in the darkness of my soul... Julian, I'm sorry. I've always been a bother to you.|
4584|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Julian|Are you kiddin' me, Lena...? I'm just happy to hear your voice again.|
4585|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Lena|Julian, there's something I'd like very much. Will you listen?|
4586|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Julian|Huh? Sure, Lena, hit me. So long as it's within my power...|
4587|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Lena|Could you call me... "honey"? You're always "Lena" this and "Lena" that. You speak as though we're barely friends-- and I don't like that feeling. That just won't do, especially not after we settle down together in Macedon.|
4588|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Julian|Huh? ...What're you talking about, Lena...? Er... I mean... H-honey... Don't tell you and I are gonna...|
4589|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Lena|Uh-huh... I'm sure God will forgive me. After all, you... You mean the world to me.|
4590|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Minerva|Maria! Please, wake up! It's me, Minerva! What's happened to you?! Get a hold of yourself.|
4591|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Maria|Unh... Ah... Minerva... A-ahhhhhh! Medeus is...|
4592|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Minerva|Shh. It's alright now. Everything's going to be okay. I'm so sorry, Maria. I've left you alone for so long...|
4593|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Maria|Minerva... I was scared... I was so scared... Oh! How is Michalis? I think he fought Gharnef to save me.|
4594|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Minerva|Michalis... is fine. Don't worry, Maria.|
4595|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Maria|Really? Then, once we go home, we'll be together again just like before? I'm so glad, Minerva! Oh, I hope we can see him soon.|
4596|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Minerva|Maria......|
4597|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|Ahh... I've done something terrible. I was too foolish... I hurt Hardin... I drove him to despair.|
4598|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Sirius|My queen... Prince Marth has ended Hardin's suffering. The Emperor loved you till the very end. He was sorry for what he'd done to you. It's alright now. You need not worry. It was all just a bad dream...|
4599|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|...... Who......? Oh...! You're... Camus...?! Camus!! Why... Why are you... This is a dream, isn't it?|
4600|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Sirius|Nngh! ...My queen... You are mistaken... I am Sirius, a soldier of the allied forces. I know not of this Camus...|
4601|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|Sirius...?! ...It can't be... No! You're wrong!! You're...|
4602|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Sirius|Please, calm yourself; you must be exhausted. I must depart soon. Queen Nyna, listen to me... You should head to Prince Marth.|
4603|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|You... Where are you going?|
4604|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Sirius|I must go to my country. There's... someone waiting for me.|
4605|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|Is... Is that so...? I see... Sirius... Thank you. I am most grateful.|
4606|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Sirius|...Forgive me...|
4607|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|Pardon...?!|
4608|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Sirius|No... It is nothing... Now, Queen Nyna; go!|
4609|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Merric|Princess Elice! It's me, Merric. Snap out out of it! I--I studied magic ferociously, all so that I could protect you... I'm sorry... I failed. I couldn't be by your side, when you needed me most. Elice... Please. Please open your eyes!|
4610|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Elice|Merric...? ...Ah! Oh, Merric! Help me... Gharnef is... I'm so frightened... Please help me!|
4611|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Merric|Elice! Thank goodness, you've come back! It's alright now. I'm here, so... Oh... but Prince Marth is... Everyone's watching, so we can't... Oh well... *ahem* Elice, I'll never leave your side again. No matter what may come between us... Never again shall I abandon you!|
4612|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Elice|Forgive me, Marth... I've been such a burden.|
4613|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|We're all safe now. We're free of the Shadow Dragon's power.|
4614|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Maria|Prince Marth! Finish him off!|
4615|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Lena|We will heal the wounded, so that no one else shall die...|
4616|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|Sire, good news. The princesses have come back to us. Your kindness has saved their souls.|
4617|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Thank goodness. I'm too happy for words. I suppose some battles require sacrifice... But that matters not... I won't give up--not now, not ever! Together, we will win this battle!|
4618|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Medeus|YOU PRESUMPTUOUS HUMANS... HOW DARE YOU--!|
4619|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|Shadow Dragon Medeus! Now, nothing stands between this blade and you. Come, let's settle this!|
4620|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Medeus|I HAVE... REVIVED... FOOLISH HUMANS... I WILL LEAVE... NONE ALIVE...|
4621|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|||
4622|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|||
4623|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|||

4625|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Medeus|DO YOU PLAN TO... DEFY ME ONCE MORE... DESCENDANT OF ANRI...?|
4626|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Marth|No matter how many times you return, mankind will never surrender! This long battle... I will end it here, once and for all!|
4627|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Medeus|A MERE HUMAN SUCH AS YOURSELF... WISHES TO CHALLENGE ME...? HOW FOOLISH...|
4628|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Kris|I have come this far, just for this moment. My death means nothing, for Prince Marth will create a bright future for us all...! As long as I have that hope, I'll fight on. I'll come at you with everything I've got!|
4629|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Elice|WE WILL KILL ALL... WHO DEFY... LORD MEDEUS...|
4630|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Maria|WE WILL KILL ALL... WHO DEFY... LORD MEDEUS...|
4631|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|WE WILL KILL ALL... WHO DEFY... LORD MEDEUS...|
4632|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Lena|WE WILL KILL ALL... WHO DEFY... LORD MEDEUS...|
4633|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Maria|Ah, Minerva, sister...|
4634|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Nyna|Camus... Save me...|
4635|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Elice|Ah, Merric...|
4636|FE12BookTwo|24-LightAndShadow|Lena|Ah, Julian...|
4637|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Sire, the war council will begin soon.|
4638|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Thank you, Kris... Huh? Wh-what happened to your hair...?|
4639|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Sir Xane did it for me. He said that a legendary power would enter me if I wear this tiara. And this hairstyle complements it. Anything to become stronger...|
4640|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|...L-legendary power? Oh, Xane's handiwork, I see. He can certainly be a handful...|
4641|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Soldier|General, the missing Altean remnants have finally returned.|
4642|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|Really? Haha...! What good timing. We will follow our original plan. Have Gra's soldiers move out to lure them and then defeat them in one go.|
4643|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Soldier|Understood, but, what about "him"?|
4644|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|The paladin, Abel? It doesn't matter if he betrays me! If he does, you will kill the female hostage!! He has already retired from the army. He won't swear loyalty to the prince again. Ha ha...! How will they avoid fighting Abel...? This will be very interesting to watch...|
4645|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Dolph|Prince Marth, I have been waiting for you. And you have finally returned.|
4646|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Oh! Dolph! You're a general of Archanea, though; why would you come to my side?|
4647|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Dolph|I've given up my position and have left Emperor Hardin's side. There is no justice left in Archanea. But justice lies in your Altea. And that's why I've come to you.|
4648|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|I see. Then Dolph, will you fight with us?|
4649|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Dolph|Indeed I shall. Let this battle be a testament to my faith in you.|
4650|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Abel!? Why are you... I don't believe this, you're betraying your homeland!?|
4651|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Lord Marth... Please forgive me... They took Est... If I didn't fight... They would kill her. ...But after meeting your highness, I can no longer... fight... against Altea... Est... I'm sorry, please forgive me!!|
4652|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Est|Abel... I’m sorry, you must have suffered.|
4653|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Est!! You’re safe.|
4654|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Est|Yes, Lord Marth rescued me. I’m alright now.|
4655|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Really...? Damn, Archanea... But how should I apologize to Lord Marth…?|
4656|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Est|I’m sorry... It was all because of me.|
4657|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|No, Est! It was nothing to do with you!! Those fools... I won’t forgive them... I’ll show them how deep my anger is!!|
4658|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Old Man|In the forts are many enemies. Don't be careless.|
4659|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Woman|Oh, you... Where did you all go to? You all went missing for so long that everyone became very worried about you.|
4660|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Man|The Kingdom of Gra views Altea as its enemy. But, in reality, they were forced to fight because of their alliance with Archanea.|
4661|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Woman|After Altea fell, Elice was taken to an unknown place by a black-robed bishop... Oh... Princess Elice... I pray that you are safe and well...|
4662|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Woman|Since being ruled by the imperial army, our days have been difficultly passed. But, we all believed that Lord Marth would definitely come back for us. He would rescue us all from our suffering... Because, our Lord Marth is the warrior of light chosen by the deities... the Starlord!|
4663|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Man|Nearby are enemy spies. Be careful! They will come from the forts.|
4664|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Young Man|The mercenaries protecting the castle are Altea's elites. It would be great if they could become your allies.|
4665|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Man|Oh, your highness, you've finally come. I have been waiting, to give this to you. However this village and the neighboring village...|
4666|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Mmm, I understand. But, for the sake of everyone, you should start to make up with them...|
4667|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Your highness... Please forgive me... I don't want to lose Est...|
4668|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Abel|Est...|
4669|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|What! Being able to defeat my great army. Are you even human?|
4670|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Eibel|My Archanea army could be defeated...?|
4671|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|That was quite a battle. Is everyone alright?|
4672|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Jagen|There's no need for concern, sire. Everybody has eagerly awaited this day.|
4673|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Sir Jagen speaks truly. We've been fighting for this day-- the day we reclaim our homeland.|
4674|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Yet, because of Archanea's actions, so many innocent lives have been lost. How can I face them...? I've caused them great sorrow. Because I was too weak... Was I presumptuous in believing I could protect my homeland?|
4675|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Sire... Do you remember, sire? The words you said to us on the very first day of our training?|
4676|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Kris...... Of course. I could never forget......|
4677|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Alone, I am powerless. So, everyone. From now on, I want you to lend me your power, as my knights.|
4678|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Upon hearing your words, I decided that I would work hard, so that I could be of assistance to you, sire. I want to become like you. There is no need for you to shoulder everything on your own. Your pain, and your suffering... They are not yours to bear alone. I will always be by your side.|
4679|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Kris......|
4680|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Jagen|Sire, chin up! We must still recapture Altea Castle. I believe that our enemies are well prepared for us, but it is our castle. We know it better than they do. Sire, give us the command! We will fight to recover our home!!|
4681|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|That was a tough battle. Is everyone alright?|
4682|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Jagen|Don't worry, sire. Everybody has eagerly awaited this day.|
4683|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Sir Jagen speaks truly. We've been fighting for this day-- the day we reclaim our homeland.|
4684|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Yet, so many innocent lives have been stolen by Archanea. No apology is worthy for them... I've caused them great sorrow. Because of my unreliability... Was I presumptuous in believing I could protect my homeland?|
4685|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Sire... Do you remember, sire? The words you said to us on the very first day of our training?|
4686|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Kris...... Of course. I could never forget......|
4687|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Alone, I am powerless. So, everyone. From now on, I want you to lend me your power, as my knights.|
4688|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Upon hearing your words, I decided that I would become your strength, sire. I wish to be your sword. There is no need for you to shoulder your burden alone. Your pain, and your suffering... Do not let them be yours to bear alone. I will always be by your side.|
4689|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Kris......|
4690|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Jagen|Sire, chin up. We must still recapture Altea Castle. I believe that our enemies are well prepared for us, but it is our castle. We know it better than they do. Sire, give us the command! We will fight to recover our home!!|
4691|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|By the way, Kris, About your tiara... Did it work? Did you feel the, er, legendary power?|
4692|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|No, I didn't feel any different.|
4693|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|As I suspected... Kris, I believe Xane pulled a fast one on you.|
4694|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|I-is that so...?|
4695|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|In light of this, would you like to return your hair to the way it was before?|
4696|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Kris|Yes, thank you.|
4697|FE12BookTwo|15-ReturnOfThePrince|Marth|Good, I'm glad we've sorted that out.|
4698|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Kris, we've returned at long last. We're back where it all began...|
4699|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|Yeah. It's a curious feeling. It feels like yesterday that I first stepped foot here and yet it seems so far away...|
4700|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Yes, I remember. When you first arrived here for training, you had no experience of battle. And now...|
4701|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4702|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4703|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4704|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4705|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4706|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4707|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|How disgraceful... Thieves inside our fair castle? What if they've stolen the Geosphere?|
4708|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking thief making his way north. We should capture him before it's too late.|
4709|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|Sire, if you'd allow me the honor, I will go. Your orders, please.|
4710|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|How disgraceful... They let thieves inside the castle? What if they've stolen the Geosphere?|
4711|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking thief making his way north. We should capture him before it's too late.|
4712|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|Sire, if necessary, I shall recover it. Your orders, my lord!|
4713|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Macellan|Prince Marth. Please, hold on.|
4714|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Macellan! Did you come here with Dolph?|
4715|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Macellan|Correct. Dolph and I are going to be your reinforcements. Archanea has nothing left for me. For the justice that I believe in, allow me to fight by your side again, Prince Marth.|
4716|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Soldier|Lord Willow, permission to open the door and attack?|
4717|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Willow|Wait. Don't be so hasty. Inform me as soon as any of the chests in the treasury are opened. We will sortie the moment that happens. Both the thieves and the Alteans will want their greasy hands on the loot. While they're busy trying to unload the chests, we will take that chance and attack. Heh heh... This is a battle of intellect, not brawn. Don't forget! Attack when the chests are sprung!|
4718|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4719|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|||
4720|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|You foul traitors! Taste the might of my Mercurius!|
4721|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Midia...|
4722|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Astram, how are you doing?|
4723|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|So it's the traitor, Jeorge. What do you want with me?|
4724|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Wait, Astram. General Eibel has already fallen. You won't be able to win even if you continue fighting.|
4725|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|You want me to surrender...? Never! Even if I am the last one standing. I am a warrior of Archanea to the end!!|
4726|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Why are you... Who are you fighting for? Are you fighting for Emperor Hardin?|
4727|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|No! It's not because of that man, but because of Nyna... And for Archanea!!|
4728|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|But, did Nyna tell you to fight here? Do you really think that Nyna would hope for this kind of battle?|
4729|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Well... I hadn't seen Nyna for a while. I was told that she fell ill, and that I couldn't see her. But... Since Hardin is Emperor of Archanea, I have no choice. If I don't follow his orders I will become a traitor, and I will be betraying Nyna.|
4730|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|Astram, Nyna already entrusted the Emblem to Prince Marth. Do you understand the meaning of her actions?|
4731|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Wh-what!! When did this happen, Jeorge? Nyna requested Prince Marth for help?|
4732|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jeorge|I believe that is the only explanation. Astram, if you want to find out the truth then come with us... If you die here, what will Midia do? You must live on, for her. You must live on, so you can confirm with your eyes what is happening.|
4733|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Astram|Hmm... I guess I have no choice. But, Jeorge. If this war is as Hardin said, and was caused by Prince Marth's ambitions. I will never forgive you! Remember that!!|
4734|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Willow|Hahaha... It's time for me to show you... The destructive power of my Meteor magic...|
4735|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Willow|Emperor Hardin, forgive me...|
4736|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|Sire. It's over.|
4737|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|At long last, Altea is ours once more.|
4738|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|We've all the reason to be happy. But is there news of Elice...?|
4739|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|Sire. We have routed the enemy.|
4740|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|At last, Altea is ours once more.|
4741|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Yes, it's a wondrous feeling. But is there news of Elice...?|
4742|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|Prince Marth... Can you hear me? I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but it would seem that Princess Elice has been kidnapped by Gharnef.|
4743|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Lord Gotoh... Do you speak truly?!|
4744|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|I have found out that Gharnef commanded his priests to search for clerics of noble birth. It is most likely that Lena and your sister were spirited away by Gharnef.|
4745|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|It can't be! What does he intend to do with them!?|
4746|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|That, I do not know. But something foul is on the cards. There can be no doubt of Gharnef's involvement in this series of unfortunate events.|
4747|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Lord Gotoh! Where is Gharnef now?|
4748|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Gotoh|I believe Princess Nyna is his next target. He is probably... at Archanea's palace.|
4749|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|I understand. Then I too shall go to Archanea. I still have to free Hardin from the Darksphere's influence. I will defeat the Dark Pontifex Gharnef, and rescue my sister--no, I'll save all of them!|
4750|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Hello Kris. It's been too long since we last spoke casually in Altea Castle. This place holds a lot of memories for you, doesn't it? Your long days of training... Not to mention you met Katarina here...|
4751|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Katarina|I-I'm sorry. I was in a hurry, and... Excuse me, did you come here to become an Altean knight as well?|
4752|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|............ Ah! Sire...... Please be careful.|
4753|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Kris?|
4754|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|I sense the same enemy presence... as that time. They may already be close...|
4755|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Sire! We're under attack! It's the assassins!|
4756|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Begin preparations for a counterattack immediately!|
4757|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Hello Kris. It's been too long since we last spoke casually in Altea Castle. This place holds a lot of memories for you, doesn't it? Your long days of training... Not to mention you met Katarina here...|
4758|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Katarina|I-I'm sorry. I was in a hurry, and... Excuse me, did you come here to become an Altean knight as well?|
4759|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|............ Ah! Sire...... Please be careful.|
4760|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Kris?|
4761|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Kris|I sense the same enemy presence... as that time. They may already be close...|
4762|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Jagen|Sire! We're under attack! It's the assassins!|
4763|FE12BookTwo|16-ReclaimingTheCapital|Marth|Begin preparations for a counterattack on the double!|
