marth and the others once again moved out from altea and headed towards the imperial capital of millennium court but along their way they passed through the kingdom of gra a land allied to archanea in the previous war gra sided with the dolhr empire which resulted in their king jiol dying in battle and the destruction of the kingdom the country was once a part of altea but they sided with archanea after listening to hardins orders hardin found king jiols daughter princess sheena and allowed her to ascend the throne and he then ordered reinforcements from gra sheena received wild support from the citizens of gra to them sheena was their only hope the youths all volunteered to become soldiers they were happy to move out and have the chance to defeat their bitter enemy altea but their dreams were shattered in an instant  before the fast approaching altean elites gras soldiers lost all morale and fled for their lives
gras army is renowned for its mighty armor knights and generals the late king jiol  our enemy in the last war  was a general himself
i see an army with strong defenses 
in the past yes i hear that gras army now consists of new recruits hardly worthy enemies speaking of strong defenses kris 
your defense is truly overwhelming only a fool would dare approach you even gra at its prime could not compete with your defense this battle has already been decided
your defense is quite impressive no man in gra could match your defense this battle has already been decided
erm your defense  could do with a little more work this is quite worrisome kris the enemies may be new recruits but dont underestimate them
princess sheena it seems the altean army has arrived
really  its already the end samson i have brought you much trouble i need to watch the final days of my kingdom of gra you may leave now
princess isnt it already enough shouldnt you despise king jiol for forcefully taking your mother isnt that why you hid at millennium court and stayed away from this country right now you are just being tricked by hardin and being used by him
perhaps i heard that the people of gra wished for the restoration of the country and thats why i agreed to help him however hardin is only interested in using us he would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him still i will not leave how can i just abandon those fighting for my sake
impossible  how can our fresh recruits resist alteas elites  fine if youre staying i will also stay to the end this could be interesting
samson  why are you doing this arent you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold i no longer have money to give you 
i dont know why either its just  sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do also i want to see how that kid fights this battle if he truly is a hero perhaps your mind may be changed 
what  what have you done  i believed you altea i trusted you  how dare you  ill kill all of you
prince marth  how unfortunate i thought you a better man
what  what have you done  i believed you altea i trusted you  how dare you  ill kill all of you
hardin sent troops here to prevent gra from rebelling the archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight
princess sheena is the child of king jiols second wife but she is different from the king she is a very kind person the princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers is there no way to save her
the soldiers here are all foreigners theres nobody else to protect this country because the knights of this country all died right now the actions of the archanea soldiers are deplorable their just the same as thieves  those lowlifes
ah  please leave me i already have nothing to give you
ah please dont get us wrong we arent here to steal
but didnt you all come here from altea for revenge
no we dont want to fight gra because gra and altea were originally like one family
is that true  then i will give my most important treasure  to  you
you are princess sheena its great to see you safe i dont view gra as an enemy gra and my country were originally one country the country may have divided after anris death but we always got on well as allies but in the previous war i felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did princess sheena please allow us to be friends once again i dont want to fight gra
prince marth  once i heard that you didnt attack my fleeing soldiers i was really surprised you truly are the second coming of king anri i trust you please  treat the citizens of gra  as if they were your citizens i will hand my whole country to your care  prince marth
thats great sheena now i can finally leave without worry
samson  can you not leave 
you dont need me anymore from now on prince marth will protect you
dont leave i dont want you to leave 
huh what why keep me it doesnt seem like you  fine if you say you need me i wont go anywhere else i will protect you wherever you may go is that fine with you
yes 
prince marth ive been waiting for you im tomas an archanean soldier  or was ive since retired from the army the archaneans here just want to sacrifice the defenceless gra soldiers this act of brutality by my former homeland  i cannot tolerate please prince marth let me fight with you in some way
you  you dare treat my citizens like that  die
forgive me citizens of gra
prince marth  i thought you were a noble person but youre just a murderer  you disappoint me
sheena 
sire to keep fighting like this is pointless all we are accomplishing is buying hardin more time
my thoughts exactly if we continue like this more blood will be spilt for naught kris do you have any sort of plan
according to our information the enemys primary force is concentrated along the highway i wonder if we can avoid that route by passing through the mountains
hmph wed have to cross adria pass  but the steep mountains make it dangerous for an army of our size
thats true and i fear the enemy may have prepared an ambush as well our bravery could be our undoing but it is the fastest possible route if we could just break through there wed be in walking distance of the palace
i am prepared for the danger we managed to conquer the same perilous road that anri walked compared to that  jagen kris we can overcome this challenge order the advance
oof  seems ive finally caught up
hmm and you are
my name is frost i am a priest of macedon when macedon was taken over by those warmonging rebels  you came and saved our country thanks to you my familys now safe i have come to return the favor
i see but hasnt it been some time since prince marth freed macedon 
your army marched at speed and this old geezer just couldnt keep up eventually i lost sight of you  but then i heard that marth had freed altea as well and i finally managed to catch up with you here in gra i am old now but i can still fight please allow me to to join you
/***EOF***/
soon after reclaiming the fane of raman marths army fears pursuit from the archanean army and escapes towards chiasmir bridge however a new enemy attacks the altean army upon reaching the central islet
the archanean army is coming from the north well be surrounded like this
the situation is desperate can marth and his friends overcome the many perils
huh kris whats with the hat
this lord wendell gave it to me so that my cold wouldnt get any worse
from lord wendell i see  chiasmir bridge has a strong sea wind so its good to have a hat to keep warm it suits you kris
really thank you sire
sire youre safe kris you too youve guarded prince marth well
sir cain you made it
im truly glad that you came back unharmed cain
yeah somehow i managed to shake off the enemy and escape here but the enemy is already approaching from the north
dont worry we will crush them
no not this time hardin is being protected by a mysterious power we cant lay a finger on him so even if we fight him now we havent a chance of winning please head to the northwestern fortress theres a boat across the river which we can use to escape to the khadein desert
sire the free company to the south will probably make their move soon indeed nows not the time to fight for the time being lets do as cain suggests and make our escape after that well think of something 
i see  i dont like it but we havent a choice  everyone hurry to the northwest fortress
if ya ask me archersll always get along well with archers
oh look if it isnt prince marth long time no see lad it seems so noisy out i wonder whats happened
ah bantu fancy meeting you in a place like this how is tiki
oh she is no longer by my side lord gotoh took her to the ice dragons temple again
the ice dragons temple wheres that ive never heard of such a place 
its in the icy lands far north of here but its no place for humans besides the hero anri no man has been there yet
anri are you perchance referring to the realm of the gods from anris legends
im not at liberty to say anything more if you want to know more you should ask lord gotoh anyhow i have a favor to ask of you my precious firestone was stolen by thieves if you can get it back for me ill show you how it works thank you prince marth
 hasten the preparations of the troops within the fortress i want marth cornered like a rat 
heh heh heh  prince your struggle is in vain but let us continue this game for a while just know that youre fast running out of time soon i will kill you myself 
heh heh heh  prince marth its been far too long
hardin  why did you attack our country what would compel you to do such an act i  i cant believe this have you really changed this much
prince i am the ruler of this continent and the emperor of archanea i will show no quarter to anyone who opposes me that includes you prince  i must destroy this foul world  it is beyond salvation traitors playtime is over you will all die here all soldiers attack do not leave a single traitor standing
good day sir
ack you y youre  caeda
thank goodness roger its nice to see you again
uh  uhm you should know ive no plans to betray archanea i was just thinking about that time when you asked me do you believe in love but im different from who i was back then
really but you still seem like a nice man thats why i wanted to speak with you again
uhh 
may i just ask why are you fighting for archanea
be because archanea has already taken over the world resistance is futile no one can win my life is precious to me if i side with whoevers stronger then im guaranteed to live longer 
i see
a are you disappointed with me
no never as i thought youre fighting for what you believe in youre not different youre the same kind man as when i first met you and im happy for that
uhhh  wait  youre leaving
yes i too must fight for what i believe in but ill make a request to marth so that we dont have to fight you im happy that we could talk again roger
w wait  as i thought youre still very kind dare i say we dont have girls quite like you back in grust or archanea um perhaps  i suppose i could  aw heck im going with you again
wait sir jeorge i wish to speak with you
prince marth  please lower your weapon i dont want to fight you
i know as do i you taught gordin how to use a bow and you were an instructor to the junior knights of altea youve been a great boon to altea i could never fight you sir jeorge
prince  i pledge allegiance to princess nyna but i can tolerate hardin no longer  taking other countries by force executing rebels without reason 
 hardin was my friend but he has changed beyond recognition if he is committing any sort of crime then i shall stop him jeorge please help me
 i understand prince to return the kingdom of archanea to what it was once before  i will take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland
master please wait
hm  gordin long time no see you seem to have gotten a little sturdier but has your bow arm improved any
yes at the moment i  they call me alteas master of bows its thanks to you master that ive been able to progress this far
and did you come here because you wanted to challenge your old teacher
n no its not like that   i might be asking the impossible but id like you to fight alongside us again sir
  
please master
i pledged allegiance to princess nyna but as for hardin  ive had it with him taking other countries by force executing rebels without reason the archanean army i see now is just a collection of hired thugs theres not even a shred of chivalry left to return the kingdom of archanea to what it was once before  i must take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland gordin convey that to prince marth
thank you master
i dont want to fight you guys but its not as if i have a choice 
ugh  i just wanted to meet her  once more  once more 
you traitors ill show you the might of mercurius
midia  my love 
you wouldnt have needed to die if you hadnt come so close fools 
what fools 
rebel soldiers  come to die have you ill show you the terror of gradivus
prince marth ill bury you with these very hands
who are you your face is unknown to me
kris i am prince marths royal guard emperor hardin of archanea the prince told me you were once a trusted friend why would you do something like this
kris is it  what does it matter to you you will die here regardless
who are you your face is unknown to me
kris i am prince marths royal guard emperor hardin of archanea i never knew you in the past but i do know this you are now the princes enemy
you may come kris but no one may even scratch me you will soon know to fear  the power of the darksphere 
please hurry sire the enemy is closing in on us
but everyone is still fighting i cant just leave them behind
worry not sire i will remain here i will regroup with everyone later
kris but 
sire you of all people know that kris is more than capable as long as kris is there everyone will escape safely and reunite with you at once now sire to the boat
i will be the rear guard everyone hurry up and escape lord wendell you too
oh right i just remembered i should probably return this hat 
oh yeah i just remembered i should probably return this hat 
i dont mind if you keep it for a little longer do you wish to give it back
yes thank you it was most comfortable
no no twas nothing  by the way should i be hurrying too
erm  yes hurry up and escape
no  if its all right with you id like to hold on to it a little longer
yes that would be splendid  by the way should i be hurrying too
erm  yes hurry up and escape

those guys are so carefree but i suppose i can start slacking off as well
indeed i too can finally  return to my eternal sleep 
thank you kris for protecting and supporting me no amount of thanks would be enough but among the people your deeds are being told as things ive done alone  that just will not do once we return to the castle ill 
if you allow me sire  i have no need for a name i dont want stories to be told of me
kris 
sire with this war now over a hero will be needed a hero called prince marth there are still hostilities between people who have fought for so long those wont disappear easily in order to have everyones agreement a king everyone recognizes   a godlike hero is needed and that hero must be you sire and you alone
but then what youve done so far will be 
even if the world doesnt know you do sire and thats enough for me i shall stay by your side i shall be your shadow
kris  youre   why i wonder ever since we met i felt a special connection with you fate sent you to me  i cant help but think that thank you kris please stay with me kris youre my other half my true friend 
thus the long tragic battle that would later be called the war of heroes finally came to an end the seven kingdoms were unified under prince marth of altea and as the united kingdom of archanea was established an era of peace began the tales of the heroes who took part in this war brought excitement and tears to the later generations chronicles of the archanean war of heroes this is a story of love and courage about the young warriors who fought with the continents fate at stake

marth and his friends follow xane marching towards the northern lands before their eyes are walls of towering mountains sheer cliffs and deep valleys  after passing countless mountains they are assaulted by scorching heat magma flowing like a river and rumbling like thunder blocks their way truly a dreadful scene as if straight out of a nightmare
this place  its incredible  i feel as though im burning up just by standing here
this is flame barrel  the fire dragons graveyard its where the fire dragons whove degenerated into savage beasts come to wait for their death
degenerated you say  what do you mean by that
im not sure if youre aware but the dragon tribe is dyin those who dont confine their true dragon form in a stone eventually lose all reason and become monsters
so thats why they become manaketes xane if you know something about the dragon tribe please tell me
if you really wanna know  tens of thousands of years ago the dragon tribe settled down on this continent and created a civilization they possessed intellect and abilities far exceedin those of humans but suddenly outta nowhere their day of destruction came at first they couldnt bear children then they began to lose their minds goin berserk one after the next the elders warned that the end of dragons as a species was approachin there was no longer any way to prevent it however there was one way they could survive to discard their identities as dragons and live on as humans the dragons fell into a panic those who believed the elders sealed their forms within stones and became humans but those who couldnt throw away their pride as a dragon those who adamantly refused to become human  they eventually lost their minds and became naught but beasts 
those fire dragons before us 
yeah theyre a livin example and its not just them there are many others but theyve all gone feral now theres no way for them to go back  worse still theyve been manipulated and degraded like cattle by the fire clans who rule over this valley well princey whadya say we get out of here the clansmen around here aint friendly if we hang around well end up as bait for their dragon pets
darros what brings you here i thought you had washed your hands of your pirating days 
prince marth  forgive me i was lookin tstart anew but there be no place tgo for an outcast like me  to resume and continue these crimes tis dishonorable indeed
i see  darros you cannot stay here come with us
prince marth  ye would still accept a fool like me  prince i  this time i be changin for sure me life is yours
please forgive me i never wanted this
of course  course id die  for what ive done 
phew and that be the end of the fire dragons valley how you doin princey
im fine  i think xane i believe you said that there were other feral dragon tribes
yeah in addition to this valley theres the wyverns dale the ice dragon shrine and the dragons altar 
the dragons altar
its a dragon graveyard in the mountains of macedon there the earth dragons sleep a long time ago  thousands of years ago in fact  the mighty earth dragons lost their minds and attacked the humans course the humans barely stood a chance most were annihilated and the rest pushed into the desolate corners of the continent and then  the divine dragon naga strongest of them all waged a war for humanity it was a fierce battle but naga emerged victorious in the end and sealed the earth dragons below dolhr in a deep sleep and so that the power of the seal would not wither she created the shield of the five orbs and placed it in the fane of raman
i see  i understand now in other words our guardian deity naga depicted in legend was the divine dragon that saved humanity but then what about the divine sword falchion
naga took pity on you humans with no way of protecting yourselves so she created it from one of her fangs then together with the shield she sealed it in the fane and had the remainin dragon houses watch over humanity she put the newly born tiki to sleep and thus ended her 5000 year life cause of all this gotohs tryin his best to carry out nagas order
wait xane  are you telling me 
yes gotoh is a divine dragon and guess what so am i
blast  this heat is absurd i wasnt sweating this much in the desert  im usually tolerant of heat but this is simply unbearable  but kris you seem 
you seem  unfazed are you not hot
i have confidence in my strength sir jagen it seems that our companions are catching up to us ill go and carry them over here
what strength  its as though youre invulnerable your reliability is astounding
you seem to be struggling too  are you holding out alright
yes ive still some strength in me sir jagen it seems that our companions are catching up to us ill go and support them
good im depending on you
you seem a little dizzy  are you holding out alright
no  i im  not doing so well  still  if i could just use my strength  oh no i feel all weak 
kris are you well oomph how troublesome  youd best hold onto me
i im sorry 
please pardon my sudden rudeness but might you be prince marth
who are you 
i am belf and these men here are robert and leiden we rushed here because we wish to join your battle
we were once knights of the sable order of grust but we have now separated from our homeland
we threw away our ranks as knights and now live to protect those who are powerless
the sable order of grust  but in the previous war we fought against the sable order as enemies despite that youre willing to join our army
our general wished for us to protect the weak regardless of nationality he is gone now so we would like to fulfill his final wish
     i see you seem to speak truly very well id like you to fight alongside us

marth was unable to reunite with princess minerva and so in order to help ogma and the grustian royal children he decided to visit wendell who was once the childrens guardian

yes that er  was correct  yesterday a group of archanean soldiers suddenly came and took the pontifex away although prince  he did leave his magic tome behind i believe its wind magic please take it with you
well if it isnt castor what brings you to a place like this

castor  thats a bit much  its only natural to help someone in need
no prince marth youve done so much for me i want to help you please let me fight alongside you you have my life at your disposal
gahahaha wont be long now til my boys hidden in the forts all spring out n attack i can almost see the precious looks on their bewildered faces
and just who the hell are you are you in league with the pirates
i am sirius a mere traveler
oh i see im a little bit worked up right now sorry about the mix up
those children 
im taking care of them do you know them
no i dont  but i do know that as things stand you wont escape with them as i understand it the altean army should arrive here provided you reach the southern village please allow me to distract the bandits while you make your escape to safety
i see so prince marth is here eh got it thanks ive got to ask though why help a group of complete strangers like us
i want to save the children that is  all
i see  sirius  you said your name was sirius right lets meet again after we both get out of here theres someone i need to take care of  the guy in charge of grusts occupation commander lang i want to avenge a man named lorenz  you  join me  if ive got you on my side then ill be that much stronger
yes  that would be interesting but first you have to survive hurry and go
touch me and ill strike you down
how foolish of me 
im sorry  i wasnt thinking gahaha just kidding ill be smashing your pretty head in
i wont  forget this
marth
caeda did something happen why are you here
marth  altea  altea was attacked by the imperial army the archanean league  gra and aurelis ambushed us our forces were annihilated and we lost the castle 
wh what did you say this cant be happening altea is 
damn our homeland has fallen to the enemy 
this is terrible beyond words  that which i feared the most has come to pass emperor hardin likely heard langs story and had us branded traitors
i refuse to believe it hardin would never attack altea youre telling me that he believed lang and truly thought that i wished to instigate a rebellion never
no i agree with you sire this attack was too soon it happened far too quickly for an attack of this scale a great number of preparations had to have been in place it is likely  that the grust campaign was a setup as was the situation in macedon its quite simple really they had you leave altea with your elite knights in tow and then proceeded to attack our weakened defenses hardin had this planned right from the start
thats preposterous are you implying that hardin  with no provocation whatsoever  decided to attack his fellow nation are you seriously suggesting this was all an elaborate trap no i wont accept it  hardin  why
sire  princess caeda what of the others is princess elice safe
elice she  she gave herself up in order to let me escape with this message marth  im so sorry she wanted me to warn you no matter what  sniff 
caeda  dont cry i understand just knowing youre safe makes me happy i should be the one apologizing i shouldnt have left  you neednt have to go through this we will take back altea even if we have to fight hardin we will reclaim our homeland
oh by the way kris about that hairstyle of yours  have you decided to keep it that way
 do you think it looks funny well itll grow back eventually if i leave it alone  do you think i should return it to normal
well its your decision to make you should do as you please so what will it be are you going to go back to the hairstyle you had before
yeah ill have to apologize to father wrys later but i think ill change it back to normal
yes i do believe that would be a good idea
no its alright im quite fond of my new hair  or lack of it rather
i is that so well if thats your wish then i can hardly complain

once upon a time the region of macedon was a territory under dolhrian rule a century ago the dragonkin rulers sent many slaves to these wild forests to excavate ruins and build a country many slaves were forced to work to their limits barely fed and then slaughtered
a young man stood up against such tragic conditions iote was his name he and his companions fled to the forests and fought astride wyverns to free the slaves after dolhrs demise the slaves established their own country in these now abundant lands and the hero iote was chosen as their first king and so was born the kingdom of macedon later feared as the domain of dracoknights
however the might macedon was stripped of prince michalis said to be the second coming of iote and is now on the brink of losing princess minerva the so called red dragon
hah hyah
i see you train without the need for sleep most admirable kris
ah sir jagen
a strong offense and a tough defense are obviously important but  you cannot afford to neglect your skill without the skill to deliver it it matters not how mighty your attack is if it does not reach the enemy speaking of which 
your skill is like that of an expert  i have nothing to add keep up the good work
thank you sir jagen
your skill is not bad dont fall behind the other knights the experience you gain from training and combat will help elevate your skill further be ever diligent
yes sir jagen
your skill is still insufficient  it ought to be better than this you may or may not have the talent for it but dont give up  the more experience you gain from training and combat the more you can refine your skill be ever diligent
y yes sir jagen
julian good news catria finally brought the altean army for us were going to join their ranks to help save princess minerva please take lena and escape to safety quickly
no can do palla lenas disappeared  im not leaving by myself

anyway im staying in the village to see if i cant find any information sorry palla give my best to prince marth
this is just between you and me but i heard that armory is in league with the rebels if youre going to enter you should be careful not to get jumped
i wonder whats going to happen to macedon they say that prince michalis is dead and princess maria is nowhere to be found  on top of that they say that princess minerva has been captured and that her life is in peril i just hope  that this country doesnt end up like grust 
you know a little while ago a paladin came here said he was on a journey he was wearing a mask but im sure that underneath he was a good person he was kind yet wrapped in a veil of sorrow i wonder if ill ever see him again 
the pegasus knight trio must be lonely without est and i was such a fan of their triangle attack too  oh est  come home already will ya
have you noticed the large drawbridge behind this village normally its separated by the river but if you use this key here you can cross the bridge just once you cross the drawbridge the enemies on the other side will come and attack you at once if you want to advance safely you might be better off taking the long detour that goes right around the mountain here take the key no matter which path you take do take care of yourself mkay
you youre bord youve come to macedon as well
long time no see prince cord already joined with yous guys right we talysian mercenaries wanted to join yous army so we came all the way here princess caedas our lady and the guy whos gonna be her man is important to us too prince marth ill protect you with my life

well er how should i say this  lena suddenly up and vanished  i  i dont know what to do
wait julian tell me what happened in detail
lenas been missing since last night the villagers speak of some sort of strange priest prowling around lately it seems that somehow lena was taken by this man
a priest  julian as it turns out princess maria has gone missing as well i have a terrible feeling about this anyway staying here wont solve anything come with us im worried for lena too well all help to look for her
prince marth  thank you nothing would please me more
rucke im impressed a spineless coward like you could throw this country into so much chaos ill hazard a guess that hardin talked you into this
wha   y youre  b but how 
thought i was dead haha  my death was but a trifle hand minerva over to me rucke i no longer have plans for this country do with it as you please however i wont rest until ive disposed of him with my own hands
u uhh  but princess minerva is barely breathing  nobody could save her now 
do you want me to shove this spear down your throat i said bring her to me
y yes of course s somebody bring the princess here
its been a while minerva that ungainly appearance doesnt suit you losing maria your subordinates abandoning you  is this the ideal country you dreamed of
mi  michalis  how 
hey cut it out why must you always insist on pointing your sword at us i pity lena for having to put up with your stupidity
oh its you julian are you still trying to worm your way into lenas good books no way i wont hand my cute lil sister to a thieving rat like you
you can relax  lena and i would never work out but even if its just a little i wanted to help her in any way i could
ooh you finally realized where you stand attaboy julian
er thats not the kind of thing i want to be hearing from you  well whatever if youre worried about lena then come with me
oh alright thanks you see they forced me to join the rebel army but you know i hate fighting alright lil brother lets join forces and look for our cute lil lena
lena  where are you what i would give to hear your voice just once before i die 
lena  f forgive  your foolish big brother 
d damn it  why is the altean army here  youre all going down with me die
the altean knights  as i expected 
sire the rebels have fled the castle but i regret to inform you that princess minerva was nowhere to be found
what could have happened she was supposed to be held inside the castle 
oh hoh i knew this task was unworthy excellent work prince marth well take care of macedon from here now let us discuss your next mission
general lang what in the world do you want this time
well you see  my castle was attacked and the grustian prince and princess were kidnapped the perpatrator fled to macedon it seems prince marth you are to capture him and return the children to me
youre asking me to send those children to their doom
youre in no position to defy me now off to work you go my prince
you  your rudeness towards my liege has gone too far  shut up prince marth is not your minion
what did you say know your place altean soldier marth it seems that your countrymen are devoid of manners
 i apologize on hisher behalf but it is as kris says general lang i will no longer follow your orders from here
sire 
what do you mean to defy my orders i see  i see as i suspected it was your doing the person who kidnapped grusts prince and princess was the mercenary ogma on your orders no less
i didnt know of this but if i had the choice i would have done exactly as you suggested back at grust even though they were meant to be our enemies i should have helped those children
you you clearly speak words of treason perhaps i should report this to the emperor
do as you will but youre not the only person who intends to visit the palace i will speak to emperor hardin and princess nyna and inform them of your crimes forgive me jagen but i cannot stand for this any longer
i understand you have endured well until now lang my liege might forgive your frequent rudeness to him but i will not come draw your sword even though i jagen am old and senile i will not lose to the likes of you
wh  what did you say damn you  ill remember this once the emperor gets wind of this ill crush your puny little altea
jagen  youre a bag of surprises to think youd stand up against lang like that
sire are you underestimating me in my old age bwahaha  im not about to let youngsters like kris hog all the glory just yet still ill admit it was somewhat foolish to contest with lang even if he did push my lord at every turn
sire sir jagen what is our next plan of action
according to lang ogma is on his way to macedon he probably intends to visit the village where lord wendell resides
lord wendell
lord wendell is a pontifex of khadein he fought as our ally in the last war i hear hes living in macedon now it also happens that the children that ogma saved were raised by lord wendell so im sure it would be the perfect time to pay him a visit
yes understood
but i worry about lang  i pray that nothing bad shall happen 
kris are you aware that weve been searching for the assassins who besieged altea a year ago 
ah i assume since youre mentioning it that youve found a new lead
were not certain but weve received information that might lead us to them a few days ago i heard of a suspicious group heading towards macedons northern mountains
the northern mountains what could they be after up there
rumors say they are pursuing our former allies in the war of shadows  and i dont believe theyre after a friendly chat with them either
i see then we cannot ignore this lead especially if lives are at stake jagen kris we shall pursue the enemy
agreed let us prepare to march with haste
/***EOF***/
a stone bridge leading up the tall rocky mountain this stone bridge seems to stretch to the heavens as it spirals around from the rocks fearful roaring and breathing sounds can be heard as if the mountain was alive the dragons table  it is asn ancient ruin of the dragon tribe and the place where the divine dragon king naga sealed away the earth dragons now after a period of 600 years the earth dragons are currently awakening and countless evil demons are being born 
   thats uh certainly one heck of a hat  a gift from ymir i presume
yes it keeps me warm although im worried that itll stand out 
i should be if i were you if you stepped out on the battlefield wearing that youd be a popular target 
prince marth in this altar lurks many savage barbarians and mage dragons long gone mad they have fallen under gharnefs spell and will attack you given the chance gharnefs servants   the heretic priests possess great power they are not to be taken lightly if you let this battle drag on it may become fiercer than you can handle do not stop make for the end at once once you defeat gharnef retrieve the falchion that he stole from your altea as you well know without the falchion defeating medeus will be nigh impossible 
i understand lord gotoh my friends and i shall sally forth to the deepest depths of the altar
it would be wise to bring this ally with you she has deigned to lend you her strength
  
youre 
another ally from the previous war sire
no i dont believe weve ever met but why  i have the strangest feeling that i know her 
my name  is nagi i will  stop the enemy  you must hurry to the throne room  go  this time  everything  must end  
sire look stairs they probably lead further in we must hurry sire
right kris  by the way do you intend to wear that hat from here on out
actually im not entirely sure its very warm as sir ymir said but i stick out like a sore thumb 
indeed the enemies looked surprised well what is your decision are you going to take it off
yes i think i will remove it for this battle
excellent choice well lets hurry
no i rather like it its so toasty
i i see well then lets go

it is the second month of the third year in the history of the empire  archaneas holy city of pales is in the midst of a time of mysterious silence archanea because of a civil war begun by the paladin midia has arrested many capable knights however archanea still has twice the military power of altea to fill the streets of pales with it has already been nearly a whole year since the expedition to grust and now at long last the final battle which would decide the fate of both countries was about to begin 
as expected the archanean army is extremely powerful we must approach with great caution
it seems that hardin has assembled his entire army for the battle
even so the people have lost their faith in emperor hardin they welcome us as liberators it is certainly very reassuring this is our final battle it may drag on but all the same i would ask that you take utmost care
kris the enemy is the archanean imperial army the continents strongest and most renowned military force its strange but im not afraid kris if youre here then everything will be okay everyone lets go
as expected the archanean army is extremely powerful we must approach with great caution
it seems that hardin has assembled his entire army for the battle
even so the people have lost their faith in emperor hardin they welcome us as liberators it is certainly very reassuring this is our final battle it may drag on but all the same i would ask that you take utmost care
kris the enemy is the archanean imperial army the continents strongest and most renowned military force im not worried though  i know how strong you are kris you wont lose to anyone
yes sire please leave it to me
everyone lets go
i knew it you intend to invade coyotes palace the king forbade us from interfering  but i will do anything to protect coyote ill defy his edict if i have to
prince marth  it is i roshea of the wolfguard i received king aureliss pardon and have been waiting for you i am truly sorry for the battle of the pass i realize that an apology means little so i will now fight under your banner but  the other wolfguard members have all sided with the archanean army i wonder if i could persuade them vyland at the least  vyland might listen to what i have to say
emperor hardin was once a kind man but he suddenly changed into such a frightening emperor  ah  if i say things like this i will get killed as well
midia is the pride of archanea she was the daughter of th highest officer of archanea duke owen this rebellion only came about because she could not stand and watch us suffer no matter what you must rescue her
we thought that nyna and hardins marriage would finally bring peace to the world yet this happened oh deities  what should we do 
midia is really pitiful she only just retired as a knight to live together with astram and now she has been separated again shes still a young girl its so sad what can you do to help her 
the archanea army has changed the troops are all bloodthirsty savages now what is going on with this country
oh this is so sad those that opposed emperor hardin have all been killed  could the emperor be possessed by a demon 
vyland why are you here the king told us not to interfere aha have you decided to join the altean army like me
roshea i came to bring you back why have you turned to the alteans we are coyotes subordinates open your eyes youre being deceived
youre wrong vyland the time i spent with the alteans was short but i know one thing for sure its not as coyote says theyre not evil people
roshea 
vyland please i dont want to fight all of you especially you vyland 
     well roshea  you were always the kindest out of us in the wolfguard youve always been able to tell which were the good guys and which were the bad i cant fight you roshea if you our brother in arms are this sure then i believe you i am your ally from now on
vyland 
sedgar hold on its me vyland
whats the meaning of this vyland dont tell me youve defected
listen sedgar i  i dont know what am i supposed to do i loved coyote like a brother all i wanted was to fight for him but  but he has changed for the worse its as though hes someone else now 
  
i wanted to serve him always thats why ive been turning a blind eye i shut myself trying to remember the coyote who loved us so long ago it really hurt to face the truth that coyotes not who he used to be  i just dont know anymore hey sedgar  what the hell am i supposed to do
vyland  i too  i feel the same way i know hes gone insane but i looked the other way and blocked my senses one day hell go back to being our coyote  thats what i kept telling myself
roshea has gone over to the alteans i cannot fight him sedgar you should come too i dont know whats right anymore but i dont want to fight you either
yes  even though coyotes madness was clear to me i did nothing i have to make this right
wolf hold your fire
sedgar what are you doing so youve chosen to betray coyote
no its not like that this is for coyotes own good somethings wrong with coyote even you must know that
that changes nothing i will die at coyotes side i swore as much though all of you might betray us though i might be alone i will not abandon him
even though you disobey his heart
what do you mean
wolf do you remember what coyote said to you the day you became commander of the wolfguard
  
if i should wander from the path of the righteous please  lead me back onto it thats what he said
i should never have forgotten the words of coyote himself  but to tell me that time has come  that we must  that we must defeat coyote 
we have to remind coyote of the day we swore allegiance to him no matter how painful it may be  that is our only recourse i never wanted to believe it would come to this 
enough sedgar for goodness sake  it would have been better had i died at adria pass  i am the commander of the wolfguard  the life that coyote gave me  i will not waste it even if that should lead to coyotes death 
what  our archanea has been defeated but as long as im here i wont let you enter the castle
glory to the emperor 
oh lord marth ive been waiting for you
boah youve suffered a grave wound  what happened
mmm  it was truly frightening  i suppose the archanea royal family is indeed under a curse you should know about hardin and nynas marriage two years ago to restore archanea a king was required and only two people were suitable king aureliss younger brother hardin and alteas prince marth you  those were the choices and we pleaded for nyna to make the final decision originally she wanted to wait a while longer but we begged for her to make up her mind immediately in the end she said that choosing prince marth as her husband would hurt princess caeda so she finally decided on hardin
wait a second wasnt that a little harsh on nyna i understand that archanea needed a king but nyna she already 
you are referring to grusts lord camus but that would be unspeakable  unthinkable in fact princess nyna was the sole successor of the royal bloodline of archanea i felt bad as well but for this country we had no other choice however lord hardin was very happy compared to ascending archaneas throne he seemed happier about the fact that nyna chose him for her husband
i also understand hardins feelings he could sacrifice his own life for nyna but did he know about camus if he did i dont believe he would be so happy
mmm  of course we kept that a secret and we also persuaded nyna to hide it as best as she could but lord hardin was a very sensitive man he quickly found out that nynas heart had no place for him he felt very painful  he locked himself in his room and didnt allow anybody to see him taking advantage of his broken heart gharnef appeared he took on the guise of a merchant to approach hardin and showed him the darksphere the distraught hardin was quickly consumed by the orb from that day on he completely changed it was because i was only focused on restoring this country that i committed such a horrendous mistake please forgive me prince marth 
i cant believe all that happened   where is nyna now
when hardin discovered that she had taken the fire emblem he had her confined in her room after that she would still communicate in secret with me however hardin found out and then wounded me he also handed nyna over to gharnef
gharnef 
mmm  gharnef had always wanted to take nyna he said that the resurrection of the dark dragon required the blood of noble clerics  and so  he took nyna  to use her as a live sacrifice  lord marth im already done for i will give my thoron and physic to you i beg of you please rescue nyna even if archanea is destroyed it no longer matters  i only wish for nyna to be safe

seeking the lightsphere marth and his friends headed for the tower of thabes
thabes is an ancient city buried under the sands along with many treasures the legend of thabes city of illusion lured many adventurous men to the desert however in the end  not one of them ever returned as the sages once said  stay clear of mamorthod the desert of death there lies the cursed dark city

jagen where in the world are we 
this is the path depicted in the anri saga the first obstacle in anris way the desert of death with its scorching sun raging sandstorm savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns that soar and dominate the skies as the city of illusion shimmers in the distance we can only stand and gaze  or so the legend has it
so anri came through here as well and by himself too 
thats right your ancestor and alteas founder king anri  to save princess artemis he set out on a journey to seek the divine blade falchion
king anri was strong i wouldnt be able to cross through here alone im truly grateful to those who offered to accompany me through this desert

sire the remaining enemies have fled victory is ours
good work but either way that was a strange enemy were they even human 
ive heard rumors about them those wicked assassins crushed their souls when they were young and raised them as living puppets who follow orders without question 
how pitiful  kris i wonder if katarina was raised under such circumstances as well 
 
however we cant do anything about that now let us go ahead to anris way where lord gotoh awaits
sir jagen ive found something most odd inside the castle its this mask it seems like a different type from the one those assassins wore but whats it for 
heh  this is a mask for use in a masquerade ball i believe
masquerade ball
yes noblemen once donned these masks in order to conceal their identities they were probably used in this old castle a long time ago so its unrelated to the assassins
i see  but it sure is a strange mask
what of it dont tell me you intend to wear it
yes for some reason i feel like giving it a try
you are an odd one well do as you wish
no ill leave it where i found it
yes good idea
lady eremiya  i have a report legion he 
i see so he failed even though i took such good care of him  such a troublesome child
lady eremiya the altean army is strong now that legion has been defeated  perhaps we should refrain from pursuing them
no crushing altea was an order of his
but 
what reese dont tell me youre afraid
clarisse 
lady eremiya please allow me the honor ill take care of them
my youre a good girl clarisse would you
anything for you lady eremiya
  lady eremiya about the remaining legion brothers 
ah those get rid of all of them
lady eremiya 
they cant fight now that theyve lost legion can they so theyre useless now broken junk is to be discarded
b but lady eremiya  they were with us in the orphanage  with you too lady eremiya 
so what
 
reese you sure are useless arent you dont worry lady eremiya ill get rid of them
my clarisse is such a good little girl completely different from a certain failure
ah lady eremiya  your praise makes me happy

prince forgive me but were mercenaries all we did in the previous war was fulfill our duties as hired swords
it might have been just a job for you two  but not to me both of you are my precious comrades you were then and still are now
prince  i appreciate your willingness to say such kind words to mercenaries like us however at the end of the day were hired swords therefore we ask for gold prince archanea occupies your country its obvious you dont have the extra resources needed to pay us
well you have a point 
gold shouldnt be an issue prince marth will reclaim altea our homeland altea may be occupied by archanea now but we shall defeat them and then youll have the gold you seek
do you  honestly think you stand a chance against a powerful kingdom like archanea
of course besides im sure you dont have a choice at this point since youve failed your mission archanea wont pay you the gold you seek anymore if youre a hired sword working for gold following prince marth would serve your interests better am i wrong
 indeed your argument is sound as weve failed we have no other options prince marth radd and i are now your hired swords we shall accompany you for as long as you wish us to

/***EOF***/
having liberated grust marth and his companions accepted wendells request and stopped by the fane of raman in search of the missing orbs however the ancient temple built to worship naga had been wrecked by constant warring and was now nothing more than a den of thieves
theyre escaping with the temples valuable treasures we must catch them stay clear of the free company guarding chiasmir bridge we cannot defeat them it seems a dancer is lost inside the forest we must find her before the bandits do
as the soldiers received their orders the flames of a new battle around the fane of raman were ignited
by the way kris i have something id like to ask you
yes sir jagen
from your perspective what kind of person am i
what kind  of person
i keep wondering about how i should have acted towards lang  our homeland alteas position is important but perhaps i brood far too much and offend people
you worry about these things too sir jagen you neednt worry your concern for prince marth is more than evident youre very strict sir jagen but also very kind
is that so  ho ho if you cheer me on enough i may even age backwards
sir jagen when you look at me what kind of person do you see
hmm well  youre very capable as a royal guard 
and you have an aura that attracts people
and youre wise almost foresighted
and i can feel a hidden genius somewhere
and you have a kind heart
and you have an indisputably strong heart
thats the kind of person you are
what an honor
well wed best begin the war council let us go kris
yes sir jagen
huff  huff  please  help me  the thieves  theyre going to 
 
no it cant be youre  one of them  as well oh fine  do your worst if youre going to kill me do it fast
girl  get behind me the altean army is marching towards the south of this forest ill take you to them
huh youre going to help me you mean youre not with the thieves
until just now i was but ive changed my mind
why 
theres someone in the altean army that i want to see thats all
hmmm  but really its cause im cute right at any rate im glad my names phina im a dancer from warren people say that once they see my dancing they feel instantly refreshed i can show you if you like oh i should tell you my story i got separated from my troupe and wandered into this forest and then those horrible thieves came and tried to take me by force  but its okay now you seem kind of scary but actually youre very kind however your appearance is  your face isnt bad but your dress sense is kind of lacking and ugh whats with your hair you know nowadays 
just stop talking anyway dont stray too far well cut our way to the west corner and then escape through there if you want to live then shut up and come with me
ah  y yes sorry 
the ancient fane of raman is just a treasure trove to thieves you can see em carrying the stolen treasure all over the place i hope they get cursed or something 
the ones protecting the bridge are astrams free company powerful men who stop at nothing as a wise man once said let sleeping dogs lie eh
i wonder if youve seen that young ladys dance marvelous isnt it makes a tired body feel healthy again in the blink of an eye
you must never go near that cave i heard a rumor that in that cave dwells a terrible fire dragon
captain astram weve sighted the altean army to the south shall we attack
our mission is to hold the bridge leaving the bridge will not be permitted only attack if the enemy approaches
yes sir but what about the troops in the fort i hear they will march out soon
they were bought with coin by the emperor let them do as they please either way they wont win we will be the ones to stop the altean army
sire please exercise caution reports indicate that a fire dragon has emerged from the cave to the west
traitors ill show you the might of the mercurius
midia  my love 
tryin to take a cut from a thiefs plunderin  you people aint even human
murderers  the lot of you 
sire weve driven away the thieves but the temple was completely ransacked anything that wasnt nailed down is gone im sure even guardian deity naga would be furious tis truly the end of civilzation
jagen do you know the legend of naga
yes only vaguely however kris do you know of it
no not really 
unknown among the youth i see  then sire allow me the honor
its said that a thousand years ago  when there was not one king in the lands people lived in small villages one day terrible monsters descended and the humans were massacred pushed to the brink of extinction the few who survived prayed to the gods for salvation the gods heard their prayers and a gigantic warrior was sent down to earth the warrior carried a gleaming blade of light in his right hand and in his left hand a shield embedded with five orbs then after a fierce battle he eradicated the monsters and returned to the heavens he was our guardian deity naga and this temple is dedicated to him he was the avatar of the gods our guardian deity 
with the blade of light and the five orbs  that is the legend of naga 
well then sire we have to cross the chiasmir bridge soon we must hurry if the enemy takes it getting across will be nigh impossible
alright then inform the whole army we cross chiasmir bridge at once we havent a moment to waste
yes sir
lord wendell were off to chiasmir bridge i  a achoo
oh dear are you alright have you caught a cold
perhaps its too early to tell
dont push yourself too hard and remember to keep yourself warm oh i know shall i lend you one of the hats that im wearing
huh is that okay
yes i have many of these hats so theres no need to worry well then would you like to try it on
yes please if its not a bother
no no dont be shy here you go and do remember to watch your health
youre a good person lord wendell i want to be more like you  oh yeah if i wear this hat for a while i wonder if my hair will start to look like his and then maybe ill be a bit more like lord wendell
no thank you but i appreciate the gesture ill be just fine
i understand but do remember to watch your health
/***EOF***/
sire we have detected an enemy presence in the mountains it seems there is a battle ongoing
alright jagen kris let us hurry with our preparations
so im surrounded  how sad i guess this is the end of the road for me 
alright hes right where we want him now to savor his pain as we slowly draw the life from his tormented soul 
clarisse  the altean army has arrived
tsk what a nuisance reese i hate to admit it but you were right about this outcome alteans never abandon their comrades  you sure learned a lot about that trash from your time staying with them
 
my job is to kill one by one everyone who sided with marth in the previous war because if his allies live theyll eventually join him one after another and that would be dangerous
  clarisse are you really up for the task
i dont need to get my hands dirty do i my underlings can get the job done were hardly dealing with strong enemies
youll die if you underestimate kris and the others clarisse i served as kriss tactician but i wasnt much help as one i didnt give them the advice a tactician should give even without me kris and the others are strong
what have you become attached to the alteans after your little frolic with them then just sit there and watch watch hard and well as i kill your beloved companions oh yes and please  dont get in my way okay
alright im leaving the rest to you others are coming to help you soon so hurry and kill them already if by some chance those rats arent dead when i return  ill make sure youre dead got it
oh my savior kris thank you kindly for coming to my rescue i cannot fight but i can heal your wounded take me with you and youll be very glad you did
wait  what where did you lot come from
tsk this is bad  to think id run from the likes of you  ill remember this
sire are you unhurt
yes im alright thank you kris
weve repelled the assassins but we cannot afford to linger here
i agree im worried about ogma let us hurry to lord wendells place
 hmm the alteans are better than i expected oh well we can always snuff them out later ill let them live for now
i warned you the altean army is strong 
gosh reese you can be annoying sometimes whose side are you supposed to be on dont tell me youre thinking of betraying lady eremiya
 no that thought could never cross my mind we all live for lady eremiya for her sake i must defeat kris  i know that well enough
greetings kris my friend its been a while since we last had a decent conversation
yes ever since the knight training eh father wrys
indeed and youve become even stronger than you were then   oh did your hair grow a little
really well it is true i havent had the time to take care of it since we left altea 
you know a haircut like mine is astonishingly easy to take care of
i i can imagine 
if you so wish i could shave your head so its like mine
eh
as im a monk im quite used to shaving heads its quite alright if you dont like it you can just let your hair grow and have your previous haircut back what do you say would you allow me to shave your head
yes please
very well then give me a moment to prepare  are you really sure
y yes 
then please sit down now close your eyes 
i i think ill pass
i see its a pity but perhaps its for the best in any case kris im counting on you from now on
/***EOF***/
saint archanea is the largest country on the continent its golden capital of millennium court has bathed in 600 years of proud history under the attack of alteas allied army it fell in just one day the citizens of archanea welcomed them as liberators and supported them to their fullest they also mentioned of their hatred towards hardin and his personal guards everybody now calls hardin the dark emperor this was in hatred of hardin the murderer of countless people if possible fighting would be avoided but it as already reached this stage  marth ra
your highness weve entered the castle but dont forget that hardin is being protected by the darksphere to fight him  you must have the lightsphere be sure to let the person fighting him carry it
midia even you betrayed me archaneas paladins have lost their touch
you fool dont you see it what youre doing isnt normal where did you take nyna to bring her back to us now
nyna that woman betrayed me i just wanted to destroy grust and she had to go and give the emblem to that boy  those who betray me must die midia youre no exception
if you want to take my life go ahead but hardin  do you know how much suffering youve caused because of your stupid jealousy just open your eyes and see
stupid jealousy  haha  you can say what you like this world is corrupt and full of annoying people is this kind of world even worth anything it would be far better for it to be destroyed midia you shall watch here  as prince marth dies by hand
marth  as a servant of the empire you dared to invade millennium court i am disappointed in you so alteas prince of light is just a lowlife
hardin your are being controlled by the darksphere and have lost your just heart please you must return to normal
hahaha  you are so naive marth i attacked altea solely because of my hatred of you in the previous war it was only because you were the descendant of anri that nyna gave the emblem to you and chose you to become the leader of the alliance prince of light  what nonsense if you hadnt received my support you would have died long ago so dont act all big marth from that day on i hated you i kept silent for nyna but i knew i would have to deal with you eventually this has nothing to do with the orb
hardin  is that true  your hatred of me  i didnt know 
ha  thats why youre just a boy marth come to me so i can use my gradivus to pierce your heart in this tiny continent i am the only hero that is needed
rebels  did you come here to get yourselves killed ill show you to fear my gradivus
marth  your highness  i have finally awakened  from my deep dream  your highness  i am deeply sorry  i fought with my inner demon however i was too weak  i resisted with all my might  but i still lost  i hoped for your highness hand to end my life  that way i could be saved  your highness  nyna  please take care of nyna  she  i hope you  can tell her  in the  end  i still  loved her  i hope  she can  forgive me 
so youve come marth ill run you through just as you wish
hardin thats enough
ive no quarrel with you  bring marth to me
sir hardin  to defeat you is my duty prepare yourself
ive no quarrel with you  bring marth to me
dark emperor hardin  look nowhere else i am your opponent
sire the battle is over we have won
yes and with this finally 
sire look over there your sister and the others 
elice and princess nyna  lena maria youre all safe
marth im so happy you made it  ngh 
you  you carry the binding shield  gah my magic has been dispelled withdraw my priests at this rate he will  let us hurry the shadow dragons return
gharnef 
that man was the dark pontifex gharnef his servants were impersonating the princesses
what was he playing at he mentioned something about the shadow dragons return  so as we suspected my sister and the other clerics must be in gharnefs hands 
forgive my interruption sire but lord gotoh has arrived
lord gotoh take me straight to him
excellent work prince marth you managed to obtain all of the orbs thanks to your efforts the lost binding shield is finally complete
incredible it felt as though the shield itself pulled in all the orbs  so this is the fabled binding shield but what now lord gotoh from gharnefs actions it would seem he has the noble clerics imprisoned i worry for their safety
hmm  i understand how you feel  however we have a far greater task to accomplish  we must seal away the earth dragons soon they will awaken from their slumber they will rise up from the ground destroying everything in their wake and turn this world into a living hell go marth entomb the awakened dragons once more
marth its finally over now the world is safe look the princesses are over there 
sister and theres princess nyna  and lena and maria as well its great to see that everybody is safe
marth you finally came i am so happy  i will need your help to restore archanea
you really worked hard marth you are my pride
lord marth with our combined strength we have already vanquished gharnef please relax
the world is safe now your highness please hurry back to altea
really its good to see everybody well but you all dont look too good 
everybody is tired from battling gharnef but it doesnt matter now so please dont worry
really  nyna i am sorry about hardin i couldnt save him
its fine he was devoured by his own ambitions so it is not unexpected that he was lost well marth you should hurry back to your homeland everybody is probably worried about you with your remaining time you must live well as long as there are still people in this world your name will never be forgotten
kris new information regarding the assassins has reached the palace as you may have guessed they were dispatched by hardin and gharnef the head of the organization is a woman named eremiah
eremiah  and where is she now
here in archanea apparently she runs an orphanage in the mountains
an orphanage
yes so it would seem however its an orphanage in name only she confines the children to a basement devoid of light and teaches them all manner of wicked things 
  sire please let me go ill crush them   i wont allow such a travesty to stand
i understand kris i too cannot allow a situation like this to carry on
 please wait
katarina were you listening the whole time
theres a hidden passage to where lady eremiah is  ill show you the way
  
please allow me to go ill be fine i dont believe for a moment that this will atone for everything ive done  but while i live i want to help in any way that i can
  sire please let me go ill crush them   i wont allow such a travesty to stand
i understand kris i too cannot allow a situation like this to carry on lets go to the orphanage then
/***EOF***/
this truly is an unimaginably treacherous journey 5000 meters  no higher than that looking down a sea of clouds can be seen they have reached the summit of the cold mountain peak breathing is difficult  dizziness is felt  their vitality is fast approaching its limits
well kris is everyone making good use of the drill grounds of course if you win often youll be that much stronger kris you 
oho ho you  youve done very well havent you
yes i go there often
i see then there is nothing i have to add i should recommend the drill grounds to the others
oho ho you  youve been winning quite often eh not bad at all
thank you but i hope to improve further
thats the spirit i should recommend the drill grounds to the others
hmm you  it seems you havent won much yet are you purposely avoiding the drill grounds
s sorry i dont really have the money so 
well its fine if youre not struggling now but when things get tough that experience will be the clincher just remember if you ever feel that your foes are too strong there is a place where you can hone your skills
xane weve already climbed this high its so cold  even breathing is hard
were almost there look can you see over there thats the ice dragons temple where gotoh is
but that was quite a shock tiki is actually the daughter of the divine dragon king also both gotoh and you are divine dragons
ah  when the divine dragons fought the earth dragons they over exhausted their dragonstones and so practically became extinct aside from naga only gotoh me and the just born tiki survived however after the war we discarded our dragonstones so we could no longer become dragons again even so i still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans gotoh followed nagas orders to protect humans but thats got nothing to do with me i dont like humans they scorned the manaketes even though they had lost their power and treated them like filth i can fully understand why medeus and the others hated humans so much the earth dragon king medeus tricked his own tribe and became a manakete by himself he used to follow nagas orders and guarded the dragons altar however the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive they even started to attack the manaketes that lived in peace the manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans and gathered at the dolhr region they formed their own kingdom of manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans to save the humans gotoh handed the falchion to anri and he created an academy of magic at khadein but whoever won wasnt any of my concern
then why are you helping me im also a human 
youre different from the others you dont seem like an unreliable person either 
mmm  thank you xane
dont  dont be silly ill get embarrassed anyway lets head to the temple but be careful of the ice dragons although theyre also wild dragons they will instinctively try to protect their temple poor guys 
you youre beck to think wed meet here of all places
me too prince marth boy am i surprised to see you its been far too long after the war i was travelin the continent and um somehow 
 you landed up here well thank goodness theres no way you would have joined the barbarians beck were fighting another war why dont you come with us
i dont have my ballista any more just my horse buddy right ere but if youre fine with that then sure ill help you princey
whats the point of war
d damn  it  you too  pony 
hey xane gotoh didnt really mention anyting about the five orbs but i thought they were very important do you know anything about them
gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didnt say anything i will tell you however after ive told you youll probably think it was better off not knowing the orbs rest on the shield that seals the earth dragons  basically they are part of the shield of seals since ancient times the divine dragons have passed down these sacred jewels each possessing different powers to put it simply the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal so if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken
hmm is that so but how come the orbs were scattered
because the shield was broken the shield of seals was displayed at the fane of raman and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it 
when did that happen
around 600 years ago to recover the shield gotoh spend many years searching the lands in the end he only found the five orbs with the shield nowhere to be seen not only that but the five orbs which he painfully collected were scattered again after raman was attacked in the previous war
really  so that was why gotoh was looking for the lost jewels  the orbs
yep the starsphere lightsphere and geosphere  as well as the darksphere and lifesphere the lightsphere is in gotohs possession that starsphere was shattered and the darksphere was given to hardin by gharnef
the geosphere is in altea and all that remains is the lifesphere
ah  anyway lets enter the temple from now on i will also help you fight well lets go
sire please wait kris you as well
i just received a distressing message people have been sighted not far behind us there seems to be a battle underway
out here could it be the barbarians or perhaps its the assassins 
in any case this area is almost entirely uninhabited so it cant be any old people  to make matters worse the snow is becoming heavier  fighting will be difficult in this weather
but if there are allies 
indeed we cannot abandon them if there are allies that is 
then well just have to find out for ourselves before the battle is over lets go
/***EOF***/
ahh  this forest sure is nice and peaceful
yeah
just walking around here makes me feel rejuvenated in a way
yeah same here
oh by the way were lost arent we
  
hey kris the ordinary wasnt this supposed to be yknow a shortcut well
um  im sorry  i really did think it was  but were definitely lost
whaaaaat you dont need to tell me that i figured that one out ages ago
everyone please we mustnt fight we need to work together in times of crisis 
shes right theres no point in crying over spilt milk rather lets find a way home ahem ladies and gentlemen our new mission find our way back to altea castle of course we should try not to wander around aimlessly while we find our way

ooh is that all to be honest im a bit hungry as well  kris lets go and find something to eat
please come in
commander kris and katarina of the 7th platoon reporting as ordered sire
please calm yourselves you may stand at ease
yet you summoned us so suddenly milord  is it to do with the bandits we subjugated are you sire reprimanding us for disobeying our orders
not at all  its quite the opposite your actions have saved many as ruler my duty is to protect my people and i am truly grateful for what you did
were honored to be of service but that was tougher than any of our training phew 
kris and you as well katarina  i hear from jagen that youve been exemplary cadets
is that so sire sir jagen never intimated as much 
ive seen your skill and i agree wholeheartedly with him why the both of you are suitable for the altean army should the two of you pass your test id love it if you would become my royal guards
royal guards sire
though the stories tell of me as a great hero it is not so there is only so much that i can do by myself that much i know to be true the war of shadows was won with the aid of comrades who wished for the same future as i twas not a lone romp across the land i realized whether in peace or war i need people i can trust  young dynamic soldiers who can support and guide me
b but the royal guard exists to protect the king  it is a role of immense importance  are we even fit for such an esteemed duty
yes i believe so i want you to be my royal guard jagen feels the same as i but  dont feel obliged to promise me i wont think ill of you if you decline and so i ask this of you once more you need not answer right away its quite alright please think it over carefully

khadein is an independent city state taking orders from no foreign nation the archmage has many pontifices under him governing according to their counsel in the previous war pontifex gharnef allied with dolhr and dragged khadein into war and the city suffered great damage as result as khadein had lost all its pontifices wendell became its archmage and started rebuilding the city however wendell left on a journey to fulfill a mission given to him by gotoh he then left khadein in the care of two young men they were two skilled and promising young mages  merric and arlen
so this is the school of khadein  the sanctuary of those who study magic
indeed merric studied here since he was a child i personally have no magical ability but as for you kris 
youre incredible i dont think youd lose to even merric
i wonder if i could study here in khadein
actually i think theyd want you to teach
you have potential im sure youd qualify to study here
thank you sire
you too hm  youre not very good at magic either
yeah  im not really cut out for it
well everyone has their own talents i wouldnt worry too much about it
merric its time to put an end to this
wait arlen why do we have to fight we were both master wendells pupils were friends are we not why do you despise me so
i was master wendells disciple before you and i was the stronger one even so master wendell gave you excalibur he should have given it to me clearly i was the only one worthy to be his successor yet he 
but i have no intention of succeeding master wendell i hold no ill feelings for khadein but once i finish studying i plan to go home back in altea there is somebody i must protect for the rest of my life  so arlen please why dont you join us so we can take back altea
altea you say why should we help a country that rebelled against the empire and attempted to invade their fair nation the mage corps of khadein have sworn allegiance to emperor hardin oh i see  i knew it was you  you dragged the altean army here
no thats not how it is
shut your mouth traitor i wont listen to your lies any longer your excalibur and my thoron well put them to the test
arlen what are you doing
master wendell 
you still dont understand my decision do you indeed as a mage your power surpasses mine but you lack compassion that is why i did not grant you excalibur
  compassion 
i had decided that you were to be my successor when the time came to think you would harbor a grudge towards me  does that not make you the same as gharnef
the same as gharnef  teacher what are you saying
arlen listen to me  gharnef along with pontifex miloah were lord gotohs best pupils but lord gotoh saw gharnefs weakness and so he left khadein and the aura tome to pontifex miloah gharnef overcome by jealousy stole the darksphere from lord gotoh and created the imhullu tome as a result  his heart was trapped within the darksphere for all eternity wrath and envy led him to ruin do you understand now arlen 
 teacher   teacher im so sorry i  i was wrong please  find it in your heart to forgive me
arlen you will use that power of yours for the good of the people understand
i wont lose to someone like merric anyone who sides with him is my enemy thunder strike them down thoron
master wendell 
why does everyone side with him  even though  even though im stronger
how horrible  consumed by your hatred you have forgotten what is truly important
sire weve rescued the clerics
sire weve rescued the clerics that were threatened by the enemy
excellent good work kris
as thanks they have offered to give us this
marth  do you hear me
lord gotoh yes i can you are speaking to me through magic are you not lord gotoh i must ask what has happened to cause hardin to suddenly change so much
hmm  the darksphere is the culprit  hardins soul is trapped within the darksphere 
the darksphere what on earth is that
light star earth life and darkness  in this world there exist five sacred orbs the darksphere is that which complements the lightsphere in battle it possesses the enemys mind negating their attacks but the darksphere also amplifies wrath and envy and can turn their owner into a demon hardin must have obtained the darksphere from somewhere  and now his heart has been lost to it
but why he should have been happy after his union with beloved princess nyna so why the envy
prince  humans are never simple creatures  in any case the only object that can overcome hardins darksphere is the lightsphere if you want to do something about him then you had best come and get it from me
huh really lord gotoh if we have the lightsphere then we can save hardin
well  if his heart is not completely consumed then perhaps
lord gotoh please lend the lightsphere to me
if you come in person to the ice dragons temple where i reside then you shall have it but that will be no easy task so marth do you have the courage to walk the path that anri walked
yes i do i will go please allow me to go i must have the lightsphere
kris may i have a word as this armys tactician i have been observing each and every of our battles if i were to sum up your recent style of fighting i would say 
most impressive to the end all of your comrades support each other and you fight as one so as to not lose each other with prince marth as our core  and your support we shall not falter
it is an honor sir jagen
excellent there is no other word at times we lose comrades  but even so we have always prevailed with prince marth as our core  and your support we shall not falter
it is an honor sir jagen
unsatisfactory  it pains me to say it but your comrades have fallen one after another  at this rate i worry for the future you must protect them from now on their lives are in your hands kris
yes sir jagen
hey can i talk to you for a second i came here cause i heard marths group was passing by but erm 
sorry who are you
im malice a mercenary and not a cheap one id like to ask you something is yer prince okay with paying gold oh of course its okay if i have to wait until this wars over so erm  if you er paid us say  590 gold for our services that ought to do i think
huh if its only that much then prince marth would gladly pay 
phew the rumors are true hes completely different from all our employers up till now right pops
he is different looks like we hit the jackpot coming to this desert im dice on behalf of the both of us its great to be in your service
sire weve just received new information it concerns the assassins movements  lord horace who thought to ally with us is in peril
lord horace  kris lord horace is an archanean knight in princess nynas service he was our ally
lord horace i am marth of altea i ask that you lay down your arms 
   is princess nyna  safe
we cannot abandon lord horace jagen kris lets hurry
/***EOF***/
sigh
whats wrong luke
dont you think its a crying shame that there arent any cute and caring clerics around
w what do you mean 
well a knight thrives on romance right like if i were wounded in battle and a lovely cleric came to my aid  hey kris the ordinary if we had a cleric like that with us i bet wed all fight twice as hard
well i dont know about the romantic part  but it would make our lives easier if we had a healer on our side unfortunately i dont think there are any healers around luke it might be a good idea for us to ask someone for assistance on this matter
kris everyone please listen i bring good news theyve found us someone who can support our platoon it appears we might be joined by a healer
shes finally here my lovely cleric out of my way let me at her
pleased to meet you i am wrys a humble curate i cannot fight but this staff i carry can heal your wounded
  
yes yes i heard the whole thing from sir jagen if you like i could lend you my services as a healer  oh my has something terrible happened your face looks awfully pale  have you been taken by illness my boy
its nothing  hes just overwhelmed with joy right now
ah no its nothing  be careful what you wish for luke
pay no heed to luke were all fine pleased to make your acquaintance wrys
well then lets continue the combat training everyone you had better be prepared ive decided that you will have a rather unusual instructor for todays practical training
this is miss athena a foreign myrmidon who helped us in the last war
ve are indebted to this country and ve vish to return the favor any voman would do the same ve are bad at teaching but if ve are using swords ve will not lose
athena is a myrmidon with excellent speed and an opponent whom you must be very cautious of kris do your best
this is general jeorge who is visiting from the kingdom of archanea
i came to instruct gordin in archery but once i heard your story my curiosity was piqued to say the least so i asked a big favor to be allowed to take part
sir jeorge  a true master of the bow and arrow they call him greatest archer on the continent kris do your best
ve vill challenge you
 ve give up
i am jeorge a bow knight of archanea let me see how you fare in battle
 that was magnificent 
you are strong especially you you vat is your name
the names kris junior knight kris
kris  ve vill remember that you you are our friend ve vill aid you if you vant
not bad at all that was a splendid fight you what is your name
the names kris junior knight kris
kris  ill remember that name im afraid i cannot join your cause but  gordin could you go in my stead
yes sir ill gladly fill in for you
kris you are someone id like to fight alongside one day i look forward to the day we can meet again
todays training is now over with that i shall give you an interim report
interim report 
from the very first test until now i have evaluated your manner of combat the more of your allies that have been injured and forced to withdraw the poorer your score get ready to listen up
yes sir
commander kris of the 7th platoon of the twenty junior knight platoons you place 
first wonderful work kris you are most talented
a amazing we did it we did it kris its all thanks to you kris
but dont let your guard down placing first doesnt give you an excuse to start slacking off that is all you may return to the castle
third impressive kris id say that youve placed rather high
we did it we did it kris its thanks to you kris
but dont let your guard down you are still in training  so from now on you must aim even higher that is all you may return to the castle
tenth just in the middle kris ive got nothing good to say at this rate
im sorry kris its because i cant do anything 
but dont give up you are still in the middle of training so i expect more effort from now on that is all you may return to the castle
last  kris  none placed worse than you 
i i im terribly sorry kris  its because i cant do anything 
 but dont give up you are still in the middle of training so from now on try as hard as you can that is all you may return to the castle
 wow this castle is absolutely massive its a huge difference to the house in my hometown  now where were the 7th platoons chambers again 
oh my  you are a junior knight are you not
ah yes im kris i came here hoping to become an altean knight and you are 
i am elice marths elder sister
oh prince marths elder sister  please excuse my lack of manners
its alright kris  i think its very admirable that youve come to help marth
it is an honor to serve prince marth the hero king
the hero king  you say it does seem that our people have grown fond of calling him that but the truth of the matter is that marth  marth is just a weak vulnerable child 
prince marth is weak 
yes of course he was the hero who triumphed in the battle against the shadow dragon however behind his heroic face marth is an idealistic child who firmly clings on to his beliefs and as you too must know the real world  cannot be saved with just ideals
yes 
even as we speak somewhere unknown to us our peoples lives are being lost  marth cannot save those people
yes thats true  even the most excellent of kings is not an omnipotent god a king is no more than human and there are limits to what he can do
yes precisely most people realize this and can come to terms with that reality but marth cannot do that  he truly thinks that he can save everyone in war losing just one companion is unbearable for him  he suppresses his feelings with all his willpower but i know that inside his heart breaks and bleeds 
  
in this cruel world it will become increasingly difficult for him to continue to hold these ideals  kris if some day you should achieve knighthood  please protect him somehow and keep his ideals safe 
/***EOF***/
leaving painful memories behind marth and his companions left grust they landed in macedon their new mission to rescue princess minerva after the war of shadows macedon was led by minerva who exiled the oppressive generals and attempted to reform the military however the influential general rucke opposed minervas peace seeking ways he assembled the exiled officers to instigate a coup detat caught unprepared minerva was captured by ruckes followers and his rebel army seized control of macedon then they dispatched powerful dracoknights to guard the countrys forested borders
macedons main force consists of pegasus knights and dracoknights  both are fast and highly mobile units in particular there are the whitewings who fought under our banner in the last war  there arent many in these lands who could match their terrifying speeds
i would have loved to witness their prowess 
kris while were on the subject of speed 
your speed can be summed up as exemplary even the whitewings would have trouble keeping up with you as id expect of an altean royal guard
it is an honor to receive such praise sir jagen
your speed is satisfactory but the whitewings would simply fly straight over you
i see  ill be more careful sir jagen
your speed is sadly terribly lacking the whitewings would probably reach their destination in half your time 
i i see  i ill be more careful sir jagen
hello there kris
hm youre  why do i feel like weve met somewhere before 
oh dont worry about little old me the important thing is that i came here to share a wonderful tip with you have you heard about hows everyone
hows  everyone
hows everyone is all the rage by checking it you can see how everyone in your army is faring you can watch your allies train discover useful items or even listen to their thoughts  so if you ever want to know how everyone is then take a look at hows everyone easy right
i  see thanks i guess
the more time passes the more things youll be able to see if you ever feel the urge then go ahead and take a peek well ill be off now buh bye
prince marth thank goodness youve come to macedon
catria i received word that there was a rebellion in macedon are you unharmed
yes im fine my older sister palla and i managed to escape somehow but princess minerva was captured by the rebels prince marth please  you have to rescue princess minerva at this rate her life will be in danger
of course i will help her catria please take us to where she is
yes my lord but first we have to break through these woods general rumels dragon knight squad is lurking within this area if we approach from the front well be easy pickings for them
i see so youre suggesting we flank them from the left or right thank you catria leave it to us
warrens a bit of an idiot just cause they paid him well he went ahead and joined the rebel army ahh to think a fool like him was once acquainted with the fair catria 
look out for those pilfering thieves if they take off with your precious treasure you wont ever get it back never let them escape from your sight
because of the last war every nation has been forced to lead hard lives the only well off country is archanea ruled by emperor hardin
some dirty thieves took our village treasure the lady sword and ran off with it only women can wield the incredible power of that sword please prise it back from their filthy hands
beware when dracoknights are around even from a far off distance they can move all at once and swoop down on you
oer here prince marth
youre  cord what are you doing so far from talys
i couldnt sit still when i heard yous fighting again so i came to join in were talyss mercenaries right if ya died princess caedad cry prince marth lemme fight too ill join yous army
warren even a good man like you has sided with the rebel army 
catria the white huh its been a while you know im just a common hunter if they pay me enough ill do anything
warren listen to me princess minerva endeavored to create a country where its people could live at ease she exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute to accomplish that goal but general rucke despite knowing this roused the soldiers into a coup detat cant you see hes just trying to make this country into his own and you can honestly say youre okay with that
 i see well i dont like the military acting as if they owned the place  alright then if youre going to help the princess then so will i
no hard feelings i dont have anything against you but this is the way i live forgive me
damn it  i shouldve seen this coming 
taste the terror of macedons fearless dracoknight squad
general rucke i leave the rest to you 
sire we found someone most unusual confined in one of the fortress rooms
hm  linde how did you wind up in a dangerous place like this
sire do you know this woman
yes this is linde her natural talent for magic helped us a great deal in the last war
prince marth thank heavens what a pleasant surprise meeting you here i desperately needed to see you again so i set out to find you but the macedonian soldiers found me suspicious and they dragged me to this fortress 
is that so im glad youre safe but why were you looking for me shouldnt you be by princess nynas side
i was requested by princess nyna to deliver you this
huh this  this is the fire emblem the royal heirlom of archanea the emblem shield
the fire emblem  i heard that in the last war princess nyna entrusted you with it sire 
indeed i looked after this as archaneas representative in the last war but why give this to me now especially at a time when archanea has so much influence under emperor hardins reign in this peaceful age why is princess nyna giving me the champions proof 
i dont understand either princess nyna didnt explain why just that i had to give it to you  i remember her eyes seemed so sad  i think she may have been crying 
princess nyna crying what on earth has been happening  linde after this battle ends i will go see princess nyna until then i want you to remain with us
yes prince marth

luke maybe if you did something about that attitude of yours youd be more popular oh its time apparently today sir jagen wishes to have a word with us before training
theyd see me as gentle and quiet like softly falling rain just like kris right
umm  if you say so
luke maybe if you did something about that attitude of yours youd be more popular oh its time apparently today sir jagen wishes to have a word with us before training
n no lets not actually the girls would run away in fear if i had kriss hairdo 
 how rude whats wrong with my hair exactly
i i think your hair looks great kris  oh its time apparently today sir jagen wishes to have a word with us before training
three months have passed since you first came here during this time ive witnessed many a platoon desert because they couldnt stomach the harsh training not to mention platoons that failed due to miserable results  of all who remain there are only twenty names
eep the requirements are incredibly strict
true but we still remain in the game thats what matters as long as we keep working hard 
from now on the practical training will be far more gruelling as such we will be introducing lectures to advise you
lectures
i am frey the knight in charge of lecturing in my lectures you will learn essential knowledge that all knights should possess
from here on this is the real thing prepare to be pushed to your limits
now firstly ill talk about the preparations you need to make before a battle before you fight your enemy on the battlefield you must ensure that you are sufficiently prepared
selecting those who will fight organizing their weapons and items  kris you will do all these things as part of your role as commander
i understand ill do my best
one more important thing pay attention to party members who wish to speak with you talking to your party members will often yield tactical advice the more stars displayed the more important a conversation is when you come to a new battlefield its always a good idea to check if anybody has something to say
well then let us begin todays mock battle from here on i will prepare an instructor based on your performances until now the 7th platoons opponent today is 
i am draug armor knight of altea your opponent is none other than me
draug is an armor knight famed for his sturdy defense kris hell be a formidable enemy
these soldiers are your opponents you must defeat all of them if you wish to fight me
well then lets begin todays practical training your opponents from here on will be the toughest yet so show me that fighting spirit of yours the 7th platoons opponent today is 
i will serve as your opponent
what we we have to fight ogma  kris ogma is a hero from the last war  hell make for a formidable enemy
the soldiers here will be your opponents first if you defeat all of them ill step up to fight
huff  puff  i i made it hey wheres this commander kris person
that would be me but who are you
im cecil a junior knight like you i know its very sudden but i was invited by katarina to join your group
 very sudden indeed but the more the merrier could we talk after the battle
sure im glad you understand oh yeah i brought along some strong weapons that katarina prepared for you just give me the orders and ill give you them to replace your worn out ones
youre not bad at all but i wont be beaten so easily
not bad as promised i will fight
i keep hearing about your abilities please allow me to judge for myself whether or not youre the real deal
s so you managed to penetrate my armor 
dont think of this as simply training come at me without restraint
 not bad thats quite some skill youve got
how  even my defense couldnt withstand such a tremendous onslaught commander kris if you have need of an armor knights strength you may call on me
we did it kris good job
such great power looks like altea is blessed with good knights kris if you have need of my power you need only ask
we did it kris good job
excuse me kris do you have a moment
huh of course what is it
that royal guard position that prince marth offered us did you think about it i  id like to be a royal guard if youre in with me together wed be an unstoppable team  when i imagine a future like that i feel very happy  um what about you kris do you perhaps feel the same as i 
um im sorry i havent really thought about it yet 
 i is that so yes i  so it was just me after all  im sorry good night kris
yeah i think it would be nice
yes of course
r really im so glad  well this is a little awkward  i should get to bed good night kris good luck for tomorrow
/***EOF***/
marth barely succeeded in escaping disembarking in the desert of khadein he elected to await his subordinates safe arrival
khadein the city of magic is a sanctuary for mages many prospecting mages come here and undergo rigorous training magic relies on containing natures energies in tomes and staves freely manipulating these energies to harness great power a few centuries ago a lone sage founded an academy here teaching magics secrets however instead of bringing happiness magic was soon used as a tool of war and a thing to be traded the sage was disappointed and vanished from the pages of history though there is no confirmation some say that was the archsage gotoh currently advanced magic like aura cannot be made without the orbs power and their use is restricted to a few chosen ones those conditions are set by their creator and they can only be inherited by those who qualify
khadein the city of magic  the proud sanctuary of sorcery
sire am i glad to see you
kris thank goodness is everyone else okay
yes everyone who survived is here
amazing i dont know how you all managed to escape that onslaught 
we were most fortunate a sandstorm was brewing as we were making our escape  thanks to the obscuring sands the enemy lost sight of us and we were able to escape with ease even during normal battles i seem to have lucky moments like that
i see kris you must be loved by the goddess of fortune
it would be my honor
your thoughts are mine but somehow we were able to shake off the enemy and escape
i see thank you kris
me neither the way was blocked by earth and sand and we lost our way as well  b but somehow  somehow we escaped
how horrible for you  even during normal battles kris unlucky things always seem to befall you i have to wonder if the goddess of fortune hates you
it would certainly seem that way 
minerva if you wait in this village you will most certainly run into marth i dont like him but he is indeed noble join forces with him
brother what are you going to do now wont you come with me 
i have no intention of doing that i only wish to find maria and bring her home to macedon
youve changed brother  or should i say youve returned to how you used to be as i thought back then you were being controlled by gharnefs dark magic
no no magic could bend my will i wished to crush the arrogant archanea and establish macedonian supremacy over this continent but father without bending his ear to me distanced himself from me and later had me banished
are you saying thats why you murdered father what a fool you were  didnt you realize that was gharnefs plotting all along yes father was strict with you but it was only because he loved you why couldnt you see that
enough minerva do you take me for a fool after i was defeated i wandered the gap between life and death when i had come to in front of me i was maria  her eyes full of tears  praying to the gods while i treated her like a pawn maria she shed tears for me  minerva im going now i have to save maria at least that can be my atonement
michalis 
sire how shall we proceed from here
hmm  i want to go home to altea but if we cant prevail against hardin then we cant go back what in the world are we supposed to do 
we need to find out the secret of the strange power thats protecting hardin forgive me sire as your royal guard i was supposed to strike down your foes 
no its not your fault kris i too felt a strange presence emanating from hardin almost like 
sire its an emergency i have just come into some new information the khadein mage corps has launched an offensive against us
what even khadein means to be our enemy  merric what are you 
sir jagen what should we do
at this rate it seems we have no choice sire we need to break into the sanctuary but you must be prepared to make sacrifices if we dont hurry archaneas pursuit force will reach our rear and well be trapped
i understand weve no choice everyone lets break into the sanctuary but avoid needless fights if possible
an update sire the archanea army is at present approaching from the south
i see hasten the march dont let them catch up
do not think you can escape alteans ill turn this desert into your graveyard
do not think you can escape alteans we will avenge captain astram
a swordslayer will demonstrate your might against a mercenary or a hero you should definitely get one if you can
from here on north you wont see no more shops if youre going that way you should stock up now
the person commanding khadeins mage corps is a young man named arlen hes not a bad man but he can be a bit uncooperative seems he regards his old rival merric with disdain hmm  i reckon only lord wendell could talk some sense into him
huh princess minerva why are you here
my brother  michalis he helped me
really thats good to hear i was so worried once i heard that prince michalis had taken you but for him to rescue you what in the world happened
maria saved michaliss life shes kind unlike myself  marias kindness was able to touch the heart of even a man like michalis
but isnt that what you wanted thats why you deliberately avoided killing michalis am i wrong princess
hmm  
i can understand no one can sever the ties between family so easily princess please lift your spirits i would like you to fight with us again just like before i would like macedons strength and yours in order to put a stop to hardins designs
youre  etzel why are you here
i have my ties to khadein as well prince marth has succumbed to his ambitions and invaded archanea when i was told that there was no way i could sit still
  
but  no matter how i put it i just couldnt imagine youd become that sort of person prince marth you said to me long ago that you wanted to let the era of war end do you still stand by those words
yes i do i do not seek to fight
 i see i too do not seek as such allow me to join you once more
i dont want to fight you but i owe khadein what a troublesome ordeal i am in 
this war  will  someday 
i will not forgive intruders upon our holy sanctuary earth show your fury bolganone
arlen  was this really what you wanted 
the atmosphere inside the building seems somewhat strange
indeed something seems to be happening kris merrics inside there you met him during your training right
yes sir merric really helped us with his magical prowess so sir merric is here  we must hurry sire
yes lets go
/***EOF***/
the shocking news brought by caeda was a terrible blow to marth hardin was once not only a comrade in arms but a trusted confidant and irreplaceable friend
yet  why attack altea what have i done wrong
olbern keep headquarters of the grustian occupation army led by the evil general lang  also known as the nest of evil
kris its been decided that were going to war with archanea archanea will not be an easy opponent they have one of the most powerful militaries on the continent
were ready to face anything sir although  we still lack experience i admit we have to grow stronger 
indeed kris are you aware of the drill grounds that operate across the continent
drill grounds sir
it costs a bit of money but if you go practice in one you can get stronger it might be a good idea to let our more inexperienced men have a go
commander lang the  a altean army has arrived 
you moron why are you so panicked with their nation and name in ruins the alteans are of no consequence to us
but sir jeorges archers left to quell the rebellion can we win with just our troops
why didnt you tell me earlier call jeorge back to the castle this instant while youre there find that hired sword navarre and bring him here general toras im heading inside you will defend this location till your last breath do not let the enemy get close do i make myself clear
captain jeorge weve received orders to return to the castle immediately
orders from lang huh im not fond of that man his treatment of our people is simply intolerable to work beneath him is an insult pay his orders no mind
but captain youll be accused of treason captain you cant be planning to defect to altea 
no thats not an option if i were to defect now id drag the entire platoon down with me so for that reason alone i will absolutely not take any risks that might besmirch our name
captain jeorge 
anyway inform everyone do not move from your stations however if the enemy approaches you may engage them
yknow lately i havent seen that mercenary samuel i thought that he might have joined your ranks but i guess not  hes as lax as they get but you cant go wrong with his skill
oh alteans hear our plea please defeat general lang as long as that man lives peace is but a fleeting dream
ohh if isnt prince marth i wonder how my granddaughter lena is faring hm what you dont know i see  th then  do you still want this hammerne staff at least if lenas pupil marisha were around im sure she could use it  well whatever be the case ive no use for a souvenir please make good use of it
whoo ready boys look at all the ruckus never a better time to attack that buncha villages
hey rickard i see you havent tired of stealin
ah chief how nice to see ya well i was plannin on workin with you and makin loadsa money but you had to go and quit the business fallin head over heels for that beautiful cleric and then dumpin me  thats just too cruel did our love really mean that little to you
can it you little fink peoplell get the wrong idea about us if you keep talkin like that anyway forget about thievin and come with me to fight for justice
hmm  alright then ill follow you anywhere i do adore ya chief
long time no see barst
captain ogma why are you here 
another war has started once again i fight under prince marths banner barst lend us your strength we need you
i got nothing to do with fighting now  well thats what i would say if you were anyone else captain i owe you youve saved our sorry asses on more occasions than one captain ogma just say the word ill do whatever you want
barst whatre you doin in a place like this
bord its been a while fightings a thing of the past for me im just an ordinary woodcutter now move along nothing to see here
dont be an idiot doncha know this is prince marths fight if you ignore his plea youre a disgrace to the talysian mercenaries tell me youre no disgrace
   you know all i really want is to live in peace  i suppose i cant just kick back and chop my wood with this damn war going on this needs to end quickly

the surprising truth from xane was a shock to marth tiki was created as the daughter of the divine dragon king naga and slept in the temple because of the kings will the kings fear of tikis power was that of a loving mothers if tiki was to awaken her tremendous power would eventually cause the destruction of the world  that is what the divine dragon king feared however bantu the kings servant became attached to tiki after watching over her for a period of hundreds of years becamesic he awoke her from her sleep and took her away so tiki only had 10 human years worth of memory  that is so sad tiki  marth was too bewildered to think
this is the ice dragons temple anris final destination 
prince marth can you hear me come to the front of the center room i shall await you there
what you found all the shards thank you then the starsphere can be restored please wait a moment 
marth this is the starsphere you can take this with you as well
huh gotoh why are you giving such an important item to me
the only person that can restore the shield of seals is you  the shield itself has chosen you
 
you still dont understand the emblem shield youre carrying is the stolen shield of seals to be honest it was only recently that i noticed its exterior had completely changed  after stealing it from the fane of raman the thief removed its jewels and sold them off as treasures the money was used to fund an army which along with three stolen weapons was used to conquer the world the thief that went on to become the king of archanea had the shield which brought him such good fortune it became the emblem of his royal family now do you understand marth it is what you are carrying archaneas fire emblem
 what   the first king of archanea was originally a thief is that true  in that case i can kind of understand the curse of the fire emblem  then gotoh  if i can collect all five orbs can i restore the shield of seals
mmm  but please hurry up the shield has already been broken for 600 years  it is almost time for the earth dragons sealed underneath macedon to awaken from their slumber those evil earth dragons number several hundreds  no several thousands once they awaken there will be nothing that we can do  i will leave tiki in your care you can find her in the room to the right that divine dragon child should be able to help you battle the earth dragons but i will state clearly if the shield of seals is not restored tiki will be destroyed
huh  why is that 
that child is still developing without the shield of seals she will begin to degenerate eventually she will become wild and attack humans i made her sleep because i felt sad for her but if the shield of seals is restored i will no longer have to worry because the shield will protect tiki marth please take care of tiki you must rescue that child from the path of ruin
is that so you couldnt find them all  theres nothing you can do about it  please hand your collected shards to me tiki is sleeping in the room to the right but since the shield isnt restored i cant let you see her that child is still developing without the shield of seals she will begin to degenerate eventually she will become wild and attack humans i cannot allow tiki to awaken again it is for her own good  marth once youve obtained all the treasures head to the room to the left i will be waiting for you 
tiki are you alright 
uh 
tiki its me marth hey open your eyes
 marth    oh marth you came you came to see tiki
yes i hadnt seen tiki in a long time are you feeling well
uh  no the bishop told me that i had to sleep again but i dont want to  because when i sleep im always alone during my sleep i dreamt many nightmares there i became a wild dragon like those poor fire dragons and ice dragons i attacked humans and i killed them no  no  when i awoke i was all alone in the dark room  i felt so strange but also very scared  so very scared  but i couldnt leave that room i cried many times and then uncle bantu would come to comfort me as usual one day he took me away and took me to a human village living in that village was very fun and everybody treated me well  in the short time until i was discovered by gharnef i felt really happy i dont want to sleep anymore  i feel that if i close my eyes once more i will be unable to open them ever again i dont want that i want to live with everyone i dont want to sleep again
tiki its alright now i will protect you so dont cry 
really  i wont need to see those scary dreams again
thats right once the shield is restored tiki can live together with the rest of us dont worry believe in me
ah im so happy thank you marth
huh  who  who are you 
 ah  mar mar 
i see  so tiki was pretty happy it must have been very painful for her though it was to protect her i was far too cruel to her i suspect she must really hate me  you should go marth i will send you to altea with my powers
you should go marth i will send you to altea with my powers
lord gotoh why dont you come with us
hmm  at the moment ive one thing i must still investigate gharnef has returned
gharnef  but we killed him
yes you killed his body but his soul was held prisoner by the darksphere and within it his hatred only grew afterwards his former disciples  the heretic bishops  resurrected him and they seem to be planning something foul
i see very well lord gotoh we shall split ways here
indeed if i find something then i too will visit altea afterwards im counting on you marth everything rests on your shoulders you must save both our races from the path of destruction
 altea home at last though you may be occupied by archanea  i will get you back i swear
boy what a serious lady hey kris you said youre marths royal guard right
yes my mission is to protect prince marth
i see but if you really plan on protectin him then you need the strength to match your conviction hey do you wanna know a way to get stronger
hm you know of a way
 at long last altea my dearest home  archanean occupation be damned i will get you back i swear it
boy what a serious fella hey kris you said youre marths royal guard right
yes my mission is to protect prince marth at all costs
i see but if you really plan on protectin him then youre gonna need the strength to back up your conviction hey do you wanna know a way to get stronger
huh do you know how to
course just hold on a second
ta da kris you know about tiki right tikis still a kid but the real reason she can fight is because of her hairstyle and tiara
wait what are you serious
yeah if you wear your hair like this then youll be that much stronger so all you gotta do is wear this tiara and wear your hair like tiki if you do that then a legendary power will flow through you  well maybe so do you wanna give it a try
sure why not
alrighty then ill be sure to do this properly
thank you sir xane
  you arent doubting me is this trust or naivete 
is something the matter sir xane
ah no its nothin well see you around im looking forward to your new look
no thats quite alright i want to protect prince marth with my own strength
hmm that so boring
huh what do you mean boring
ah no its nothin catch you later

the 7th platoon and its commander kris are all present and accounted for yes from today forth you will train together as a team in your bid to become fully fledged knights the first half of your training will focus on developing your practical skills without further ado i will introduce the senior knight who is to be your instructor
i am cain the knight in charge of your practical training to hone your practical skills we will have a contest in the form of combat if you let your guard down it wont be just an injury youll be walking home with
even amongst the altean knights cain is one of our strongest men you must all become strong enough to earn his approval
well then lets begin todays training your enemies will consist of us altean knights as well as brave warriors whom i am proud to call friends the opponents are determined by the ability of each platoon 7th platoon your opponent is 
my squires my friends please go easy on me
oh its princess caeda prince marths fiancee shes so pretty  i feel nervous at the thought of fighting her 
let us see if youve got the ability talyss mercenaries shall fight you first
i see you know how to fight well in that case i will fight you next
fear wont help you approach with confidence and the intent to fight
youre a mercenary arent you  tee hee this looks promising come show me what you can do with your sword
an armored knight  ill be at a disadvantage with the way that i fight but i wont lose so easily come show me what youve got
youre a cavalier huh looks like youll be a good match for me come show me what youve got
so youre a fighter kris of the lance and the axe the axe is advantageous  i might be at a slight disadvantage but i wont lose easily come show me what youve got
kris youre an archer the bane of us pegasus knights  b but i will not sit idly by and lose to you show me everything you have
so youre a mage kris pegasus knights are resistant to magic you know im not going to lose this one come show me what youve got
kris youre a myrmidon huh teehee i feel somewhat drawn to you we should be friends from now on but that doesnt mean ill go easy on you in this fight come kris show me what you can do with that sword of yours
well well kris youre a pegasus knight just like me teehee we have so much in common  but i wont go easy on you for this battle you and your pegasus  shall we take to the skies
ngh 
that was a thrilling fight you are the first squires to have bested me in combat promise me that youll become knights worthy of helping marth
of course princess caeda
if you ever need help during the practical training do call on me and ill fight but as your companion
hm wed gladly appreciate your help but im not sure if we would be allowed to
what should we do i know how about we ask sir jagen
i have no qualms about your proposal you may borrow the help of friends if they offer as much
what a relief im certain princess caeda will make a reliable ally
but is it really alright to rely on others i dont see how this fits with our training 
hmph dont tell me youre still in the dark about prince marths method of fighting in the war of shadows
yes im sorry im not familiar with the details
then i shall tell you our victory in the previous war was not just by merit of altea gathering and fighting together with allies of various positions and statuses  this is how prince marth fights no matter when an ally came to our side they could instantly join the battle with us that is also a necessary skill for an altean knight
i see  i understand now
if we can combine our strengths when we fight im sure we can achieve anything right kris
yes youre right
no this i know the league led by prince marth didnt just consist of altea it went beyond the frontiers of nationality and included friend and foe alike 
yes our victory was not just the accomplishment of us altean knights overcoming status and position being able to fight together as equals  that is how prince marth fights no matter when an ally came to our side they could instantly join the battle with us that is also a necessary skill for an altean knight
i see  that will be important to our training i understand now
if we can combine our strengths when we fight im sure we can achieve anything right kris
yes youre right

from his exiled shores marth young prince of altea swore he would retake his homeland marth never forgot his oath years later he rallied an army at talys to defeat medeus starting with caeda talyss princess marth gathered together many allies duke hardin nynas guardian also became one of his trusted comrades with archaneas treasured fire emblem awarded to him by nyna marth led the archanean league as its commander
in the following battles the league wrestled back control of both archanea and altea finally after a long and fierce battle with shadow dragon medeuss forces  marth vanquished the shadow dragon  and thus did peace return to the world these are the events that transpired one year ago

luke how should we go about this
roderick you wait at the back ill fight alone its just kris and that kid right if thats all i should be able to handle it ill show them my true strength
youre at it again  fine have it your way but i think underestimating your opponent will get you into trouble
commander gotcha well ill be commander if you guys all insist
nobodys insisting anything luke 
excuse me id like to recommend kris
katarina 
kris is a really strong individual and he didnt abandon me during the mock combat yesterday even though i couldnt fight
alright then i challenge him kris if you beat me ill cede the position to you
huh h how has it come to this
its a challenge man to man kris youre not afraid to fight me are you
dont be silly kris wont lose to you
so well decide with a battle thatll let us know whos got the skill to be commander
im sorry kris that was selfish of me  but i couldnt stand hearing them make fun of you 
its okay when my grandfather trained me he used to say the same thing he said that the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting
huh y your grandfather sure sounds colorful  anyway our opponents are luke and roderick its been decided that ryan will be on our team
y yes ill do my best
commander gotcha oh whats that luke should be the one yes i completely agree
dont make up our words 
excuse me id like to recommend kris
katarina 
kris is a really strong individual and she didnt abandon me during the mock combat yesterday even though i couldnt fight
alright then i challenge her kris if you beat me ill recognize you as leader
huh h how has it come to this
its a challenge man to man
but im a woman 
well then its a man to woman challenge kris youre not afraid to fight me are you
dont be silly kris wont lose to you
so well decide with a battle thatll let us know whos got the skill to be commander
im sorry kris that was selfish of me  but i couldnt stand hearing them make fun of you 
its okay when my grandfather trained me he used to say something similar he said the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting well im a girl but 
anyway our opponents are luke and roderick its been decided that ryan will be on our team
y yes ill do my best
as i thought luke couldnt win alone i guess ill have to fight too
guah  i impossible  the future hero luke defeated 
urgh i see  you are even stronger than i had imagined 
kris ive heard rumors about you sir jagen said that there was a recruit who stood out from the rest of us
is that so
yeah thats right and i bet youre hogging all the attention overshadowing the rest of us ill beat you here to prove im the best prepare yourself
sorry kris but i wont hold back just because youre a girl
thats fine with me
ill show you what ive got kris try not to fall in love with me
kiddo just stand back and watch only kris is worthy of fighting me
kris ive heard the rumors about you as well i need to see your ability firsthand especially if youre to become the commander i ask you this as a fellow squire of altea
thank goodness  kris you won i knew you could do it
alright im a man of my word ill keep my promise from here on the commanderll be kris gah but i dont get it i was so confident in my skills how did i wind up losing
because we didnt fight together we took turns fighting kris one on one thats why we lost to himher
yeah my brother once said the same thing  even if we are weak individually we can become stronger by working together with our friends
thats right fighting with your friends that is the way of an altean knight
 i see i thought i could be the victor through my strength alone but i guess i was wrong fighting together is far more important 
luke  im so glad you understand now
yeah its all clear to me it looks like being the leader is more trouble than its worth so ill leave this bothersome job to kris im sure itll be a joy working under himher kris ill be looking forward to your help
 does he really get it
alright then kris now that youre the commander how about i give you a cool title
a title
yeah all the legendary heroes have their own awesome title hm lets see  looking at your eyes  its got to be kris the ordinary
i dont really understand  nor do i think its something worth celebrating
aw dont worry about it kris the ordinary

under the guidance of archsage gotoh marth and the others headed to macedons north to the wyverns dale it is an undeveloped region populated with wyverns and ruled by barbarians but there is no time to stop because the fate of the world is in marths hands
jagen where are we macedon or dolhr
both  we are precisely on the border i hear this place is home to macedons great wyverns but since the area is overrun with barbarians even the macedonian soldiers dare not set foot in here
i see you learn something new every day 
according to our scouts a large number of wyverns and barbarians have gathered nearby its like anris way  no its worse sire please be careful
got it lets go kris i need to know whats happened to my sister and the others  i have a dreadful feeling about this
there you are marth
youre 
who are you a barbarian of this dale please stand back sire
its alright kris this is ymir another ally from the last war when i met him he was holding off an entire army to protect some villagers hes a kind and brave man
yeah the names ymir i heard marth was fightin here and figured id come along too
i i see  how rude of me sir ymir please forgive my insolence
oh its okay my face is a bit on the scary side i gotta admit whats your name
ah yes i am the altean royal guard kris
kris what a name its a real pleasure to meet you
likewise
on the other side of the mountains is a small hill called the dragons table recently there have been eerie roaring sounds coming from there grandfather and the others are afraid a demon is about to awaken you mustnt get to close to that place
this is the wyverns dale dont go any further otherwise i fear youll be burnt to death by the wyverns
prince michalis what are you doing here and youve suffered a grave wound what happened
 marth   i have been waiting  for you 
huh
 take this 
  this is the starlight tome youre giving it to me
thats right  gharnef  only with this spell can he be harmed i managed to take it back from his possession 
gharnef where is he now
the dragons table  ha  i was careless  i could be  defeated by gharnef  marth  good luck  im already finished if minerva is still around  tell her to  in my place  rescue maria 
michalis
your highness  i leave marias fate to you  urgh
     brother  could it be  is it really you 
 minerva 
ah youre wounded ill go get help
dont bother  this wound is beyond help id rather you call for  prince marth i have  something i must pass on to him
the prince will be here soon hold on brother ill tend to your wound 
heh  to think id need your help in the end  guh  ngh 
brother
minerva  i have something to ask of you should i die  give this tome to prince marth this is as far as i can go  i leave the rest  to you 
b  brother  michalis  no  this isnt like you when did you become so weak the brother i knew was strong and noble  he always found his own way never relying on anyone else  do you hear me i wont accept this youre going to pass this on yourself without the help of your younger sister
hmph  am i being scolded now 
brother listen to me  you cannot die here you have to live 
so this is the dragons altar the place where divine dragon naga banished the earth dragons 
indeed medeus the altars guardian could not tolerate the human races atrocities against the manaketes thus he gathered the surviving dragonkin forming the dolhrian empire all to obliterate mankind he was vanquished by anri once and then defeated a second time by you however earth dragons boast tremendous life force and cannot be completely eliminated so easily  even now they sleep at this altar
you mean to say theyll awaken
not exactly even sleeping earth dragons should not awaken for centuries or so the next time medeus awakens though he will rise as a terrifying shadow dragon  no wait  perhaps  yes i see  so thats why gharnef 
whats the matter lord gotoh
prince marth i have finally realized the reason why gharnef kidnapped the clerics he intends to use them to resurrect medeus to hasten the awakening of a dragon requires the life force of pure maiden women knowing this gharnef kidnapped them
so that means elice and the others are in this very altar
indubitably  marth you must hurry they are in grave danger medeuss awakening  is only a matter of time
sir ymir please forgive me for earlier
its fine i dont mind at all its rare to see someone like me anyway but its so warm dressin like this why doesnt anybody else do this i dont get it
oh is it warm
yeah its great during winter hey why dont you try wearin this for a change its a hat made from animal hide just wear it youre gonna see how amazin it is right away
this is  wow it is a pretty great hat
see it fits you well do you want to wear it for a bit
yes id love to
whoa im so stoked you said that itll look great on you no doubt about it
oh no i dont think it suits me
that so  too bad but oh well
im sorry after you went to all that trouble too 
its fine its fine i dont mind at all
brother   brother  why  why here  i  i never wanted to fight you  i just wanted things to be like they used to  with you and maria  brother   michalis  bro ther  
 your tears  how long has it been since i saw them last 
what  m michalis are you 
i dont plan on dying in front of you minerva id be an endless laughing stock the michalis you knew  would never die in a place like this am i right
brother  oh brother
hmph dont get the wrong idea you and i are still enemies  that will not change the incompetence of your army sickens me so you leave me with no choice but to help
thank goodness  youve finally returned to your old self i understand until the shadow dragon breathes his last let us borrow your strength

oh my if it isnt the broken puppet i wonder  should i call you ungrateful trash or traitorous trash but i must say its very brave of you to show your face in front of me again eine
meeting you again  crushes my heart id rather die frankly  but if i can be of use to kris then i will not run away
a junk puppet talking like a human being the only word youre ever allowed to say is yes ill make sure that mouth of yours starts working properly right away
sire weve seized control of the area the assassins shall target you no longer
i see thank you
according to the villagers nearby  that woman called eremiya used to be a kind bishop who looked after war orphans but during the war her orphanage was burned down and all the children killed  ever since then  she changed
so she was yet another victim of the war that does not erase her sins but  tis truly a tragedy
however at the very least there wont be more victims like katarina
indeed thats my only comfort let us go kris there are still things we must do
yes sire
 bah  so you failed in the end   eremiya
master  gharnef  forgive  me  for not  fulfilling your order 
oh you dont need to apologize the ritual to revive the shadow dragon shall soon begin you and your underlings were useful enough for capturing the clerics heh heh it was worth the trouble casting that spell on you 
what a spell  on me 
yes dont you remember but of course poor poor eremiya my spell stole that memory as well once upon a time you felt grief the corpses of the orphans killed in the war haunted your very existence you wondered what you could have done so that they might have survived 
i  never wanted  to let those children die 
and then i told you you had to make the children stronger twisted yes but they became stronger so they wouldnt die just as you wanted well have you remembered now
thats right i  i made those children 
heh heh  hypocrites like you and marth disgust me despairing over the orphans deaths you fell all too easily under my spell and then you gathered children subjecting them to hellish training just as i told you to you watched the children cry and scream  and yet you smiled  heh heh twas quite a sight
ah  ahh   aaaaah   my   my  children  aaaaaah
heh heh  worry not eremiya the despair you feel now is nothing this world will soon be enveloped in the darkest despair  you had better look forward to it marth heh heh heh

grust has been liberated
all that remains is olbern keep where general lang remains barricaded lang used his influence to steal belongings daughters and lives from the people of grust was there ever a man as cruel as he is
altean knights charge
kris you should be aware that lang is a general with high defense to defeat him you would do well to attack with magic or a special weapon like an armorslayer
duly noted
if you plan to defeat him with strength alone youd have to be extremely powerful
kris your strength is simply tremendous against a blow from you langs armor would crumple like paper please in my stead kill that insolent man
yes sir
kris your strength is quite impressive you might just be able to defeat lang please in my stead kill that insolent man
kris you are sadly not very strong but you could fight using your other talents please in my stead kill that insolent man
heh heh heh  so the alteans have come reinforcements are arriving soon if we can hold out a little longer we can make a pincer attack swordsman navarre when they open that door you make your move there is no need for restraint slice them to pieces
yeah  sure though the knights of altea are hardly worthy enemies
oh ho thats my navarre they say not even ogma of talys is your equal
what ogma n  naturally  a guy like him is no match for me
i see glad to hear it then ill leave this place in your capable hands navarre
sire there seems to be movement near the front of the castle and it would appear to be moving towards our forces
are they enemy reinforcements or allies to our cause 
i do not know but  i do hope they are allies
sire
frey thank goodness youre safe
you too sire norne and i escaped from altea castle and we rode here as fast as we could
but the rest of our forces were scattered  im sorry we couldnt all make it
you dont have to apologize im just glad that youre safe the others can take care of themselves
sire from here on we shall accompany you please give us your orders
oh and please be careful i caught a glimpse of enemy troops approachin the castle behind us i expect theyll be enterin the castle soon
enemy reinforcements i understand thank you
navarre please hear me out lend your sword to our case just once more
what who are you ill have no business with women or children  but theres a first for everything  whoa shes smoking what business do you have with me
   y youre not navarre who are you
yikes ive been exposed huh im actually a stingy mercenary known as samuel somehow i keep getting mistaken for this famous navarre swordsman guy i got tired of it after a while so i decided to pose as him and got myself hired but i dont like this general lang guy either if youre alright with it ill lend you my sword
yes  youll do just fine 
navarre  you bastard 
stay away  this evening my killing edge hungers for blood 
do you mean to kill me no matter what hmph very well i knew that wed have to settle our score eventually
wait  stay your blade  im no navarre im just a sham i  its me samuel have you forgotten ogma
samuel samuel the gladiator from knorda
yes i was a slave gladiator at the time and you really helped me out even when everyone was making their escape you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught 
  
i heard everything from my friends how you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse how by chance the young princess talys tears in her eyes stood up for you and saved you and thats why you swore your blade to talys or rather  to the princess 
enough  say no more no more its in the past now  no more 
 ogma  anyway i want to repay you im following you from now on okay
i pity your soul but i can at least grant you a quick death take this my killing edge
doh i shouldnt have said that i was navarre 
w wait please im sorry  please forgive me  ive only done as the emperor ordered me to i didnt agree with him but i had no choice so  so please s spare my life  ill do anything you say yes  just like this  mwahaha you shouldnt have let your guard down you fool  now die
urgh  impossible  i have been defeated 
general lang i have  with my own eyes  witnessed a number of your crimes i cannot forgive you but if you have something to say i will listen
s silence  silence you damned country boy prince youre a fool for coming here just die already
is that your answer then prepare yourself
y you youre that impertinent little girlboy from before 
lang you have oppressed countless people and insulted my liege you can only atone for these sins with your life
w  why you
lord wendell thank goodness youre unharmed
lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned even though i told him that i must fulfill a mission assigned to me by archsage gotoh 
a mission from lord gotoh
thats correct  you have seen the starsphere  the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface in order to pierce gharnefs shadowy veil lord gotoh created a sacred spell named starlight from that orb
unfortunately the strain on the starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards which scattered into the sky lord gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power and that if even one of them is lost the world will fall into irreparable ruin by any means possible we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the starsphere
is  is this a joke that the world could just end  this is all very hard to take in but arent these the star shards if so we already have a few after we retake altea wed be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs
of course  your country was only just invaded by the empire  i understand prince  i too shall fight to restore altea then thinking about it my meeting with you is like a sign from lord gotoh himself in that case i shall surrender myself to fate but please lets stop by the fane of raman we may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple
understood if its the fane of raman we can go there on our way to altea
general lang has been defeated and now the people of grust no longer have to suffer
thats right sire
kris since leaving altea weve had a great deal of fights  looking back at them now 
none of our companions were hurt and none of them died thats what im happiest about kris its because youve been here thank you so much
it couldnt be helped but  some of our comrades were injured or passed on i dont want to lose anyone from now i know we can do it if youre there kris please help me
all i remember is seeing our companions fall one by one  enough i dont want any of our comrades to suffer that pain kris please help me
sire some new information has come in from the patrol just ahead the enemy seems to be preparing some kind of ambush its not the archanean empire but likely i fear mercenaries hired with coin
mercenaries is it  do we continue as we are or take a longer safer route personally id rather not detour we have to return to altea as soon as possible
hmph if you would allow me to speak as your tactician  i think we ought to stay here and fight we will be facing mercenaries the altean knights would never lose to mere mercenaries
kris your thoughts
i agree with sir jagen
i see thank you jagen kris the whole army shall move on as they were well hit the mercenaries head on

once there was a war known as the war of shadows an epic battle between prince marths heroes and the dolhrian empire which ended with the defeat of the earth dragon king medeus the warriors who had united under the fire emblem returned to their own lands devoting themselves to the reconstruction of their homelands among the nations that made up the seven kingdoms of archanea gra and grust were devastated altea aurelis macedon and talys were left deeply scarred and even the mighty kingdom of archanea was undergoing restoration
however in the palace still shaken by war one important event took place hardin the younger brother of king aurelis was married to princess nyna becoming the twenty fourth king of house archanea after ascending the throne hardin aggressively restored the country in the twinkling of an eye and formed a powerful army by gathering many soldiers he then proclaimed the restoration of the holy archanean empire and himself emperor
one year has passed since the war with dolhr the world seemed to be moving towards an era of peace however unbeknownst to man the cogs of destiny had started spiraling out of order
it has been a year since the war of shadows ended the war ravaged kingdom of altea was finally starting to regain stability thanks to prince marths efforts prince marths engagement to princess caeda was announced and the people of altea rejoiced sharing their happiness however  nearing the day of their wedding an unexpected letter arrived from the imperial palace containing an imperial edict
dear prince marth of altea in the kingdom of grust now under imperial rule a large scale rebellion has broken out i request your kingdoms assistance in its subjugation your highness is to lead the entire army of altea and sortie at once suppressing the grustian rebellion   the emperor of archanea
the kingdom of archanea was alteas suzerain so its orders were absolute forced to comply marth ordered the knight cain to protect his homeland and together with jagen the paladin arran and the young newly appointed knights left altea on the grustian expedition
kris well be arriving shortly this is your first real battle is it not battles will be different from here on out defeat on the battlefield means death any allies you lose will never return  that is the harsh reality of war you must take the utmost care not to get yourself killed
of course sire
you and everyone else  it would be wonderful if we could end this battle without losing anyone 
sire 
sire we have made arrangements for a transport convoy we will also have merchants accompanying us who will sell us weapons and items i daresay they will be invaluable during battle preparations
thank you jagen then lets begin our preparations at once
sire this is general lang the commanding officer of the occupational forces
oho so you are prince marth glad you could make it here since youve come all this way i suppose ill let you have the glory of capturing the rebel leader general lorenz
what general lorenz leads the rebels what would possess him to rebel of all things
who knows i havent the foggiest idea and frankly i dont care prince you are to kill general lorenz and reclaim the children of the grustian royal family that hes hiding while you do that  we will slaughter the families of those who participated in this rebellion and raze their homes to the ground
are you insane theyre innocent civilians
i insane young man are you questioning my orders perhaps altea too plans to rebel against archanea 
of course not thats not 
prince marth your tiny country means absolutely nothing to me your rude behaviour is merely an irritation do not forget that i have the power of the empire behind me i can crush weak pesky insects like you any time i wish
jagen  what in the world is going on here how could hardin have entrusted this country to such a vile man
sire i understand how you feel however lorenz has begun a rebellion that much seems to be true so we ought to do something about that first sire why dont you try speaking to general lorenz personally allow me to stay by your side and serve as your tactician royal guard kris when prince marth is in danger on the battlefield protect him at all costs that is an order
acknowledged
kris i have no need to worry if youre here lets clean up the bandits and head to general lorenzs position
yes sir
after the last war princess nyna let this country keep its sovereignty under the rule of general lorenz however as soon as hardin became emperor general lorenz was banished and langs troops came crawling in lang stole everything from us he stole our gold of course but he even stole our food and our loved ones  ah  if only general camus were here then we wouldnt have to live in fear of people like lang
there arent any young girls left in this country they were all taken away by the imperial troops they say general lang keeps the really pretty ones to himself what a dark insane chapter in grusts history 
the late king grust had two children princess yuliya and prince jubelo theyre still young maybe thirteen or fourteen cute little twins both of them in the last war gharnef the dark pontifex kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king they were taken to khadein the city of magic and locked away in a pitch black room at great personal risk pontifex wendell saved them he took them to a monastery to protect them
general lorenz took the royal children from lord wendell and raised them in grust the empire demanded their extradition but lorenz was afraid they would be killed and hid them the empire branded lorenz a traitor and sent general lang here lang did horrible things to find the royal children thats why we rose up but we lost and now lang is going to kill everyone in this entire country
i heard that general lorenz lived in talys when he was young talys wasnt unified at the time so there were a number of noble houses contending for control lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch of one house and together they unified talys into one country lorenz and that patriarch  now the king of talys  remain close friends to this day
i only saw him briefly but that knight arran looked awfully pale you know hes probably hit the wall so to speak i doubt hell get any stronger no matter how much he fights 
oh  please show mercy to just this child shes only ten years old
maam please calm yourself i am not here to take any children
what  youre not imperial soldiers
no  were not we didnt come to fight if theres anything you need please ask its not much but we can give you food
wait  please take me with you 
huh  youre  are you really ten
no  im a grown woman but granny lied so that i wouldnt be taken away by the soldiers langs soldiers are all monstrous but youre different you have very sweet eyes please take me with you i want you to take me away from this country and take me to yours
its not safe for her to stay here please take her with you and protect her you can marry her too if you like marisha is a beautiful good natured lady just like me im sure shell make a fine wife
no no no granny its far too early for that now youve made marisha all flustered
oh a battle is it were in luck boys lets loot em villages before ey realize whats hit em
alright that will do for now  sir ogma please forgive me for getting you involved in this mess
i am here on king talyss orders as such i will do everything in my power to help
i see  then i have a favor to ask of you i want you to escort these children to macedon these children  prince jubelo and princess yuliya are king grusts orphans please take them safely to lord wendell in macedon
understood  i will guard these two with my life
thank you sir ogma  now prince jubelo princess yuliya you will be leaving with sir ogma
no im not going i wont leave you behind
princess  i cannot go with this wound i can barely even walk it saddens me but you two must go on without me
you took that grievous wound to protect us  how can you tell us to just leave you behind now i will never leave we will never leave your side lorenz
what shall i do general
hmm  this is most troublesome princess yuliya is not one to change her mind easily  we will remain here
in that case i will find some other way to help you i will find lang and bring him down  i will bury him with this sword i swear on it general lorenz you must hold out until then 
prince marth so it is you  how unfortunate that i must fight  the altean army and its prince 
please wait i do not wish to fight with you i heard about everything from the villagers ive heard of all the atrocities archanea has committed i promise i will inform emperor hardin of the truth and rescue grust so please lower your weapons
prince  i am grateful for the offer but i am afraid that i cannot comply prince you know nothing do you think that a man of emperor hardins caliber would make a general out of a man as worthless as lang without good reason he called for an invasion to crush the kingdom of grust and make it a territory of the empire
no it cant be hardin would never do something like that
i know its hard to believe but im afraid that ever since he became emperor he has changed a great deal he is no longer the hardin you once knew prince i have one final request of you in this stronghold i am protecting the young prince and princess of grust please find a way to help them if you can do just that i will have no regrets
what  general lorenz what are you saying 
prince marth  my life in exchange for theirs  by any means necessary please help them  this is the last thing i will ask
general lorenz   this cant be happening  
what youre  the altean army so even altea has turned on us 
forgive me people of grust 
prince marth  general lorenz entrusted everything to you you spared his life and even heard him out we the people of grust thank you please let me offer you a token of our gratitude here were protecting prince jubelo and princess yuliya in this stronghold i beg you do what you must to protect our last fragments of hope 
you youre  grusts royal heirs  prince jubelo and princess yuliya
sniff  lorenz  hes gone  how can we live on without him
you monsters stay away youre going to murder us just like you murdered lorenz
no you have it all wrong we just 
ah  prince marth you finally caught these filthy traitors
general lang wait please these children have done nothing wrong allow me to take custody of them
dont make me laugh these brats are coming with me to my castle besides my dear prince you have other more important priorities i have received reports that there has been a military revolt in macedon and princess minerva has been imprisoned
what  how could that happen to macedon i understand my obligations general lang still these children  let them stay with me please
prince do not try my patience listen up you two youre coming with me
no let me go jubelo  help me
yuliya  yuliya 
wait lang release them at once
sire give me the order and ill get them safely back at once
sire dont do it you too kris if we oppose lang right here right now we run the risk of being branded traitors by archanea
but jagen are you telling me to simply allow lang to take them i cannot stand for that 
i understand how you feel sire  but please remain patient for a little longer if we head to macedon  then rescue princess minerva macedon will surely lend us its strength
/***EOF***/
to avoid needless battle the altean army decided to cross the central mountain range said to be impassable for a large army going through adria pass one will soon reach the city of pales hurry we cant let the enemy spot us we must charge straight through marth and the others were anxious but they carried on advancing across the narrow mountain road but they didnt expect in the middle of the cliff to be ambushed by an unfathomable enemy they were the northern kingdom of aurelis elite squad the wolfguard who had headed south to aid archanea
kris if we can get through this pass we will be on archaneas doorstep just hang in there a little longer
yes sire
despite all the odds weve surpassed anris way and taken back altea  the battles weve faced up to now  have been nothing short of difficult and in those battles 
weve managed to keep everyone alive with the strength of all our comrades we can accomplish something worthy of anri  im so proud of everyone
sire  
its thanks to our friends that our country is free i cannot help but think of the fallen i want to become stronger for them from now on lets live so that no one falls again 
sire  
 the feeling of pain overwhelms me when i think of the severely wounded and the many who have fallen  perhaps if i had been stronger like anri then everyone would still be alive  from now  from now on i will definitely 
sire  
wolf sedgar vyland is this really okay  can we really fight this battle
roshea what are you trying to say look the altean army is marching long the narrow mountain road nows our only chance to defeat them
yes roshea we swore that we could sacrifice our lives for lord hardin lord hardin was the one who freed us plains people from slavery if we dont fight altea now millennium court will fall do you want lord hardin to be defeated by them
thats right prince marth wants to destroy archanea and conquer the world and thats why he joined forces with macedon to crust grust now he even has gra under his rule if we dont do something the whole world will fall under his control
i still dont believe it i cannot believe prince marth would have such ambitions
what are you saying that emperor hardin lied do you think that he would stoop to such a low enough roshea you disappoint me if you want to betray us then go ahead sedgar vyland lets go if were too slow they will pass us
hey wait i wont betray you i understand  ill go
the wolfguard of aurelis must we fight them as well 
sire please hold on weve just received word from a messenger of king aurelis it seems aurelis has no plans to war  according to the messenger king aurelis wishes to parley with you in the village
what what could this mean that the wolfguard is moving independent of aureliss orders
i dont know but  depending on how negotiations go its possible the wolfguard may signal a retreat
i see it would benefit us all if we could avoid pointless fighting lets hurry to the village
oh prince marth it is good to see you
huh arent you king aurelis what are you doing here
i came here to stop my countrys army also i must apologise to your highness i believed hardins words and followed archanea but i now realize my wrongs archaneas empress nyna secretly sent me a letter saying that hardin isnt normal and is ill  my country will remain neutral and its knights will return to aurelis i hope you wont attack my men anymore
i understand your highness i dont want to fight with you please forgive me for taking so many of your knights lives
oh you really are like what the rumors say my body is frail and i have no children and even hardin my younger brother has completely changed prince marth please protect aurelis in my place i will hand my whole country to you i give this jewel to you as a gift this is a magical jewel containing the divine power of life i spent a lot of gold to buy it from a travelling merchant i believe it will be useful to you dont worry about hardin since he is a knight it is natural for him to die in battle that is his fate well prince marth i will go on ahead i hop you will all be safe 
i am roshea of the aurelis knights i dont want to fight but i cant betray my companions please forgive me 
as long as were here we wont let you get to millennium court if you dont want to die run back to your country
you  why are you invading other countries have you been blinded by ambition
the leader of aurelis knights wolf is here for your head
lord hardin 
kris weve made it through the palace is not far i have only you to thank for this you do nothing but help me
no its not like that it was your decision sire i just came up with the idea
thats hardly the whole truth the times when im lost in my thoughts if youre there i have confidence im thankful for that more than anything
sire weve just received urgent news apparently a coup detat broke out in the palace the knights and citizens who opposed emperor hardins ways rose in rebellion
what in the blazes what has happened to them now
unfortunately the instigators were all defeated and captured  rumor has it that the rebels are being executed by the day
damn it hardin  this is absurd its decided we will head for the palace at once and end this kris lets go
yes sire
kris weve made it through the palace is not far i have only you to thank for this you do nothing but help me
no not at all i just made a random suggestion
thats hardly the whole truth the times when im lost in my thoughts if youre there i have confidence im thankful for that more than anything
sire weve just received urgent news apparently a coup detat broke out in the palace the knights and citizens who opposed emperor hardins ways rose in rebellion
what in the blazes what has happened to them now

kris  the final battle is nigh medeus awaits us up ahead it wont be an easy battle  i dare not imagine how many of us will be left standing at the end  either way the fate of this world rests on our hands 
sire  worry not sire we will emerge victorious thats what the fortune teller said
fortune teller
when i was a child i asked our villages fortune teller for a reading  the old lady held the palm of my hand and said to me  ah your fate is clear to me child
and what did she say
she said that i would grow up to be a legendary hero 
she said that i would live out my life quietly 
she said that i would follow my calling like an arrow 
she said that i would devote my life to the service of others 
she said that i would be stupidly rich and famous 
oh  i can imagine that happening 
and she said that id live until i was a hundred years old 
til a hundred  that is an awfully long time  oh i see  if the fortune teller was right then 
then we are definitely walking out of this hall victorious im not quite that old yet  so rest easy sire
haha youre quite right i  feel much calmer now thank you kris 
i see my sister and the others  but who are they guarding  no it cant be  thats  thats medeus 
with the princesses around him sire youll be unable to strike down medeus if we dont do something soon then the other dragons will awaken and this battle will rapidly escalate into mayhem
then what do you suppose i do how on earth can we save them tell me jagen
i  i do not know  but if we are to defeat medeus we must stop at nothing 
what  you cant mean to kill them
it may be  necessary as they are now they suffer greatly we must save them even if it should cost them their lives 
jagen this  is this really a decision i must make
you are alteas crown prince sire a ruler must be ready for anything though it may cost them their happiness that is all
enough jagen i understand still i cannot accept it there must be another way even till the very end i will never give up
kris i know how prince marth feels please i beg of you  please find a way to save them
understood i will try my best but if the occasion should arise  even if prince marth himself refuses i shall release them from their misery  but for now  i dont want to think about it i still want to hope

marth and the others were transported to alteas outskirts by gotohs magic they were ready to begin the battle to reclaim their homeland the commander of archaneas army general eibel had ordered the gra knights to charge to buy time at the same time he prepared many dishonorable tactics and waited for the chance to defeat alteas army in one swift blow before his fond homeland marths battles were about to begin once again we will reclaim our captical of anri we will reclaim our homeland prince marths voice resounded through alteas skies they had travelled a difficult journey but their destination was finally reached
sire the war council will begin soon
thank you kris  huh wh what happened to your hair 
sir xane did it for me he said that a legendary power would enter me if i wear this tiara and this hairstyle complements it anything to become stronger 
 l legendary power oh xanes handiwork i see he can certainly be a handful 
general the missing altean remnants have finally returned
really haha  what good timing we will follow our original plan have gras soldiers move out to lure them and then defeat them in one go
understood but what about him
the paladin abel it doesnt matter if he betrays me if he does you will kill the female hostage he has already retired from the army he wont swear loyalty to the prince again ha ha  how will they avoid fighting abel  this will be very interesting to watch 
prince marth i have been waiting for you and you have finally returned
oh dolph youre a general of archanea though why would you come to my side
ive given up my position and have left emperor hardins side there is no justice left in archanea but justice lies in your altea and thats why ive come to you
i see then dolph will you fight with us
indeed i shall let this battle be a testament to my faith in you
abel why are you  i dont believe this youre betraying your homeland
lord marth  please forgive me  they took est  if i didnt fight  they would kill her  but after meeting your highness i can no longer  fight  against altea  est  im sorry please forgive me
abel  im sorry you must have suffered
est youre safe
yes lord marth rescued me im alright now
really  damn archanea  but how should i apologize to lord marth 
im sorry  it was all because of me
no est it was nothing to do with you those fools  i wont forgive them  ill show them how deep my anger is
in the forts are many enemies dont be careless
oh you  where did you all go to you all went missing for so long that everyone became very worried about you
the kingdom of gra views altea as its enemy but in reality they were forced to fight because of their alliance with archanea
after altea fell elice was taken to an unknown place by a black robed bishop  oh  princess elice  i pray that you are safe and well 
since being ruled by the imperial army our days have been difficultly passed but we all believed that lord marth would definitely come back for us he would rescue us all from our suffering  because our lord marth is the warrior of light chosen by the deities  the starlord
nearby are enemy spies be careful they will come from the forts
the mercenaries protecting the castle are alteas elites it would be great if they could become your allies
oh your highness youve finally come i have been waiting to give this to you however this village and the neighboring village 
mmm i understand but for the sake of everyone you should start to make up with them 
your highness  please forgive me  i dont want to lose est 
est 
what being able to defeat my great army are you even human
my archanea army could be defeated 
that was quite a battle is everyone alright
theres no need for concern sire everybody has eagerly awaited this day
sir jagen speaks truly weve been fighting for this day   the day we reclaim our homeland
yet because of archaneas actions so many innocent lives have been lost how can i face them  ive caused them great sorrow because i was too weak  was i presumptuous in believing i could protect my homeland
sire  do you remember sire the words you said to us on the very first day of our training
kris   of course i could never forget  
alone i am powerless so everyone from now on i want you to lend me your power as my knights
upon hearing your words i decided that i would work hard so that i could be of assistance to you sire i want to become like you there is no need for you to shoulder everything on your own your pain and your suffering  they are not yours to bear alone i will always be by your side
kris  
sire chin up we must still recapture altea castle i believe that our enemies are well prepared for us but it is our castle we know it better than they do sire give us the command we will fight to recover our home
that was a tough battle is everyone alright
dont worry sire everybody has eagerly awaited this day
sir jagen speaks truly weve been fighting for this day   the day we reclaim our homeland
yet so many innocent lives have been stolen by archanea no apology is worthy for them  ive caused them great sorrow because of my unreliability  was i presumptuous in believing i could protect my homeland
sire  do you remember sire the words you said to us on the very first day of our training
kris   of course i could never forget  
alone i am powerless so everyone from now on i want you to lend me your power as my knights
upon hearing your words i decided that i would become your strength sire i wish to be your sword there is no need for you to shoulder your burden alone your pain and your suffering  do not let them be yours to bear alone i will always be by your side
kris  
sire chin up we must still recapture altea castle i believe that our enemies are well prepared for us but it is our castle we know it better than they do sire give us the command we will fight to recover our home
by the way kris about your tiara  did it work did you feel the er legendary power
no i didnt feel any different
as i suspected  kris i believe xane pulled a fast one on you
i is that so 
in light of this would you like to return your hair to the way it was before
yes thank you
good im glad weve sorted that out
/***EOF***/
this was a fierce battle like no other but their homeland of altea has been liberated all that remains is the castle  if i could regain altea castle where i was born  everybody thank you  i really must thank you all for placing your trust in me  before marths face flowed shimmering tears  even the girl who gently wiped his tears away couldnt prevent her own tears 
kris weve returned at long last were back where it all began 
yeah its a curious feeling it feels like yesterday that i first stepped foot here and yet it seems so far away 
yes i remember when you first arrived here for training you had no experience of battle and now 
youve grown into one of the continents finest young soldiers kris with you here i have no doubt that we can reclaim our homeland were all counting on you
you have gained much experience as a knight of altea kris your efforts will decide whether or not we will succeed in reclaiming altea were counting on you
hmm  you havent really changed very much from how you were back then kris you must work harder on the battlefield from now on im counting on you
how disgraceful  thieves inside our fair castle what if theyve stolen the geosphere
sire weve sighted a suspicious looking thief making his way north we should capture him before its too late
sire if youd allow me the honor i will go your orders please
how disgraceful  they let thieves inside the castle what if theyve stolen the geosphere
sire weve sighted a suspicious looking thief making his way north we should capture him before its too late
sire if necessary i shall recover it your orders my lord
prince marth please hold on
macellan did you come here with dolph
correct dolph and i are going to be your reinforcements archanea has nothing left for me for the justice that i believe in allow me to fight by your side again prince marth
lord willow permission to open the door and attack
wait dont be so hasty inform me as soon as any of the chests in the treasury are opened we will sortie the moment that happens both the thieves and the alteans will want their greasy hands on the loot while theyre busy trying to unload the chests we will take that chance and attack heh heh  this is a battle of intellect not brawn dont forget attack when the chests are sprung
whats that the chests have been sprung now open the door heh heh heh their panicked faces will be glorious
you foul traitors taste the might of my mercurius
midia 
astram how are you doing
so its the traitor jeorge what do you want with me
wait astram general eibel has already fallen you wont be able to win even if you continue fighting
you want me to surrender  never even if i am the last one standing i am a warrior of archanea to the end
why are you  who are you fighting for are you fighting for emperor hardin
no its not because of that man but because of nyna  and for archanea
but did nyna tell you to fight here do you really think that nyna would hope for this kind of battle
well  i hadnt seen nyna for a while i was told that she fell ill and that i couldnt see her but  since hardin is emperor of archanea i have no choice if i dont follow his orders i will become a traitor and i will be betraying nyna
astram nyna already entrusted the emblem to prince marth do you understand the meaning of her actions
wh what when did this happen jeorge nyna requested prince marth for help
i believe that is the only explanation astram if you want to find out the truth then come with us  if you die here what will midia do you must live on for her you must live on so you can confirm with your eyes what is happening
hmm  i guess i have no choice but jeorge if this war is as hardin said and was caused by prince marths ambitions i will never forgive you remember that
hahaha  its time for me to show you  the destructive power of my meteor magic 
emperor hardin forgive me 
sire its over
at long last altea is ours once more
weve all the reason to be happy but is there news of elice 
sire we have routed the enemy
at last altea is ours once more
yes its a wondrous feeling but is there news of elice 
prince marth  can you hear me i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings but it would seem that princess elice has been kidnapped by gharnef
lord gotoh  do you speak truly
i have found out that gharnef commanded his priests to search for clerics of noble birth it is most likely that lena and your sister were spirited away by gharnef
it cant be what does he intend to do with them
that i do not know but something foul is on the cards there can be no doubt of gharnefs involvement in this series of unfortunate events
lord gotoh where is gharnef now
i believe princess nyna is his next target he is probably  at archaneas palace
i understand then i too shall go to archanea i still have to free hardin from the darkspheres influence i will defeat the dark pontifex gharnef and rescue my sister  no ill save all of them
hello kris its been too long since we last spoke casually in altea castle this place holds a lot of memories for you doesnt it your long days of training  not to mention you met katarina here
