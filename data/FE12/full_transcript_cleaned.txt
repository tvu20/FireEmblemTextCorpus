still smarting from their bitter experience with gharnef and the dark magic imhullu prince marth and the league regrouped and marched south  home to altea once marths kingdom had been beautiful blessed with rich soil and clear waters now the eyes tended to notice instead the barren farms the ruins forlorn stares marth vowed to free altea from its torment without any further delay
youve done it marth were here thats altea beneath our feet  your home
countless days have passed since dolhr took my kingdom from me  days i would never have lived had it not been for my sister elices sacrifice and the sacrifices of so many others 
what became of your sister and the rest of your family what of them as well
my father as you know died in gra i last saw my mother and sister the day the castle fell i do not know if they still live but i hope that they do and if the enemy has them i will rescue them you can be sure of that
sire our preparations are complete we are ready to march
thank you
alteans and friends of the league join me now help me set altea free and ensure today is the last battle my people must endure
listen well because this is very important there are two villages in the northwest of altea the easterly village is home to a paladin named arran while the westerly village is home to a hero named samson theyre both fine men and warriors but their villages have been feudin for years you should probably resign yourself to the fact that youll only get one of them to join your ranks give it some thought the hero to the west or the paladin to the east
a vip card will gain you entrance to secret shops where are the shops well thats the secret
a lad named xane has been locked up in the eastern jail they say hes got some sort of amazing power wonder what it is
three orbs are enshrined at the fane of raman each brimming with power what sort of power none can say well except those who have wielded it right
the altean army welcome home its good to see you these years been nowt but dark days its about time we had something bright to look forward to
take care when usin a devil sword its a powerful blade to be sure  but it might just claim your life instead of your foes
princess elice was prepared to die that day the castle fell but she didnt they say instead of killin her the dark pontifex gharnef spirited her off somewhere oh our poor princess  i hope shes safe
my name is samson once i was a swordfighter of some renown but that was then and this is now im happy enough with my life here in the village but if you need another man i will fight unfortunately there has always been bad blood between our village and the next one over theyll have closed the gates to you the moment they saw you come here guess that means the paladin arran wont be fightin with you thems the breaks
sire my name is arran once i was a captain to many knights  but things change and i came to live here in this village if you need warriors for the coming struggle i would be honored to fight unfortunately there has always been bad blood between this village and our neighbors no doubt they closed their gates to you as soon as they saw you come here you wont be able to recruit the hero samson now im afraid
hey there princey thanks for settin me free the names xane i hail from a land few have heard of an even fewer have seen i wont trouble you with the details me and my folk have the power to transform into other people we can shape shift you see when doluna caught on they started threatenin me told me to join their army or face my doom hah well i wasnt about to waste my considerable talent on those evil coots you on the other hand youve got character say why dont we team up i do owe you for savin my hide and i think youll find my talents are quite considerable
well done rabble anyone else would be dead by now a shame you must end your campaign right here before your own gates
rrgh general camus  the rest  is in your  hands 
well done sire the enemy has ceased their resistance victory is ours
bravo marth on behalf of house archanea i wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations
thank you nyna but its still too soon to celebrate we havent freed the castle yet
sire your soldiers have assembled for the castle raid perhaps you could say a few words first 
altean warriors  brave comrades the road has been long but at last we have driven dolhr from my homeland there are not words to express my gratitude to you all you gave altea back to me thank you  thank you  an army of foes still haunt my castle i mean to kick them out ready my friends lets send these varlets scurrying
/***EOF***/
it never had much in the way of riches but neither did it have much trouble all that changed when a pirate crew fell upon the town and made it their hideout here in galder history records marths first steps toward freeing his homeland
prince marth i am ogma a mercenary of talys the king has bid me and my three men join your army cavalry has arrived from the west flying grusts standard they mean to take your life sire be careful
a pirate callin himself darros wants to talk to your prince says hes washed his hands of pillagin and plunderin and wants to fight for the good of all hah right  and im a farmer whos been sworn off rain 
curates gain experience whenever they use their staves
hammers smash right through heavy armor you should pick one up when you get the chance
oh mighty prince of altea please will you save sister lena shes gone up into the ghouls teeth to tend to the sick there we warned her i swear we did  lena is our angel if something befell her i  no i wont think of it take this gold weve 5000 pieces just promise youll use it to bring her home to us unharmed
ahoy prince marth i be darros a simple man o the sea ive had me fill o the piratin life and now i be lookin tstart anew what say ye make me yer matey and i swear tpull me load
castor it is you isnt it must even good men like you betray talys now
princess caeda oh im sorry but me mothers sick and the medicine dont buy itself see 
so you agreed to fight for the pirates in exchange for coin all right then if its gold you need take mine here this is all i have take it and go to your mothers side
but princess i betrayed you  ach ive been a fool forgive me princess let me fight for you now me life is yours
ogma
princess 
i never got to thank you for coming along with us theres no swordsman i trust more ive seen your strength
you dont need to thank me princess im just doing my job speaking of which your father would flay me if you came to any harm do me a favor and leave the dangerous fighting to me and my men
i dont need protecting ogma  ive got another job for you protect marth for me
but princess 
hes very important to me and the world  but mostly to me so do as i ask ogma keep him safe thats my first and last request
very well how could i say no to you
thank you ogma i knew youd understand all right i have to go but i hope we get to talk like this more youre a good listener
 princess

prince marth i am castor of talys i wish to add my bow to your strength
of course caeda told me about you
you know shes always been very kind to me sire even before i left talys and look how ive repaid her 
castor you can still show her your heart is true let the battles to come be what defines you
the gall of ye defyin me crew ill put an axe square between yer eyes ye aint leaving here alive i swear it on the rickety peg leg oshanty pete
augh  fiends ye be 
you have our gratitude sire for finally chasin those pirates away now as i hear it you plan to march on to aurelis thatll take you right up through the ghouls teeth with all due respect sire youre taking a great risk crossin those mountains thats soothsire territory the soothsires are fearsome bandits always raidin the villages and harryin what travelers dare pass by and the swordsman with em  goes by the name o navarre  hes a terror with a blade so they say if you go up there keep your wits about you  or you wont come back down
/***EOF***/
prince marth he said i do not doubt you love your sister something great but you must be patient  time is on your side if you stay here and grow stronger a time will come when you can help her so marth stayed in talys protected by its kind people and the years went by 
sire youve a visitor from the castle its princess caeda
caeda what is it you look white as a sheet
marth come quickly its the castle  galdrs pirates attacked from out of nowhere  they stormed the gates and cut down everyone in their path i fear for my fathers life 
steady caeda you did well to come find us alteas bravest knights arent about to hand talys to that flock of seafowl come well make for the castle now
villages will keep their gates open for prince marth but he must be quick – if a thief reaches a village before the prince does there may not be any more village left to visit
i hear you need a high weapon level to wield the strongest weapons another thing keep your fliers away from those enemy archers
a knight belongs on the front lines if you ask me that thick armor can take a lot of abuse so they should be up front protecting the other units
galder thats the harbor town west of talys out beyond the water these days a pirate by the name of gomer calls the shots there the whole towns at the mercy of his crew
a man of the staff by the name of wrys lives in the village south of the castle he was hopin to meet your prince
prince marth tis good you stopped by the villagers have collected 10000 gold pieces if it please you use the money to arm your warriors and rid our land of those pirates
i am wrys a humble curate i cannot fight but this staff i carry can heal your wounded take me with you and youll be very glad you did
the might of altea ye say now har ye sprogs look tbe a mite short omighty tme
rrgh  yell pay dog 
ah prince marth you have saved us in our hour of need please accept my thanks lad i believe you are ready if you wish to seek out allies in aurelis i will give you what soldiers i can to see you arrive there safely captain ogma is a fine swordsman brave and true i know he and his fighters will serve you well another thing during your travels you are certain to meet many who despise dolhr some may be hiding in villages other may have been captured or forced to fight against their will or better judgment it falls upon you to find these individuals and win them over your cause understood lad then go the time has come be patient steady strong i know you will do great things
/***EOF***/
having won the day and putting camus and his sable order to rout marth and the league moved on to the mountains in eastern grust to crush the last of the opposition the surviving grustian soldiers in a mad attempt to hang on to their lives took all the residents of a nearby village hostage to keep marth from striking however they could not have picked a worse village to harass 
have the villagers given up struggling yet
with that ogre on the loose hardly sir all of our soldiers together still cant contain him the other villagers have fled into the caverns out of reach
what grr enough of this the league will be here soon take your positions well deal with them first and cut that giant down to size later
ymir youre hurt
am i i hardly feel it
why would you try to take on an entire army just for our sake
because you treat me like a human being do i need another reason
ymir  thank you
ill be standing guard outside the cavern nobody will hurt you i swear it
who are you you dont seem to be one of grusts soldiers
you just keep your distance im not letting anyone near the villagers in here and that includes you
you wrong me sir im here to rout the last of grusts army to save you
yeah well they said the same thing when they led us down here and look where that got us im not fallin for the same lies twice
i speak the truth but if my word is not good enough so be it stand aside and watch us fight let the battle prove i mean what i say agreed either way you are in danger here take the villagers and hide until this is over
 so im supposed to just sit here when i could be fightin
just give me a chance to prove im here to protect you
 fine ill stay out of it for now but if i find youre lyin to me ill split you right down the middle
the villagers are countin on me i wont let you through
rrgh  im sorry  i tried 
well never surrender to you akaneian rabble long live grust
rebel  scum 
prince marth thank you those soldiers told us theyd protect us when they led us down here  but they were just using us as leverage hostages to keep you at bay if you hadnt shown up they might have just killed us outright in the end 
prince marth sorry i doubted you
well at least weve cleared up the misunderstanding
since you came to the villagers rescue how bout i help you out as a way of sayin thanks
you mean  join our army
im strongest in the land well second strongest at least i can hold my own in battle but if you dont want a monster in your ranks i understand 
monster youre a giant among men to be sure but a hero as well any warrior who can fend of an entire army is welcome among us
then count me in lets see how many more armies break themselves against me eh
/***EOF***/
the galloping of enemy destriers far away then closer  then far too close
aurelis at last the enemy will have sent their forces to meet us
grust dolhr grawere up against their standing armies and we must brace ourselves for it
sire i believe it prudent that we start taking time to prepare our troops before each battle we should select the warriors best suited for the situation and outfit them with the right weapons and items accordingly
all right thats sound advice  i believe ill take it
an unknown army to the south that must be the altean princeling and his band of lickspittles if they think well sit by and let them join forces with the aurelians then they have another think coming with this ridersbane ill litter the lea with their cavalry
weapons can be crafted of iron steel or silver each metal more powerful than the last youl need to raise your weapon level accordingly though before you can use them
middle aged man“when facing armored knights or generals youll want to arm yourself with a sword they call an armorslayer then theres the ridersbane which makes short work of cavaliers and paladins  but only knights and cavalry can wield it the rapier is effective against armored units and cavalry but you need to be a prince to wield that one also keep in mind that weapons wear down with use and eventually break
general bentheon who guards the castle was carrying a ridersbane last i saw keep your cavaliers away or that weapon could spell the end of ‘em
did you know you can use keys to unlock doors and lower bridges  you did ahem right of course you did
theres no terror like the dracoknight one false move when theyre flyin about and you can kiss your life goodbye
kind altean this kingdom is in dire need of a savior weve saved up 5000 gold and poured our prayers into every coin please use this money to answer them
aha prince marth we meet again
 huh merric merric is that you
well yes sire last i looked whilst studying magic in khadein i caught wind of a war brewing and decided to seek you out
i see  thank you then i need friends like you on the battlefield you will fight with us of course
of course ‘twould be a passing shame if you didnt get to see me flex a little magic muscle wait till i show you my latest excalibur
lena  where are you what i would give to hear your voice just once before i die 
lena  forgive your fool of a brother 
matthis is that you
lena what are you doing on a battlefield
i was attacked by bandits in the teeth while tending to the sick there and these people saved me the real question is what are you doing on a battlefield  least of all this one
im not here by choice sister of mine since you left macedon has only gotten worse and worse they forced me to enlist  you know i hate warfare but it was into the army or onto the chopping block
shame on you matthis if youre going to fight then at least fight for something you believe in medon has done terrible things marrying their might to doluna helping them torment people brother its not too late you could join alteas forces theyre good people you know prince marth would welcome you they all would
 all right then if im gonna to die id rather die as one of the dashing than one of the dastardly you know lena you always were the reliable one and now youre all grown up i thought for sure youd have already settled down with your one true love
t true love ive ive met no such man matthis
hmm is that so ill bet you havent  well you just be careful there are plenty of thieves out there who would steal a girls heart
you must be matthis sister lenas 
ack y youre prince marth aieee s s stay your rapier i beg you
 what has gotten into you
you mean you havent come to stick me like a pig for fighting under the macedonian standard
er no 
matthis“really
really and truly
oh uh right then  sorry about that little display i guess lena was right just goes to show not all princes are cut from the same cloth
marth“what do you mean
oh well our prince  prince michalis of macedon that is  hes strong and proud and an utter tyrant they say he put the soldiers who look the most scared in the front lines on purpose
hmm  prince michalis of medon 
dont worry sire i wont mistake you for him again altean princes i can trust
you can defy us yes  but you will never defeat us
w what 
prince marth you have our thanks for liberating the south castle youll find captain hardin protecting the king and the lady nyna at the northern fortress located in aurelis when you find him please be sure to give him this silver sword

the empire was finished the fires of war that had raged across archanea would die and light would come to take darknesss place but before any of that came to pass there were a few final moments of marths tale that need telling 
marth you did it its finally over
ive waiting a long time for this day and now im not entirely certain what to do with it 
marth  um we havent talked much since leaving talys but i thought do you know where you will be going
to altea of course war has left my kingdom in ruins i cannot waste another day i must return to help rebuild
so  i suppose that means you have bid talys farewell for good 
dont be silly caeda i need to at least go thank your father and tell him the fighting is done
my father  marth im not asking about my  never mind please excuse me 
marth did something happen i just passed caeda and she looked heartbroken 
no  well we were just talking and she asked me 
ha ha oh marth  how can a man who faced the shadow dragon be so desperate to avoid facing his own feelings
i  my  what i dont know what you are talking about
you wish to send caeda home to talys then and return to altea alone that is what you want
well thats where we both belong i dont see what my wants have to do with anything
clearly not marth if you have anything to say to caeda say it now love cannot always make the leap from heart to heart by itself sometimes you must speak it aloud and give it wings surely a great leader like you can muster the courage for that
 
caeda  might i er have a moment
 
i did not speak with my heart before when i said i would go to altea i  well i had meant  i hoped you would be at my side
 
as you said we have not spoken much since talys with you i felt i never had to say a word if the battle started to take its toll you were always there  close by  i would see you there so beaut  ahem so brave  and i would um  derive yes derive great strength derive   ugh why is this so difficult caeda im just trying to tell you i 
marth  shh me too  me too
well done marth our struggle is finally over you have saved our world
not just me many fought at my side  and died
marth  you loved her didnt you caeda
 she was the one i most wanted to keep safe but i failed and i have lost her forever  it occurs to me now that perhaps she was the one protecting me all along caeda  why did you take up arms with a fool like me
marth do not blame yourself  remember anri and artemis we are their descendants perhaps we were always meant to share their curse as well as their blood and  perhaps only the curse has exacted its price could our battle with the shadow dragon be won this peace we have made  we must cherish it marth we have both paid so dearly for it let us work together to ensure none must endure a tragedy like our again
so concludes the tale of falchion blade of light marth its wielder and his battle with the shadow dragon herein its events have been chronicled that none may ever forget
/***EOF***/
the long war had been fought archaneas many lands freed and now the league had cornered their archenemy within his castle they broke into four groups and stormed the four gates of dolhr keep  unaware that this was exactly what medeus was expecting bravely these warriors fate had chosen steeled themselves for one last struggle
we made it now we just have to find medeus 
i can sense it  a sinister will is at work here 
marth you have fought splendidly
lord gotoh what are you doing here
i washed my hands of humankind and their foolish ways long ago but you and your companions have convinced me that was a rash decision perhaps there is hope for you yet allow me to offer what help i can
you mean youll fight with us
yes i may lack the power to stop medeus but his minions are another story let this old man strike them down and clear a path for you  the gods have chosen you marth prince of light
come my friends we have a dragon to tame help me confine medeus to the shadows for all eternity and bring light back into the world
his last words were as follows “tell my son that i leave the future of altea and our continent in his hands”
your sister knows that you are the future of altea  nay the whole land
foolish humans you dare disturb me while i slumber oh how you will regret it as you die slowly painfully writhing in the fires of the inferno
nngh  defeated again  by humans know this altean prince  that light which surrounds you is only a temporary respite so long as the darkness in your hearts continues to sustain me  i cannot be  destroyed   rrraaahhh
hmm so  i am not the only dragon revived i had heard you perished the last time no matter youve recovered even less of your power than me this time you have no chance
/***EOF***/
aurelis was free but marth and his army  now known as the archanean league still had much work ahead of them they followed the middleroad south bound for archanea palace  a perilous route for it took them right into lefcandith valley and the jaws of trouble the countless fortresses lining the valley made it a veritable gauntlet and compounding the danger was the presence of the whitewings a knightly order led by princess minerva of macedon it would be a fierce battle
general harmein i cannot abide by these tactics of yours let me attack the rebels head on and keep my pride as a knight of macedon
ah you mean the same pride that cost us all those soldiers back in aurelis i think not princess if were to regroup we need to buy time my tactics are necessary the emperor himself has named me commander of this post either obey or accept the consequences your little sister maria is still under our word is she not what a shame it would be if we decided we could no longer care for her 
enough  i will obey but the altean knights are smarter than you give them credit for they will prevail here and you will regret having acting so rashly general
say did you happen to get a look at the axe wrapped in minervas princessly fingers no i suppose not otherwise youd not be standing here that axe is hauteclere the strongest axe of ‘em all nobody knows who made it or where but its said to rival even the three regalia archaneas mightiest weapons why if she got her hands on iotes shield thatun being macedons treasure see shed be nigh unstoppable
you there have you come across a young girl one by the name of tiki she must be found boy tiki is the last of the naga the divine dragon clan without her powers we cannot challenge the manaketes who serve medeus  me i havent the power i am a fire dragon yes  but in the name alone in name alone i lost my firestone in pyrathi without it i cannot do battle  you will be traveling much yes i wish to go with you perhaps together we can find tiki
fie enough ive no stomach for these cat and mouse tactics come whitewings we fly hyah
rrgh  i cant keep up the fight with these wounds  i must withdraw
i serve princess minerva not grust this battle is over
the commander left then ive no reason to stay
sorry general my place is with the commander
curse minerva and her pride grr no matter if i am to die here then i wont be dying alone
aaargh traitors every where 
prince marth i was wondering if we might talk about the manaketes
manaketes you mean the dragonkin
yes sire i was not sure how much knowledge you had of the manaketes the manaketes inhabited our continent long before the dawn of humanity however ordinarily their draconic disposition stayed suppressed their power sealed within special stones thus rather than terrorizing humankind they chose to live simple peaceful lives in the quieter reaches of the world however a century ago something changed medeus the shadow dragon surfaced in the dolhr region and created what would be a great empire there his forces invaded the human realm and in the blink of an eye he had subjected all of the land it was then in that darkest hour that a young man named anri appeared and rose against the shadow dragon in his head was a shining blade of light  falchion  which he plunged into medeus  and the tyrant was no more anri went on to found altea  and the rest i believe you know
yes malledus  is that what this was about i do know my own kingdoms history and i know what i must do now that medeus has revived and restored dolhr to its former might
you are anris last male descendant the only one who can wield falchion you must find the blade that was taken and put an end to doluna and its misguided manakete rulers
i will finish what my father started i will avenge him and bring light back into our world
/***EOF***/
the league had reached archanean soil so marth gave himself leave to recuperate in port warren a harbor town known for commerce coin alone kept the town free and they paid dolhr dearly in taxes to preserve their autonomy naturally then theirs was a warm welcome when the archanean league arrived marths soldiers were glad to rest there nestled between mountain and sea but their joy was spoiled by news that the enemy was fast approaching  as harsh an awakening as a rock beneath the pillow
prince marth i am caesar and this is radd we are hired swords in the service of port warren grust has gathered its knights by the fortresses to the north its dangerous for you to stay here thankfully the eastern castle has been left almost entirely unguarded thats the place to strike please be careful sire well be fighting with you all the way
they say a princess of macedon is being held captive inside castle deil thats odd dont you think why would dolhr imprison their own ally
i saw loads of enemy soldiers up by the northern fortresses theyll be pouring out of the gates any minute now youd better send someone to bar the exits before they do
i bear you no ill will but what can i say a wars a war
good day sir
ack
peace ive no wish to fight you my name is caeda i hail from talys
wh what are you talking to me for this is a battlefield
might i trouble you by asking your name good sir

 youre very kind caeda dare i say we dont have girls quite like you back in grust um perhaps i suppose i could aw heck im going with you
prince marth im roger a grustian soldier well at least i was im through fighting against you let me join your league
well certainly we need all the strong allies we can get but why the sudden change of heart
well er  theres this fetching girl named caeda who asked me to and uh  what can i say i think im in love try saying no to a girl who comes racing up to you in the heat of battle just to ask if you believe in love whew i mustve turned red as a strawberry heh heh 
  
w what are you doing all the way out here blast im finished 
long live grust nngff 
sire its too dangerous to stay here we must flee to pyrathi there are risks there too  the pyrathi king mannu is said to be a descendant of the dragonkin a manakete still weve no other recourse well just have to take our chances  keep your wits about you sire

tired from so many long battles marth and the league arrive at last in archanea princess nynas mother kingdom past the mountains lay the royal palace known to some as millennium court and within its walls awaited many treasures and captives the enemy had taken with each step marth draw nearer to one of the great waypoints on his journey
nyna soon the palace will be in sight i know this cant be easy for you
 when the palace fell many many good archaneans were killed the royal family my family were their bodies were hung before the gates as an example i cannot unpaint that vivid picture of my parents grotesquely changed i feel as though i should cry marth or scream but no tears come and i cannot chase away the sadness and rage   i cannot change the past i can only shape the future lead the way marth i am ready take me home
this here is knorda archaneas closest market town drop by the armories and vendors if youve an interest in rare goods
a gang of ruffians have rounded up some archanean folk and are holdin em over at the edge of town what a world its become that weve gotta be prisoners in our own land
three ancient weapons known as the regalia have been passed down through the generations of house archanea parthia the bow of flame gradivus the lance that pierces stone and mercurius the spectral sword only those blessed by the gods may lay hands on them  or so it goes
im sick of war if it aint the screams of battle youre hearin its the bawlin of the widows you all should go home to your loved ones if you ask me
watch out for the ballisticians they can fire their missiles quite a long ways if you see theyre usin a weapon called an arrowspate move your fliers out of there before their wings get clipped also ballisticians have a weapon called the thunderbolt which is particularly effective against other ballisticians
not everybody fighting for grust is a bad apple you know take my sweetheart jake hes got a heart of gold that one if you see him tell him annas worried sick about him course my jake wont talk to no one but the most beautiful of women thats just the way he is
i hope this warring is over and done with soon and i hope my jake is well

khadein  the school my father was a student there a long time ago
the school is beautiful–was beautiful until gharnef took over and changed everything i was blessed with wonderful teachers and i found a healthy mix of friends and rivals in the other aspiring mages

the secret shop didnt you know there are secret shops hidden all over the continent well theres one in altea too
oh really where exactly
if i told you it wouldnt be much of a secret now would it the entrance is disguised so you cant find it
disguised
and they dont let anybody in without a vip card so dont expect to waltz through the door by accident
but how do they stay in business
who knows last i heard they were desperate for customers
then maybe they should reopen as a tell your friends  shop
ha very clever anyway you should drop by when youre in the neighborhood
but i dont know  ugh never mind
burn  burn till your blood boils and your flesh cooks
emperor medeus i have failed you 
good news nyna weve wrested control of the gates from the enemy
then weve won
not quite yet we can enter the palace but dolhr still holds strong inside her walls also a number of knights are being held captive inside
loyal soldiers who fought for their kingdom and their people marth i wish to free them as soon as possible
i understand we should strike now then before enemy reinforcements can arrive i believe we have a good chance
thank you marth as always i am counting on you worry no more
/***EOF***/
a quiet prosperous kingdom famed for the flying beasts favored by dracoknights but then their brother prince michalis succumbed to his lust for power despite his sisters adamant opposition he swore allegiance to dolhr and when macedons dragoons took flight the world suffered even now that the tides had turned michalis took position for one last stand dracoknights filled the sky end to end eager to pluck marth from the earth
lord gotoh the league has begun its attack i wish for you to move someplace safe until the fighting has ended
why not just end this folly now michalis
folly what folly
you loved your younger sister so much it pains me to see you quarrel if you and minerva had worked as one macedon might have become a great kingdom  greater even than archanea perhaps but instead you let gharnef trick you into destroying your family and your kingdom with it
 i cannot undo what is done my fathers blood will always be on my hands just as minervas betrayal of her brother and country will be on hers and macedon has not been destroyed not yet so long as i carry iotes shield the leagues arrows cannot fell me
very well and if you win what then
if i win i will tell you right now my only goal is to gut that altean prince who leads the league my pride as macedonian king rests upon it
i see  then weve nothing more to discuss have we
the weight of his fathers murder threatens to crush him  poor boy poor fool
a great sage lives in the village to the north hes not very sociable though hardly anyone ever sees him
marth marth why did you not heed me why did you not bring the two orbs without them i cannot make starlight for you you will not be able to break through gharnefs imhullu magic not take falchion from his clutches without anris sword your battle with medeus will be fraught with peril if you still mean to face him you will need all the strength you can muster every advantage you can find if you have weapons like the sword mercurius or the lance gradivus the fight may not be lost  hmm  i too may be able to help in some other way let me think on it regardless your quest has just become more difficult than you realize i hope you are ready
you have the lightsphere and starsphere with you well done now i can create starlight for you
 there it is finished take this with you it is the only magic capable of breaking through imhullu use it to stop that fiend gharnef once and for all
made it this far have you dont gloat yet my dragoons and i still rule these skies
minerva i have missed you sister let us embrace one last time
michalis 
well strike a moments hesitation spells death on the battlefield i know i taught you better
you will not lay down your lance and walk the right path
dont be a child there are no right paths just mine and yours two that will never cross
very well then you leave me no choice embrace you i shall brother
m maria what are you doing here
the whitewings ha come to try and slay your king
the whitewings ha come to try and slay your king
the whitewings ha come to try and slay your king
ive been waiting for you altean whelp i swear on my crown you will die
aaagh i am finished forgive me my people
first general camus of grust  now prince michalis of macedon men of such promise  had the times been different the two might have led illustrious lives
yes prince michalis was a brilliant man with great things ahead of him but in the end the rashness of youth did him in
only because gharnef found his weakness and exploited it until we stop that fiend this spiral of misery will never cease
then shall we go to thabes lord gotoh said the city lies someplace far to the north of khadein
yes in the heart of the desert 
thabes is an old city  none in recent memory have gone there and returned alive within its walls remain many powerful apparatus crafted of long forgotten magic lord gotoh believes gharnef is harnessing their power and that is why he wields such influence over the continent
and he has imhullu as well  this will be a struggle
still gharnefs reign must end the world was so much more beautiful before he painted it red 
/***EOF***/
khadein city of magic ever since gharnef named himself ruler of this mecca for the magically inclined the sands surrounding it had run red many knights had tried to oust gharnef but what defense did they have against the mages the fiend had bent to his purpose one by one the heroes fell to blades unseen and fires within their armor and it was not long at all before khadeins wickedness outstripped its wisdom
what the dregs of archanea have come to challenge my kingdom ha ha ha  really do they think people have not tried before so long as i possess this imhullu magic they cannot snuff my life out no one can as for the white sage  he will trouble me no longer with the dragon goddess right where i want her in the fane of raman there is no way for gotohs starlight to disperse the shadows that guard me
fight gharnef are you mad youll never stop him his magic imhullu summons up foul spirits that protect him only the white sage gotohs magic can undo him the magic of starli  whoa there i need to hold my tongue he might be listenin with those wizard ears of his for all i know go on work a little magic yourself and disappear huh shoo
you think those clothes ometal will protect you from mages ha armor wont save you you need a barrier staff another thing about gharnef  here move in closer in case hes listenin you dont want to fight him head on he never stays put in khadein for very long anyway if he tries to attack you ride it out good things come to those who wait
you dare oppose me fool you must not value your life cower before the might of the magic imhullu once forbidden now unleashed
altean prince i fear you are not quite imposing enough to warrant my staying here but if its falchion you want come and take it i shall be waiting at the temple of thabes
no falchion the battle was for naught
 marth prince marth
huh who are you
my name is gotoh i am speaking to you from macedon through magic
gotoh the white sage
some have used that name yes you must listen to me as you suspect gharnef has made off with falchion with imhullu and falchion in the sorcerers grasp dolhr now must think twice before challenging him gharnef knows this and one day he plans to conquer dolhr and rule the entire world
is imhullu so powerful a magic then
yes the mage who wields it cannot be killed cannot be so much as scratched i was the magics guardian once knowing its forbidden power could work terrible evils so i kept it close but gharnef one of my two pupils  miloah being the other  took the forbidden tome and vanished now you are paying for my carelessness forgive me i wish to make amends by teaching you the only way to undo imhullus power
which is 
it is called starlight one blast is enough to break through imhullus shadowy protection but to cast the magic you need two orbs the lightsphere and the starsphere heed me marth when you find the lightsphere and starsphere bring them to me then i will give you the magic you seek then you will have starlight and with it gharnefs reign will end

after taking back the palace the league rode across akaneia freeing the greater part of the kingdom as they went  all except the west a landed knight there named horace who had betrayed akaneia to join doluna continued to stubbornly hold out against marths forces nyna could not fathom why such a fiercely loyal knight would turn to treachery but with her other knights calling for horaces blood she had no choice but to give in and ask marth to bring the traitor to justice
have you heard horace i am told the rebels just recaptured the palace that accursed akaneian wench never mind camuss pleas we should have put her to the sword with the rest of them 
 
hm something bothering you now dont tell me you are toying with the idea of rejoining your motherland because if you do i think you know exactly what will befall your people
yes youve made it quite clear i am an akaneian knight no longer i knew this day would come when i gave me lance to doluna i will not flinch
good then gather your soldiers and kill these rebels before they cause any more trouble
lord horace our soldiers are in position
good
shall we advance on the enemy
 no that wont be necessary well lure them in close then strike no one attacks unless the enemy makes a move first is that clear
lord horace i am marth of altea i ask that you lay down your arms 
is princess nyna safe
she is  and shes quite worried about you sir
so her highness is alive  the soldiers who died protecting her can rest in peace  now then prince marth draw your sword
what but lord horace
horacei chose to betray akaneia and now i must abide by that choice princess nyna has returned to the palace and akaneia is restored i have no regrets
lord horace who rules this land used to be a knight of akaneia after the palace fell though he bent his knee to the dolunian emperor and has been servin him ever since for that folks call him a traitor and say he tarnished his knightly brethrens reputation well thats a load of hogwash he broke his knightly oaths to protect us not cause hes some traitor please sire you have to help clear his name here lord horaces father bless him gave me this weapon as a gift long ago i know hed be glad to see it used to restore his sons honor
 are you with the league please sir im beggin ya you have to help lord horace hes always looked out for us small folk before and after he inherited the land hes a pillar of strength he is wed be dead if he hadnt made the tough choices he did the least we can do is rescue him from his plight now here ive got this magic tome one of our villagers found after the last battle on our soil you take it and find some way to save him promise
vexatious rebels ill skewer you like rabbits
nngh youll  pay 
what dejaniras been killed then  its over soldiers lay down your weapons no more akaneian blood shall be shed  mine shall be the last
bravo prince marth i yield spare the lives of my soldiers and treat my people kindly and you may do with me as you see fit
no wait please lord horace is a good man doluna threatened him said theyd raze the land corner to corner if he didnt comply so you see 
hush youve said enough
but lord horace 
horacei betrayed my fellow knights and besmirched their good name i will not dress up my sins as kindnesses i accept my punishment allow me to die a knights death
nynai will not
  princess nyna
horace i heard what you said and you have it quite right your crimes deserve death or worse
nyna what are you 
but i shall give you no knights death i shall give you a traitors life you say you will not dress up your sins i say you will not run from them either
your highness  are you saying you wish me to live
you did all in your power to protect these people that was honorable horace but if you die today no one will remember you for anything but your one act of betrayal your soldiers will have to bear that shame in your stead do you call that justice
 
starting today you shall prove to the world there was value in your actions show us a traitors worth show us what the soldiers who fought and died for you saw to be true
i  i do not know what to say
nynai have claimed your life horace you have no say you shall fight for us and you shall not die i forbid it
heh  very well your highness as you command 
nyna we have put down the western insurgence
and horace
marthi am sorry 
poor horace marth in his heart i do not think he truly wished to betray akaneia
nor i doluna must have threatened to do harm to his people
so horace capitulated to keep them safe  he acted to save lives yet the world will brand him a traitor that one word will come to define him  and none will ever know the traitors worth

the holy kingdom of archanea had come into being six centuries earlier when the regions numerous city states were unified under one monarch the first king adrah had fought valiantly to accomplish this wielding the three weapons he came to call his regalia  gifts from the gods some said the kingdom adrah forged was pronounced holy its kings were esteemed with archaneas aid six more independent kingdoms sprang up in their own time but archanea was always the greatest   and now marth was about to take his first walk through its historic palaces halls
bishop what do you make of this i hear shouting in the corridors
hmm princess nyna must have returned with an army in tow
an army really then we are saved
saved perhaps or doomed surely the enemy realizes we are more trouble alive than dead now
you do not take my meaning bishop by we i mean archanea archanea is saved if princess nyna has truly come to chase the enemy from our halls to free us then my death will have meaning
ho ho i admire your spirit child i always have but think how astram would grieve if you were to die
i i had hoped to see him one last time  to say goodbye that alone i regret
ah but you have not died yet midia hang on to hope
rebel pup you dare defy dolhr then writhe in the fires of bolganone
do not think you have won  dolhr is undying  nngh
marth thank you were it not for you i may never have seen the halls of my house again
i could not have done it alone nyna the whole archanean league fought tooth and nail this day
true and yet all the same  i have little doubt your exploits are the ones that will live on in song i have a gift for you to celebrate your achievements here this bow is called parthia it is one of the three regalia that have been passed down through house archanea the other two regalia  the sword mercurius and the lance gradivus are not here the enemy took them when they fled i am sorry i had hoped to give you all three and thus aid you in the battles to come 
your concern for me is more than enough nyna one day i will get your familys treasures back and use them to crush dolhr i swear it on this emblem of fire

the lightsphere and the starsphere marth and company set off to chiasmir and the fane of raman to find them but in their path stood a cohort of grustian knights known as the sable order the bridges across the strait would soon be choked with the brave and the dead 
prince marth i see them a cohort of grustian knights out on the far side of the bridge that must be the sable order 
marth i heard the enemy forces have been spotted
yes thats right the sable order it seems
really tell me who leads them
why does it matter
oh  no its just  they say the sable order is led by a brilliant general i was  wondering if he was riding with them today
you must mean general camus i am told dolhr is not very happy with him at the moment brilliant or not something about acting outside orders  theyll be keeping him on a short leash i dont expect well see him here
that  that is good news 
you know how the fane of raman is supposed to be protected by a fearsome guardian well i heard the “fearsome guardian” is nowt but a wee lass if thats true you have to wonder why shed stay all by herself in a dreary place like that mayhap she broke her mas favorite vase and got stuck there as a punishment ha ha right
ah youre prince marth i am est of the medonian whitewings  palla and catrias younger sister ive been looking for you initially i intended to join up with you along with my sisters but then i heard grust had made off with one of akaneias three regalia  the sword mercurius  so i flew there to get it back this is mercurius right here its lovely isnt it and powerful in the right hands i think youll find it a formidable weapon indeed
catria
est its about time you made it back i was so worried 
sorry  i wont leave you like that again we belong together anyway when the three of us surround an enemy were just about unstoppable
true  but even so i like having you somewhere i can keep an eye on you ha ha
hey whats that supposed to mean
hey palla im not slowing you and catria down am i
why would you say that
i dont know  you and she have so much more experience sometimes i  i just feel like im not pulling my load
ha ha  est  youre doing just fine there are no half whitewings or almost whitewings youre one of us because youre every bit as good as us have a little confidence
right confidence 
 feel better
uh huh thanks palla its funny  whenever i talk to you i calm right down promise youll always be there for me palla
i will  i promise
commander did anybody tell you i flew all the way to grust and brought back mercurius pretty spiffy huh
yes marth told me all about it very brave of you to undertake such a dangerous task alone well done est
hee hee you mean it thanks commander you should have seen the arrows whooshing past me left and right but im a whitewing right so i swooped down and let em have it just watch though ill find some way to top it
i dont doubt it i expect great things from you est
hee hee you mean it
you shall not pass not today not ever
you  shall  not  unnh 
weve made it across the strait
yes but the real battle may yet be ahead of us
malledus  can we be certain the lightsphere and the starsphere are in the fane of raman
yes sire but unfortunately they may not be all we find the fane is said to be guarded by a goddess one with fearsome powers those who defile her sanctuary are punished by fire none are spared from the blaze
perhaps we should reconsider marth 
perhaps  but if none are spared from the blaze where do the rumors come from besides we need those two orbs
well might i suggest you take in just a few able companions and let the sleeping dragons lie
sage advice ive no desire to tear apart a holy place whether the goddess is home or not  ill choose a handful of elite to search for the orbs with me

with the aid of the white sage gotohs powerful warp magic marth and company were transported to the faraway city of thabes once thabes was an advanced civilization but only its decay advanced now the league traced the lifeless streets to the temple at the citys heart somewhere within its walls gharnef was waiting and now marth must wrest falchion and his sister elice from the fiends grip
the temple of thabes  hes here  somewhere 
heh heh heh  come to play little marth
‘tis i gharnef i have been waiting for you
waiting
oh yes for you to dance around the continent collecting powerful weapons and killing off my competition thanks to you camus and michalis will trouble me no more you have my gratitude diligent prince
you  monster
tsk tsk dont spoil the moment now youre about to do me one last favor  die prince heh heh heh
thats what you think i have something else in mind
heh is that a threat if you mean to harm me first youll have to find me boy
and what is that supposed to mean
my prince several sorcerers have been sighted throughout the temple theyre  they all seem to be gharnef sire
heh heh fight boy fight wear yourself thin fighting puppets and shadows but the only way youll claim falchion is by defeating the real me heh heh ha ha ha ha
sire weve pinpointed where gharnef is keeping the magical apparatus that gives him his power
where
the tower of thabes atop this very temple
then we dont need to fight gharnef  if we find those apparatus
gharnefs power  a great deal of power  will be sealed forever
then lets hurry and seize the entrance to the tower
a word of caution sir stopping the apparatus will not undo imhullu power  only gharnefs he still has falchion in his keeping if you want the blade back you must defeat him now before seizing the tower
heh heh heh  you dare challenge me fool you must not value your life cower before the might of the dark magic imhullu
agh what  where did you get starlight  still you are a fool your power is not enough to defeat medeus  i shall be waiting in the pits of the inferno  for when he sends you to join me  heh heh ha ha ha
malledus quickly find the apparatus and shut them down
right away sire
 blast how  how did they find the apparatus all my power  still they are fools if they think they can defeat medeus with such cheap tricks  heh heh ha ha ha
gharnef is getting away sire shall we give chase
no  let him go without his magical apparatus he has no power left to abuse
sire we found princess elice up in the tower of thabes shes on her way to see you right  ah here she is
elice
marth oh look at you a man grown
sister i was so worried none had seen you since the castle fell i  i feared the worst
i was prepared for the worst if that was what it took to ensure your safety but they did not kill me gharnef spared my life
why would he spare you
marth have you heard of the staff of aum
the staff that brings back the dead it was lost to the world long ago or so the legend goes
yes but gharnef found it  in the resurrectory
the resurrectory what was it doing in a temple in the middle of dolhr
i could not say but that was why gharnef kept me alive he wished me to wield it the staff of aums power can only be channeled by women of royal blood marth you are going to dolhr are you not
yes i must settle things with medeus
then take me to the resurrectory along the way to claim the staff aum works but once but i will use it to revive a lost comrade
/***EOF***/
grust would harry the league no more marth led his forces on to macedon however macedons dragoons were ready to waylay them at the border countless reinforcements hovered within the fortresses waiting to strike would marth be able to lead the league safely through the gauntlet
princess minerva we will soon reach the macedonian border are you certain you wish to join the battle if youve any reservations about fighting your own countrymen 
if i did prince marth i would not have offered you my axe
but surely 
you have the wrong idea perhaps you think i wish to spare my brother and former vassals forgive them for seeing things differently
 dont you
i would be lying if i said i did not wish it were that simple but history needs to remember that when macedon went astray it was a macedonian who set things right
even if it means your own brother may die
since i was little i followed in michaliss footsteps whatever books he read i read whenever he practiced the sword i was close by watching learning  he was always a step ahead my hero something to aspire to even now some part of me loves him  i love him enough to spare him death on some strangers sword you see let him be punished by my hands
rebels you have strutted into the wrong kingdom this time
nngh i am but a pebble  in macedons unshakeable foundation 
 prince marth 
that voice lord gotoh is that you
i see you have made it to macedon you will find me in a village north of the macedon aerie their castle if you possess the lightsphere and starsphere have them in hand when you visit me here  ah yes i also have good news your sister elice is unharmed
what you are certain where is she now
thabes city of illusion gharnef took her with him when he fled i pray you rescue her soon
i will
but first bring me the two orbs without starlights mighty blast gharnef will only add your life to the list of things he has taken from you
/***EOF***/
the time to slip away had come still the prince could not quell the sadness in his heart for his sister elice
prince marth  sire sire are you listening
huh  oh malledus
get ahold of yourself sire i know how you grieve but the gra host that pursues us will not be interested we must keep moving and with all haste at that
i im sorry these thoughts are hard to put aside
from here we will cross out of altea and begin our escape to talys i trust you are prepared
talys  ive heard the name an island kingdom to the east isnt it
that is correct the king there was a good friend to your father  and perhaps more importantly a true friend it was princess elices wish that you seek refuge in talys should things ever go awry
me but not her 
ive arranged for a boat to take us from the northeast shore but to get there well first need to cut through a prison to the north i managed to come by a key to the premises let me hand it over
now on the road you may notice people who seem to be fighting for gra against their own wishes before you resort to your blade you should try talking to them first
boy i dont envy you the enemy horde is closing in on you fastern a bolt of thoron you and your friends had better hightail it on outta here
sometimes victory on a battlefield requires that someone you care about make a sacrifice but parting with one comrade may be the only way to meet another you need to accept your losses in life and move forward
my word arent you–no you cannot stay here run before their soldiers come back here this is the bow my granddaughter always used take it sire please promise youll stay safe 
enemies south of the prison
yes sir not many of em but the scouts say theyre a tough bunch all the same and guess whos with em 
 youre saying the prince is coming this way
yes sir how ought we proceed the main force ‘as yet to arrive and  to be honest sir  we need em
bah youre cowed too easily we can win if we set a trap
er a trap sir
the prince of altea will be ours just do as i tell you and well pluck this royal plum long before the main force can show up to steal all the glory heh 
you inside
grrrmph 
heh i thought altea was the great ‘ero anris kingdom didnt take moren a couple of days to break you now did it gaggles
mmph arrumph
whats the matter gaggles cant talk cause youre gagged gaggles ba ha ha ill letcha in on a little secret alteas little princeling is on ‘is way ‘ere right this moment
 
ooh but sad for you you look awful dangerous in the uniform  mister gra soldier ha soon as the prince sees you ‘ell say yow its an enemy ambush and thatll be the end of you
gugrrrmph
once the prince sticks you like a pig we get to call him marth the tyrant coz ‘e kills ‘is own countrymen
wont that be an ‘oot
rrrmph
so long gaggles better start praying to your ‘igher deity of choice
listen men your target is the prince find the prince of altea and bring me his head served on a shield
look there
no anri save us of all the places to be beset sire that is gras main force  and they are accompanied by the knights of grusts sable order our chances of routing them are slim im afraid and those of slipping away undetected afterward all but nil 
then weve no hope
i i can think of one strategy we could leave a decoy behind for when the enemy catches up
a decoy
its you theyre after sire were one of your men to stay behind disguised as you well the enemy ought to take the bait that would give you and the others time to escape
one of your men must make for that fortress on the south highroad he will act as a decoy by dressing as you and luring the enemy force away
but malledus how will he find his way back to us
sire he may not you must part with one of your comrades there is no other way
 well i will find a way you cannot expect me to agree to to abandon one of our own to a death at the hands of the enemy surely there must be another way 
forgive me sire but this is our only chance you know as well as i do that you must not die here today
no sire get back here one of your other men must take that position
look its its prince marth
oh yeah whos that then that bloke over there is dressed in the same clothes could be either of em
simpletons use your heads one of them ran the other didnt what does that tell you easy the one who stayed behind is trying to buy time for the one who fled
so er the one who took off is 
the real prince you idiot yes hie troops after him put that craven whip to the sword
wait quickly malledus we must head south and rescue him
no sire we have to press on
press on insert name might be dying back there
if he were then why would you be so selfish as to let him die in vain honor him by allowing his life and his choice to mean something
  
 all right
i will honor him  i will go
the prince fled south bah seems the plums fallen too far from our tree  no matter open the north door we can still crush the altean rabble he left behind 
blast that archer was on our side
they killed the captive heh heh  what fools hie lets give them the punishment fools deserve open the north door lure them out and strike them down
all but the prince have been slain good open the north door the little whelp is ours now
sire there is a village over yonder its residents may be willing to help why dont you try paying them a visit
prince marth make haste sire
draug is that you what are you doing here
draug sir the enemy has crossed the border from the west theyll be upon us soon
right were on our way sire this is norne she heard wind of our struggles and wishes to fight for altea
prince marth tis an honor by your leave though ill be savin the curtsy bobbin for later quickly sire
this is the wrong prince no you dare make a fool of me kill him make this faux prince suffer
may i suffer for my sins 
yow its an enemy ambush
rrrgmph mrph
huh youve been gagged here ill get that  wait i know you youre one of our archers er 
gordin sire my name is gordin the enemy captured me and left me in this mortifying state
i see well im glad youre unharmed but im afraid we cannot stay here a moment longer stay behind me and 
i can fight sire if you have a bow i could use i would be honored to fight at your side
heh these old bones are still good for something farewell my prince live and grow strong 
glory to altea land of my birth farewell sire fortune protect you 
good  alteas hope is restored farewell sire fortune protect you 
count this knight honored to die in the service of his prince live sire and grow strong 
i was dead anyway till you came sir  if im to die again at least let me die for you fortune protect you sire 
and so marth and his knights left altea heavy of heart and bleary of eye 
look sire see how altea shrinks on the horizon 
aven 
i beg your pardon
i am a craven powerless to save my sister to staunch my kingdoms wounds to ease my peoples fears 
this was your only recourse sire but surely one day you will be able to set things right 
surely why do words of such conviction smack so much of uncertainty when spoken not surely jagen assuredly gra will pay for their acts today though allow me to wallow in this pain to feel every awful twist of it i never want to forget
sire 
i will return altea your prince will return to you one day

long ago medeus king of the dragonkin conquered the continent of archanea beginning an age of fear and despair for all its people that tyranny was broken however when an unlikely hero intervened a young man hailing from the altea region appeared with a divine blade in hand he stood against the shadow dragon and struck him down for some time after the land enjoyed an age of peace however after a centurys passing the shadow dragon returned he forged an alliance with a fiendish sorcerer who sought to rule the world and their combined might toppled kingdom upon unsuspecting kingdom
again darkness threatened to engulf the continent it fell upon the king of altea sole descendant of the dragon slayer hero to sally forth with the divine blade and fulfill his blood destiny
his son prince marth remained at home with the boys mother his elder sister and a garrison manned by alteas neighbor and ally gra thus the boy applied himself to the ways of both pen and sword until one day 
his sister stayed behind to buy his freedom
prince marth  are you awake beggin your pardon sire but the princess has asked to see you
elice is she all right
she seemed to be sire but her words implied a certain urgency she bade you dress quickly and wait by the throne
 has something happened
its our forces off in gra sire there seems to ave been some sort of incident but  well im not privy to the specifics
i see  thank you ill be there shortly
my sister said she would meet me by the throne

weve not many soldiers left this is hard to bear i know but the castle is lost we must face that i will look for mother and join you as soon as i can you find jagen and get away from here  far away understand
 all right but promise you wont be long
goodbye marth may you live long

grust had caught the league unawares forcing them to flee to pyrathi but the kingdom of pyrathi seldom made contact with the outside world and their king mannu was wroth when he heard of the leagues unexpected visit there were whispers mannu was a dragonkin  rumors soon to be proved true
interlopers barbarous filth they dare dig their heels and hooves into this hallowed ground i will kill them for this  one by one  then turn the crimson grass beneath them into their pyre
your best chance of stopping a manakete lies in what they call a wyrmslayer its a type of sword and i hear one is enshrined in the eastern palace
prince marth i am jeorge an archanean sniper i fought to defend our palace from dolhr but the enemys strength was too great we lost and i was captured thankfully theyre not half as bright as they are strong and i managed to slip away when they were not looking i heard you were on your way to pyrathi and that princess nyna was with you so i came here to offer my help let me fight with you to save my land and i will use this silver bow to show you marksmanship unlike any youve ever seen
foolhardy humans defying a manakete king tremble now and feel the last quickening of your heart
what  slain by this fangless coward and his minions
prince marth i am catria of the whitewinged order of macedon i have come with a request from our mistress the princess minerva she is planning to lead us against dolhr in rebellion however her hands are tied so long as the enemy holds her younger sister the princess maria captive will you rescue princess maria from their clutches that my whitewing sisters and i might join in your fight
/***EOF***/
trace a line around the continents north eastern plains and you have aurelis this kingdom alone had somehow resisted dolhrs attempts to conquer it but only by some miracle by the time marth arrived in aurelis much of its territory had already been carved up by dolhrs ally macedon still the kings younger brother hardin refused to give up without a fight the people called him coyote and he intended to live up to the name since its founding aurelis and the holy kingdom of archanea shared close ties and months ago princess nyna of archanea had come to hardins aid by his side she had called on the people to fight  but few remained to answer macedons finest soldiers were closing in nyna knew they were out of time 
princess nyna ive spotted them the altean army is on the far side of the river
theyre here at last prince marth has come for us
so it seems now what say you we turn this battle around im going to take my men east to join our might with marths together we will retake the castle stay here my lady and wait for the good news
a castle like ours must be chock full o royal treasure ah but only a thief could get inside chests locked that tight 
the shops in port warren feature wares both rare and beautiful be thrifty with your gold now if youve any plans to venture that way later also keep in mind that shops keep only a limited stock of some items once theyre sold out you cant buy any more
word has it that the enemy is mustering its forces in the fortresses nearby youd better hurry and send units to bar their exits
well gday there son  why the wide eyed stare aincha never seen a country village before you know speakin o rare sights i once went to pyrathi where i saw me a real live manakete cripes let me tell you what a shock that was in a blink this regular old feller turned into an enormous dragon i mean i aint stupid id heard of the dragonkin before id just always assumed manaketes looked somethin like parakeets sheesh   what oh this i picked this stone up while i was there dunno what it is but how often do you spy a glowin red rock ya know what im sayin but honestly its been kinda creepin me out lately you want it go on ‘n take it sheesh 
oh  master wendell teacher
well hello merric what a surprise good to see you havens blown yourself up yet

very brave of you sir hmm  why dont you join us then if gharnef is helping dolhr then hes a bitter enemy of ours as much as he is to yours and khadeins we couldnt possibly leave the city in his clutches and im sure the prince would be pleased as pie to have magic as robust as yours in his arsenal
hmm you do know how to argue a point ive no taste for war but war is what ive been served come merric well fight together tell your prince of altea that wendell is at his service
prince marth i am wendell a pontifex of khadein city of magic our pleas for peace have failed and khadein has been taken over by one of the other pontifices his name is gharnef and he and the many mages who swear allegiance to him have allied themselves with dolhr prince marth i ask you now please lend me your help in thwarting his vile ambitions
prince marth i am wendell a pontifex of khadein city of magic our pleas for peace have failed and khadein has been taken over by one of the other pontifices his name is gharnef and he and the many mages who swear allegiance to him have allied themselves with dolhr prince marth i ask you now please lend me your help in thwarting his vile ambitions
lord hardin i am marth of altea ive come to offer what help i can
and i very gratefully accept it stories of your exploits travel fast young prince i feel as though ive gained a thousand allies in one
ive heard a few stories of you as well coyote it will be an honor to fight alongside such a courageous man
ive left princess nyna someplace safe for now we need to decide who will command here i was hoping it would be you
me but sir hardin you are far more qualified 
tsk princess nyna would not be pleased to hear us nitpicking over who will be listed in the history books take command so we can oust this macedonian scum and be done with it
you are sure
make no mistake lord marth i consider myself an exceptionally good judge of character if i thought you acted out of selfishness or ambition i would not extend the offer i have you have my trust
lord hardin thank you that is an honor if you dont mind me saying so  i feel as though ive made a good friend we share the same ideals i think
that we do may our friendship be a long one
princess minerva bade me guard this castle in her absence you shall not take it so long as i stand
heh  you think youve won wretch far from it 
prince marth your arrival could not have been better timed please accept our gratitude princess nyna of archanea is en route from the fortress i am sure she will wish to meet you the battle is not won yet though many of the enemy continue to hold out within the castles halls stay wary

the samsooth mountains whose gashing peaks rose up and divided the peninsula since before anyone could remember the mountains had belonged to bandits blights on the land whose acts of plunder kidnapping and arson knew no bounds out of fear their victims gave these peaks another name the ghouls teeth while the bandits who ruled atop the teeths craggy crowns took a name as well the samsooth sires or soothsires 
hey cmon lena shake a leg we need to get out of the teeth and we need to do it yesterday rumor has it the knights of altea are at the foot of the mountain we wont get a better chance its just a little bit farther stick with me

uh uh honey no can do i didnt betray my boys back there so you could zap me on out of here alone forget the staff ill come back later and get it for you myself all right right now though i need you to run tick tack now move that frock
 
take care around mercenaries theyre quite skillful if youre unlucky they may drop you at stroke
units with high skill deal more frequent critical hits units with high speed have an easier time avoiding enemy attack
hunters are stronger than archers but they also have weaker defenses keep them out of close range combat
oh ho ho dont you look young and full of life such a warm smile here deserves a nice reward here take this axe this evil abomination of an axe beware its blade drinks blood and devours flesh id hate to see you come to any harm”
will it be tears or blood you weep first

dolhr had little trouble forcing him into an alliance now he had taken ill even as grust suffered its string of defeats at the hand of the league the once mighty kingdom was poised to fall 
nyna well soon be launching the attack if you have something to tell me  now is the time to do it
all right marth as you wish when the dolhr grust allied forces seized control of archanea the entire royal family was killed save me i was given into grusts custody  the custody of the sable order to be more specific i am told dolhr wished for my execution  and with it the end of the holy lineage of house archanea  and grust was willing to comply
but you are not dead
that is right i was not put to the sword the sable orders captain came to my defense his name  was camus
 
camus protected me knowing he risked incurring the wrath of the shadow dragon he was the one who eventually arranged for my escape to aurelis
 i had no idea that certainly explains dolhrs displeasure with him
i hated him too at first but in time i found my hatred tempered by the compassion he showed me my feelings  changed and now all i wish is to see him again  but not if it means you and he must fight
nyna  do you  i cannot make any promises but i will do what i can i hope you can accept that
thank you marth i could not ask for more
ah prince marth welcome welcome tell me have you seen my granddaughter lena is she well if she happens to you would you see she gets this hammerne staff its a staff of repairing passed down through our family im certain shell make good use of it of course not all items can be repaired be sure to caution her about that
general camus can you hear me it is i marth of altea i must speak with you please show yourself
prince marth i am camus of grust
general i have no wish to fight you you know this battle is pointless surely you must
so long as grust continues to support dolhrs ambitions it does not matter what i know or think i am a knight i have a duty to fight for my motherlands glory till the very end
but surely 
prince marth there is nothing you can do or say i am party to your fathers murder are you a man or not draw your sword
stop camus
princess nyna 
nyna what are you doing here this is the middle of the battlefield
i know i know  but please camus listen to me  camus you gave me back my life and marth he gave me back my kingdom i do not wish to see that the two of you fight it is  it is unbearable please camus fight with us we need your strength  i need it
i am sorry princess
what but camus
were my heart my master i would do exactly as you say but what sort of knight abandons his kingdom  his king  now when they need him the most would you have me toss away the life i have built as if it meant nothing at all
no camus i  i dont know 
i have lived as a knight and i intend to die as one there are no other roads left for me to walk farewell my princess i shall never forget our days together at the palace few though they were i pray you meet someone who can bring joy back into your life
no victory here can give grust back her glory
this too must be fate
general lorenz my name is caeda i hail from talys my father has told me quite a bit about you
princess caeda my look what a lovely young woman youve grown into your father was a good friend to me many years ago
general i heard you opposed grust forming an alliance with dolhr why didnt you try to stop it
you think i did not try princess our king is meek in the end dolhr proved better at cowing him than i did
but sir surely you know that dolhr intends to use manaketes to conquer humankind you must act now  for grusts sake if not the worlds join us general lorenz we can put an end to this battle right now
hmm what you say makes sense enough but i serve grust i cannot simply betray my country
ah but what makes a country
pardon
is it one man  your king or is it the countless innocent people who make their home here
well thats  hmm 
my father has a saying “a kingless country is a country still but a king without subjects rules naught but hills” if you disobey your king to ensure his subjects safety how is that a betrayal you are protecting his reign
protecting his reign  aha ha ha ha ha ahh that mad logic i feel as though ive shed twenty years and im talking to your father again you win princess i yield i will join you in the interests of king and country har
general lorenz hold
what you are marth the altean prince 
yes sir the king of talys told me much about you he said you opposed grust forming an alliance with dolhr right from the very start
thats right
then fight with us with your help we can defeat dolhr
forgive me prince marth but am i to just abandon my country then
 
i know yours is the just cause still i wish to remain a grustian general right to the end i am fighting here because that is the way for me to honor my kingdom
forgive me general but  is it really
pardon
since you are a grustian general then surely you fight for grusts future first and foremost but tell me from where you are standing now do you see any future for your country
 i shall have to learn to mask my misgivings better if you can pluck them from my heart so easily you are quite correct if i care what becomes of grust then i cannot continue to stand by dolhr so i will stand by you instead prince  and hope the future is a bit easier to spot from there
prince marth i am general lorenz of grust i have decided to join you in the interest of my fellow grustians
i am honored general thank you caeda tells me you and her father were close
yes how the princess has grown though sharp as a tack that one such a change from when she was  now what am i saying caeda has always been clever even as a wee girl she knew how to wrap her elders about her little finger
you knew caeda when she was little
oh yes the mischief she got into well those are stories for another day first weve a battle to finish
so we do sir
with this lance gradivus i am all but invincible a pity you had to waste your life
nyna  fare  well 
forgive me nyna i was unable to reunite you with your general
no marth i  i should not have made such a selfish request i am sorry so terribly sorry 
 
the worst part marth  the worst part is i knew it would come to this ever since i gave you the emblem i just knew  have you heard the story of artemiss curse
no 
the last time the fire emblem changed hands to save house archanea it was not without cost there was a princess named artemis who loved your ancestor anri with all her heart he loved her as well  but when medeus appeared the two were parted forever she cursed the fire emblem  called it the end of war but also the end of love now the emblem has changed hands again and i am the one who is cursed 
nyna 
look at me so quick to fall apart  you lost loved ones in altea and took it so bravely but i cannot be so brave  please  leave me for a moment this is too much to bear i need to  to confront my feelings 
 say no more nyna  princess i will step out send for me if you need anything
thank you marth 
ahh  camus camus  ahh  no  oh why 
nyna  princess
i am told camus has not been found perhaps he still lives i know how selfish it is to wish it  but if he cannot be with me then i must cling to the hope his life has not been cut short it is all i have left

the archanean heroes hurried to altea but they would not go unchallenged waiting for them at fort menedy were grusts artillery regiment the dreaded “wooden cavalry” missiles crashed down rocking the earth as the enemy ballistae rumbled forward had marth and the league any hope of triumphing over such firepower
grusts artillery our opponent is mighty
nonetheless we must face them head on they stand between us and altea
that hunger for danger worries me marth humanitys hopes rest on your shoulders i would sooner not see them crushed
which humanitys hopes or my shoulders  have a little faith nyna the enemy ballisticians can strike from afar but theyre powerless up close all we need to do is move in and silence them before they do too much damage watch
ballisticians are really only vulnerable to one type of weapon the thunderbolt fresh out of thunderbolts then youll just have to dart in and hit ‘em at close range
we and our countrymen wanted to fight for archanea you know not just us neither they say some of grusts soldiers would sooner rally under archaneas banner than dolhrs but general camus conquered us ‘fore we could act and grust has had us under their thumb ever since heres hopin you win this battle quick we like bein free dont you know
prince marth i presume the names beck i fought in the battle at castle deil after my shameful defeat there see i took refuge in this village and when i heard your army was marchin this way i readied my ballista hopin for another taste of battle so how bout it princey take me along im packin thunderbolts see the enemy ballisticiansll never know what hit em
hello my lover
midia  midia my sweet can it really be you i feared you were dead
oh astram how could you not have heard archanea is free the altean army came and liberated the palace along with all the hostages within now we fight as one come with us astram you neednt dance to dolhrs fiddle any longer
ive a mind to break their fiddle for all the evils they have wrought
now you can we can take them together
that we can  midia i am sorry i left you alone i will not make that mistake again
no you certainly wont now that i have you back youll find me exceedingly reluctant to let you go
ooh  yes i can see that just take care you dont crush me instead of dolhr
you are prince marth
correct sir astram
 forgive my lack of courtesy but you and i need to be clear on a certain point
oh
while i have decided to lend you my sword my allegiance lies with princess nyna not you my lord i will follow your orders but should i learn you have been false to her or that you are manipulating her  heads will roll
well sir astram in the interest of keeping my head atop my shoulders let me suggest this fight with me watch me and then judge for yourself whether i am worthy of your skill and of your help
   hmm very well your orders then lord marth
hmph care to see what steel the wooden cavalry is really made of
nngh  so the prince can fight  but  your victories are numbered  general camus and his sable order will be upon you rabble very  soon  and you will die  on the lance  of the greatest warrior  alive 
spectacularly done marth  does something ail you i thought you would be happier
today there was this commoner  she mentioned grust was divided about the war some of its people wanted to fight with altea she said ever since i lost my father and kingdom ive held nothing but hate in my heart for gra and grust but not once did i give any thought to what must have been going on in their heads
and now you find your hate for them has been lessened
no  the hate remains i will never forget the pain they inflicted upon me the rage i felt yet now at least i can tell you its not just hate not anymore
not all evils are wrought of evil purposes perhaps this sounds naive but a true leader needs to look at his opponent and see more than just an enemy

thus prince marth escaped altea castle with sir jagen and company at his side however this success would mean little to him once he learned the cost the boys woes were just beginning
cain how are your wounds you should rest
these scratches its my pride youre wounding sire  anyway we must talk theres a reason ive returned  sire i am i am to deliver to you his majestys last words
last words you dont mean father 
my condolences sire the king died valiantly on the fields of gra the traitors took from him the divine blade falchion and gave no quarter to those of our soldiers who remained 
i i see so theyre all dead father too 
his last words were as follows tell my son that i leave the future of altea and our continent in his hands he must rise now where i have fallen as falchions rightful heir he has been born into greatness  now he must be great
 father i will try 
 sire i i cannot bear this failing to protect his majesty then leaving my brothers to die slinking away like some coward this indignity is too much to bear one day i will repay them in kind i will avenge the fallen i swear it
cain you speak for us both when that day comes we will punish them together gra dolhr all of them
sire we ought to pay a visit to these homes outside the castle
your countrymen love you perhaps they have knowledge that may serve us
just ‘cause you see an enemy over yonder doesnt mean you should go runnin up to him like a fool lure one out then take ‘im down then go out and lure the next thats how we did it when i was a lad
sir jagen is a paladin the champion of altea ive never met him but i hear hes strong as an ox despite his age still you cant have a champion like him do everything thats not fair to all your would be future champions let our other units fight and gain experience or you may find yourself in a real fix down the line
if you get hurt rest a spell at a fort a short stay there and youll be feeling hale as ever
javelins and hand axes are versatile weapons that let you attack both up close and from a short distance away
weapons arent indestructible you know when a weapons durability reaches 0 thats it no more weapon so be sure to keep an eye on those numbers
look sire not all of gras might harries the castle theyve left soldiers here outside
elice will have no plans to escape  lets seize that fort across the water perhaps we can squash enemy reinforcement at the source
mages that will complicate things they dont need to get as close to do us harm well need to approach carefully
there that ought to do for the enemy soldiers around here malledus why arent you with my sister did you leave her someplace safe
 princess elice will not be joining us she has elected to stay at the castle
hold sire where are you going
where do you think
stop sire consider for a moment why the princess would go as far as to lie to you to ensure your escape your sister knows that you are the future of altea  nay the whole land
 
im our future 
sire  you must live drink deeply now of these injustices sup on these slights they serve remember them one day you will lead us back here to avenge the fallen and reclaim altea in their names
 then it seems my life is no longer mine to hazard
in your veins flows the blood of a hero  the blood of anri you are a son of house archanea and sole heir to falchion  our only hope of defeating medeus emperor of dolhr sire weret in my power i would have you choose you own path but im afraid your path has chosen you
  
his last words were as follows tell my son that i leave the future of altea and our continent in his hands he must rise now where i have fallen as falchions rightful heir he has been born into greatness  now he must be great
/***EOF***/
sire
 frey abel youre alive
yes sire princess elice bade us protect you sir malledus stayed behind to accompany her
sire we must be quick sir jagen awaits us at the gates
blast this will not do how did gras soldiers ever make it this far
jagen and the others will be caught like mice we need to seize the gates and secure the area immediately
now whos that who thinks they can sneak up on us ho ho  whats this i spy the altean prince oi listen up you lot bag the prince dead or alive hell fetch us as sweet a reward as the mind can conjure
hmm they have archers  we need to take care they dont pick us off from afar
sire it gladdens me to see you in one piece its not safe for you here we must be away at once
prince marth where are you answer me sire
cain  thats cain
cain youre supposed to be in gra why have you returned without  yow those wounds 
sire its really you i feared the worst that his message would go undeliv agh 
in that state i dont know how you even stayed ahorse those gashes must be treated at once 
no sire not until weve escaped
 cain i trust you can put off bleeding to death for just a while longer
of course sir  i aim to please 
princess elice the enemy is nearly upon us gather your things quickly
no malledus i am staying here
s staying here what madness is this
too many people have died to keep altea and its castle safe i cannot abandon what so many lives have brought with father and mother unaccounted for i am the natural choice to remain with alteas people and besides by staying i can buy time for the rest of you to escape
nonsense just gather your things and 
malledus i am not suggesting i am commanding if something befalls father marth will become the last person in the entire world worthy of wielding the falchion i want you to guide him malledus  even when the rest of us no longer can
princess i will try my best
theres not much time go malledus  go

dolhr  land of the manaketes before medeus the dragonkin had few dealings with the human realm but when the shadow dragon came everything changed he sunk all archanea into a cycle of war in which heroes rose and heroes fell  always claiming his cause was just and the humans deaths deserved but now medeuss empire was crumbling  he was nearing the end of his reign  even as marth was nearing the end of his long quest
there sire up on the mountains to the south you can see dolhr keep
and inside is medeus king of the earth dragons  the one they call the shadow dragon  why doesnt he leave the keep and face us
i recall lord gotoh saying his return is not yet complete only within the keeps walls can he maintain dragon form
really  then we have the advantage 
to dolhr keep then let us put a stop to this war
nestled in the mountains far to the southeast is a holy temple known as the resurrectory use the staff of aum there and they say you can call a departed friend back from beyond the river of death
princess elice youre safe
oh my merric is that you i havent seen you in ages  so youve been fighting with the league thank you for keeping marth safe
well i did learn a spell or two in khadein here princess get behind me ill face the enemy for us both
youll  face the  aha ha oh merric
whwhats so funny princess i was quite serious ill have you know
ha ha forgive me merric its just i remembered you when you were little  you were always a bit delicate oftentimes i had to nurse you back to health remember
but that was– i couldnt– yes
and look at you now such a brave strong man a far cry from the old merric but you dont have to pretend i know youre far too sweet to mow down hordes of enemies and  i think i prefer it that way
you  you do
this land all of it  it belonged to us then you humans took it defiled it
rrgh  emperor  medeus  forgive your servants weakness 
emperor the enemy has broken through the gates
that impudent boy  have the guards take their positions the keep must be defended
at once
hmph youll find an earth dragon like me harder to tame than gharnef brat come and face me ill tear the ground asunder and send you straight down to hell
marth  can you hear me
lord gotoh
i know you mean to challenge medeus but you and your companions havent the power to win
what why not because i failed to retrieve falchion
you also failed to save the divine dragon girl
i  did not mean for anything to happen to her 
you can put your heart at ease tiki is not dead she has merely returned to her slumber still without her powers  we must take other steps  select a handful of your best warriors i must send you into an unseen dimension
an  unseen dimension my lord
a place outside the confines of our world there you will find a tower and once in the tower you must pass its keepers test if your strength and your need are great enough the towers master will answer  and then perhaps your fortunes will be changed for the better

gras betrayal of altea years earlier had come as a shock of course until that day they attacked marths kingdom in the name of dolhr gra had been a trustworthy neighbor and ally while the altean army was out on an expedition gra struck from the rearm annihilating the altean soldiers killing marths father king cornelius and stealing falchion the blade of light it was a crushing blow much time had passed since that sad day and much had changed now it was marths turn to descend on gra bastion and face king jiol the man who had robbed him of his father
king jiol theyre ‘ere the league is outside the bastion
league how dare you call them that i see naught but a prince of ghosts and his pack of rebels
b beggin your pardon sire but everybody calls em the league now altea and aurelis and archanea the league of as you might say
shut up you idiot hmmm so the princeling has returned and he leads all the might of archanea with the fire emblem in hand did you send to dolhr for reinforcements like i asked
of course sire macedons pegasus knights are on their way
pegasus knights how am i supposed to stop the lea  those rebels with a handful of of winged ponies send another messenger tell them we need camuss sable order or or michaliss dragoons blast i deserve the same protection as the rest of the empire betraying altean was gharnefs idea let let him fight the brat dont just stand there do something i dont want to die
at level 10 some units can change class  move up in the world you might say cavaliers become paladins mercenaries become ‘eroes and err  well i forget the rest
with a silver card you can buy from shops at ‘alf price sounds like somethin out of a dream eh
you must be prince marth of altea i have a favor to ask of you this magic tome belongs to bishop boah of archanea general volzhin of dolhr has been keeping it stashed away but it found its way into my hands you might say i would appreciate greatly if you could return it to the good bishop in my stead one other thing  please take care of princess nyna i am counting on you to keep her safe  i must go now but our paths will cross again you can be certain of that
greetings prince marth i am palla of the whitewinged order of macedon my younger sister and i parted ways with macedon the moment we heard princess maria was free until now we had fought for dolhr against our will  but no longer you have freed us to do what our hearts tell us is right i wish to fight with my mistress princess minerva my lance is hers and yours still sire i fear for my youngest sister est she flew to grust some time ago and has yet to return if the three of us  catria est and i  are reunited we can serve you all the better i hope est is safe
hail prince marth ‘tis me catria we meet again my elder sister and i heard our mistress princess minerva had joined your ranks so we absconded from macedon to come and look for you here i will fight my hardest for you sire you need only give the command
grrr  altean rabble i should have killed you stragglers back when i had the chance
thus falls  the mighty kingdom  of gra 
well done marth altea is just a step away now you can take back your home
yes and take it back i shall but 
something is wrong what troubles you
falchion isnt here
the divine blade was it supposed to be
yes when one of my knights returned from the battle where my father cornelius fell he said gra had stolen falchion and if we are to defeat dolhr and the shadow dragon medeus we need that blade
prince marth
did you find it malledus
no it seems gharnef made off with it
gharnef then to find falchion 
thats right well need to go to khadein the kingdom of magic where he resides it pains me to turn astray when altea is so close but it must be done

not all of the leagues soldiers took catria of the whitewings at her word some insisted her plea was a ruse a trap concocted by princess minerva herself marth doubted that though he had seen the woman in lefcandith valley and she did not strike him as a sort of conniving menace his followers feared as the brunt of grusts might drew closer marth led the league to castle deil determined to attack the citadel and rescue the young macedonian princess maria
princess minerva what brings you here youve left your post not very wise might i remind you poor conduct on your part could have repercussions on how comfortable your sister remains
i am aware of my sister thank you  i did not come to make trouble just let me see maria for a little while shes only a child general think of what she must be going through
impossible im afraid she is a hostage if your sisters well being concerns you then start following orders
general grave news the rebel army has been sighted east of castle deil
what why in creation would the rebels come here blast order the dragoons to sortie and dont forget to send word to the main army we need reinforcements
rebels  then marth has arrived 
you know once there were three great magi in our world miloah the master of aura gharnef the dark pontifex and gotoh the white sage but now miloah is gone  if only there were somebody left powerful enough to stop gharnef 
that medonian princess minerva  she doesnt seem like a bad sort i have a sister too and if somebody threatened to hurt her  well im just sayin you cant always judge people based on their actions
oh you must be prince marth my hes so dashing  thank you for rescuing me please be sure to tell my sister i am free shell be grateful for the news now then shall we be off im coming with you of course  no protesting i wish to help
greetings prince marth i am minerva of macedon thank you for saving my sister marias plight forced me to treat you as an enemy when i knew you were not suffice to say i am deeply sorry for that  the whole world has gone mad most of macedon fights for dolhr now my own brother michalis leads them and on their hands is the blood of their king my father they must be stopped i must stop them still i fear for my soldiers whom i can no longer protect especially the three whitewing sisters palla catria and est dolhr worried we would rebel and forced us to separate if they knew i was safe they would join your ranks in a heartbeat we are yours to command sire let us help you defeat dolhr and repay them for sullying macedons honor
sister
maria  are you all right

grrr  must i do everything myself bah youll not get past me rebel
theyre a force  to be reckoned  with  rrgh 
marth have you ever heard of pontifex miloah
the one who defended archanea with the power of aura of course he and his magic are famous but i read miloah died in a battle with gharnef soon after the fiend sold his soul to dolhr 
alas miloah did die  but his daughter linde yet lives i am told she inherited her fathers skill with aura magic  but since the battle with gharnef none have seen her wherever she is it cannot be pleasant  marth please find linde with her father gone we are the only family the girl has left

after shattering macedons main force outside aurelis castle marth next led his army into the castles halls to liberate the kingdom a number of treasures slept in aurelis castles nooks and crannies but how to extract them before they could fall into enemy hands “only a thief could open chests locked that tight” grumbled one of marths men but we dont have any thieves with us  do we
what the rebels are inside the castle grrr very well armored units intercept the intruders archers defend the throne thieves you go gather up the treasure while i make preparations to withdraw you have your orders dont let those rebels anywhere near this chamber

oh uh  hey there chief been a long time huh so funny story i decided to break in here and clean the place out  and then i got caught hilarious right comedy gold ok your turn what are you doin here
me ive washed my hands of thievery and joined the forces of justice
ohhh really justice so then this wouldnt have nothin to do with some new lady friend you always did have a soft spot for a pretty face and the right features 
wha  can it you little fink i said its about justice im entitled to have moral crisis now and then  you know what just for that you are gonna work for me startin right now

 wow really a prince you say thanks for springin me im rickard just a small time thief mind you but ive got big aspirations i broke in here to clean the place out and instead it was me that got my cloak cleaned  since you saved my hide i guess the least i can do is lend my services in return

blast theyre upon me why didnt those idiot soldiers stop them
rrgh  why  
prince marth  at long last i am nyna of house archanea ‘tis archaneas burden to protect the world of crisis  a duty i have striven to fulfill but dolhr has laid waste to my kingdom and now i find myself powerless to stop the world from falling into ruin marth  please pick up the banner where i have let it fall lead your might against dolhr and free us all
of course princess nyna altea swore fealty to archanea long ago a vow we have always kept and as you know it is in my blood – house alteas blood – to destroy medeus just as anri did before me
thank you marth then let me give you this this crest is called the fire emblem house archanea bestows it only upon a true champion one we believe has the power to save the world with it you gain the right to open treasure chests across the land and wield the precious items within i know you will use them well never give up marth fight until the day you restore light to our world

the league had routed hollstadts knights and recaptured most of the kingdom but there was still the castle to deal with before altea would be free the mage dragon morzas remained entrenched within its walls unlike general camus who preceded him morzas had been a cruel warden slaughtering many innocent alteans at the slightest provocation marth roiled to think such a monster still sat upon his noble fathers throne
kee hee hee  wretched altean whelp stumbling home to the slaughter  what fool throws away a life already so preciously bought your mother liza is dead i killed her myself your sister elice lives only because gharnef wanted her so what will become of you little prince will you run for your life a second time or will you stay this time to die emperor medeus would not put me on this throne if he thought you could remove me from it kee hee hee 
kee hee  witless human none defy a mage dragon and live to speak of it
grrf  i stand  corrected b ut you still lack the power  to defeat medeus 
marth any word have you found your family your sister
 my sister was taken by gharnef she is no longer here  and my my mother is  she is dead slain by that dolhrian dragon 
  marth i am truly sorry 
i thought there would be something some part of my old life i would be coming back to i fought so hard 
you fought wonderfully marth
 sire might i have a moment
all the moments you want malledus what is it
your people have gathered outside the castle they are overjoyed to be free again sire and would like very much to see their prince
all right then ill go at once
marth perhaps you should let that wait just until you are able to share their joy with them we could send someone in your stead 
no that would not do today is a momentous day for my kingdom and my people i must celebrate with them now not later anything else would be a disservice to those who died to save altea i am a prince before i am a son or a brother come malledus let us go greet my people
“glory to marth our prince of light glory to our star and savior” marth smiled down at his people and waved the great commanders last victory of the day was commanding his tears not to flow

marth did as gotoh instructed and chose soldiers for his journey into the unseen what lay within the tower in this alternate world to test him marths heart wavered but with neither the divine blade falchion nor the divine dragon girl to aid him the towers master was his last hope of defeating medeus gotoh had told marth to find a coffin so while most of his companions remained in the material world to battle doluna marth and his chosen few scoured the tower to search of a mysterious savior
this must be the tower lord gotoh spoke of 
sire its teeming with soldiers  who are they they fly no recognizable banner
they are the keepers whose test i must pass
you mean to fight them then
gotoh says we must prove ourselves very well well seize the tower follow me
sire look stairs beneath the throne where could they lead
 do you think this is the coffin
there are no others and look these markings around it are the same pattern we saw in the fane of raman 
hmm youre right 
we found a dragon girl in the fane  i wonder if these symbols huh
sire the coffin  its opening
what no it must be some kind of trap or  or some kind of  er 
 woman could she be the master gotoh spoke of
 who are you
my name is marth prince of altea and you my lady
me my name  is nagi
nagi  i was sent here to find you by a man named gotoh
gotoh  i know that name but from where i cannot recall
youve lost your memory
i  cannot say for certain but your voice  i heard you calling did you rouse me from my sleep
i  er  not on purpose
your soul  called out to me begging for my help for this blade 
that thats falchion how did you get it
i cannot remember  but you need it i know that and you need my powers
your  powers my lady
take me with you i must  finish what i started  i think i must fight with you

at long last altea was free again marth took the league to helena castle in the north an old fortress and key supply point during dolhr and grusts occupation there he meant to seize the last of the enemys gold and provisions but grust would not give up the castle without a fight 
lord dactyl ive brought the mage
good hold him up
 nngh 
well then have you been persuaded to fight for us
 never id rather die
youd rather die ha as if a spell slinging vagabond like you has any choice in the matter enough strip him of all his possessions and lock him up someplace perhaps we can use him later
theres not much to strip him of milord just the tome and this ring 
ring let me have a look at that
no dont you  grr let me go dont you touch ursulas ring
wha  what are you  yaagh
o oi take your hands off lord dactyl
rrgh  please not the ring  give it back
unhand me you filthy maggot
nngh  unnh 
take this wretch away now
at once milord
hmph all that for some tawdry ring  hmm that gives me an idea 
ive brought him milord
good ive had a change of heart i am considering giving that ring of yours back
 
but you must face the league for us how much considering i do hinges on how well you fight
 and how am i to fight unarmed my lord
hmm  ah yes well you can have your little book back but you know what the consequences will be if you betray us 
for now ill just have to feign obedience 
sorry i mean you no harm but neither have i any wish to die here
blast where have those indolent guards gone
unnh  gwaaah
prince marth grusts garrison left their war chest when they fled this much gold should buy plenty of equipment might i suggest sire you avail yourself of this opportunity to outfit your soldiers our next opponent will be grusts sable order by our scouts reports they march to meet us as we speak many say their knights are the strongest on the continent well want to be well prepared
youre prince marth arent you i wish to thank you
 who are you
my name is etzel i am a traveling sorcerer those grustian cowards stole a ring from me and were it not for you i might never have seen it again
the ring must have been very dear to you then
its all i have to remember my wife by she got caught in the fighting back when gra betrayed altea 
those were dark days you have my deepest sympathies i lost my father in the same battle
will there be no end to this bloodshed
there will etzel i have sworn to end it thats the very reason all of us fight
and you think you can end it just like that from anyone elses lips that would sound absurdly naive but i can tell you are sincere tell me prince have you any need for an extra  spell slinger ive no taste for war but i do have a fierce hunger for ending it lets usher in a new era you and i

then you mean to invade
yes and this time general camus will be there to meet us i am sure of it camus the sable they call him many extol him as the most able warrior alive it will be a fierce battle  but one we cannot avoid
you are certain we must face him
we have crippled grust but they will regroup and stand in our way again no we need to stamp this fire out before the wind catches it and starts spreading it anew
very well but before you attack there is something i must tell you later though  not yet i must sort my feelings out first

marth and the others once again moved out from altea and headed towards the imperial capital of millennium court but along their way they passed through the kingdom of gra a land allied to archanea in the previous war gra sided with the dolhr empire which resulted in their king jiol dying in battle and the destruction of the kingdom the country was once a part of altea but they sided with archanea after listening to hardins orders hardin found king jiols daughter princess sheena and allowed her to ascend the throne and he then ordered reinforcements from gra sheena received wild support from the citizens of gra to them sheena was their only hope the youths all volunteered to become soldiers they were happy to move out and have the chance to defeat their bitter enemy altea but their dreams were shattered in an instant  before the fast approaching altean elites gras soldiers lost all morale and fled for their lives
gras army is renowned for its mighty armor knights and generals the late king jiol  our enemy in the last war  was a general himself
i see an army with strong defenses 
in the past yes i hear that gras army now consists of new recruits hardly worthy enemies speaking of strong defenses kris 
your defense is truly overwhelming only a fool would dare approach you even gra at its prime could not compete with your defense this battle has already been decided
your defense is quite impressive no man in gra could match your defense this battle has already been decided
erm your defense  could do with a little more work this is quite worrisome kris the enemies may be new recruits but dont underestimate them
princess sheena it seems the altean army has arrived
really  its already the end samson i have brought you much trouble i need to watch the final days of my kingdom of gra you may leave now
princess isnt it already enough shouldnt you despise king jiol for forcefully taking your mother isnt that why you hid at millennium court and stayed away from this country right now you are just being tricked by hardin and being used by him
perhaps i heard that the people of gra wished for the restoration of the country and thats why i agreed to help him however hardin is only interested in using us he would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him still i will not leave how can i just abandon those fighting for my sake
impossible  how can our fresh recruits resist alteas elites  fine if youre staying i will also stay to the end this could be interesting
samson  why are you doing this arent you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold i no longer have money to give you 
i dont know why either its just  sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do also i want to see how that kid fights this battle if he truly is a hero perhaps your mind may be changed 
what  what have you done  i believed you altea i trusted you  how dare you  ill kill all of you
prince marth  how unfortunate i thought you a better man
what  what have you done  i believed you altea i trusted you  how dare you  ill kill all of you
hardin sent troops here to prevent gra from rebelling the archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight
princess sheena is the child of king jiols second wife but she is different from the king she is a very kind person the princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers is there no way to save her
the soldiers here are all foreigners theres nobody else to protect this country because the knights of this country all died right now the actions of the archanea soldiers are deplorable their just the same as thieves  those lowlifes
ah  please leave me i already have nothing to give you
ah please dont get us wrong we arent here to steal
but didnt you all come here from altea for revenge
no we dont want to fight gra because gra and altea were originally like one family
is that true  then i will give my most important treasure  to  you
you are princess sheena its great to see you safe i dont view gra as an enemy gra and my country were originally one country the country may have divided after anris death but we always got on well as allies but in the previous war i felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did princess sheena please allow us to be friends once again i dont want to fight gra
prince marth  once i heard that you didnt attack my fleeing soldiers i was really surprised you truly are the second coming of king anri i trust you please  treat the citizens of gra  as if they were your citizens i will hand my whole country to your care  prince marth
thats great sheena now i can finally leave without worry
samson  can you not leave 
you dont need me anymore from now on prince marth will protect you
dont leave i dont want you to leave 
huh what why keep me it doesnt seem like you  fine if you say you need me i wont go anywhere else i will protect you wherever you may go is that fine with you
yes 
prince marth ive been waiting for you im tomas an archanean soldier  or was ive since retired from the army the archaneans here just want to sacrifice the defenceless gra soldiers this act of brutality by my former homeland  i cannot tolerate please prince marth let me fight with you in some way
you  you dare treat my citizens like that  die
forgive me citizens of gra
prince marth  i thought you were a noble person but youre just a murderer  you disappoint me
sheena 
sire to keep fighting like this is pointless all we are accomplishing is buying hardin more time
my thoughts exactly if we continue like this more blood will be spilt for naught kris do you have any sort of plan
according to our information the enemys primary force is concentrated along the highway i wonder if we can avoid that route by passing through the mountains
hmph wed have to cross adria pass  but the steep mountains make it dangerous for an army of our size
thats true and i fear the enemy may have prepared an ambush as well our bravery could be our undoing but it is the fastest possible route if we could just break through there wed be in walking distance of the palace
i am prepared for the danger we managed to conquer the same perilous road that anri walked compared to that  jagen kris we can overcome this challenge order the advance
oof  seems ive finally caught up
hmm and you are
my name is frost i am a priest of macedon when macedon was taken over by those warmonging rebels  you came and saved our country thanks to you my familys now safe i have come to return the favor
i see but hasnt it been some time since prince marth freed macedon 
your army marched at speed and this old geezer just couldnt keep up eventually i lost sight of you  but then i heard that marth had freed altea as well and i finally managed to catch up with you here in gra i am old now but i can still fight please allow me to to join you
/***EOF***/
soon after reclaiming the fane of raman marths army fears pursuit from the archanean army and escapes towards chiasmir bridge however a new enemy attacks the altean army upon reaching the central islet
the archanean army is coming from the north well be surrounded like this
the situation is desperate can marth and his friends overcome the many perils
huh kris whats with the hat
this lord wendell gave it to me so that my cold wouldnt get any worse
from lord wendell i see  chiasmir bridge has a strong sea wind so its good to have a hat to keep warm it suits you kris
really thank you sire
sire youre safe kris you too youve guarded prince marth well
sir cain you made it
im truly glad that you came back unharmed cain
yeah somehow i managed to shake off the enemy and escape here but the enemy is already approaching from the north
dont worry we will crush them
no not this time hardin is being protected by a mysterious power we cant lay a finger on him so even if we fight him now we havent a chance of winning please head to the northwestern fortress theres a boat across the river which we can use to escape to the khadein desert
sire the free company to the south will probably make their move soon indeed nows not the time to fight for the time being lets do as cain suggests and make our escape after that well think of something 
i see  i dont like it but we havent a choice  everyone hurry to the northwest fortress
if ya ask me archersll always get along well with archers
oh look if it isnt prince marth long time no see lad it seems so noisy out i wonder whats happened
ah bantu fancy meeting you in a place like this how is tiki
oh she is no longer by my side lord gotoh took her to the ice dragons temple again
the ice dragons temple wheres that ive never heard of such a place 
its in the icy lands far north of here but its no place for humans besides the hero anri no man has been there yet
anri are you perchance referring to the realm of the gods from anris legends
im not at liberty to say anything more if you want to know more you should ask lord gotoh anyhow i have a favor to ask of you my precious firestone was stolen by thieves if you can get it back for me ill show you how it works thank you prince marth
 hasten the preparations of the troops within the fortress i want marth cornered like a rat 
heh heh heh  prince your struggle is in vain but let us continue this game for a while just know that youre fast running out of time soon i will kill you myself 
heh heh heh  prince marth its been far too long
hardin  why did you attack our country what would compel you to do such an act i  i cant believe this have you really changed this much
prince i am the ruler of this continent and the emperor of archanea i will show no quarter to anyone who opposes me that includes you prince  i must destroy this foul world  it is beyond salvation traitors playtime is over you will all die here all soldiers attack do not leave a single traitor standing
good day sir
ack you y youre  caeda
thank goodness roger its nice to see you again
uh  uhm you should know ive no plans to betray archanea i was just thinking about that time when you asked me do you believe in love but im different from who i was back then
really but you still seem like a nice man thats why i wanted to speak with you again
uhh 
may i just ask why are you fighting for archanea
be because archanea has already taken over the world resistance is futile no one can win my life is precious to me if i side with whoevers stronger then im guaranteed to live longer 
i see
a are you disappointed with me
no never as i thought youre fighting for what you believe in youre not different youre the same kind man as when i first met you and im happy for that
uhhh  wait  youre leaving
yes i too must fight for what i believe in but ill make a request to marth so that we dont have to fight you im happy that we could talk again roger
w wait  as i thought youre still very kind dare i say we dont have girls quite like you back in grust or archanea um perhaps  i suppose i could  aw heck im going with you again
wait sir jeorge i wish to speak with you
prince marth  please lower your weapon i dont want to fight you
i know as do i you taught gordin how to use a bow and you were an instructor to the junior knights of altea youve been a great boon to altea i could never fight you sir jeorge
prince  i pledge allegiance to princess nyna but i can tolerate hardin no longer  taking other countries by force executing rebels without reason 
 hardin was my friend but he has changed beyond recognition if he is committing any sort of crime then i shall stop him jeorge please help me
 i understand prince to return the kingdom of archanea to what it was once before  i will take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland
master please wait
hm  gordin long time no see you seem to have gotten a little sturdier but has your bow arm improved any
yes at the moment i  they call me alteas master of bows its thanks to you master that ive been able to progress this far
and did you come here because you wanted to challenge your old teacher
n no its not like that   i might be asking the impossible but id like you to fight alongside us again sir
  
please master
i pledged allegiance to princess nyna but as for hardin  ive had it with him taking other countries by force executing rebels without reason the archanean army i see now is just a collection of hired thugs theres not even a shred of chivalry left to return the kingdom of archanea to what it was once before  i must take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland gordin convey that to prince marth
thank you master
i dont want to fight you guys but its not as if i have a choice 
ugh  i just wanted to meet her  once more  once more 
you traitors ill show you the might of mercurius
midia  my love 
you wouldnt have needed to die if you hadnt come so close fools 
what fools 
rebel soldiers  come to die have you ill show you the terror of gradivus
prince marth ill bury you with these very hands
who are you your face is unknown to me
kris i am prince marths royal guard emperor hardin of archanea the prince told me you were once a trusted friend why would you do something like this
kris is it  what does it matter to you you will die here regardless
who are you your face is unknown to me
kris i am prince marths royal guard emperor hardin of archanea i never knew you in the past but i do know this you are now the princes enemy
you may come kris but no one may even scratch me you will soon know to fear  the power of the darksphere 
please hurry sire the enemy is closing in on us
but everyone is still fighting i cant just leave them behind
worry not sire i will remain here i will regroup with everyone later

sire you of all people know that kris is more than capable as long as kris is there everyone will escape safely and reunite with you at once now sire to the boat
i will be the rear guard everyone hurry up and escape lord wendell you too
oh right i just remembered i should probably return this hat 
oh yeah i just remembered i should probably return this hat 
i dont mind if you keep it for a little longer do you wish to give it back
yes thank you it was most comfortable
no no twas nothing  by the way should i be hurrying too
erm  yes hurry up and escape
no  if its all right with you id like to hold on to it a little longer

those guys are so carefree but i suppose i can start slacking off as well
indeed i too can finally  return to my eternal sleep 
thank you kris for protecting and supporting me no amount of thanks would be enough but among the people your deeds are being told as things ive done alone  that just will not do once we return to the castle ill 
if you allow me sire  i have no need for a name i dont want stories to be told of me
kris 
sire with this war now over a hero will be needed a hero called prince marth there are still hostilities between people who have fought for so long those wont disappear easily in order to have everyones agreement a king everyone recognizes   a godlike hero is needed and that hero must be you sire and you alone
but then what youve done so far will be 
even if the world doesnt know you do sire and thats enough for me i shall stay by your side i shall be your shadow
kris  youre   why i wonder ever since we met i felt a special connection with you fate sent you to me  i cant help but think that thank you kris please stay with me kris youre my other half my true friend 
thus the long tragic battle that would later be called the war of heroes finally came to an end the seven kingdoms were unified under prince marth of altea and as the united kingdom of archanea was established an era of peace began the tales of the heroes who took part in this war brought excitement and tears to the later generations chronicles of the archanean war of heroes this is a story of love and courage about the young warriors who fought with the continents fate at stake

marth and his friends follow xane marching towards the northern lands before their eyes are walls of towering mountains sheer cliffs and deep valleys  after passing countless mountains they are assaulted by scorching heat magma flowing like a river and rumbling like thunder blocks their way truly a dreadful scene as if straight out of a nightmare
this place  its incredible  i feel as though im burning up just by standing here
this is flame barrel  the fire dragons graveyard its where the fire dragons whove degenerated into savage beasts come to wait for their death
degenerated you say  what do you mean by that
im not sure if youre aware but the dragon tribe is dyin those who dont confine their true dragon form in a stone eventually lose all reason and become monsters
so thats why they become manaketes xane if you know something about the dragon tribe please tell me
if you really wanna know  tens of thousands of years ago the dragon tribe settled down on this continent and created a civilization they possessed intellect and abilities far exceedin those of humans but suddenly outta nowhere their day of destruction came at first they couldnt bear children then they began to lose their minds goin berserk one after the next the elders warned that the end of dragons as a species was approachin there was no longer any way to prevent it however there was one way they could survive to discard their identities as dragons and live on as humans the dragons fell into a panic those who believed the elders sealed their forms within stones and became humans but those who couldnt throw away their pride as a dragon those who adamantly refused to become human  they eventually lost their minds and became naught but beasts 
those fire dragons before us 
yeah theyre a livin example and its not just them there are many others but theyve all gone feral now theres no way for them to go back  worse still theyve been manipulated and degraded like cattle by the fire clans who rule over this valley well princey whadya say we get out of here the clansmen around here aint friendly if we hang around well end up as bait for their dragon pets
darros what brings you here i thought you had washed your hands of your pirating days 
prince marth  forgive me i was lookin tstart anew but there be no place tgo for an outcast like me  to resume and continue these crimes tis dishonorable indeed
i see  darros you cannot stay here come with us
prince marth  ye would still accept a fool like me  prince i  this time i be changin for sure me life is yours
please forgive me i never wanted this
of course  course id die  for what ive done 
phew and that be the end of the fire dragons valley how you doin princey
im fine  i think xane i believe you said that there were other feral dragon tribes
yeah in addition to this valley theres the wyverns dale the ice dragon shrine and the dragons altar 
the dragons altar
its a dragon graveyard in the mountains of macedon there the earth dragons sleep a long time ago  thousands of years ago in fact  the mighty earth dragons lost their minds and attacked the humans course the humans barely stood a chance most were annihilated and the rest pushed into the desolate corners of the continent and then  the divine dragon naga strongest of them all waged a war for humanity it was a fierce battle but naga emerged victorious in the end and sealed the earth dragons below dolhr in a deep sleep and so that the power of the seal would not wither she created the shield of the five orbs and placed it in the fane of raman
i see  i understand now in other words our guardian deity naga depicted in legend was the divine dragon that saved humanity but then what about the divine sword falchion
naga took pity on you humans with no way of protecting yourselves so she created it from one of her fangs then together with the shield she sealed it in the fane and had the remainin dragon houses watch over humanity she put the newly born tiki to sleep and thus ended her 5000 year life cause of all this gotohs tryin his best to carry out nagas order
wait xane  are you telling me 
yes gotoh is a divine dragon and guess what so am i
blast  this heat is absurd i wasnt sweating this much in the desert  im usually tolerant of heat but this is simply unbearable  but kris you seem 
you seem  unfazed are you not hot
i have confidence in my strength sir jagen it seems that our companions are catching up to us ill go and carry them over here
what strength  its as though youre invulnerable your reliability is astounding
you seem to be struggling too  are you holding out alright
yes ive still some strength in me sir jagen it seems that our companions are catching up to us ill go and support them
good im depending on you
you seem a little dizzy  are you holding out alright
no  i im  not doing so well  still  if i could just use my strength  oh no i feel all weak 
kris are you well oomph how troublesome  youd best hold onto me
i im sorry 
please pardon my sudden rudeness but might you be prince marth
who are you 
i am belf and these men here are robert and leiden we rushed here because we wish to join your battle
we were once knights of the sable order of grust but we have now separated from our homeland
we threw away our ranks as knights and now live to protect those who are powerless
the sable order of grust  but in the previous war we fought against the sable order as enemies despite that youre willing to join our army
our general wished for us to protect the weak regardless of nationality he is gone now so we would like to fulfill his final wish
     i see you seem to speak truly very well id like you to fight alongside us

marth was unable to reunite with princess minerva and so in order to help ogma and the grustian royal children he decided to visit wendell who was once the childrens guardian

dyou know of a staff called rescue i hear you can bring faraway allies right next to you in a flash itd be so cool if it were true
oh those star shards are so shiny and pretty if you hold on to them something good might happen to you
these days all them bandits and piratesve been doin as they please geez this wouldnt ave appened if it werent for all them political tomfoolery
oh youre  youre  the prince of altea how nice of you to drop by sir
i heard lord wendell was living here
yes that er  was correct  yesterday a group of archanean soldiers suddenly came and took the pontifex away although prince  he did leave his magic tome behind i believe its wind magic please take it with you
well if it isnt castor what brings you to a place like this
ah prince marth erm  actually i need money for medicine for me sick mother but i couldnt find any work in talys so i moved here instead
i see  thats terrible  i do hope your mother gets better well goodbye then 
    wait me mother shes really sick  i need money sir 
hm oh right here its only a little but i hope it helps
uhm  thank you prince marth you dont have to be so kind to a guy like me 
castor  thats a bit much  its only natural to help someone in need
no prince marth youve done so much for me i want to help you please let me fight alongside you you have my life at your disposal
gahahaha wont be long now til my boys hidden in the forts all spring out n attack i can almost see the precious looks on their bewildered faces
and just who the hell are you are you in league with the pirates
i am sirius a mere traveler
oh i see im a little bit worked up right now sorry about the mix up
those children 
im taking care of them do you know them
no i dont  but i do know that as things stand you wont escape with them as i understand it the altean army should arrive here provided you reach the southern village please allow me to distract the bandits while you make your escape to safety
i see so prince marth is here eh got it thanks ive got to ask though why help a group of complete strangers like us
i want to save the children that is  all
i see  sirius  you said your name was sirius right lets meet again after we both get out of here theres someone i need to take care of  the guy in charge of grusts occupation commander lang i want to avenge a man named lorenz  you  join me  if ive got you on my side then ill be that much stronger
yes  that would be interesting but first you have to survive hurry and go
touch me and ill strike you down
how foolish of me 
im sorry  i wasnt thinking gahaha just kidding ill be smashing your pretty head in
i wont  forget this
marth
caeda did something happen why are you here
marth  altea  altea was attacked by the imperial army the archanean league  gra and aurelis ambushed us our forces were annihilated and we lost the castle 
wh what did you say this cant be happening altea is 
damn our homeland has fallen to the enemy 
this is terrible beyond words  that which i feared the most has come to pass emperor hardin likely heard langs story and had us branded traitors
i refuse to believe it hardin would never attack altea youre telling me that he believed lang and truly thought that i wished to instigate a rebellion never
no i agree with you sire this attack was too soon it happened far too quickly for an attack of this scale a great number of preparations had to have been in place it is likely  that the grust campaign was a setup as was the situation in macedon its quite simple really they had you leave altea with your elite knights in tow and then proceeded to attack our weakened defenses hardin had this planned right from the start
thats preposterous are you implying that hardin  with no provocation whatsoever  decided to attack his fellow nation are you seriously suggesting this was all an elaborate trap no i wont accept it  hardin  why
sire  princess caeda what of the others is princess elice safe
elice she  she gave herself up in order to let me escape with this message marth  im so sorry she wanted me to warn you no matter what  sniff 
caeda  dont cry i understand just knowing youre safe makes me happy i should be the one apologizing i shouldnt have left  you neednt have to go through this we will take back altea even if we have to fight hardin we will reclaim our homeland
oh by the way kris about that hairstyle of yours  have you decided to keep it that way
 do you think it looks funny well itll grow back eventually if i leave it alone  do you think i should return it to normal
well its your decision to make you should do as you please so what will it be are you going to go back to the hairstyle you had before
yeah ill have to apologize to father wrys later but i think ill change it back to normal
yes i do believe that would be a good idea
no its alright im quite fond of my new hair  or lack of it rather
i is that so well if thats your wish then i can hardly complain

once upon a time the region of macedon was a territory under dolhrian rule a century ago the dragonkin rulers sent many slaves to these wild forests to excavate ruins and build a country many slaves were forced to work to their limits barely fed and then slaughtered
a young man stood up against such tragic conditions iote was his name he and his companions fled to the forests and fought astride wyverns to free the slaves after dolhrs demise the slaves established their own country in these now abundant lands and the hero iote was chosen as their first king and so was born the kingdom of macedon later feared as the domain of dracoknights
however the might macedon was stripped of prince michalis said to be the second coming of iote and is now on the brink of losing princess minerva the so called red dragon
hah hyah
i see you train without the need for sleep most admirable kris
ah sir jagen
a strong offense and a tough defense are obviously important but  you cannot afford to neglect your skill without the skill to deliver it it matters not how mighty your attack is if it does not reach the enemy speaking of which 
your skill is like that of an expert  i have nothing to add keep up the good work
thank you sir jagen
your skill is not bad dont fall behind the other knights the experience you gain from training and combat will help elevate your skill further be ever diligent
yes sir jagen
your skill is still insufficient  it ought to be better than this you may or may not have the talent for it but dont give up  the more experience you gain from training and combat the more you can refine your skill be ever diligent
y yes sir jagen
julian good news catria finally brought the altean army for us were going to join their ranks to help save princess minerva please take lena and escape to safety quickly
no can do palla lenas disappeared  im not leaving by myself
what lena as well  princess maria is missing too why is it only clerics 
anyway im staying in the village to see if i cant find any information sorry palla give my best to prince marth
this is just between you and me but i heard that armory is in league with the rebels if youre going to enter you should be careful not to get jumped
i wonder whats going to happen to macedon they say that prince michalis is dead and princess maria is nowhere to be found  on top of that they say that princess minerva has been captured and that her life is in peril i just hope  that this country doesnt end up like grust 
you know a little while ago a paladin came here said he was on a journey he was wearing a mask but im sure that underneath he was a good person he was kind yet wrapped in a veil of sorrow i wonder if ill ever see him again 
the pegasus knight trio must be lonely without est and i was such a fan of their triangle attack too  oh est  come home already will ya
have you noticed the large drawbridge behind this village normally its separated by the river but if you use this key here you can cross the bridge just once you cross the drawbridge the enemies on the other side will come and attack you at once if you want to advance safely you might be better off taking the long detour that goes right around the mountain here take the key no matter which path you take do take care of yourself mkay
you youre bord youve come to macedon as well
long time no see prince cord already joined with yous guys right we talysian mercenaries wanted to join yous army so we came all the way here princess caedas our lady and the guy whos gonna be her man is important to us too prince marth ill protect you with my life
hey prince its been a while hasnt it its me julian
julian id heard that youd gone to macedon with lena but to think wed cross paths here  how is lena of course shes with you right
well er how should i say this  lena suddenly up and vanished  i  i dont know what to do
wait julian tell me what happened in detail
lenas been missing since last night the villagers speak of some sort of strange priest prowling around lately it seems that somehow lena was taken by this man
a priest  julian as it turns out princess maria has gone missing as well i have a terrible feeling about this anyway staying here wont solve anything come with us im worried for lena too well all help to look for her
prince marth  thank you nothing would please me more
rucke im impressed a spineless coward like you could throw this country into so much chaos ill hazard a guess that hardin talked you into this
wha   y youre  b but how 
thought i was dead haha  my death was but a trifle hand minerva over to me rucke i no longer have plans for this country do with it as you please however i wont rest until ive disposed of him with my own hands
u uhh  but princess minerva is barely breathing  nobody could save her now 
do you want me to shove this spear down your throat i said bring her to me
y yes of course s somebody bring the princess here
its been a while minerva that ungainly appearance doesnt suit you losing maria your subordinates abandoning you  is this the ideal country you dreamed of
mi  michalis  how 
hey cut it out why must you always insist on pointing your sword at us i pity lena for having to put up with your stupidity
oh its you julian are you still trying to worm your way into lenas good books no way i wont hand my cute lil sister to a thieving rat like you
you can relax  lena and i would never work out but even if its just a little i wanted to help her in any way i could
ooh you finally realized where you stand attaboy julian
er thats not the kind of thing i want to be hearing from you  well whatever if youre worried about lena then come with me
oh alright thanks you see they forced me to join the rebel army but you know i hate fighting alright lil brother lets join forces and look for our cute lil lena
lena  where are you what i would give to hear your voice just once before i die 
lena  f forgive  your foolish big brother 
d damn it  why is the altean army here  youre all going down with me die
the altean knights  as i expected 
sire the rebels have fled the castle but i regret to inform you that princess minerva was nowhere to be found
what could have happened she was supposed to be held inside the castle 
oh hoh i knew this task was unworthy excellent work prince marth well take care of macedon from here now let us discuss your next mission
general lang what in the world do you want this time
well you see  my castle was attacked and the grustian prince and princess were kidnapped the perpatrator fled to macedon it seems prince marth you are to capture him and return the children to me
youre asking me to send those children to their doom
youre in no position to defy me now off to work you go my prince
you  your rudeness towards my liege has gone too far  shut up prince marth is not your minion
what did you say know your place altean soldier marth it seems that your countrymen are devoid of manners
 i apologize on hisher behalf but it is as kris says general lang i will no longer follow your orders from here
sire 
what do you mean to defy my orders i see  i see as i suspected it was your doing the person who kidnapped grusts prince and princess was the mercenary ogma on your orders no less
i didnt know of this but if i had the choice i would have done exactly as you suggested back at grust even though they were meant to be our enemies i should have helped those children
you you clearly speak words of treason perhaps i should report this to the emperor
do as you will but youre not the only person who intends to visit the palace i will speak to emperor hardin and princess nyna and inform them of your crimes forgive me jagen but i cannot stand for this any longer
i understand you have endured well until now lang my liege might forgive your frequent rudeness to him but i will not come draw your sword even though i jagen am old and senile i will not lose to the likes of you
wh  what did you say damn you  ill remember this once the emperor gets wind of this ill crush your puny little altea
jagen  youre a bag of surprises to think youd stand up against lang like that
sire are you underestimating me in my old age bwahaha  im not about to let youngsters like kris hog all the glory just yet still ill admit it was somewhat foolish to contest with lang even if he did push my lord at every turn
sire sir jagen what is our next plan of action
according to lang ogma is on his way to macedon he probably intends to visit the village where lord wendell resides
lord wendell
lord wendell is a pontifex of khadein he fought as our ally in the last war i hear hes living in macedon now it also happens that the children that ogma saved were raised by lord wendell so im sure it would be the perfect time to pay him a visit
yes understood
but i worry about lang  i pray that nothing bad shall happen 
kris are you aware that weve been searching for the assassins who besieged altea a year ago 
ah i assume since youre mentioning it that youve found a new lead
were not certain but weve received information that might lead us to them a few days ago i heard of a suspicious group heading towards macedons northern mountains
the northern mountains what could they be after up there
rumors say they are pursuing our former allies in the war of shadows  and i dont believe theyre after a friendly chat with them either
i see then we cannot ignore this lead especially if lives are at stake jagen kris we shall pursue the enemy
agreed let us prepare to march with haste
/***EOF***/
a stone bridge leading up the tall rocky mountain this stone bridge seems to stretch to the heavens as it spirals around from the rocks fearful roaring and breathing sounds can be heard as if the mountain was alive the dragons table  it is asn ancient ruin of the dragon tribe and the place where the divine dragon king naga sealed away the earth dragons now after a period of 600 years the earth dragons are currently awakening and countless evil demons are being born 
   thats uh certainly one heck of a hat  a gift from ymir i presume
yes it keeps me warm although im worried that itll stand out 
i should be if i were you if you stepped out on the battlefield wearing that youd be a popular target 
prince marth in this altar lurks many savage barbarians and mage dragons long gone mad they have fallen under gharnefs spell and will attack you given the chance gharnefs servants   the heretic priests possess great power they are not to be taken lightly if you let this battle drag on it may become fiercer than you can handle do not stop make for the end at once once you defeat gharnef retrieve the falchion that he stole from your altea as you well know without the falchion defeating medeus will be nigh impossible 
i understand lord gotoh my friends and i shall sally forth to the deepest depths of the altar
it would be wise to bring this ally with you she has deigned to lend you her strength
  
youre 
another ally from the previous war sire
no i dont believe weve ever met but why  i have the strangest feeling that i know her 
my name  is nagi i will  stop the enemy  you must hurry to the throne room  go  this time  everything  must end  
sire look stairs they probably lead further in we must hurry sire
right kris  by the way do you intend to wear that hat from here on out
actually im not entirely sure its very warm as sir ymir said but i stick out like a sore thumb 
indeed the enemies looked surprised well what is your decision are you going to take it off
yes i think i will remove it for this battle
excellent choice well lets hurry
no i rather like it its so toasty
i i see well then lets go

it is the second month of the third year in the history of the empire  archaneas holy city of pales is in the midst of a time of mysterious silence archanea because of a civil war begun by the paladin midia has arrested many capable knights however archanea still has twice the military power of altea to fill the streets of pales with it has already been nearly a whole year since the expedition to grust and now at long last the final battle which would decide the fate of both countries was about to begin 
as expected the archanean army is extremely powerful we must approach with great caution
it seems that hardin has assembled his entire army for the battle
even so the people have lost their faith in emperor hardin they welcome us as liberators it is certainly very reassuring this is our final battle it may drag on but all the same i would ask that you take utmost care
kris the enemy is the archanean imperial army the continents strongest and most renowned military force its strange but im not afraid kris if youre here then everything will be okay everyone lets go
as expected the archanean army is extremely powerful we must approach with great caution
it seems that hardin has assembled his entire army for the battle
even so the people have lost their faith in emperor hardin they welcome us as liberators it is certainly very reassuring this is our final battle it may drag on but all the same i would ask that you take utmost care
kris the enemy is the archanean imperial army the continents strongest and most renowned military force im not worried though  i know how strong you are kris you wont lose to anyone
yes sire please leave it to me
everyone lets go
i knew it you intend to invade coyotes palace the king forbade us from interfering  but i will do anything to protect coyote ill defy his edict if i have to
prince marth  it is i roshea of the wolfguard i received king aureliss pardon and have been waiting for you i am truly sorry for the battle of the pass i realize that an apology means little so i will now fight under your banner but  the other wolfguard members have all sided with the archanean army i wonder if i could persuade them vyland at the least  vyland might listen to what i have to say
emperor hardin was once a kind man but he suddenly changed into such a frightening emperor  ah  if i say things like this i will get killed as well
midia is the pride of archanea she was the daughter of th highest officer of archanea duke owen this rebellion only came about because she could not stand and watch us suffer no matter what you must rescue her
we thought that nyna and hardins marriage would finally bring peace to the world yet this happened oh deities  what should we do 
midia is really pitiful she only just retired as a knight to live together with astram and now she has been separated again shes still a young girl its so sad what can you do to help her 
the archanea army has changed the troops are all bloodthirsty savages now what is going on with this country
oh this is so sad those that opposed emperor hardin have all been killed  could the emperor be possessed by a demon 
vyland why are you here the king told us not to interfere aha have you decided to join the altean army like me
roshea i came to bring you back why have you turned to the alteans we are coyotes subordinates open your eyes youre being deceived
youre wrong vyland the time i spent with the alteans was short but i know one thing for sure its not as coyote says theyre not evil people
roshea 
vyland please i dont want to fight all of you especially you vyland 
     well roshea  you were always the kindest out of us in the wolfguard youve always been able to tell which were the good guys and which were the bad i cant fight you roshea if you our brother in arms are this sure then i believe you i am your ally from now on
vyland 
sedgar hold on its me vyland
whats the meaning of this vyland dont tell me youve defected
listen sedgar i  i dont know what am i supposed to do i loved coyote like a brother all i wanted was to fight for him but  but he has changed for the worse its as though hes someone else now 
  
i wanted to serve him always thats why ive been turning a blind eye i shut myself trying to remember the coyote who loved us so long ago it really hurt to face the truth that coyotes not who he used to be  i just dont know anymore hey sedgar  what the hell am i supposed to do
vyland  i too  i feel the same way i know hes gone insane but i looked the other way and blocked my senses one day hell go back to being our coyote  thats what i kept telling myself
roshea has gone over to the alteans i cannot fight him sedgar you should come too i dont know whats right anymore but i dont want to fight you either
yes  even though coyotes madness was clear to me i did nothing i have to make this right
wolf hold your fire
sedgar what are you doing so youve chosen to betray coyote
no its not like that this is for coyotes own good somethings wrong with coyote even you must know that
that changes nothing i will die at coyotes side i swore as much though all of you might betray us though i might be alone i will not abandon him
even though you disobey his heart
what do you mean
wolf do you remember what coyote said to you the day you became commander of the wolfguard
  
if i should wander from the path of the righteous please  lead me back onto it thats what he said
i should never have forgotten the words of coyote himself  but to tell me that time has come  that we must  that we must defeat coyote 
we have to remind coyote of the day we swore allegiance to him no matter how painful it may be  that is our only recourse i never wanted to believe it would come to this 
enough sedgar for goodness sake  it would have been better had i died at adria pass  i am the commander of the wolfguard  the life that coyote gave me  i will not waste it even if that should lead to coyotes death 
what  our archanea has been defeated but as long as im here i wont let you enter the castle
glory to the emperor 
oh lord marth ive been waiting for you
boah youve suffered a grave wound  what happened
mmm  it was truly frightening  i suppose the archanea royal family is indeed under a curse you should know about hardin and nynas marriage two years ago to restore archanea a king was required and only two people were suitable king aureliss younger brother hardin and alteas prince marth you  those were the choices and we pleaded for nyna to make the final decision originally she wanted to wait a while longer but we begged for her to make up her mind immediately in the end she said that choosing prince marth as her husband would hurt princess caeda so she finally decided on hardin
wait a second wasnt that a little harsh on nyna i understand that archanea needed a king but nyna she already 
you are referring to grusts lord camus but that would be unspeakable  unthinkable in fact princess nyna was the sole successor of the royal bloodline of archanea i felt bad as well but for this country we had no other choice however lord hardin was very happy compared to ascending archaneas throne he seemed happier about the fact that nyna chose him for her husband
i also understand hardins feelings he could sacrifice his own life for nyna but did he know about camus if he did i dont believe he would be so happy
mmm  of course we kept that a secret and we also persuaded nyna to hide it as best as she could but lord hardin was a very sensitive man he quickly found out that nynas heart had no place for him he felt very painful  he locked himself in his room and didnt allow anybody to see him taking advantage of his broken heart gharnef appeared he took on the guise of a merchant to approach hardin and showed him the darksphere the distraught hardin was quickly consumed by the orb from that day on he completely changed it was because i was only focused on restoring this country that i committed such a horrendous mistake please forgive me prince marth 
i cant believe all that happened   where is nyna now
when hardin discovered that she had taken the fire emblem he had her confined in her room after that she would still communicate in secret with me however hardin found out and then wounded me he also handed nyna over to gharnef
gharnef 
mmm  gharnef had always wanted to take nyna he said that the resurrection of the dark dragon required the blood of noble clerics  and so  he took nyna  to use her as a live sacrifice  lord marth im already done for i will give my thoron and physic to you i beg of you please rescue nyna even if archanea is destroyed it no longer matters  i only wish for nyna to be safe

seeking the lightsphere marth and his friends headed for the tower of thabes
thabes is an ancient city buried under the sands along with many treasures the legend of thabes city of illusion lured many adventurous men to the desert however in the end  not one of them ever returned as the sages once said  stay clear of mamorthod the desert of death there lies the cursed dark city
huh  w whos there
sire its me kris
oh its just you  you had me startled for a moment especially with that mask on you 
is it that strange
well  perhaps a little do you mean to fight like that
yes
i i see
jagen where in the world are we 
this is the path depicted in the anri saga the first obstacle in anris way the desert of death with its scorching sun raging sandstorm savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns that soar and dominate the skies as the city of illusion shimmers in the distance we can only stand and gaze  or so the legend has it
so anri came through here as well and by himself too 
thats right your ancestor and alteas founder king anri  to save princess artemis he set out on a journey to seek the divine blade falchion
king anri was strong i wouldnt be able to cross through here alone im truly grateful to those who offered to accompany me through this desert
i think everybody wishes to follow you sire everyone wants to be with you wherever you go they will follow thats what i believe its because of your kindness sire
thank you i dont have anris power but i have all of you wonderful companions like you kris thats how i can keep going lets go kris

listen jake were fighting for the peace of the continent again could you help us like old times 
i dunno i kinda lost my ballista so i doubt id be much use to you
thats not true youd help us a lot just by being there

xane how do you know lord gotoh just who are you
well lemme see i dont think that really matters right now hey put that jaw back in place and follow me
kris i noticed you fighting with that mask on
yes the desert sun was strong but it acted as a shield nevertheless i suppose theres little point in wearing it now
i see are you going to remove it then
yes i think i shall
yes thats probably a good idea
no ill keep fighting with it on
i is that so  does it not bother you in any way
not at all i can fight just fine with it on
i i see well if thats what youve decided then i have no problems with it
/***EOF***/
sire lord horace should be inside this fort
it seems the enemy has already infiltrated the building please be careful sire
all right let us fight with caution
uwee hee hee  horaces was it youses a stubborn ones  yous already killed three of our brotherses but there are mores of us  moreses moreses moreses how longs can you last uwee hee
who the hell are you who gave you the orders to attack me
uwee hee hee who knowses we sure dont but really poor yous youll be killed by us and wont even knows why
my life isnt my own ever since i became a knight my life is for my liege and my people i cannot be defeated by cowards like you
uwee hee hee bring it on we are legion there are manys of us and ones of us all in oneses want to knows how to defeats us hmm simple just kills the real legion but can you findses the real legion uwee hee hee
you are kris prince marths royal guard correct tis an honor to meet you i am horace an archanean knight in the service of princess nyna prince marth saved me in the previous war for princess nynas sake please allow me the privilege of fighting alongside you
uwee hee hee you can kills us and kills us again but there are mores of our brotherses  moreses moreses moreses of us as longs as the real legion is still standing therell be no end to the legion  uwee hee
uwee hee hee are we real or are we false try us and see
uwee hee  hee  how did you  know 
sire the remaining enemies have fled victory is ours
good work but either way that was a strange enemy were they even human 
ive heard rumors about them those wicked assassins crushed their souls when they were young and raised them as living puppets who follow orders without question 
how pitiful  kris i wonder if katarina was raised under such circumstances as well 
 
however we cant do anything about that now let us go ahead to anris way where lord gotoh awaits
sir jagen ive found something most odd inside the castle its this mask it seems like a different type from the one those assassins wore but whats it for 
heh  this is a mask for use in a masquerade ball i believe
masquerade ball
yes noblemen once donned these masks in order to conceal their identities they were probably used in this old castle a long time ago so its unrelated to the assassins
i see  but it sure is a strange mask
what of it dont tell me you intend to wear it
yes for some reason i feel like giving it a try
you are an odd one well do as you wish
no ill leave it where i found it
yes good idea
lady eremiya  i have a report legion he 
i see so he failed even though i took such good care of him  such a troublesome child
lady eremiya the altean army is strong now that legion has been defeated  perhaps we should refrain from pursuing them
no crushing altea was an order of his
but 
what reese dont tell me youre afraid
clarisse 
lady eremiya please allow me the honor ill take care of them
my youre a good girl clarisse would you
anything for you lady eremiya
  lady eremiya about the remaining legion brothers 
ah those get rid of all of them
lady eremiya 
they cant fight now that theyve lost legion can they so theyre useless now broken junk is to be discarded
b but lady eremiya  they were with us in the orphanage  with you too lady eremiya 
so what
 
reese you sure are useless arent you dont worry lady eremiya ill get rid of them
my clarisse is such a good little girl completely different from a certain failure
ah lady eremiya  your praise makes me happy
 
/***EOF***/
sire weve been ambushed by the enemy enemy troops are waiting for us ahead
alright jagen kris make preparation for battle
yes immediately
yes at once
we did it caesar our ambush was a success theyre completely surrounded tactical victory is ours
i see however dont lower your guard our enemy is the altean army  we know how strong they are
but caesar are you really fine with this we did fight under alteas banner in the previous war 
were mercenaries we have no liege i need gold and will do anything for it even selling my soul to the devil
gold huh  indeed when we get the reward from emperor hardin  im sure we could save her alright lets do it caesar
radd theres no need for you to follow me my sister is my business the altean army is strong youll die if youre careless
im doing this for my own interests too so ill tag along with you caesar as i always have and always will
very well then lets go
legion youre ready i presume
yes yes yesss its finally time for us allses uwee hee hee togethers with those mercenaries well gives marth a royal funeral
it seems some of those mercenaries were marths allies in the previous war i do wonder if theyll be of any use
so whats doesnt matters if theyre uselesses all we have to do is kills him ourselves
bah i dont like you getting the best part oh well do whatever you want
the time for words is gone fighting is all we can do now
cant i  even save  one little sister

caesar id like to hire you and radd if possible i want you to come with us you and radd fought by my side in the previous war youre both my comrades
prince forgive me but were mercenaries all we did in the previous war was fulfill our duties as hired swords
it might have been just a job for you two  but not to me both of you are my precious comrades you were then and still are now
prince  i appreciate your willingness to say such kind words to mercenaries like us however at the end of the day were hired swords therefore we ask for gold prince archanea occupies your country its obvious you dont have the extra resources needed to pay us
well you have a point 
gold shouldnt be an issue prince marth will reclaim altea our homeland altea may be occupied by archanea now but we shall defeat them and then youll have the gold you seek
do you  honestly think you stand a chance against a powerful kingdom like archanea
of course besides im sure you dont have a choice at this point since youve failed your mission archanea wont pay you the gold you seek anymore if youre a hired sword working for gold following prince marth would serve your interests better am i wrong
 indeed your argument is sound as weve failed we have no other options prince marth radd and i are now your hired swords we shall accompany you for as long as you wish us to
thank you caesar
no  caesar 
radd  you have my condolences radd id like to hire you if possible i want you to come with us you and caesar fought by our side in the previous war youre both my comrades

/***EOF***/
having liberated grust marth and his companions accepted wendells request and stopped by the fane of raman in search of the missing orbs however the ancient temple built to worship naga had been wrecked by constant warring and was now nothing more than a den of thieves
theyre escaping with the temples valuable treasures we must catch them stay clear of the free company guarding chiasmir bridge we cannot defeat them it seems a dancer is lost inside the forest we must find her before the bandits do
as the soldiers received their orders the flames of a new battle around the fane of raman were ignited
by the way kris i have something id like to ask you
yes sir jagen
from your perspective what kind of person am i
what kind  of person
i keep wondering about how i should have acted towards lang  our homeland alteas position is important but perhaps i brood far too much and offend people
you worry about these things too sir jagen you neednt worry your concern for prince marth is more than evident youre very strict sir jagen but also very kind
is that so  ho ho if you cheer me on enough i may even age backwards
sir jagen when you look at me what kind of person do you see
hmm well  youre very capable as a royal guard 
and you have an aura that attracts people
and youre wise almost foresighted
and i can feel a hidden genius somewhere
and you have a kind heart
and you have an indisputably strong heart
thats the kind of person you are
what an honor
well wed best begin the war council let us go kris
yes sir jagen
huff  huff  please  help me  the thieves  theyre going to 
 
no it cant be youre  one of them  as well oh fine  do your worst if youre going to kill me do it fast
girl  get behind me the altean army is marching towards the south of this forest ill take you to them
huh youre going to help me you mean youre not with the thieves
until just now i was but ive changed my mind
why 
theres someone in the altean army that i want to see thats all
hmmm  but really its cause im cute right at any rate im glad my names phina im a dancer from warren people say that once they see my dancing they feel instantly refreshed i can show you if you like oh i should tell you my story i got separated from my troupe and wandered into this forest and then those horrible thieves came and tried to take me by force  but its okay now you seem kind of scary but actually youre very kind however your appearance is  your face isnt bad but your dress sense is kind of lacking and ugh whats with your hair you know nowadays 
just stop talking anyway dont stray too far well cut our way to the west corner and then escape through there if you want to live then shut up and come with me
ah  y yes sorry 
the ancient fane of raman is just a treasure trove to thieves you can see em carrying the stolen treasure all over the place i hope they get cursed or something 
the ones protecting the bridge are astrams free company powerful men who stop at nothing as a wise man once said let sleeping dogs lie eh
i wonder if youve seen that young ladys dance marvelous isnt it makes a tired body feel healthy again in the blink of an eye
you must never go near that cave i heard a rumor that in that cave dwells a terrible fire dragon
captain astram weve sighted the altean army to the south shall we attack
our mission is to hold the bridge leaving the bridge will not be permitted only attack if the enemy approaches
yes sir but what about the troops in the fort i hear they will march out soon
they were bought with coin by the emperor let them do as they please either way they wont win we will be the ones to stop the altean army
sire please exercise caution reports indicate that a fire dragon has emerged from the cave to the west
traitors ill show you the might of the mercurius
midia  my love 
tryin to take a cut from a thiefs plunderin  you people aint even human
murderers  the lot of you 
sire weve driven away the thieves but the temple was completely ransacked anything that wasnt nailed down is gone im sure even guardian deity naga would be furious tis truly the end of civilzation
jagen do you know the legend of naga
yes only vaguely however kris do you know of it
no not really 
unknown among the youth i see  then sire allow me the honor
its said that a thousand years ago  when there was not one king in the lands people lived in small villages one day terrible monsters descended and the humans were massacred pushed to the brink of extinction the few who survived prayed to the gods for salvation the gods heard their prayers and a gigantic warrior was sent down to earth the warrior carried a gleaming blade of light in his right hand and in his left hand a shield embedded with five orbs then after a fierce battle he eradicated the monsters and returned to the heavens he was our guardian deity naga and this temple is dedicated to him he was the avatar of the gods our guardian deity 
with the blade of light and the five orbs  that is the legend of naga 
well then sire we have to cross the chiasmir bridge soon we must hurry if the enemy takes it getting across will be nigh impossible
alright then inform the whole army we cross chiasmir bridge at once we havent a moment to waste
yes sir
lord wendell were off to chiasmir bridge i  a achoo
oh dear are you alright have you caught a cold
perhaps its too early to tell
dont push yourself too hard and remember to keep yourself warm oh i know shall i lend you one of the hats that im wearing
huh is that okay
yes i have many of these hats so theres no need to worry well then would you like to try it on
yes please if its not a bother
no no dont be shy here you go and do remember to watch your health
youre a good person lord wendell i want to be more like you  oh yeah if i wear this hat for a while i wonder if my hair will start to look like his and then maybe ill be a bit more like lord wendell
no thank you but i appreciate the gesture ill be just fine
i understand but do remember to watch your health
/***EOF***/
sire we have detected an enemy presence in the mountains it seems there is a battle ongoing
alright jagen kris let us hurry with our preparations
so im surrounded  how sad i guess this is the end of the road for me 
alright hes right where we want him now to savor his pain as we slowly draw the life from his tormented soul 
clarisse  the altean army has arrived
tsk what a nuisance reese i hate to admit it but you were right about this outcome alteans never abandon their comrades  you sure learned a lot about that trash from your time staying with them
 
my job is to kill one by one everyone who sided with marth in the previous war because if his allies live theyll eventually join him one after another and that would be dangerous
  clarisse are you really up for the task
i dont need to get my hands dirty do i my underlings can get the job done were hardly dealing with strong enemies
youll die if you underestimate kris and the others clarisse i served as kriss tactician but i wasnt much help as one i didnt give them the advice a tactician should give even without me kris and the others are strong
what have you become attached to the alteans after your little frolic with them then just sit there and watch watch hard and well as i kill your beloved companions oh yes and please  dont get in my way okay
alright im leaving the rest to you others are coming to help you soon so hurry and kill them already if by some chance those rats arent dead when i return  ill make sure youre dead got it
oh my savior kris thank you kindly for coming to my rescue i cannot fight but i can heal your wounded take me with you and youll be very glad you did
wait  what where did you lot come from
tsk this is bad  to think id run from the likes of you  ill remember this
sire are you unhurt
yes im alright thank you kris
weve repelled the assassins but we cannot afford to linger here
i agree im worried about ogma let us hurry to lord wendells place
 hmm the alteans are better than i expected oh well we can always snuff them out later ill let them live for now
i warned you the altean army is strong 
gosh reese you can be annoying sometimes whose side are you supposed to be on dont tell me youre thinking of betraying lady eremiya
 no that thought could never cross my mind we all live for lady eremiya for her sake i must defeat kris  i know that well enough
greetings kris my friend its been a while since we last had a decent conversation
yes ever since the knight training eh father wrys
indeed and youve become even stronger than you were then   oh did your hair grow a little
really well it is true i havent had the time to take care of it since we left altea 
you know a haircut like mine is astonishingly easy to take care of
i i can imagine 
if you so wish i could shave your head so its like mine
eh
as im a monk im quite used to shaving heads its quite alright if you dont like it you can just let your hair grow and have your previous haircut back what do you say would you allow me to shave your head
yes please
very well then give me a moment to prepare  are you really sure
y yes 
then please sit down now close your eyes 
i i think ill pass
i see its a pity but perhaps its for the best in any case kris im counting on you from now on

saint archanea is the largest country on the continent its golden capital of millennium court has bathed in 600 years of proud history under the attack of alteas allied army it fell in just one day the citizens of archanea welcomed them as liberators and supported them to their fullest they also mentioned of their hatred towards hardin and his personal guards everybody now calls hardin the dark emperor this was in hatred of hardin the murderer of countless people if possible fighting would be avoided but it as already reached this stage  marth ra
your highness weve entered the castle but dont forget that hardin is being protected by the darksphere to fight him  you must have the lightsphere be sure to let the person fighting him carry it
midia even you betrayed me archaneas paladins have lost their touch
you fool dont you see it what youre doing isnt normal where did you take nyna to bring her back to us now
nyna that woman betrayed me i just wanted to destroy grust and she had to go and give the emblem to that boy  those who betray me must die midia youre no exception
if you want to take my life go ahead but hardin  do you know how much suffering youve caused because of your stupid jealousy just open your eyes and see
stupid jealousy  haha  you can say what you like this world is corrupt and full of annoying people is this kind of world even worth anything it would be far better for it to be destroyed midia you shall watch here  as prince marth dies by hand
marth  as a servant of the empire you dared to invade millennium court i am disappointed in you so alteas prince of light is just a lowlife
hardin your are being controlled by the darksphere and have lost your just heart please you must return to normal
hahaha  you are so naive marth i attacked altea solely because of my hatred of you in the previous war it was only because you were the descendant of anri that nyna gave the emblem to you and chose you to become the leader of the alliance prince of light  what nonsense if you hadnt received my support you would have died long ago so dont act all big marth from that day on i hated you i kept silent for nyna but i knew i would have to deal with you eventually this has nothing to do with the orb
hardin  is that true  your hatred of me  i didnt know 
ha  thats why youre just a boy marth come to me so i can use my gradivus to pierce your heart in this tiny continent i am the only hero that is needed
rebels  did you come here to get yourselves killed ill show you to fear my gradivus
marth  your highness  i have finally awakened  from my deep dream  your highness  i am deeply sorry  i fought with my inner demon however i was too weak  i resisted with all my might  but i still lost  i hoped for your highness hand to end my life  that way i could be saved  your highness  nyna  please take care of nyna  she  i hope you  can tell her  in the  end  i still  loved her  i hope  she can  forgive me 
so youve come marth ill run you through just as you wish
hardin thats enough
ive no quarrel with you  bring marth to me
sir hardin  to defeat you is my duty prepare yourself
ive no quarrel with you  bring marth to me
dark emperor hardin  look nowhere else i am your opponent
sire the battle is over we have won
yes and with this finally 
sire look over there your sister and the others 
elice and princess nyna  lena maria youre all safe
marth im so happy you made it  ngh 
you  you carry the binding shield  gah my magic has been dispelled withdraw my priests at this rate he will  let us hurry the shadow dragons return
gharnef 
that man was the dark pontifex gharnef his servants were impersonating the princesses
what was he playing at he mentioned something about the shadow dragons return  so as we suspected my sister and the other clerics must be in gharnefs hands 
forgive my interruption sire but lord gotoh has arrived
lord gotoh take me straight to him
excellent work prince marth you managed to obtain all of the orbs thanks to your efforts the lost binding shield is finally complete
incredible it felt as though the shield itself pulled in all the orbs  so this is the fabled binding shield but what now lord gotoh from gharnefs actions it would seem he has the noble clerics imprisoned i worry for their safety
hmm  i understand how you feel  however we have a far greater task to accomplish  we must seal away the earth dragons soon they will awaken from their slumber they will rise up from the ground destroying everything in their wake and turn this world into a living hell go marth entomb the awakened dragons once more
marth its finally over now the world is safe look the princesses are over there 
sister and theres princess nyna  and lena and maria as well its great to see that everybody is safe
marth you finally came i am so happy  i will need your help to restore archanea
you really worked hard marth you are my pride
lord marth with our combined strength we have already vanquished gharnef please relax
the world is safe now your highness please hurry back to altea
really its good to see everybody well but you all dont look too good 
everybody is tired from battling gharnef but it doesnt matter now so please dont worry
really  nyna i am sorry about hardin i couldnt save him
its fine he was devoured by his own ambitions so it is not unexpected that he was lost well marth you should hurry back to your homeland everybody is probably worried about you with your remaining time you must live well as long as there are still people in this world your name will never be forgotten
kris new information regarding the assassins has reached the palace as you may have guessed they were dispatched by hardin and gharnef the head of the organization is a woman named eremiah
eremiah  and where is she now
here in archanea apparently she runs an orphanage in the mountains
an orphanage
yes so it would seem however its an orphanage in name only she confines the children to a basement devoid of light and teaches them all manner of wicked things 
  sire please let me go ill crush them   i wont allow such a travesty to stand
i understand kris i too cannot allow a situation like this to carry on
 please wait
katarina were you listening the whole time
theres a hidden passage to where lady eremiah is  ill show you the way
  
please allow me to go ill be fine i dont believe for a moment that this will atone for everything ive done  but while i live i want to help in any way that i can
  sire please let me go ill crush them   i wont allow such a travesty to stand
i understand kris i too cannot allow a situation like this to carry on lets go to the orphanage then
/***EOF***/
this truly is an unimaginably treacherous journey 5000 meters  no higher than that looking down a sea of clouds can be seen they have reached the summit of the cold mountain peak breathing is difficult  dizziness is felt  their vitality is fast approaching its limits
well kris is everyone making good use of the drill grounds of course if you win often youll be that much stronger kris you 
oho ho you  youve done very well havent you
yes i go there often
i see then there is nothing i have to add i should recommend the drill grounds to the others
oho ho you  youve been winning quite often eh not bad at all
thank you but i hope to improve further
thats the spirit i should recommend the drill grounds to the others
hmm you  it seems you havent won much yet are you purposely avoiding the drill grounds
s sorry i dont really have the money so 
well its fine if youre not struggling now but when things get tough that experience will be the clincher just remember if you ever feel that your foes are too strong there is a place where you can hone your skills
xane weve already climbed this high its so cold  even breathing is hard
were almost there look can you see over there thats the ice dragons temple where gotoh is
but that was quite a shock tiki is actually the daughter of the divine dragon king also both gotoh and you are divine dragons
ah  when the divine dragons fought the earth dragons they over exhausted their dragonstones and so practically became extinct aside from naga only gotoh me and the just born tiki survived however after the war we discarded our dragonstones so we could no longer become dragons again even so i still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans gotoh followed nagas orders to protect humans but thats got nothing to do with me i dont like humans they scorned the manaketes even though they had lost their power and treated them like filth i can fully understand why medeus and the others hated humans so much the earth dragon king medeus tricked his own tribe and became a manakete by himself he used to follow nagas orders and guarded the dragons altar however the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive they even started to attack the manaketes that lived in peace the manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans and gathered at the dolhr region they formed their own kingdom of manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans to save the humans gotoh handed the falchion to anri and he created an academy of magic at khadein but whoever won wasnt any of my concern
then why are you helping me im also a human 
youre different from the others you dont seem like an unreliable person either 
mmm  thank you xane
dont  dont be silly ill get embarrassed anyway lets head to the temple but be careful of the ice dragons although theyre also wild dragons they will instinctively try to protect their temple poor guys 
you youre beck to think wed meet here of all places
me too prince marth boy am i surprised to see you its been far too long after the war i was travelin the continent and um somehow 
 you landed up here well thank goodness theres no way you would have joined the barbarians beck were fighting another war why dont you come with us
i dont have my ballista any more just my horse buddy right ere but if youre fine with that then sure ill help you princey
whats the point of war
d damn  it  you too  pony 
hey xane gotoh didnt really mention anyting about the five orbs but i thought they were very important do you know anything about them
gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didnt say anything i will tell you however after ive told you youll probably think it was better off not knowing the orbs rest on the shield that seals the earth dragons  basically they are part of the shield of seals since ancient times the divine dragons have passed down these sacred jewels each possessing different powers to put it simply the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal so if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken
hmm is that so but how come the orbs were scattered
because the shield was broken the shield of seals was displayed at the fane of raman and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it 
when did that happen
around 600 years ago to recover the shield gotoh spend many years searching the lands in the end he only found the five orbs with the shield nowhere to be seen not only that but the five orbs which he painfully collected were scattered again after raman was attacked in the previous war
really  so that was why gotoh was looking for the lost jewels  the orbs
yep the starsphere lightsphere and geosphere  as well as the darksphere and lifesphere the lightsphere is in gotohs possession that starsphere was shattered and the darksphere was given to hardin by gharnef
the geosphere is in altea and all that remains is the lifesphere
ah  anyway lets enter the temple from now on i will also help you fight well lets go
sire please wait kris you as well
i just received a distressing message people have been sighted not far behind us there seems to be a battle underway
out here could it be the barbarians or perhaps its the assassins 
in any case this area is almost entirely uninhabited so it cant be any old people  to make matters worse the snow is becoming heavier  fighting will be difficult in this weather
but if there are allies 
indeed we cannot abandon them if there are allies that is 
then well just have to find out for ourselves before the battle is over lets go
/***EOF***/
ahh  this forest sure is nice and peaceful
yeah
just walking around here makes me feel rejuvenated in a way
yeah same here
oh by the way were lost arent we
  
hey kris the ordinary wasnt this supposed to be yknow a shortcut well
um  im sorry  i really did think it was  but were definitely lost
whaaaaat you dont need to tell me that i figured that one out ages ago
everyone please we mustnt fight we need to work together in times of crisis 
shes right theres no point in crying over spilt milk rather lets find a way home ahem ladies and gentlemen our new mission find our way back to altea castle of course we should try not to wander around aimlessly while we find our way

ooh is that all to be honest im a bit hungry as well  kris lets go and find something to eat
please come in
commander kris and katarina of the 7th platoon reporting as ordered sire
please calm yourselves you may stand at ease
yet you summoned us so suddenly milord  is it to do with the bandits we subjugated are you sire reprimanding us for disobeying our orders
not at all  its quite the opposite your actions have saved many as ruler my duty is to protect my people and i am truly grateful for what you did
were honored to be of service but that was tougher than any of our training phew 
kris and you as well katarina  i hear from jagen that youve been exemplary cadets
is that so sire sir jagen never intimated as much 
ive seen your skill and i agree wholeheartedly with him why the both of you are suitable for the altean army should the two of you pass your test id love it if you would become my royal guards
royal guards sire
though the stories tell of me as a great hero it is not so there is only so much that i can do by myself that much i know to be true the war of shadows was won with the aid of comrades who wished for the same future as i twas not a lone romp across the land i realized whether in peace or war i need people i can trust  young dynamic soldiers who can support and guide me
b but the royal guard exists to protect the king  it is a role of immense importance  are we even fit for such an esteemed duty
yes i believe so i want you to be my royal guard jagen feels the same as i but  dont feel obliged to promise me i wont think ill of you if you decline and so i ask this of you once more you need not answer right away its quite alright please think it over carefully
/***EOF***/
khadein is an independent city state taking orders from no foreign nation the archmage has many pontifices under him governing according to their counsel in the previous war pontifex gharnef allied with dolhr and dragged khadein into war and the city suffered great damage as result as khadein had lost all its pontifices wendell became its archmage and started rebuilding the city however wendell left on a journey to fulfill a mission given to him by gotoh he then left khadein in the care of two young men they were two skilled and promising young mages  merric and arlen
so this is the school of khadein  the sanctuary of those who study magic
indeed merric studied here since he was a child i personally have no magical ability but as for you kris 
youre incredible i dont think youd lose to even merric
i wonder if i could study here in khadein
actually i think theyd want you to teach
you have potential im sure youd qualify to study here
thank you sire
you too hm  youre not very good at magic either
yeah  im not really cut out for it
well everyone has their own talents i wouldnt worry too much about it
merric its time to put an end to this
wait arlen why do we have to fight we were both master wendells pupils were friends are we not why do you despise me so
i was master wendells disciple before you and i was the stronger one even so master wendell gave you excalibur he should have given it to me clearly i was the only one worthy to be his successor yet he 
but i have no intention of succeeding master wendell i hold no ill feelings for khadein but once i finish studying i plan to go home back in altea there is somebody i must protect for the rest of my life  so arlen please why dont you join us so we can take back altea
altea you say why should we help a country that rebelled against the empire and attempted to invade their fair nation the mage corps of khadein have sworn allegiance to emperor hardin oh i see  i knew it was you  you dragged the altean army here
no thats not how it is
shut your mouth traitor i wont listen to your lies any longer your excalibur and my thoron well put them to the test
arlen what are you doing
master wendell 
you still dont understand my decision do you indeed as a mage your power surpasses mine but you lack compassion that is why i did not grant you excalibur
  compassion 
i had decided that you were to be my successor when the time came to think you would harbor a grudge towards me  does that not make you the same as gharnef
the same as gharnef  teacher what are you saying
arlen listen to me  gharnef along with pontifex miloah were lord gotohs best pupils but lord gotoh saw gharnefs weakness and so he left khadein and the aura tome to pontifex miloah gharnef overcome by jealousy stole the darksphere from lord gotoh and created the imhullu tome as a result  his heart was trapped within the darksphere for all eternity wrath and envy led him to ruin do you understand now arlen 
 teacher   teacher im so sorry i  i was wrong please  find it in your heart to forgive me
arlen you will use that power of yours for the good of the people understand
i wont lose to someone like merric anyone who sides with him is my enemy thunder strike them down thoron
master wendell 
why does everyone side with him  even though  even though im stronger
how horrible  consumed by your hatred you have forgotten what is truly important
sire weve rescued the clerics
sire weve rescued the clerics that were threatened by the enemy
excellent good work kris
as thanks they have offered to give us this
marth  do you hear me
lord gotoh yes i can you are speaking to me through magic are you not lord gotoh i must ask what has happened to cause hardin to suddenly change so much
hmm  the darksphere is the culprit  hardins soul is trapped within the darksphere 
the darksphere what on earth is that
light star earth life and darkness  in this world there exist five sacred orbs the darksphere is that which complements the lightsphere in battle it possesses the enemys mind negating their attacks but the darksphere also amplifies wrath and envy and can turn their owner into a demon hardin must have obtained the darksphere from somewhere  and now his heart has been lost to it
but why he should have been happy after his union with beloved princess nyna so why the envy
prince  humans are never simple creatures  in any case the only object that can overcome hardins darksphere is the lightsphere if you want to do something about him then you had best come and get it from me
huh really lord gotoh if we have the lightsphere then we can save hardin
well  if his heart is not completely consumed then perhaps
lord gotoh please lend the lightsphere to me
if you come in person to the ice dragons temple where i reside then you shall have it but that will be no easy task so marth do you have the courage to walk the path that anri walked
yes i do i will go please allow me to go i must have the lightsphere
kris may i have a word as this armys tactician i have been observing each and every of our battles if i were to sum up your recent style of fighting i would say 
most impressive to the end all of your comrades support each other and you fight as one so as to not lose each other with prince marth as our core  and your support we shall not falter
it is an honor sir jagen
excellent there is no other word at times we lose comrades  but even so we have always prevailed with prince marth as our core  and your support we shall not falter
it is an honor sir jagen
unsatisfactory  it pains me to say it but your comrades have fallen one after another  at this rate i worry for the future you must protect them from now on their lives are in your hands kris
yes sir jagen
hey can i talk to you for a second i came here cause i heard marths group was passing by but erm 
sorry who are you
im malice a mercenary and not a cheap one id like to ask you something is yer prince okay with paying gold oh of course its okay if i have to wait until this wars over so erm  if you er paid us say  590 gold for our services that ought to do i think
huh if its only that much then prince marth would gladly pay 
phew the rumors are true hes completely different from all our employers up till now right pops
he is different looks like we hit the jackpot coming to this desert im dice on behalf of the both of us its great to be in your service
sire weve just received new information it concerns the assassins movements  lord horace who thought to ally with us is in peril
lord horace  kris lord horace is an archanean knight in princess nynas service he was our ally
lord horace i am marth of altea i ask that you lay down your arms 
   is princess nyna  safe
we cannot abandon lord horace jagen kris lets hurry
/***EOF***/
sigh
whats wrong luke
dont you think its a crying shame that there arent any cute and caring clerics around
w what do you mean 
well a knight thrives on romance right like if i were wounded in battle and a lovely cleric came to my aid  hey kris the ordinary if we had a cleric like that with us i bet wed all fight twice as hard
well i dont know about the romantic part  but it would make our lives easier if we had a healer on our side unfortunately i dont think there are any healers around luke it might be a good idea for us to ask someone for assistance on this matter
kris everyone please listen i bring good news theyve found us someone who can support our platoon it appears we might be joined by a healer
shes finally here my lovely cleric out of my way let me at her
pleased to meet you i am wrys a humble curate i cannot fight but this staff i carry can heal your wounded
  
yes yes i heard the whole thing from sir jagen if you like i could lend you my services as a healer  oh my has something terrible happened your face looks awfully pale  have you been taken by illness my boy
its nothing  hes just overwhelmed with joy right now
ah no its nothing  be careful what you wish for luke
pay no heed to luke were all fine pleased to make your acquaintance wrys
well then lets continue the combat training everyone you had better be prepared ive decided that you will have a rather unusual instructor for todays practical training
this is miss athena a foreign myrmidon who helped us in the last war
ve are indebted to this country and ve vish to return the favor any voman would do the same ve are bad at teaching but if ve are using swords ve will not lose
athena is a myrmidon with excellent speed and an opponent whom you must be very cautious of kris do your best
this is general jeorge who is visiting from the kingdom of archanea
i came to instruct gordin in archery but once i heard your story my curiosity was piqued to say the least so i asked a big favor to be allowed to take part
sir jeorge  a true master of the bow and arrow they call him greatest archer on the continent kris do your best
ve vill challenge you
 ve give up
i am jeorge a bow knight of archanea let me see how you fare in battle
 that was magnificent 
you are strong especially you you vat is your name
the names kris junior knight kris
kris  ve vill remember that you you are our friend ve vill aid you if you vant
not bad at all that was a splendid fight you what is your name
the names kris junior knight kris
kris  ill remember that name im afraid i cannot join your cause but  gordin could you go in my stead
yes sir ill gladly fill in for you
kris you are someone id like to fight alongside one day i look forward to the day we can meet again
todays training is now over with that i shall give you an interim report
interim report 
from the very first test until now i have evaluated your manner of combat the more of your allies that have been injured and forced to withdraw the poorer your score get ready to listen up
yes sir
commander kris of the 7th platoon of the twenty junior knight platoons you place 
first wonderful work kris you are most talented
a amazing we did it we did it kris its all thanks to you kris
but dont let your guard down placing first doesnt give you an excuse to start slacking off that is all you may return to the castle
third impressive kris id say that youve placed rather high
we did it we did it kris its thanks to you kris
but dont let your guard down you are still in training  so from now on you must aim even higher that is all you may return to the castle
tenth just in the middle kris ive got nothing good to say at this rate
im sorry kris its because i cant do anything 
but dont give up you are still in the middle of training so i expect more effort from now on that is all you may return to the castle
last  kris  none placed worse than you 
i i im terribly sorry kris  its because i cant do anything 
 but dont give up you are still in the middle of training so from now on try as hard as you can that is all you may return to the castle
 wow this castle is absolutely massive its a huge difference to the house in my hometown  now where were the 7th platoons chambers again 
oh my  you are a junior knight are you not
ah yes im kris i came here hoping to become an altean knight and you are 
i am elice marths elder sister
oh prince marths elder sister  please excuse my lack of manners
its alright kris  i think its very admirable that youve come to help marth
it is an honor to serve prince marth the hero king
the hero king  you say it does seem that our people have grown fond of calling him that but the truth of the matter is that marth  marth is just a weak vulnerable child 
prince marth is weak 
yes of course he was the hero who triumphed in the battle against the shadow dragon however behind his heroic face marth is an idealistic child who firmly clings on to his beliefs and as you too must know the real world  cannot be saved with just ideals
yes 
even as we speak somewhere unknown to us our peoples lives are being lost  marth cannot save those people
yes thats true  even the most excellent of kings is not an omnipotent god a king is no more than human and there are limits to what he can do
yes precisely most people realize this and can come to terms with that reality but marth cannot do that  he truly thinks that he can save everyone in war losing just one companion is unbearable for him  he suppresses his feelings with all his willpower but i know that inside his heart breaks and bleeds 
  
in this cruel world it will become increasingly difficult for him to continue to hold these ideals  kris if some day you should achieve knighthood  please protect him somehow and keep his ideals safe 
/***EOF***/
leaving painful memories behind marth and his companions left grust they landed in macedon their new mission to rescue princess minerva after the war of shadows macedon was led by minerva who exiled the oppressive generals and attempted to reform the military however the influential general rucke opposed minervas peace seeking ways he assembled the exiled officers to instigate a coup detat caught unprepared minerva was captured by ruckes followers and his rebel army seized control of macedon then they dispatched powerful dracoknights to guard the countrys forested borders
macedons main force consists of pegasus knights and dracoknights  both are fast and highly mobile units in particular there are the whitewings who fought under our banner in the last war  there arent many in these lands who could match their terrifying speeds
i would have loved to witness their prowess 
kris while were on the subject of speed 
your speed can be summed up as exemplary even the whitewings would have trouble keeping up with you as id expect of an altean royal guard
it is an honor to receive such praise sir jagen
your speed is satisfactory but the whitewings would simply fly straight over you
i see  ill be more careful sir jagen
your speed is sadly terribly lacking the whitewings would probably reach their destination in half your time 
i i see  i ill be more careful sir jagen
hello there kris
hm youre  why do i feel like weve met somewhere before 
oh dont worry about little old me the important thing is that i came here to share a wonderful tip with you have you heard about hows everyone
hows  everyone
hows everyone is all the rage by checking it you can see how everyone in your army is faring you can watch your allies train discover useful items or even listen to their thoughts  so if you ever want to know how everyone is then take a look at hows everyone easy right
i  see thanks i guess
the more time passes the more things youll be able to see if you ever feel the urge then go ahead and take a peek well ill be off now buh bye
prince marth thank goodness youve come to macedon
catria i received word that there was a rebellion in macedon are you unharmed
yes im fine my older sister palla and i managed to escape somehow but princess minerva was captured by the rebels prince marth please  you have to rescue princess minerva at this rate her life will be in danger
of course i will help her catria please take us to where she is
yes my lord but first we have to break through these woods general rumels dragon knight squad is lurking within this area if we approach from the front well be easy pickings for them
i see so youre suggesting we flank them from the left or right thank you catria leave it to us
warrens a bit of an idiot just cause they paid him well he went ahead and joined the rebel army ahh to think a fool like him was once acquainted with the fair catria 
look out for those pilfering thieves if they take off with your precious treasure you wont ever get it back never let them escape from your sight
because of the last war every nation has been forced to lead hard lives the only well off country is archanea ruled by emperor hardin
some dirty thieves took our village treasure the lady sword and ran off with it only women can wield the incredible power of that sword please prise it back from their filthy hands
beware when dracoknights are around even from a far off distance they can move all at once and swoop down on you
oer here prince marth
youre  cord what are you doing so far from talys
i couldnt sit still when i heard yous fighting again so i came to join in were talyss mercenaries right if ya died princess caedad cry prince marth lemme fight too ill join yous army
warren even a good man like you has sided with the rebel army 
catria the white huh its been a while you know im just a common hunter if they pay me enough ill do anything
warren listen to me princess minerva endeavored to create a country where its people could live at ease she exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute to accomplish that goal but general rucke despite knowing this roused the soldiers into a coup detat cant you see hes just trying to make this country into his own and you can honestly say youre okay with that
 i see well i dont like the military acting as if they owned the place  alright then if youre going to help the princess then so will i
no hard feelings i dont have anything against you but this is the way i live forgive me
damn it  i shouldve seen this coming 
taste the terror of macedons fearless dracoknight squad
general rucke i leave the rest to you 
sire we found someone most unusual confined in one of the fortress rooms
hm  linde how did you wind up in a dangerous place like this
sire do you know this woman
yes this is linde her natural talent for magic helped us a great deal in the last war
prince marth thank heavens what a pleasant surprise meeting you here i desperately needed to see you again so i set out to find you but the macedonian soldiers found me suspicious and they dragged me to this fortress 
is that so im glad youre safe but why were you looking for me shouldnt you be by princess nynas side
i was requested by princess nyna to deliver you this
huh this  this is the fire emblem the royal heirlom of archanea the emblem shield
the fire emblem  i heard that in the last war princess nyna entrusted you with it sire 
indeed i looked after this as archaneas representative in the last war but why give this to me now especially at a time when archanea has so much influence under emperor hardins reign in this peaceful age why is princess nyna giving me the champions proof 
i dont understand either princess nyna didnt explain why just that i had to give it to you  i remember her eyes seemed so sad  i think she may have been crying 
princess nyna crying what on earth has been happening  linde after this battle ends i will go see princess nyna until then i want you to remain with us
yes prince marth

three months have passed since you first came here during this time ive witnessed many a platoon desert because they couldnt stomach the harsh training not to mention platoons that failed due to miserable results  of all who remain there are only twenty names
eep the requirements are incredibly strict
true but we still remain in the game thats what matters as long as we keep working hard 
from now on the practical training will be far more gruelling as such we will be introducing lectures to advise you
lectures
i am frey the knight in charge of lecturing in my lectures you will learn essential knowledge that all knights should possess
from here on this is the real thing prepare to be pushed to your limits
now firstly ill talk about the preparations you need to make before a battle before you fight your enemy on the battlefield you must ensure that you are sufficiently prepared
selecting those who will fight organizing their weapons and items  kris you will do all these things as part of your role as commander
i understand ill do my best
one more important thing pay attention to party members who wish to speak with you talking to your party members will often yield tactical advice the more stars displayed the more important a conversation is when you come to a new battlefield its always a good idea to check if anybody has something to say
well then let us begin todays mock battle from here on i will prepare an instructor based on your performances until now the 7th platoons opponent today is 
i am draug armor knight of altea your opponent is none other than me
draug is an armor knight famed for his sturdy defense kris hell be a formidable enemy
these soldiers are your opponents you must defeat all of them if you wish to fight me
well then lets begin todays practical training your opponents from here on will be the toughest yet so show me that fighting spirit of yours the 7th platoons opponent today is 
i will serve as your opponent
what we we have to fight ogma  kris ogma is a hero from the last war  hell make for a formidable enemy
the soldiers here will be your opponents first if you defeat all of them ill step up to fight
huff  puff  i i made it hey wheres this commander kris person
that would be me but who are you
im cecil a junior knight like you i know its very sudden but i was invited by katarina to join your group
 very sudden indeed but the more the merrier could we talk after the battle
sure im glad you understand oh yeah i brought along some strong weapons that katarina prepared for you just give me the orders and ill give you them to replace your worn out ones
youre not bad at all but i wont be beaten so easily
not bad as promised i will fight
i keep hearing about your abilities please allow me to judge for myself whether or not youre the real deal
s so you managed to penetrate my armor 
dont think of this as simply training come at me without restraint
 not bad thats quite some skill youve got
how  even my defense couldnt withstand such a tremendous onslaught commander kris if you have need of an armor knights strength you may call on me
we did it kris good job
such great power looks like altea is blessed with good knights kris if you have need of my power you need only ask
we did it kris good job
excuse me kris do you have a moment
huh of course what is it
that royal guard position that prince marth offered us did you think about it i  id like to be a royal guard if youre in with me together wed be an unstoppable team  when i imagine a future like that i feel very happy  um what about you kris do you perhaps feel the same as i 
um im sorry i havent really thought about it yet 
 i is that so yes i  so it was just me after all  im sorry good night kris
yeah i think it would be nice
yes of course
r really im so glad  well this is a little awkward  i should get to bed good night kris good luck for tomorrow

marth barely succeeded in escaping disembarking in the desert of khadein he elected to await his subordinates safe arrival
khadein the city of magic is a sanctuary for mages many prospecting mages come here and undergo rigorous training magic relies on containing natures energies in tomes and staves freely manipulating these energies to harness great power a few centuries ago a lone sage founded an academy here teaching magics secrets however instead of bringing happiness magic was soon used as a tool of war and a thing to be traded the sage was disappointed and vanished from the pages of history though there is no confirmation some say that was the archsage gotoh currently advanced magic like aura cannot be made without the orbs power and their use is restricted to a few chosen ones those conditions are set by their creator and they can only be inherited by those who qualify
khadein the city of magic  the proud sanctuary of sorcery
sire am i glad to see you
kris thank goodness is everyone else okay
yes everyone who survived is here
amazing i dont know how you all managed to escape that onslaught 
we were most fortunate a sandstorm was brewing as we were making our escape  thanks to the obscuring sands the enemy lost sight of us and we were able to escape with ease even during normal battles i seem to have lucky moments like that
i see kris you must be loved by the goddess of fortune
it would be my honor
your thoughts are mine but somehow we were able to shake off the enemy and escape
i see thank you kris
me neither the way was blocked by earth and sand and we lost our way as well  b but somehow  somehow we escaped
how horrible for you  even during normal battles kris unlucky things always seem to befall you i have to wonder if the goddess of fortune hates you
it would certainly seem that way 
minerva if you wait in this village you will most certainly run into marth i dont like him but he is indeed noble join forces with him
brother what are you going to do now wont you come with me 
i have no intention of doing that i only wish to find maria and bring her home to macedon
youve changed brother  or should i say youve returned to how you used to be as i thought back then you were being controlled by gharnefs dark magic
no no magic could bend my will i wished to crush the arrogant archanea and establish macedonian supremacy over this continent but father without bending his ear to me distanced himself from me and later had me banished
are you saying thats why you murdered father what a fool you were  didnt you realize that was gharnefs plotting all along yes father was strict with you but it was only because he loved you why couldnt you see that
enough minerva do you take me for a fool after i was defeated i wandered the gap between life and death when i had come to in front of me i was maria  her eyes full of tears  praying to the gods while i treated her like a pawn maria she shed tears for me  minerva im going now i have to save maria at least that can be my atonement
michalis 
sire how shall we proceed from here
hmm  i want to go home to altea but if we cant prevail against hardin then we cant go back what in the world are we supposed to do 
we need to find out the secret of the strange power thats protecting hardin forgive me sire as your royal guard i was supposed to strike down your foes 
no its not your fault kris i too felt a strange presence emanating from hardin almost like 
sire its an emergency i have just come into some new information the khadein mage corps has launched an offensive against us
what even khadein means to be our enemy  merric what are you 
sir jagen what should we do
at this rate it seems we have no choice sire we need to break into the sanctuary but you must be prepared to make sacrifices if we dont hurry archaneas pursuit force will reach our rear and well be trapped
i understand weve no choice everyone lets break into the sanctuary but avoid needless fights if possible
an update sire the archanea army is at present approaching from the south
i see hasten the march dont let them catch up
do not think you can escape alteans ill turn this desert into your graveyard
do not think you can escape alteans we will avenge captain astram
a swordslayer will demonstrate your might against a mercenary or a hero you should definitely get one if you can
from here on north you wont see no more shops if youre going that way you should stock up now
the person commanding khadeins mage corps is a young man named arlen hes not a bad man but he can be a bit uncooperative seems he regards his old rival merric with disdain hmm  i reckon only lord wendell could talk some sense into him
huh princess minerva why are you here
my brother  michalis he helped me
really thats good to hear i was so worried once i heard that prince michalis had taken you but for him to rescue you what in the world happened
maria saved michaliss life shes kind unlike myself  marias kindness was able to touch the heart of even a man like michalis
but isnt that what you wanted thats why you deliberately avoided killing michalis am i wrong princess
hmm  
i can understand no one can sever the ties between family so easily princess please lift your spirits i would like you to fight with us again just like before i would like macedons strength and yours in order to put a stop to hardins designs
youre  etzel why are you here
i have my ties to khadein as well prince marth has succumbed to his ambitions and invaded archanea when i was told that there was no way i could sit still
  
but  no matter how i put it i just couldnt imagine youd become that sort of person prince marth you said to me long ago that you wanted to let the era of war end do you still stand by those words
yes i do i do not seek to fight
 i see i too do not seek as such allow me to join you once more
i dont want to fight you but i owe khadein what a troublesome ordeal i am in 
this war  will  someday 
i will not forgive intruders upon our holy sanctuary earth show your fury bolganone
arlen  was this really what you wanted 
the atmosphere inside the building seems somewhat strange
indeed something seems to be happening kris merrics inside there you met him during your training right
yes sir merric really helped us with his magical prowess so sir merric is here  we must hurry sire
yes lets go
/***EOF***/
the shocking news brought by caeda was a terrible blow to marth hardin was once not only a comrade in arms but a trusted confidant and irreplaceable friend
yet  why attack altea what have i done wrong
olbern keep headquarters of the grustian occupation army led by the evil general lang  also known as the nest of evil
kris its been decided that were going to war with archanea archanea will not be an easy opponent they have one of the most powerful militaries on the continent
were ready to face anything sir although  we still lack experience i admit we have to grow stronger 
indeed kris are you aware of the drill grounds that operate across the continent
drill grounds sir
it costs a bit of money but if you go practice in one you can get stronger it might be a good idea to let our more inexperienced men have a go
commander lang the  a altean army has arrived 
you moron why are you so panicked with their nation and name in ruins the alteans are of no consequence to us
but sir jeorges archers left to quell the rebellion can we win with just our troops
why didnt you tell me earlier call jeorge back to the castle this instant while youre there find that hired sword navarre and bring him here general toras im heading inside you will defend this location till your last breath do not let the enemy get close do i make myself clear
captain jeorge weve received orders to return to the castle immediately
orders from lang huh im not fond of that man his treatment of our people is simply intolerable to work beneath him is an insult pay his orders no mind
but captain youll be accused of treason captain you cant be planning to defect to altea 
no thats not an option if i were to defect now id drag the entire platoon down with me so for that reason alone i will absolutely not take any risks that might besmirch our name
captain jeorge 
anyway inform everyone do not move from your stations however if the enemy approaches you may engage them
yknow lately i havent seen that mercenary samuel i thought that he might have joined your ranks but i guess not  hes as lax as they get but you cant go wrong with his skill
oh alteans hear our plea please defeat general lang as long as that man lives peace is but a fleeting dream
ohh if isnt prince marth i wonder how my granddaughter lena is faring hm what you dont know i see  th then  do you still want this hammerne staff at least if lenas pupil marisha were around im sure she could use it  well whatever be the case ive no use for a souvenir please make good use of it

the surprising truth from xane was a shock to marth tiki was created as the daughter of the divine dragon king naga and slept in the temple because of the kings will the kings fear of tikis power was that of a loving mothers if tiki was to awaken her tremendous power would eventually cause the destruction of the world  that is what the divine dragon king feared however bantu the kings servant became attached to tiki after watching over her for a period of hundreds of years becamesic he awoke her from her sleep and took her away so tiki only had 10 human years worth of memory  that is so sad tiki  marth was too bewildered to think
this is the ice dragons temple anris final destination 
prince marth can you hear me come to the front of the center room i shall await you there
what you found all the shards thank you then the starsphere can be restored please wait a moment 
marth this is the starsphere you can take this with you as well
huh gotoh why are you giving such an important item to me
the only person that can restore the shield of seals is you  the shield itself has chosen you
 
you still dont understand the emblem shield youre carrying is the stolen shield of seals to be honest it was only recently that i noticed its exterior had completely changed  after stealing it from the fane of raman the thief removed its jewels and sold them off as treasures the money was used to fund an army which along with three stolen weapons was used to conquer the world the thief that went on to become the king of archanea had the shield which brought him such good fortune it became the emblem of his royal family now do you understand marth it is what you are carrying archaneas fire emblem
 what   the first king of archanea was originally a thief is that true  in that case i can kind of understand the curse of the fire emblem  then gotoh  if i can collect all five orbs can i restore the shield of seals
mmm  but please hurry up the shield has already been broken for 600 years  it is almost time for the earth dragons sealed underneath macedon to awaken from their slumber those evil earth dragons number several hundreds  no several thousands once they awaken there will be nothing that we can do  i will leave tiki in your care you can find her in the room to the right that divine dragon child should be able to help you battle the earth dragons but i will state clearly if the shield of seals is not restored tiki will be destroyed
huh  why is that 
that child is still developing without the shield of seals she will begin to degenerate eventually she will become wild and attack humans i made her sleep because i felt sad for her but if the shield of seals is restored i will no longer have to worry because the shield will protect tiki marth please take care of tiki you must rescue that child from the path of ruin
is that so you couldnt find them all  theres nothing you can do about it  please hand your collected shards to me tiki is sleeping in the room to the right but since the shield isnt restored i cant let you see her that child is still developing without the shield of seals she will begin to degenerate eventually she will become wild and attack humans i cannot allow tiki to awaken again it is for her own good  marth once youve obtained all the treasures head to the room to the left i will be waiting for you 
tiki are you alright 
uh 
tiki its me marth hey open your eyes
 marth    oh marth you came you came to see tiki
yes i hadnt seen tiki in a long time are you feeling well
uh  no the bishop told me that i had to sleep again but i dont want to  because when i sleep im always alone during my sleep i dreamt many nightmares there i became a wild dragon like those poor fire dragons and ice dragons i attacked humans and i killed them no  no  when i awoke i was all alone in the dark room  i felt so strange but also very scared  so very scared  but i couldnt leave that room i cried many times and then uncle bantu would come to comfort me as usual one day he took me away and took me to a human village living in that village was very fun and everybody treated me well  in the short time until i was discovered by gharnef i felt really happy i dont want to sleep anymore  i feel that if i close my eyes once more i will be unable to open them ever again i dont want that i want to live with everyone i dont want to sleep again
tiki its alright now i will protect you so dont cry 
really  i wont need to see those scary dreams again
thats right once the shield is restored tiki can live together with the rest of us dont worry believe in me
ah im so happy thank you marth
huh  who  who are you 
 ah  mar mar 
i see  so tiki was pretty happy it must have been very painful for her though it was to protect her i was far too cruel to her i suspect she must really hate me  you should go marth i will send you to altea with my powers
you should go marth i will send you to altea with my powers
lord gotoh why dont you come with us
hmm  at the moment ive one thing i must still investigate gharnef has returned
gharnef  but we killed him
yes you killed his body but his soul was held prisoner by the darksphere and within it his hatred only grew afterwards his former disciples  the heretic bishops  resurrected him and they seem to be planning something foul
i see very well lord gotoh we shall split ways here
indeed if i find something then i too will visit altea afterwards im counting on you marth everything rests on your shoulders you must save both our races from the path of destruction
 altea home at last though you may be occupied by archanea  i will get you back i swear
boy what a serious lady hey kris you said youre marths royal guard right
yes my mission is to protect prince marth
i see but if you really plan on protectin him then you need the strength to match your conviction hey do you wanna know a way to get stronger
hm you know of a way
 at long last altea my dearest home  archanean occupation be damned i will get you back i swear it
boy what a serious fella hey kris you said youre marths royal guard right
yes my mission is to protect prince marth at all costs
i see but if you really plan on protectin him then youre gonna need the strength to back up your conviction hey do you wanna know a way to get stronger
huh do you know how to
course just hold on a second
ta da kris you know about tiki right tikis still a kid but the real reason she can fight is because of her hairstyle and tiara
wait what are you serious
yeah if you wear your hair like this then youll be that much stronger so all you gotta do is wear this tiara and wear your hair like tiki if you do that then a legendary power will flow through you  well maybe so do you wanna give it a try
sure why not
alrighty then ill be sure to do this properly
thank you sir xane
  you arent doubting me is this trust or naivete 
is something the matter sir xane
ah no its nothin well see you around im looking forward to your new look
no thats quite alright i want to protect prince marth with my own strength
hmm that so boring
huh what do you mean boring
ah no its nothin catch you later

but is it really alright to rely on others i dont see how this fits with our training 
hmph dont tell me youre still in the dark about prince marths method of fighting in the war of shadows
yes im sorry im not familiar with the details
then i shall tell you our victory in the previous war was not just by merit of altea gathering and fighting together with allies of various positions and statuses  this is how prince marth fights no matter when an ally came to our side they could instantly join the battle with us that is also a necessary skill for an altean knight
i see  i understand now
if we can combine our strengths when we fight im sure we can achieve anything right kris
yes youre right
no this i know the league led by prince marth didnt just consist of altea it went beyond the frontiers of nationality and included friend and foe alike 
yes our victory was not just the accomplishment of us altean knights overcoming status and position being able to fight together as equals  that is how prince marth fights no matter when an ally came to our side they could instantly join the battle with us that is also a necessary skill for an altean knight
i see  that will be important to our training i understand now
if we can combine our strengths when we fight im sure we can achieve anything right kris
yes youre right

from his exiled shores marth young prince of altea swore he would retake his homeland marth never forgot his oath years later he rallied an army at talys to defeat medeus starting with caeda talyss princess marth gathered together many allies duke hardin nynas guardian also became one of his trusted comrades with archaneas treasured fire emblem awarded to him by nyna marth led the archanean league as its commander
in the following battles the league wrestled back control of both archanea and altea finally after a long and fierce battle with shadow dragon medeuss forces  marth vanquished the shadow dragon  and thus did peace return to the world these are the events that transpired one year ago

so well decide with a battle thatll let us know whos got the skill to be commander
im sorry kris that was selfish of me  but i couldnt stand hearing them make fun of you 
its okay when my grandfather trained me he used to say the same thing he said that the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting
huh y your grandfather sure sounds colorful  anyway our opponents are luke and roderick its been decided that ryan will be on our team
y yes ill do my best
commander gotcha oh whats that luke should be the one yes i completely agree

thank goodness  kris you won i knew you could do it
alright im a man of my word ill keep my promise from here on the commanderll be kris gah but i dont get it i was so confident in my skills how did i wind up losing

under the guidance of archsage gotoh marth and the others headed to macedons north to the wyverns dale it is an undeveloped region populated with wyverns and ruled by barbarians but there is no time to stop because the fate of the world is in marths hands
jagen where are we macedon or dolhr
both  we are precisely on the border i hear this place is home to macedons great wyverns but since the area is overrun with barbarians even the macedonian soldiers dare not set foot in here
i see you learn something new every day 
according to our scouts a large number of wyverns and barbarians have gathered nearby its like anris way  no its worse sire please be careful
got it lets go kris i need to know whats happened to my sister and the others  i have a dreadful feeling about this
there you are marth
youre 
who are you a barbarian of this dale please stand back sire
its alright kris this is ymir another ally from the last war when i met him he was holding off an entire army to protect some villagers hes a kind and brave man
yeah the names ymir i heard marth was fightin here and figured id come along too
i i see  how rude of me sir ymir please forgive my insolence
oh its okay my face is a bit on the scary side i gotta admit whats your name
ah yes i am the altean royal guard kris
kris what a name its a real pleasure to meet you
likewise
on the other side of the mountains is a small hill called the dragons table recently there have been eerie roaring sounds coming from there grandfather and the others are afraid a demon is about to awaken you mustnt get to close to that place
this is the wyverns dale dont go any further otherwise i fear youll be burnt to death by the wyverns
prince michalis what are you doing here and youve suffered a grave wound what happened
 marth   i have been waiting  for you 
huh
 take this 
  this is the starlight tome youre giving it to me
thats right  gharnef  only with this spell can he be harmed i managed to take it back from his possession 
gharnef where is he now
the dragons table  ha  i was careless  i could be  defeated by gharnef  marth  good luck  im already finished if minerva is still around  tell her to  in my place  rescue maria 
michalis
your highness  i leave marias fate to you  urgh
     brother  could it be  is it really you 
 minerva 
ah youre wounded ill go get help
dont bother  this wound is beyond help id rather you call for  prince marth i have  something i must pass on to him
the prince will be here soon hold on brother ill tend to your wound 
heh  to think id need your help in the end  guh  ngh 
brother
minerva  i have something to ask of you should i die  give this tome to prince marth this is as far as i can go  i leave the rest  to you 
b  brother  michalis  no  this isnt like you when did you become so weak the brother i knew was strong and noble  he always found his own way never relying on anyone else  do you hear me i wont accept this youre going to pass this on yourself without the help of your younger sister
hmph  am i being scolded now 
brother listen to me  you cannot die here you have to live 
so this is the dragons altar the place where divine dragon naga banished the earth dragons 
indeed medeus the altars guardian could not tolerate the human races atrocities against the manaketes thus he gathered the surviving dragonkin forming the dolhrian empire all to obliterate mankind he was vanquished by anri once and then defeated a second time by you however earth dragons boast tremendous life force and cannot be completely eliminated so easily  even now they sleep at this altar
you mean to say theyll awaken
not exactly even sleeping earth dragons should not awaken for centuries or so the next time medeus awakens though he will rise as a terrifying shadow dragon  no wait  perhaps  yes i see  so thats why gharnef 
whats the matter lord gotoh
prince marth i have finally realized the reason why gharnef kidnapped the clerics he intends to use them to resurrect medeus to hasten the awakening of a dragon requires the life force of pure maiden women knowing this gharnef kidnapped them
so that means elice and the others are in this very altar
indubitably  marth you must hurry they are in grave danger medeuss awakening  is only a matter of time
sir ymir please forgive me for earlier
its fine i dont mind at all its rare to see someone like me anyway but its so warm dressin like this why doesnt anybody else do this i dont get it
oh is it warm
yeah its great during winter hey why dont you try wearin this for a change its a hat made from animal hide just wear it youre gonna see how amazin it is right away
this is  wow it is a pretty great hat
see it fits you well do you want to wear it for a bit
yes id love to
whoa im so stoked you said that itll look great on you no doubt about it
oh no i dont think it suits me
that so  too bad but oh well
im sorry after you went to all that trouble too 
its fine its fine i dont mind at all
brother   brother  why  why here  i  i never wanted to fight you  i just wanted things to be like they used to  with you and maria  brother   michalis  bro ther  
 your tears  how long has it been since i saw them last 
what  m michalis are you 
i dont plan on dying in front of you minerva id be an endless laughing stock the michalis you knew  would never die in a place like this am i right
brother  oh brother
hmph dont get the wrong idea you and i are still enemies  that will not change the incompetence of your army sickens me so you leave me with no choice but to help
thank goodness  youve finally returned to your old self i understand until the shadow dragon breathes his last let us borrow your strength

kris prince marth this is it please watch your footing
its pitch black visiblitys practically non existent  well be in trouble if we have to fight
the organizations children were raised in darkness  they have no heart or will of their own they only move their limbs when ordered like puppets 
katarina 
im  not like them anymore kris  i want to be of use to you that feeling is mine and mine alone not just some order but my own truest desire  my treasure lets go kris
sire this is it please watch your footing
its pitch black did katarina and the others really live here 
  itll be difficult to battle in this darkness  sire please exercize caution
the altean army is here gosh that junk puppet betrayed me  who would have expected that shed wrestle free from my control but i bet you didnt know this there are many puppets here far superior to you my dear come my sweet little children the bad men have come darkness is our friend what our enemies cannot see we can let them experience  the feeling of pure terror
the altean army is here oh how wonderful come my sweet little children the bad men have come darkness is our friend what our enemies cannot see we can let them experience  the feeling of pure terror
my children  were just trash in the end they couldnt even dispose of this rabble  it seems i have no choice but to show them how its properly done
my  children 
lady eremiya 
oh my if it isnt the broken puppet i wonder  should i call you ungrateful trash or traitorous trash but i must say its very brave of you to show your face in front of me again eine
meeting you again  crushes my heart id rather die frankly  but if i can be of use to kris then i will not run away
a junk puppet talking like a human being the only word youre ever allowed to say is yes ill make sure that mouth of yours starts working properly right away
sire weve seized control of the area the assassins shall target you no longer
i see thank you
according to the villagers nearby  that woman called eremiya used to be a kind bishop who looked after war orphans but during the war her orphanage was burned down and all the children killed  ever since then  she changed
so she was yet another victim of the war that does not erase her sins but  tis truly a tragedy
however at the very least there wont be more victims like katarina
indeed thats my only comfort let us go kris there are still things we must do
yes sire
 bah  so you failed in the end   eremiya
master  gharnef  forgive  me  for not  fulfilling your order 
oh you dont need to apologize the ritual to revive the shadow dragon shall soon begin you and your underlings were useful enough for capturing the clerics heh heh it was worth the trouble casting that spell on you 
what a spell  on me 
yes dont you remember but of course poor poor eremiya my spell stole that memory as well once upon a time you felt grief the corpses of the orphans killed in the war haunted your very existence you wondered what you could have done so that they might have survived 
i  never wanted  to let those children die 
and then i told you you had to make the children stronger twisted yes but they became stronger so they wouldnt die just as you wanted well have you remembered now
thats right i  i made those children 
heh heh  hypocrites like you and marth disgust me despairing over the orphans deaths you fell all too easily under my spell and then you gathered children subjecting them to hellish training just as i told you to you watched the children cry and scream  and yet you smiled  heh heh twas quite a sight
ah  ahh   aaaaah   my   my  children  aaaaaah
heh heh  worry not eremiya the despair you feel now is nothing this world will soon be enveloped in the darkest despair  you had better look forward to it marth heh heh heh

grust has been liberated
all that remains is olbern keep where general lang remains barricaded lang used his influence to steal belongings daughters and lives from the people of grust was there ever a man as cruel as he is
altean knights charge
kris you should be aware that lang is a general with high defense to defeat him you would do well to attack with magic or a special weapon like an armorslayer
duly noted
if you plan to defeat him with strength alone youd have to be extremely powerful
kris your strength is simply tremendous against a blow from you langs armor would crumple like paper please in my stead kill that insolent man
yes sir
kris your strength is quite impressive you might just be able to defeat lang please in my stead kill that insolent man
kris you are sadly not very strong but you could fight using your other talents please in my stead kill that insolent man
heh heh heh  so the alteans have come reinforcements are arriving soon if we can hold out a little longer we can make a pincer attack swordsman navarre when they open that door you make your move there is no need for restraint slice them to pieces
yeah  sure though the knights of altea are hardly worthy enemies
oh ho thats my navarre they say not even ogma of talys is your equal
what ogma n  naturally  a guy like him is no match for me
i see glad to hear it then ill leave this place in your capable hands navarre
sire there seems to be movement near the front of the castle and it would appear to be moving towards our forces
are they enemy reinforcements or allies to our cause 
i do not know but  i do hope they are allies
sire
frey thank goodness youre safe
you too sire norne and i escaped from altea castle and we rode here as fast as we could
but the rest of our forces were scattered  im sorry we couldnt all make it
you dont have to apologize im just glad that youre safe the others can take care of themselves
sire from here on we shall accompany you please give us your orders
oh and please be careful i caught a glimpse of enemy troops approachin the castle behind us i expect theyll be enterin the castle soon
enemy reinforcements i understand thank you
navarre please hear me out lend your sword to our case just once more
what who are you ill have no business with women or children  but theres a first for everything  whoa shes smoking what business do you have with me
   y youre not navarre who are you
yikes ive been exposed huh im actually a stingy mercenary known as samuel somehow i keep getting mistaken for this famous navarre swordsman guy i got tired of it after a while so i decided to pose as him and got myself hired but i dont like this general lang guy either if youre alright with it ill lend you my sword
yes  youll do just fine 
navarre  you bastard 
stay away  this evening my killing edge hungers for blood 
do you mean to kill me no matter what hmph very well i knew that wed have to settle our score eventually
wait  stay your blade  im no navarre im just a sham i  its me samuel have you forgotten ogma
samuel samuel the gladiator from knorda
yes i was a slave gladiator at the time and you really helped me out even when everyone was making their escape you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught 
  
i heard everything from my friends how you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse how by chance the young princess talys tears in her eyes stood up for you and saved you and thats why you swore your blade to talys or rather  to the princess 
enough  say no more no more its in the past now  no more 
 ogma  anyway i want to repay you im following you from now on okay
i pity your soul but i can at least grant you a quick death take this my killing edge
doh i shouldnt have said that i was navarre 
w wait please im sorry  please forgive me  ive only done as the emperor ordered me to i didnt agree with him but i had no choice so  so please s spare my life  ill do anything you say yes  just like this  mwahaha you shouldnt have let your guard down you fool  now die
urgh  impossible  i have been defeated 
general lang i have  with my own eyes  witnessed a number of your crimes i cannot forgive you but if you have something to say i will listen
s silence  silence you damned country boy prince youre a fool for coming here just die already
is that your answer then prepare yourself
y you youre that impertinent little girlboy from before 
lang you have oppressed countless people and insulted my liege you can only atone for these sins with your life
w  why you
lord wendell thank goodness youre unharmed
lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned even though i told him that i must fulfill a mission assigned to me by archsage gotoh 
a mission from lord gotoh
thats correct  you have seen the starsphere  the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface in order to pierce gharnefs shadowy veil lord gotoh created a sacred spell named starlight from that orb
unfortunately the strain on the starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards which scattered into the sky lord gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power and that if even one of them is lost the world will fall into irreparable ruin by any means possible we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the starsphere
is  is this a joke that the world could just end  this is all very hard to take in but arent these the star shards if so we already have a few after we retake altea wed be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs
of course  your country was only just invaded by the empire  i understand prince  i too shall fight to restore altea then thinking about it my meeting with you is like a sign from lord gotoh himself in that case i shall surrender myself to fate but please lets stop by the fane of raman we may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple
understood if its the fane of raman we can go there on our way to altea
general lang has been defeated and now the people of grust no longer have to suffer
thats right sire
kris since leaving altea weve had a great deal of fights  looking back at them now 
none of our companions were hurt and none of them died thats what im happiest about kris its because youve been here thank you so much
it couldnt be helped but  some of our comrades were injured or passed on i dont want to lose anyone from now i know we can do it if youre there kris please help me
all i remember is seeing our companions fall one by one  enough i dont want any of our comrades to suffer that pain kris please help me
sire some new information has come in from the patrol just ahead the enemy seems to be preparing some kind of ambush its not the archanean empire but likely i fear mercenaries hired with coin
mercenaries is it  do we continue as we are or take a longer safer route personally id rather not detour we have to return to altea as soon as possible
hmph if you would allow me to speak as your tactician  i think we ought to stay here and fight we will be facing mercenaries the altean knights would never lose to mere mercenaries
kris your thoughts
i agree with sir jagen
i see thank you jagen kris the whole army shall move on as they were well hit the mercenaries head on

once there was a war known as the war of shadows an epic battle between prince marths heroes and the dolhrian empire which ended with the defeat of the earth dragon king medeus the warriors who had united under the fire emblem returned to their own lands devoting themselves to the reconstruction of their homelands among the nations that made up the seven kingdoms of archanea gra and grust were devastated altea aurelis macedon and talys were left deeply scarred and even the mighty kingdom of archanea was undergoing restoration
however in the palace still shaken by war one important event took place hardin the younger brother of king aurelis was married to princess nyna becoming the twenty fourth king of house archanea after ascending the throne hardin aggressively restored the country in the twinkling of an eye and formed a powerful army by gathering many soldiers he then proclaimed the restoration of the holy archanean empire and himself emperor
one year has passed since the war with dolhr the world seemed to be moving towards an era of peace however unbeknownst to man the cogs of destiny had started spiraling out of order
it has been a year since the war of shadows ended the war ravaged kingdom of altea was finally starting to regain stability thanks to prince marths efforts prince marths engagement to princess caeda was announced and the people of altea rejoiced sharing their happiness however  nearing the day of their wedding an unexpected letter arrived from the imperial palace containing an imperial edict
dear prince marth of altea in the kingdom of grust now under imperial rule a large scale rebellion has broken out i request your kingdoms assistance in its subjugation your highness is to lead the entire army of altea and sortie at once suppressing the grustian rebellion   the emperor of archanea
the kingdom of archanea was alteas suzerain so its orders were absolute forced to comply marth ordered the knight cain to protect his homeland and together with jagen the paladin arran and the young newly appointed knights left altea on the grustian expedition
kris well be arriving shortly this is your first real battle is it not battles will be different from here on out defeat on the battlefield means death any allies you lose will never return  that is the harsh reality of war you must take the utmost care not to get yourself killed
of course sire
you and everyone else  it would be wonderful if we could end this battle without losing anyone 
sire 
sire we have made arrangements for a transport convoy we will also have merchants accompanying us who will sell us weapons and items i daresay they will be invaluable during battle preparations
thank you jagen then lets begin our preparations at once
sire this is general lang the commanding officer of the occupational forces
oho so you are prince marth glad you could make it here since youve come all this way i suppose ill let you have the glory of capturing the rebel leader general lorenz
what general lorenz leads the rebels what would possess him to rebel of all things
who knows i havent the foggiest idea and frankly i dont care prince you are to kill general lorenz and reclaim the children of the grustian royal family that hes hiding while you do that  we will slaughter the families of those who participated in this rebellion and raze their homes to the ground
are you insane theyre innocent civilians
i insane young man are you questioning my orders perhaps altea too plans to rebel against archanea 
of course not thats not 
prince marth your tiny country means absolutely nothing to me your rude behaviour is merely an irritation do not forget that i have the power of the empire behind me i can crush weak pesky insects like you any time i wish
jagen  what in the world is going on here how could hardin have entrusted this country to such a vile man
sire i understand how you feel however lorenz has begun a rebellion that much seems to be true so we ought to do something about that first sire why dont you try speaking to general lorenz personally allow me to stay by your side and serve as your tactician royal guard kris when prince marth is in danger on the battlefield protect him at all costs that is an order
acknowledged
kris i have no need to worry if youre here lets clean up the bandits and head to general lorenzs position
yes sir
after the last war princess nyna let this country keep its sovereignty under the rule of general lorenz however as soon as hardin became emperor general lorenz was banished and langs troops came crawling in lang stole everything from us he stole our gold of course but he even stole our food and our loved ones  ah  if only general camus were here then we wouldnt have to live in fear of people like lang
there arent any young girls left in this country they were all taken away by the imperial troops they say general lang keeps the really pretty ones to himself what a dark insane chapter in grusts history 
the late king grust had two children princess yuliya and prince jubelo theyre still young maybe thirteen or fourteen cute little twins both of them in the last war gharnef the dark pontifex kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king they were taken to khadein the city of magic and locked away in a pitch black room at great personal risk pontifex wendell saved them he took them to a monastery to protect them
general lorenz took the royal children from lord wendell and raised them in grust the empire demanded their extradition but lorenz was afraid they would be killed and hid them the empire branded lorenz a traitor and sent general lang here lang did horrible things to find the royal children thats why we rose up but we lost and now lang is going to kill everyone in this entire country
i heard that general lorenz lived in talys when he was young talys wasnt unified at the time so there were a number of noble houses contending for control lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch of one house and together they unified talys into one country lorenz and that patriarch  now the king of talys  remain close friends to this day
i only saw him briefly but that knight arran looked awfully pale you know hes probably hit the wall so to speak i doubt hell get any stronger no matter how much he fights 
oh  please show mercy to just this child shes only ten years old
maam please calm yourself i am not here to take any children
what  youre not imperial soldiers
no  were not we didnt come to fight if theres anything you need please ask its not much but we can give you food
wait  please take me with you 
huh  youre  are you really ten
no  im a grown woman but granny lied so that i wouldnt be taken away by the soldiers langs soldiers are all monstrous but youre different you have very sweet eyes please take me with you i want you to take me away from this country and take me to yours
its not safe for her to stay here please take her with you and protect her you can marry her too if you like marisha is a beautiful good natured lady just like me im sure shell make a fine wife
no no no granny its far too early for that now youve made marisha all flustered
oh a battle is it were in luck boys lets loot em villages before ey realize whats hit em
alright that will do for now  sir ogma please forgive me for getting you involved in this mess
i am here on king talyss orders as such i will do everything in my power to help
i see  then i have a favor to ask of you i want you to escort these children to macedon these children  prince jubelo and princess yuliya are king grusts orphans please take them safely to lord wendell in macedon
understood  i will guard these two with my life
thank you sir ogma  now prince jubelo princess yuliya you will be leaving with sir ogma
no im not going i wont leave you behind
princess  i cannot go with this wound i can barely even walk it saddens me but you two must go on without me
you took that grievous wound to protect us  how can you tell us to just leave you behind now i will never leave we will never leave your side lorenz
what shall i do general
hmm  this is most troublesome princess yuliya is not one to change her mind easily  we will remain here
in that case i will find some other way to help you i will find lang and bring him down  i will bury him with this sword i swear on it general lorenz you must hold out until then 
prince marth so it is you  how unfortunate that i must fight  the altean army and its prince 
please wait i do not wish to fight with you i heard about everything from the villagers ive heard of all the atrocities archanea has committed i promise i will inform emperor hardin of the truth and rescue grust so please lower your weapons
prince  i am grateful for the offer but i am afraid that i cannot comply prince you know nothing do you think that a man of emperor hardins caliber would make a general out of a man as worthless as lang without good reason he called for an invasion to crush the kingdom of grust and make it a territory of the empire
no it cant be hardin would never do something like that
i know its hard to believe but im afraid that ever since he became emperor he has changed a great deal he is no longer the hardin you once knew prince i have one final request of you in this stronghold i am protecting the young prince and princess of grust please find a way to help them if you can do just that i will have no regrets
what  general lorenz what are you saying 
prince marth  my life in exchange for theirs  by any means necessary please help them  this is the last thing i will ask
general lorenz   this cant be happening  
what youre  the altean army so even altea has turned on us 
forgive me people of grust 
prince marth  general lorenz entrusted everything to you you spared his life and even heard him out we the people of grust thank you please let me offer you a token of our gratitude here were protecting prince jubelo and princess yuliya in this stronghold i beg you do what you must to protect our last fragments of hope 
you youre  grusts royal heirs  prince jubelo and princess yuliya
sniff  lorenz  hes gone  how can we live on without him
you monsters stay away youre going to murder us just like you murdered lorenz
no you have it all wrong we just 
ah  prince marth you finally caught these filthy traitors
general lang wait please these children have done nothing wrong allow me to take custody of them
dont make me laugh these brats are coming with me to my castle besides my dear prince you have other more important priorities i have received reports that there has been a military revolt in macedon and princess minerva has been imprisoned
what  how could that happen to macedon i understand my obligations general lang still these children  let them stay with me please
prince do not try my patience listen up you two youre coming with me
no let me go jubelo  help me
yuliya  yuliya 
wait lang release them at once
sire give me the order and ill get them safely back at once
sire dont do it you too kris if we oppose lang right here right now we run the risk of being branded traitors by archanea
but jagen are you telling me to simply allow lang to take them i cannot stand for that 
i understand how you feel sire  but please remain patient for a little longer if we head to macedon  then rescue princess minerva macedon will surely lend us its strength

to avoid needless battle the altean army decided to cross the central mountain range said to be impassable for a large army going through adria pass one will soon reach the city of pales hurry we cant let the enemy spot us we must charge straight through marth and the others were anxious but they carried on advancing across the narrow mountain road but they didnt expect in the middle of the cliff to be ambushed by an unfathomable enemy they were the northern kingdom of aurelis elite squad the wolfguard who had headed south to aid archanea
kris if we can get through this pass we will be on archaneas doorstep just hang in there a little longer
yes sire
despite all the odds weve surpassed anris way and taken back altea  the battles weve faced up to now  have been nothing short of difficult and in those battles 
weve managed to keep everyone alive with the strength of all our comrades we can accomplish something worthy of anri  im so proud of everyone
sire  
its thanks to our friends that our country is free i cannot help but think of the fallen i want to become stronger for them from now on lets live so that no one falls again 
sire  
 the feeling of pain overwhelms me when i think of the severely wounded and the many who have fallen  perhaps if i had been stronger like anri then everyone would still be alive  from now  from now on i will definitely 
sire  
wolf sedgar vyland is this really okay  can we really fight this battle
roshea what are you trying to say look the altean army is marching long the narrow mountain road nows our only chance to defeat them
yes roshea we swore that we could sacrifice our lives for lord hardin lord hardin was the one who freed us plains people from slavery if we dont fight altea now millennium court will fall do you want lord hardin to be defeated by them
thats right prince marth wants to destroy archanea and conquer the world and thats why he joined forces with macedon to crust grust now he even has gra under his rule if we dont do something the whole world will fall under his control
i still dont believe it i cannot believe prince marth would have such ambitions
what are you saying that emperor hardin lied do you think that he would stoop to such a low enough roshea you disappoint me if you want to betray us then go ahead sedgar vyland lets go if were too slow they will pass us
hey wait i wont betray you i understand  ill go
the wolfguard of aurelis must we fight them as well 
sire please hold on weve just received word from a messenger of king aurelis it seems aurelis has no plans to war  according to the messenger king aurelis wishes to parley with you in the village
what what could this mean that the wolfguard is moving independent of aureliss orders
i dont know but  depending on how negotiations go its possible the wolfguard may signal a retreat
i see it would benefit us all if we could avoid pointless fighting lets hurry to the village
oh prince marth it is good to see you
huh arent you king aurelis what are you doing here
i came here to stop my countrys army also i must apologise to your highness i believed hardins words and followed archanea but i now realize my wrongs archaneas empress nyna secretly sent me a letter saying that hardin isnt normal and is ill  my country will remain neutral and its knights will return to aurelis i hope you wont attack my men anymore
i understand your highness i dont want to fight with you please forgive me for taking so many of your knights lives
oh you really are like what the rumors say my body is frail and i have no children and even hardin my younger brother has completely changed prince marth please protect aurelis in my place i will hand my whole country to you i give this jewel to you as a gift this is a magical jewel containing the divine power of life i spent a lot of gold to buy it from a travelling merchant i believe it will be useful to you dont worry about hardin since he is a knight it is natural for him to die in battle that is his fate well prince marth i will go on ahead i hop you will all be safe 
i am roshea of the aurelis knights i dont want to fight but i cant betray my companions please forgive me 
as long as were here we wont let you get to millennium court if you dont want to die run back to your country
you  why are you invading other countries have you been blinded by ambition
the leader of aurelis knights wolf is here for your head
lord hardin 
kris weve made it through the palace is not far i have only you to thank for this you do nothing but help me
no its not like that it was your decision sire i just came up with the idea
thats hardly the whole truth the times when im lost in my thoughts if youre there i have confidence im thankful for that more than anything
sire weve just received urgent news apparently a coup detat broke out in the palace the knights and citizens who opposed emperor hardins ways rose in rebellion
what in the blazes what has happened to them now
unfortunately the instigators were all defeated and captured  rumor has it that the rebels are being executed by the day
damn it hardin  this is absurd its decided we will head for the palace at once and end this kris lets go
yes sire
kris weve made it through the palace is not far i have only you to thank for this you do nothing but help me
no not at all i just made a random suggestion
thats hardly the whole truth the times when im lost in my thoughts if youre there i have confidence im thankful for that more than anything

kris  the final battle is nigh medeus awaits us up ahead it wont be an easy battle  i dare not imagine how many of us will be left standing at the end  either way the fate of this world rests on our hands 
sire  worry not sire we will emerge victorious thats what the fortune teller said
fortune teller
when i was a child i asked our villages fortune teller for a reading  the old lady held the palm of my hand and said to me  ah your fate is clear to me child
and what did she say
she said that i would grow up to be a legendary hero 
she said that i would live out my life quietly 
she said that i would follow my calling like an arrow 
she said that i would devote my life to the service of others 
she said that i would be stupidly rich and famous 
oh  i can imagine that happening 
and she said that id live until i was a hundred years old 
til a hundred  that is an awfully long time  oh i see  if the fortune teller was right then 
then we are definitely walking out of this hall victorious im not quite that old yet  so rest easy sire
haha youre quite right i  feel much calmer now thank you kris 
i see my sister and the others  but who are they guarding  no it cant be  thats  thats medeus 
with the princesses around him sire youll be unable to strike down medeus if we dont do something soon then the other dragons will awaken and this battle will rapidly escalate into mayhem
then what do you suppose i do how on earth can we save them tell me jagen
i  i do not know  but if we are to defeat medeus we must stop at nothing 
what  you cant mean to kill them
it may be  necessary as they are now they suffer greatly we must save them even if it should cost them their lives 
jagen this  is this really a decision i must make
you are alteas crown prince sire a ruler must be ready for anything though it may cost them their happiness that is all
enough jagen i understand still i cannot accept it there must be another way even till the very end i will never give up
kris i know how prince marth feels please i beg of you  please find a way to save them
understood i will try my best but if the occasion should arise  even if prince marth himself refuses i shall release them from their misery  but for now  i dont want to think about it i still want to hope
kris

marth and the others were transported to alteas outskirts by gotohs magic they were ready to begin the battle to reclaim their homeland the commander of archaneas army general eibel had ordered the gra knights to charge to buy time at the same time he prepared many dishonorable tactics and waited for the chance to defeat alteas army in one swift blow before his fond homeland marths battles were about to begin once again we will reclaim our captical of anri we will reclaim our homeland prince marths voice resounded through alteas skies they had travelled a difficult journey but their destination was finally reached
sire the war council will begin soon
thank you kris  huh wh what happened to your hair 
sir xane did it for me he said that a legendary power would enter me if i wear this tiara and this hairstyle complements it anything to become stronger 
 l legendary power oh xanes handiwork i see he can certainly be a handful 
general the missing altean remnants have finally returned
really haha  what good timing we will follow our original plan have gras soldiers move out to lure them and then defeat them in one go
understood but what about him
the paladin abel it doesnt matter if he betrays me if he does you will kill the female hostage he has already retired from the army he wont swear loyalty to the prince again ha ha  how will they avoid fighting abel  this will be very interesting to watch 
prince marth i have been waiting for you and you have finally returned
oh dolph youre a general of archanea though why would you come to my side
ive given up my position and have left emperor hardins side there is no justice left in archanea but justice lies in your altea and thats why ive come to you
i see then dolph will you fight with us
indeed i shall let this battle be a testament to my faith in you
abel why are you  i dont believe this youre betraying your homeland
lord marth  please forgive me  they took est  if i didnt fight  they would kill her  but after meeting your highness i can no longer  fight  against altea  est  im sorry please forgive me
abel  im sorry you must have suffered
est youre safe
yes lord marth rescued me im alright now
really  damn archanea  but how should i apologize to lord marth 
im sorry  it was all because of me
no est it was nothing to do with you those fools  i wont forgive them  ill show them how deep my anger is
in the forts are many enemies dont be careless
oh you  where did you all go to you all went missing for so long that everyone became very worried about you
the kingdom of gra views altea as its enemy but in reality they were forced to fight because of their alliance with archanea
after altea fell elice was taken to an unknown place by a black robed bishop  oh  princess elice  i pray that you are safe and well 
since being ruled by the imperial army our days have been difficultly passed but we all believed that lord marth would definitely come back for us he would rescue us all from our suffering  because our lord marth is the warrior of light chosen by the deities  the starlord
nearby are enemy spies be careful they will come from the forts
the mercenaries protecting the castle are alteas elites it would be great if they could become your allies
oh your highness youve finally come i have been waiting to give this to you however this village and the neighboring village 
mmm i understand but for the sake of everyone you should start to make up with them 
your highness  please forgive me  i dont want to lose est 
est 
what being able to defeat my great army are you even human
my archanea army could be defeated 
that was quite a battle is everyone alright
theres no need for concern sire everybody has eagerly awaited this day
sir jagen speaks truly weve been fighting for this day   the day we reclaim our homeland
yet because of archaneas actions so many innocent lives have been lost how can i face them  ive caused them great sorrow because i was too weak  was i presumptuous in believing i could protect my homeland
sire  do you remember sire the words you said to us on the very first day of our training
kris   of course i could never forget  
alone i am powerless so everyone from now on i want you to lend me your power as my knights
upon hearing your words i decided that i would work hard so that i could be of assistance to you sire i want to become like you there is no need for you to shoulder everything on your own your pain and your suffering  they are not yours to bear alone i will always be by your side
kris  
sire chin up we must still recapture altea castle i believe that our enemies are well prepared for us but it is our castle we know it better than they do sire give us the command we will fight to recover our home
that was a tough battle is everyone alright
dont worry sire everybody has eagerly awaited this day
sir jagen speaks truly weve been fighting for this day   the day we reclaim our homeland
yet so many innocent lives have been stolen by archanea no apology is worthy for them  ive caused them great sorrow because of my unreliability  was i presumptuous in believing i could protect my homeland
sire  do you remember sire the words you said to us on the very first day of our training
kris   of course i could never forget  
alone i am powerless so everyone from now on i want you to lend me your power as my knights
upon hearing your words i decided that i would become your strength sire i wish to be your sword there is no need for you to shoulder your burden alone your pain and your suffering  do not let them be yours to bear alone i will always be by your side
kris  
sire chin up we must still recapture altea castle i believe that our enemies are well prepared for us but it is our castle we know it better than they do sire give us the command we will fight to recover our home
by the way kris about your tiara  did it work did you feel the er legendary power
no i didnt feel any different
as i suspected  kris i believe xane pulled a fast one on you
i is that so 
in light of this would you like to return your hair to the way it was before
yes thank you
good im glad weve sorted that out
/***EOF***/
this was a fierce battle like no other but their homeland of altea has been liberated all that remains is the castle  if i could regain altea castle where i was born  everybody thank you  i really must thank you all for placing your trust in me  before marths face flowed shimmering tears  even the girl who gently wiped his tears away couldnt prevent her own tears 
kris weve returned at long last were back where it all began 
yeah its a curious feeling it feels like yesterday that i first stepped foot here and yet it seems so far away 
yes i remember when you first arrived here for training you had no experience of battle and now 
youve grown into one of the continents finest young soldiers kris with you here i have no doubt that we can reclaim our homeland were all counting on you
you have gained much experience as a knight of altea kris your efforts will decide whether or not we will succeed in reclaiming altea were counting on you
hmm  you havent really changed very much from how you were back then kris you must work harder on the battlefield from now on im counting on you
how disgraceful  thieves inside our fair castle what if theyve stolen the geosphere
sire weve sighted a suspicious looking thief making his way north we should capture him before its too late
sire if youd allow me the honor i will go your orders please
how disgraceful  they let thieves inside the castle what if theyve stolen the geosphere
sire weve sighted a suspicious looking thief making his way north we should capture him before its too late
sire if necessary i shall recover it your orders my lord
prince marth please hold on
macellan did you come here with dolph
correct dolph and i are going to be your reinforcements archanea has nothing left for me for the justice that i believe in allow me to fight by your side again prince marth
lord willow permission to open the door and attack
wait dont be so hasty inform me as soon as any of the chests in the treasury are opened we will sortie the moment that happens both the thieves and the alteans will want their greasy hands on the loot while theyre busy trying to unload the chests we will take that chance and attack heh heh  this is a battle of intellect not brawn dont forget attack when the chests are sprung
whats that the chests have been sprung now open the door heh heh heh their panicked faces will be glorious
you foul traitors taste the might of my mercurius
midia 
astram how are you doing
so its the traitor jeorge what do you want with me
wait astram general eibel has already fallen you wont be able to win even if you continue fighting
you want me to surrender  never even if i am the last one standing i am a warrior of archanea to the end
why are you  who are you fighting for are you fighting for emperor hardin
no its not because of that man but because of nyna  and for archanea
but did nyna tell you to fight here do you really think that nyna would hope for this kind of battle
well  i hadnt seen nyna for a while i was told that she fell ill and that i couldnt see her but  since hardin is emperor of archanea i have no choice if i dont follow his orders i will become a traitor and i will be betraying nyna
astram nyna already entrusted the emblem to prince marth do you understand the meaning of her actions
wh what when did this happen jeorge nyna requested prince marth for help
i believe that is the only explanation astram if you want to find out the truth then come with us  if you die here what will midia do you must live on for her you must live on so you can confirm with your eyes what is happening
hmm  i guess i have no choice but jeorge if this war is as hardin said and was caused by prince marths ambitions i will never forgive you remember that
hahaha  its time for me to show you  the destructive power of my meteor magic 
emperor hardin forgive me 
sire its over
at long last altea is ours once more
weve all the reason to be happy but is there news of elice 
sire we have routed the enemy
at last altea is ours once more
yes its a wondrous feeling but is there news of elice 
prince marth  can you hear me i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings but it would seem that princess elice has been kidnapped by gharnef
lord gotoh  do you speak truly
i have found out that gharnef commanded his priests to search for clerics of noble birth it is most likely that lena and your sister were spirited away by gharnef
it cant be what does he intend to do with them
that i do not know but something foul is on the cards there can be no doubt of gharnefs involvement in this series of unfortunate events
lord gotoh where is gharnef now
i believe princess nyna is his next target he is probably  at archaneas palace
i understand then i too shall go to archanea i still have to free hardin from the darkspheres influence i will defeat the dark pontifex gharnef and rescue my sister  no ill save all of them
hello kris its been too long since we last spoke casually in altea castle this place holds a lot of memories for you doesnt it your long days of training  not to mention you met katarina here
