@Opening 
Still smarting from their bitter experience with Gharnef and the dark magic Imhullu, Prince Marth and the League regrouped and marched south- home to Altea. Once Marth's kingdom had been beautiful, blessed with rich soil and clear waters; now the eyes tended to notice instead the barren farms; the ruins; forlorn stares. Marth vowed to free Altea from its torment without any further delay.

@Intro 
Nyna: You've done it, Marth. We're here. That's Altea beneath our feet- your home.
Marth: Countless days have passed since Dolhr took my kingdom from me- days I would never have lived had it not been for my sister Elice's sacrifice, and the sacrifices of so many others...
Nyna: What became of your sister? And the rest of your family, what of them as well?
Marth: My father, as you know, died in Gra. I last saw my mother and sister the day the castle fell. I do not know if they still live...but I hope that they do. And if the enemy has them, I will rescue them. You can be sure of that.
Malledus: Sire, our preparations are complete. We are ready to march.
Marth: Thank you.
Marth: Alteans and friends of the League! Join me now! Help me set Altea free, and ensure today is the last battle my people must endure!

@Visit 
Old Man: Listen well, because this is very important. There are two villages in the northwest of Altea. The easterly village is home to a paladin named Arran while the westerly village is home to a hero named Samson. They're both fine men and warriors, but their villages have been feudin' for years. You should probably resign yourself to the fact that you'll only get one of them to join your ranks. Give it some thought: the hero to the west, or the paladin to the east?

Young Girl: A VIP card will gain you entrance to secret shops. Where are the shops? Well, that’s the secret!

Young Man: A lad named Xane has been locked up in the eastern jail. They say he’s got some sort of amazing power. Wonder what it is.

Middle-aged Man: Three orbs are enshrined at the Fane of Raman, each brimming with power. What sort of power, none can say. Well, except those who have wielded it, right?

Old Woman: The Altean army! Welcome home. It’s good to see you. These years been nowt but dark days; it’s about time we had something bright to look forward to.

Middle-aged Man: Take care when usin' a devil sword. It’s a powerful blade, to be sure- but it might just claim your life instead of your foe’s.
Young Man: Princess Elice was prepared to die that day the castle fell. But she didn't, they say. Instead of killin' her, the Dark Pontifex Gharnef spirited her off somewhere! Oh, our poor princess... I hope she's safe.

@Recruit-Visit 
Samson: My name is Samson. Once, I was a swordfighter of some renown...but that was then, and this is now. I'm happy enough with my life here in the village, but if you need another man, I will fight. Unfortunately, there has always been bad blood between our village and the next one over. They'll have closed the gates to you the moment they saw you come here. Guess that means the paladin Arran won't be fightin' with you. Them's the breaks.

Arran: Sire, my name is Arran. Once I was a captain to many knights... but, things change, and I came to live here in this village. If you need warriors for the coming struggle, I would be honored to fight. Unfortunately, there has always been bad blood between this village and our neighbors. No doubt they closed their gates to you as soon as they saw you come here. You won't be able to recruit the hero Samson now, I'm afraid.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Xane
Xane: Hey there, princey. Thanks for settin' me free! The name's Xane. I hail from a land few have heard of an even fewer have seen. I won't trouble you with the details. Me and my folk have the power to transform into other people. We can shape-shift, you see. When Doluna caught on, they started threatenin' me. Told me to join their army or "face my doom." Hah! Well, I wasn't about to waste my considerable talent on those evil coots! You, on the other hand...You've got character. Say, why don't we team up? I do owe you for savin' my hide. And I think you'll find my talents are...quite considerable.

@Boss 
Hollstadt: Well done, rabble. Anyone else would be dead by now. A shame you must end your campaign right here, before your own gates!

Hollstadt: Rrgh! General Camus... The rest... is in your... hands...

@End 
Malledus: Well done, sire! The enemy has ceased their resistance. Victory is ours!
Nyna: Bravo, Marth. On behalf of House Archanea, I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations.
Marth: Thank you, Nyna. But it's still too soon to celebrate. We haven't freed the castle yet.
Malledus: Sire, your soldiers have assembled for the castle raid. Perhaps you could say a few words first...
Marth: Altean warriors... Brave comrades. The road has been long, but at last we have driven Dolhr from my homeland. There are not words to express my gratitude to you all. You gave Altea back to me. Thank you... Thank you. ...An army of foes still haunt my castle. I mean to kick them out. Ready, my friends? Let's send these varlets scurrying!

@Opening
One thing could always be said about Galder Harbor, the mainland port nearest Talys: it never had much in the way of riches, but neither did it have much trouble. All that changed when a pirate crew fell upon the town and made it their hideout. Here, in Galder, history records Marth’s first steps toward freeing his homeland.

@Intro 
Ogma: Prince Marth, I am Ogma, a mercenary of Talys. The king has bid me and my three men join your army. Cavalry has arrived from the west, flying Grust’s standard. They mean to take your life, sire. Be careful.

@Visit 
Young Man: A pirate callin’ himself Darros wants to talk to your prince. Says he’s washed his hands of pillagin’ and plunderin’ and wants to fight for the good of all. Hah! Right... And I’m a farmer who’s been sworn off rain...

Young Man: Curates gain experience whenever they use their staves.

Middle-Aged Man: Hammers smash right through heavy armor. You should pick one up, when you get the chance.

Old Man: Oh! Mighty prince of Altea! Please, will you save Sister Lena? She’s gone up into the Ghoul’s Teeth to tend to the sick there. We warned her, I swear we did... Lena is our angel. If something befell her, I- No, I won’t think of it. Take this gold: we’ve 5000 pieces. Just promise you’ll use it to bring her home to us unharmed.

@Recruit-Visit
Darros: Ahoy, Prince Marth, I be Darros, a simple man o’ the sea. I’ve had me fill o’ the piratin’ life, and now I be lookin’ t’start anew. What say ye? Make me yer matey, and I swear t’pull me load.

@Recruit-Talk
%Caeda,Castor
Caeda: Castor?! It is you, isn’t it? Must even good men like you betray Talys now?
Castor: Princess Caeda? Oh...I’m sorry, but me mother’s sick, and the medicine don’t buy itself, see...
Caeda: So you agreed to fight for the pirates in exchange for coin...All right then. If it’s gold you need, take mine. Here, this is all I have. Take it, and go to your mother’s side.
Castor: But Princess...I betrayed you! ...Ach, I’ve been a fool! Forgive me, Princess. Let me fight for you now. Me life is yours.

@Battle-Talk
%Caeda,Ogma
Caeda: Ogma!
Ogma: Princess...
Caeda: I never got to thank you for coming along with us. There's no swordsman I trust more. I've seen your strength.
Ogma: You don't need to thank me, Princess. I'm just doing my job. Speaking of which, your father would flay me if you came to any harm. Do me a favor, and leave the dangerous fighting to me and my men.
Caeda: I don't need protecting, Ogma. ...I've got another job for you. Protect Marth for me.
Ogma: But, Princess...
Caeda: He's very important to me. And the world... But mostly to me. So do as I ask, Ogma. Keep him safe. That's my first and last request.
Ogma: Very well. How could I say no to you?
Caeda: Thank you, Ogma. I knew you'd understand. All right, I have to go. But I hope we get to talk like this more. You're a good listener.
Ogma: ...Princess
Caeda: Yes?
Ogma: You keep yourself safe, too. Marth would grieve if anything befell you.
Caeda: Fair enough. Thank you, Ogma. You're very kind.

%Castor,Marth
Castor: Prince Marth, I am Castor of Talys. I wish to add my bow to your strength.
Marth: Of course. Caeda told me about you.
Castor: You know, she’s always been very kind to me, sire, even before I left Talys. And look how I’ve repaid her...
Marth: Castor, you can still show her your heart is true. Let the battles to come be what defines you!

@Boss
Gomer: The gall of ye, defyin' me crew! I'll put an axe square between yer eyes! Ye ain't leaving here alive. I swear it on the rickety peg leg o'Shanty Pete!

Gomer: Augh... Fiends, ye be...

@End 
Villager: You have our gratitude, sire, for finally chasin’ those pirates away. Now, as I hear it, you plan to march on to Aurelis...That’ll take you right up through the Ghoul’s Teeth. With all due respect, sire, you’re taking a great risk crossin’ those mountains that’s Soothsire territory. The Soothsires are fearsome bandits, always raidin’ the villages and harryin’ what travelers dare pass by. And the swordsman with ’em- goes by the name o’ Navarre- he’s a terror with a blade, so they say. If you go up there, keep your wits about you- or you won’t come back down.

@Opening
Marth, prince of Altea was lucky. Though Dolhr took from him his kingdom and all but a handful of knights, they could not take his life. Marth lived and made it to the eastern isle of Talys. Talys was a small border kingdom, with no grand order of knights to boast of, but its king selflessly gave Marth use of the isle's eastern fortress. And as he saw the boy shake with anger and grief, he also gave wise counsel: "Prince Marth," he said, "I do not doubt you love your sister something great. But you must be patient... Time is on your side. If you stay here, and grow stronger, a time will come when you can help her." So Marth stayed in Talys, protected by its kind people, and the years went by...

@Intro
Jagen: Sire! You've a visitor from the castle. It's Princess Caeda!
Marth: Caeda, what is it? You look white as a sheet!
Caeda: Marth, come quickly! It’s the castle... Galdr's pirates attacked from out of nowhere... They stormed the gates and cut down everyone in their path! I fear for my father's life...
Marth: Steady, Caeda. You did well to come find us. Altea's bravest knights aren't about to hand Talys to that flock of seafowl. Come, we'll make for the castle now!

@Visit
Old man: Villages will keep their gates open for Prince Marth, but he must be quick – if a thief reaches a village before the prince does, there may not be any more village left to visit.

Young man: I hear you need a high weapon level to wield the strongest weapons. Another thing: Keep your fliers away from those enemy archers!

Young man: A knight belongs on the front lines, if you ask me. That thick armor can take a lot of abuse, so they should be up front protecting the other units.

Teenage boy: Galder? That's the harbor town west of Talys out beyond the water. These days, a pirate by the name of Gomer calls the shots there. The whole town's at the mercy of his crew.

Old woman: A man of the staff by the name of Wrys lives in the village south of the castle. He was hopin' to meet your prince.

Old man: Prince Marth! 'Tis good you stopped by. The villagers have collected 10,000 gold pieces. If it please you, use the money to arm your warriors, and rid our land of those pirates.

@Recruit-Visit
Wrys: I am Wrys, a humble curate. I cannot fight, but this staff I carry can heal your wounded. Take me with you, and you'll be very glad you did.

@Boss
Gazzak: The might of Altea, ye say, now? Har! Ye sprogs look t’be a mite short o’mighty t’me.

Gazzak: Rrgh... Ye'll pay, dog...

@End
Talys King: Ah, Prince Marth! You have saved us in our hour of need. Please accept my thanks. Lad, I believe you are ready. If you wish to seek out allies in Aurelis, I will give you what soldiers I can to see you arrive there safely. Captain Ogma is a fine swordsman, brave and true. I know he and his fighters will serve you well. Another thing...During your travels, you are certain to meet many who despise Dolhr. Some may be hiding in villages; other may have been captured or forced to fight against their will or better judgment. It falls upon you to find these individuals and win them over your cause. Understood, lad? Then go! The time has come! Be patient, steady, strong: I know you will do great things.

@Opening 
Having won the day and putting Camus and his Sable Order to rout, Marth and the League moved on to the mountains in eastern Grust, to crush the last of the opposition. The surviving Grustian soldiers, in a mad attempt to hang on to their lives, took all the residents of a nearby village hostage to keep Marth from striking. However, they could not have picked a worse village to harass...

@Intro 
Larissa: Have the villagers given up struggling yet?
Enemy Soldier: With that ogre on the loose? Hardly, sir. All of our soldiers together still can’t contain him. The other villagers have fled into the caverns, out of reach.
Larissa: What? Grr, enough of this! The League will be here soon. Take your positions! We’ll deal with them first and cut that giant down to size later.

Old Woman: Ymir, you’re hurt!
Ymir: Am I? I hardly feel it.
Old Man: Why would you try to take on an entire army just for our sake?
Ymir: Because you treat me like a human being. Do I need another reason?
Old Woman: Ymir... thank you.
Ymir: I’ll be standing guard outside the cavern. Nobody will hurt you, I swear it.

@Battle-Talk
%Marth,Ymir 
Marth: Who are you? You don’t seem to be one of Grust’s soldiers.
Ymir: You just keep your distance. I’m not letting anyone near the villagers in here, and that includes you!
Marth: You wrong me, sir. I’m here to rout the last of Grust’s army. To save you.
Ymir: Yeah? Well, they said the same thing when they led us down here. And look where that got us. I’m not fallin’ for the same lies twice!
Marth: I speak the truth. But, if my word is not good enough, so be it. Stand aside and watch us fight. Let the battle prove I mean what I say. Agreed? Either way, you are in danger here. Take the villagers and hide until this is over.
Ymir: ...So I’m supposed to just sit here, when I could be fightin’?
Marth: Just give me a chance to prove I’m here to protect you.
Ymir: ...Fine. I’ll stay out of it. For now. But if I find you’re lyin’ to me, I’ll split you right down the middle!

@Recruit-Battle 
Ymir: The villagers are countin’ on me. I won’t let you through!

Ymir: Rrgh... I’m sorry... I tried...

@Boss
Larissa: We’ll never surrender to you Akaneian rabble! Long live Grust!

Larissa: Rebel... scum...

@End 
Old Man: Prince Marth, thank you. Those soldiers told us they’d protect us when they led us down here... but they were just using us as leverage, hostages to keep you at bay! If you hadn’t shown up, they might have just killed us outright in the end...

Ymir: Prince Marth, sorry I doubted you.
Marth: Well, at least we’ve cleared up the misunderstanding.
Ymir: Since you came to the villagers’ rescue, how ’bout I help you out as a way of sayin’ thanks?
Marth: You mean... join our army?
Ymir: I’m strongest in the land! Well, second strongest, at least. I can hold my own in battle. But if you don’t want a monster in your ranks, I understand...
Marth: Monster? You’re a giant among men, to be sure, but a hero as well! Any warrior who can fend of an entire army is welcome among us!
Ymir: Then count me in! Let’s see how many more armies break themselves against me, eh!

@Opening
After a hard battle, Marth’s Altean Army- for it had grown to be called such- set foot at last in the kingdom of Aurelis. However, joining his might to that of the Aurelians would have to wait. As Marth descended into the vast green lea separating his troops from theirs, he heard a terrible sound: the galloping of enemy destriers, far away...then closer... Then far too close.

@Intro 
Malledus: Aurelis, at last...The enemy will have sent their forces to meet us.
Marth: Grust, Dolhr, Gra..We’re up against their standing armies, and we must brace ourselves for it.
Malledus: Sire, I believe it prudent that we start taking time to prepare our troops before each battle. We should select the warriors best suited for the situation and outfit them with the right weapons and items accordingly.
Marth: All right, that’s sound advice- I believe I’ll take it.

Bentheon: An unknown army to the south? That must be the Altean princeling and his band of lickspittles. If they think we’ll sit by and let them join forces with the Aurelians, then they have another think coming. With this ridersbane, I’ll litter the lea with their cavalry!

@Visit
Young Man: Weapons can be crafted of iron, steel, or silver, each metal more powerful than the last. You’’l need to raise your weapon level accordingly, though, before you can use them.

Middle-aged Man:“When facing armored knights or generals, you’ll want to arm yourself with a sword they call an armorslayer. Then there’s the ridersbane, which makes short work of cavaliers and paladins- but only knights and cavalry can wield it. The rapier is effective against armored units AND cavalry. But you need to be a prince to wield that one! Also, keep in mind that weapons wear down with use and eventually break.

Young Man: General Bentheon who guards the castle was carrying a ridersbane last I saw. Keep your cavaliers away, or that weapon could spell the end of ‘em.

Old Man: Did you know you can use keys to unlock doors and lower bridges? ...You did? Ahem! Right, of course you did.

Middle-aged Man: There’s no terror like the dracoknight. One false move when they’re flyin’ about, and you can kiss your life goodbye.

Old Woman: Kind Altean, this kingdom is in dire need of a savior. We’ve saved up 5,000 gold and poured our prayers into every coin. Please, use this money to answer them.

@Recruit-Visit
Merric: Aha! Prince Marth. We meet again.
Marth: ...Huh? Merric?! Merric, is that you?
Merric: Well, yes, sire, last I looked. Whilst studying magic in Khadein, I caught wind of a war brewing and decided to seek you out.
Marth: I see... Thank you, then. I need friends like you on the battlefield. You will fight with us, of course?
Merric: Of course! ‘Twould be a passing shame if you didn’t get to see me flex a little magic muscle. Wait till I show you my latest: Excalibur!

Matthis: Lena... Forgive your...fool of a brother...

@Recruit-Talk
%Lena,Matthis
Lena: Matthis? Is that you?
Matthis: Lena?! What are you doing on a battlefield?
Lena: I was attacked by bandits in the Teeth while tending to the sick there, and these people saved me. The real question is, what are YOU doing on a battlefield- least of all this one!
Matthis: I’m not here by choice, sister of mine. Since you left, Macedon has only gotten worse and worse. They forced me to enlist- you know I hate warfare, but it was into the army or onto the chopping block.
Lena: Shame on you, Matthis. If you’re going to fight, then at least fight for something you believe in. Medon has done terrible things: marrying their might to Doluna, helping them torment people...Brother, it’s not too late. You could join Altea’s forces. They’re good people you know. Prince Marth would welcome you. They all would.
Matthis: ...All right, then. If I’m gonna to die, I’d rather die as one of the dashing than one of the dastardly. You know, Lena, you always were the reliable one and now you’re all grown up...I thought for sure you’d have already settled down with your one true love.
Lena: T-true love? I’ve...I’ve met no such man, Matthis.
Matthis: Hmm, is that so? I’ll bet you haven’t... Well, you just be careful. There are plenty of thieves out there who would steal a girl’s heart.

@Battle-Talk 
%Marth,Matthis
Marth: You must be Matthis, Sister Lena’s-
Matthis: ACK! Y-you’re Prince Marth! Aieee! S-s-stay your rapier, I beg you!
Marth: ...What has gotten into you?
Matthis: You mean...you haven’t come to stick me like a pig for fighting under the Macedonian standard?
Marth: Er, no...
Matthis:“Really?
Marth: Really and truly.
Matthis: Oh! Uh, right then... Sorry about that little display. I guess Lena was right. Just goes to show not all princes are cut from the same cloth!
Marth:“What do you mean?
Matthis: Oh, well, our prince- Prince Michalis of Macedon, that is- he’s strong, and proud...and an utter tyrant. They say he put the soldiers who look the most scared in the front lines on purpose.
Marth: Hmm... Prince Michalis of Medon...
Matthis: Don’t worry, sire, I won’t mistake you for him again! Altean princes I can trust!

@Boss 
Bentheon: You can defy us, yes... But you will never defeat us.

Bentheon: W...what...

@End

@Opening 
After Medeus's demise, Dolhr would relax its shadowy grip on the land and fade into obscurity: the Empire was finished. The fires of war that had raged across Archanea would die, and light would come to take darkness's place. But before any of that came to pass, there were a few final moments of Marth's tale that need telling...

@Dialogue 
^start
Caeda: Marth, you did it. It's finally over.
Marth: I've waiting a long time for this day. And now I'm not entirely certain what to do with it...
Caeda: Marth... um, we haven't talked much since leaving Talys. But I thought.. Do you know where you will be going?
Marth: To Altea, of course. War has left my kingdom in ruins. I cannot waste another day; I must return to help rebuild.
Caeda: So... I suppose that means you have bid Talys farewell for good...
Marth: Don't be silly, Caeda. I need to at least go thank your father and tell him the fighting is done.
Caeda: My father...? Marth, I'm not asking about my- Never mind. Please excuse me...
Nyna: Marth, did something happen? I just passed Caeda, and she looked heartbroken...
Marth: No... Well, we were just talking. And she asked me...
Nyna: Ha ha, oh, Marth... How can a man who faced the Shadow Dragon be so desperate to avoid facing his own feelings?
Marth: I- my- what? I don't know what you are talking about.
Nyna: You wish to send Caeda home to Talys, then, and return to Altea alone? That is what you want?
Marth: Well, that's where we both belong. I don't see what my wants have to do with anything.
Nyna: Clearly not. Marth, if you have anything to say to Caeda, say it now. Love cannot always make the leap from heart to heart by itself; sometimes you must speak it aloud and give it wings. Surely a great leader like you can muster the courage for that?
Marth: .....
Marth: Caeda... might I, er, have a moment?
Caeda: .....?
Marth: I did not speak with my heart before. When I said I would go to Altea, I... Well, I had meant... I hoped you would be at my side.
Caeda: .....!
Marth: As you said, we have not spoken much since Talys. With you, I felt I never had to say a word. If the battle started to take its toll, you were always there... close by... I would see you there, so beaut- ahem, so brave... and I would, um,.... derive! Yes, derive great strength! Derive... ....Ugh, why is this so difficult?! Caeda, I'm just trying to tell you I-
Caeda: Marth... Shh. Me too... Me too.

Nyna: Well done, Marth. Our struggle is finally over. You have saved our world.
Marth: Not just me. Many fought at my side... And died.
Nyna: Marth... You loved her, didn't you? Caeda.
Marth: ...She was the one I most wanted to keep safe. But I failed, and I have lost her forever... It occurs to me now that perhaps she was the one protecting me all along. Caeda... Why did you take up arms with a fool like me?
Nyna: Marth, do not blame yourself. ...Remember Anri and Artemis. We are their descendants; perhaps we were always meant to share their curse as well as their blood. And... perhaps only the curse has exacted its price could our battle with the Shadow Dragon be won. This peace we have made... We must cherish it, Marth. We have both paid so dearly for it. Let us work together to ensure none must endure a tragedy like our again.
^end

@Narration 
So concludes the tale of Falchion, blade of light; Marth, its wielder; and his battle with the Shadow Dragon. Herein its events have been chronicled, that none may ever forget.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The long war had been fought, Archanea’s many lands freed, and now the League had cornered their archenemy within his castle. They broke into four groups and stormed the four gates of Dolhr Keep- unaware that this was exactly what Medeus was expecting. Bravely, these warriors fate had chosen steeled themselves for one last struggle.

@Intro 
Marth: We made it. Now we just have to find Medeus...
Nagi: I can sense it... A sinister will is at work here...
Gotoh: Marth, you have fought splendidly.
Marth: Lord Gotoh?! What are you doing here?
Gotoh: I washed my hands of humankind and their foolish ways long ago. But you and your companions have convinced me that was a rash decision. Perhaps there is hope for you yet. Allow me to offer what help I can.
Marth: You mean you’ll fight with us?
Gotoh: Yes. I may lack the power to stop Medeus, but his minions are another story. Let this old man strike them down and clear a path for you. ...The gods have chosen you, Marth, prince of light.
Marth: Come, my friends! We have a dragon to tame! Help me confine Medeus to the shadows for all eternity and bring light back into the world!

@Flashback
Cain: His last words were as follows: “Tell my son that I leave the future of Altea and our continent in his hands.”
Malledus: Your sister knows that you are the future of Altea- nay, the whole land!

@Boss 
Medeus: Foolish humans! You dare disturb me while I slumber? Oh, how you will regret it as you die slowly...painfully...writhing in the fires of the inferno!

Medeus: Nngh... Defeated again... by humans! Know this, Altean prince... That light which surrounds you is only a temporary respite. So long as the darkness in your hearts continues to sustain me... I cannot be... destroyed...... Rrraaahhh!!!

%Nagi,Medeus 
Medeus: Hmm? So... I am not the only dragon revived. I had heard you perished the last time. No matter; you've recovered even less of your power than me. This time, you have no chance!

@Opening 
Aurelis was free, but Marth and his army- now known as the Archanean League still had much work ahead of them. They followed the Middleroad south, bound for Archanea Palace- a perilous route, for it took them right into Lefcandith Valley and the jaws of trouble. The countless fortresses lining the valley made it a veritable gauntlet and compounding the danger was the presence of the Whitewings, a knightly order led by Princess Minerva of Macedon. It would be a fierce battle.

@Intro 
Minerva: General Harmein, I cannot abide by these tactics of yours. Let me attack the rebels head-on, and keep my pride as a knight of Macedon.
Harmein: Ah, you mean the same pride that cost us all those soldiers back in Aurelis? I think not, Princess. If we’re to regroup, we need to buy time. My tactics are necessary. The emperor himself has named me commander of this post. Either obey, or accept the consequences. Your little sister Maria is still under our word, is she not? What a shame it would be, if we decided we could no longer care for her...
Minerva: Enough! ...I will obey. But the Altean knights are smarter than you give them credit for. They will prevail here, and you will regret having acting so rashly, General.

@Visit 
Middle-aged Man: Say, did you happen to get a look at the axe wrapped in Minerva’s princessly fingers? No, I suppose not, otherwise you’d not be standing here. That axe is Hauteclere, the strongest axe of ‘em all. Nobody knows who made it or where, but it’s said to rival even the three regalia, Archanea’s mightiest weapons. Why, if she got her hands on Iote’s Shield (that’un being Macedon’s treasure, see) she’d be nigh unstoppable!

@Recruit-Visit
Bantu: You there. Have you come across a young girl, one by the name of Tiki? She must be found, boy! Tiki is the last of the Naga, the divine-dragon clan. Without her powers, we cannot challenge the Manaketes who serve Medeus... Me? I haven’t the power. I am a fire dragon, yes... But in the name alone, in name alone. I lost my firestone in Pyrathi. Without it, I cannot do battle. ...You will be traveling much, yes? I wish to go with you. Perhaps together we can find Tiki.

@Battle 
Minerva: Fie, enough! I’ve no stomach for these cat-and-mouse tactics. Come, Whitewings, we fly! Hyah!

@Character-Falls
Minerva: Rrgh... I can’t keep up the fight with these wounds... I must withdraw.

Palla: I serve Princess Minerva, not Grust. This battle is over.

Catria: The commander left? Then I’ve no reason to stay.

Malledus: Prince Marth, I was wondering if we might talk about the Manaketes.
Marth: Manaketes? You mean the dragonkin?
Malledus: Yes, sire. I was not sure how much knowledge you had of the Manaketes. The Manaketes inhabited our continent long before the dawn of humanity. However, ordinarily their draconic disposition stayed suppressed; their power sealed within special stones. Thus rather than terrorizing humankind, they chose to live simple, peaceful lives in the quieter reaches of the world. However, a century ago, something changed. Medeus, the Shadow Dragon, surfaced in the Dolhr region and created what would be a great empire there. His forces invaded the human realm, and in the blink of an eye, he had subjected all of the land. It was then, in that darkest hour, that a young man named Anri appeared, and rose against the Shadow Dragon. In his head was a shining blade of light- Falchion- which he plunged into Medeus- and the tyrant was no more. Anri went on to found Altea- and the rest, I believe, you know.
Marth: Yes, Malledus... Is that what this was about? I do know my own kingdom’s history. And I know what I must do, now that Medeus has revived and restored Dolhr to its former might.
Malledus: You are Anri’s last male descendant, the only one who can wield Falchion. You must find the blade that was taken, and put an end to Doluna and its misguided Manakete rulers.
Marth: I will finish what my father started. I will avenge him, and bring light back into our world.

@Opening 
The League had reached Archanean soil, so Marth gave himself leave to recuperate in Port Warren, a harbor town known for commerce. Coin alone kept the town free and they paid Dolhr dearly in taxes to preserve their autonomy. Naturally, then, theirs was a warm welcome when the Archanean League arrived. Marth's soldiers were glad to rest there, nestled between mountain and sea, but their joy was spoiled by news that the enemy was fast approaching- as harsh an awakening as a rock beneath the pillow.

@Intro 
Caesar: Prince Marth, I am Caesar, and this is Radd. We are hired swords in the service of Port Warren. Grust has gathered its knights by the fortresses to the north. It's dangerous for you to stay here. Thankfully, the eastern castle has been left almost entirely unguarded; that's the place to strike. Please be careful, sire. We'll be fighting with you all the way.

@Visit
Old Woman: They say a princess of Macedon is being held captive inside Castle Deil. That's odd, don’t you think? Why would Dolhr imprison their own ally?

Young Man: I saw loads of enemy soldiers up by the northern fortresses! They’ll be pouring out of the gates any minute now. You’d better send someone to bar the exits before they do!

Caeda: Good day, sir.
Roger: Ack!
Caeda: Peace, I’ve no wish to fight you. My name is Caeda. I hail from Talys.
Roger: Wh-what are you talking to me for?! This is a battlefield!
Caeda: Might I trouble you by asking your name, good sir?
Roger: M-my name? That’s- It’s Roger... Why?
Caeda: Hee hee, forgive me, Roger, it’s just you looked sweet and kind. I just had to stop and talk to you. Tell me: do you believe in love? Oh, listen to me. I’m sure you already have a sweetheart back in Grust.
Roger: What?! No, no! I... mean, er, I’m quite unattached at the moment.
Caeda: Roger, think of the children- the poor women and children who shed tears every day this war drags on. I joined the Archanean League to put an end to it, but I just...just...*Sniff* Oh, Roger, doesn't it break your heart?
Roger: Aye, miss. There, there. I, too, wish nothing more than for this needless war to end.
Caeda: Then...would you consider fighting with us to end it?
Roger: What? Oh heavens, no... I’m sorry, but I could never betray my kingdom.
Caeda: Ah, yes, I see. You must have family back in Grust who are counting on you.
Roger: No, not especially. My parents are dead, and it’s not as if I’ve a girl to call my own. But Grust is my home- always has been. I won’t betray her.
Caeda: And I cannot convince you to change your mind?
Roger: I’m afraid not, miss.
Caeda: All right, sorry to bother you. But I’m glad we had this chance to talk, Roger. You’re every bit the man I thought you were. Goodbye, then...
Roger: Wait- you’re leaving?!
Caeda: Well, yes, Roger, I must! Every moment I stay here, I put you at risk. What if your comrades thought you were conspiring with the enemy? No, I must go...

Roger: Well, er... There’s this fetching girl named Caeda who asked me to, and, uh... What can I say? I think I’m in love. Try saying no to a girl who comes racing up to you in the heat of battle just to ask if you believe in love! Whew! I must’ve turned red as a strawberry! Heh heh...

@Opening 
Tired from so many long battles, Marth and the League arrive at last in Archanea, Princess Nyna's mother kingdom. Past the mountains lay the royal palace, known to some as Millennium Court; and within its walls awaited many treasures and captives the enemy had taken. With each step, Marth draw nearer to one of the great waypoints on his journey.

@Intro 
Marth: Nyna, soon the palace will be in sight. I...know this can't be easy for you.
Nyna: ...When the palace fell, many, many good Archaneans were killed. The royal family...My family were...Their bodies were hung before the gates as an example. I cannot unpaint that vivid picture, of my parents grotesquely changed...I feel as though I should cry, Marth; or scream. But no tears come, and I cannot chase away the sadness and rage... ...I cannot change the past. I can only shape the future. Lead the way, Marth. I am ready. Take me home.

@Visit 
Young Man: This here is Knorda, Archanea’s closest market town. Drop by the armories and vendors if you’ve an interest in rare goods.

Young Man: A gang of ruffians have rounded up some Archanean folk and are holdin! em over at the edge of town. What a world it’s become, that we’ve gotta be prisoners in our own land!

Middle-aged Man: Three ancient weapons known as the Regalia have been passed down through the generations of House Archanea: Parthia, the bow of flame; Gradivus, the lance that pierces stone; and Mercurius, the spectral sword. Only those blessed by the gods may lay hands on them- or so it goes.

Old Woman: I’m sick of war. If it ain’t the screams of battle you’re hearin! it’s the bawlin! of the widows! You all should go home to your loved ones if you ask me.

Young Man: Watch out for the ballisticians. They can fire their missiles quite a long ways. If you see they’re usin! a weapon called an arrowspate, move your fliers out of there, before their wings get clipped! Also, ballisticians have a weapon called the thunderbolt, which is particularly effective against other ballisticians.

Anna: Not everybody fighting for Grust is a bad apple, you know. Take my sweetheart, Jake. He’s got a heart of gold, that one. If you see him, tell him Anna’s worried sick about him. ’Course, my Jake won’t talk to no-one but the most beautiful of women! That’s just the way he is.

Anna: I hope this warring is over and done with soon. And I hope my Jake is well.

Anna: Jake! What are you doing back?...Oh, so you've decided to fight for the Archanean League now?...No, no, I won't stop you. Sure, I wish you'd just stay put for a change, but I know you wouldn't fight unless it were for a fine cause indeed. Go get 'em, honeycomb!

Anna: Go get 'em, Jake!

Ruffian: Heh. Whadda you want? A broken nose?
Marth: I hear you are holding some Archaneans here against their will. Release them at once!
Ruffian: How ’bout I release my fist into yer- Munchin! Manaketes! The Altean army?! Aieee! Get me outta here!!!
Marth: Is everyone all right? I know you’ve been through a lot. Go home to your families.
Marth: Em? What’s wrong, lad? Why don't you go home?
Boy: Because! I have no home to go to.
Marth: You! You’re a girl! Why were you dressed as a boy?
Linde: To hide, sir. My name is Linde. My father is – was – Miloah, a pontifex. I donned men’s garb to escape Gharnef, but no sooner was I away when those ruffians grabbed me.
Marth: So you’re Linde! I’m glad you’re safe. Princess Nyna was worried about you, you know! Well, we’re all together now. I promise to keep you out of danger.
Linde: No! Let me fight. With Princess Nyna’s blessing, and the tome my father left me, I can wield Aura magic. Let me use it to avenge him. I want to destroy Gharnef myself!

Jake: Really? Anna mentioned me? ...In a good way, right?
Caeda: She's very worried about you. She wants to know why such a good man is fighting for the wrong side.
Jake: Wrong side? Hmm... Well, I have to admit, I'm not too keen on kicking Archanea while they're down...
Caeda: They why not fight for Archanea instead? Help us defeat Grust and Dolhr, and set the world right.
Jake: Well...I don't know. I don't think it's that simple... Hmm...
Caeda: Anna would love you for it, I'm sure.
Jake: She would? Hmmm... All right, you win. But I'm doin' it for Anna- " just to be clear!

Linde: Khadein... The school? My father was a student there a long time ago.
Merric: The school is beautiful–was beautiful, until Gharnef took over and changed everything. I was blessed with wonderful teachers, and I found a healthy mix of friends and rivals in the other aspiring mages.
Linde: It sounds nice, I suppose. But my father was the only teacher and friend I ever needed. ......
Merric: I'm sorry, Linde...

Marth: The what?
Jake: The secret shop! Didn’t you know there are secret shops hidden all over the continent? Well, there’s one in Altea, too.
Marth: Oh, really? Where exactly?
Jake: If I told you, it wouldn’t be much of a secret, now would it? The entrance is disguised so you can’t find it.
Marth: Disguised?!
Jake: And they don’t let anybody in without a VIP card. So don’t expect to waltz through the door by accident.
Marth: But how do they stay in business?
Jake: Who knows! Last I heard, they were desperate for customers.
Marth: Then maybe they should reopen as a "tell your friends " shop.
Jake: Ha! Very clever. Anyway, you should drop by when you’re in the neighborhood.

Nyna: Loyal soldiers who fought for their kingdom and their people...Marth, I wish to free them as soon as possible.
Marth: I understand. We should strike now, then, before enemy reinforcements can arrive. I believe we have a good chance.
Nyna: Thank you, Marth. As always, I am counting on you. Worry no more.

@Opening
The Macedon that Minerva and Maria remembered best was one of peace: a quiet, prosperous kingdom famed for the flying beasts favored by dracoknights. But then their brother, Prince Michalis, succumbed to his lust for power. Despite his sisters’ adamant opposition, he swore allegiance to Dolhr; and when Macedon’s Dragoons took flight, the world suffered. Even now that the tides had turned, Michalis took position for one last stand. Dracoknights filled the sky end to end, eager to pluck Marth from the Earth.

@Intro
Michalis: Lord Gotoh, the League has begun its attack. I wish for you to move someplace safe until the fighting has ended.
Gotoh: Why not just end this folly now, Michalis?
Michalis: Folly? What folly?
Gotoh: You loved your younger sister so much. It pains me to see you quarrel. If you and Minerva had worked as one, Macedon might have become a great kingdom- greater even than Archanea, perhaps. But instead, you let Gharnef trick you into destroying your family, and your kingdom with it.
Michalis: ...I cannot undo what is done. My father’s blood will always be on my hands, just as Minerva’s betrayal of her brother and country will be on hers. And Macedon has not been destroyed, not yet. So long as I carry Iote's Shield, the League’s arrows cannot fell me.
Gotoh: Very well. And if you win? What then?
Michalis: If I win, I will tell you. Right now, my only goal is to gut that Altean prince who leads the League. My pride as Macedonian king rests upon it.
Gotoh: I see... Then we’ve nothing more to discuss, have we?
Gotoh: The weight of his father’s murder threatens to crush him... Poor boy...Poor fool.

@Visit 
Old Woman: A great sage lives in the village to the north. He’s not very sociable, though. Hardly anyone ever sees him.

Gotoh: Marth, Marth, why did you not heed me? Why did you not bring the two orbs? Without them, I cannot make Starlight for you. You will not be able to break through Gharnef’s Imhullu magic, not take Falchion from his clutches. Without Anri’s sword, your battle with Medeus will be fraught with peril. If you still mean to face him, you will need all the strength you can muster, every advantage you can find. If you have weapons like the sword Mercurius or the lance Gradivus, the fight may not be lost... Hmm... I, too, may be able to help in some other way. Let me think on it. Regardless, your quest has just become more difficult than you realize. I hope you are ready.

Gotoh: You have the Lightsphere and Starsphere with you? Well done! Now I can create Starlight for you.
Gotoh: ...There. It is finished. Take this with you; it is the only magic capable of breaking through Imhullu. Use it to stop that fiend Gharnef once and for all.

@Boss
Michalis: Made it this far, have you? Don’t gloat yet. My Dragoons and I still rule these skies!

%Minerva,Michalis
Michalis: Minerva, I have missed you, Sister. Let us embrace one last time.
Minerva: Michalis...
Michalis: Well? Strike! A moment’s hesitation spells death on the battlefield. I know I taught you better.
Minerva: You will not lay down your lance and walk the right path?
Michalis: Don’t be a child. There are no right paths; just mine and yours, two that will never cross.
Minerva: Very well. Then you leave me no choice. Embrace you I shall, Brother!

%Maria,Michalis
Michalis: M-Maria? What are you doing here?

%Catria,Michalis 
Michalis: The Whitewings? Ha! Come to try and slay your king?

%Palla,Michalis 
Michalis: The Whitewings? Ha! Come to try and slay your king?

%Est,Michalis 
Michalis: The Whitewings? Ha! Come to try and slay your king?

%Marth,Michalis 
Michalis: I’ve been waiting for you, Altean whelp. I swear on my crown, you will die!

Michalis: Aaagh! I am finished. Forgive me, my people.

@End 
Marth: First General Camus of Grust... Now Prince Michalis of Macedon. Men of such promise... Had the times been different, the two might have led illustrious lives.
Malledus: Yes, Prince Michalis was a brilliant man with great things ahead of him. But in the end, the rashness of youth did him in.
Marth: Only because Gharnef found his weakness and exploited it. Until we stop that fiend, this spiral of misery will never cease.
Malledus: Then shall we go to Thabes? Lord Gotoh said the city lies someplace far to the north of Khadein.
Marth: Yes, in the heart of the desert...
Malledus: Thabes is an old city... None in recent memory have gone there and returned alive. Within its walls remain many powerful apparatus crafted of long-forgotten magic. Lord Gotoh believes Gharnef is harnessing their power, and that is why he wields such influence over the continent.
Marth: And he has Imhullu as well... This will be a struggle.
Marth: Still, Gharnef’s reign must end. The world was so much more beautiful before he painted it red...
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Khadein, city of magic. Ever since Gharnef named himself ruler of this mecca for the magically inclined, the sands surrounding it had run red. Many knights had tried to oust Gharnef, but what defense did they have against the mages the fiend had bent to his purpose? One by one the heroes fell to blades unseen and fires within their armor; and it was not long at all before Khadein's wickedness outstripped its wisdom.

@Intro 
Gharnef: What? The dregs of Archanea have come to challenge my kingdom? Ha ha ha... Really, do they think people have not tried before? So long as I possess this Imhullu magic, they cannot snuff my life out. No one can. As for the White Sage... He will trouble me no longer. With the dragon-goddess right where I want her, in the Fane of Raman, there is no way for Gotoh's Starlight to disperse the shadows that guard me.

@Visit 
Young Man: Fight Gharnef? Are you mad? You'll never stop him! His magic, Imhullu, summons up foul spirits that protect him! Only the White Sage Gotoh's magic can undo him: the magic of Starli- Whoa, there. I need to hold my tongue! He might be listenin' with those wizard-ears of his, for all I know. Go on, work a little magic yourself and disappear, huh? Shoo!

Young Man: You think those clothes o'metal will protect you from mages? Ha! Armor won't save you. You need a Barrier staff! Another thing, about Gharnef- here, move in closer in case he's listenin'. You don't want to fight him head on. He never stays put in Khadein for very long anyway. If he tries to attack you, ride it out. Good things come to those who wait.

@Boss 
Gharnef: You dare oppose me, fool? You must not value your life. Cower before the might of the magic Imhullu: once forbidden, now unleashed!

@Battle 
Gharnef: Altean prince! I fear you are not quite imposing enough to warrant my staying here. But if it's Falchion you want, come and take it. I shall be waiting at the Temple of Thabes.

@End 
Marth: No Falchion...The battle was for naught.
Gotoh: ...Marth...Prince Marth.
Marth: Huh? Who are you?!
Gotoh: My name is Gotoh...I am speaking to you from Macedon through magic.
Marth: Gotoh...the White Sage?
Gotoh: Some have used that name, yes. You must listen to me. As you suspect, Gharnef has made off with Falchion. With Imhullu and Falchion in the sorcerer's grasp, Dolhr now must think twice before challenging him. Gharnef knows this. And one day, he plans to conquer Dolhr and rule the entire world.
Marth: Is Imhullu so powerful a magic, then?
Gotoh: Yes. The mage who wields it cannot be killed; cannot be so much as scratched. I was the magic's guardian once. Knowing its forbidden power could work terrible evils, so I kept it close. But Gharnef, one of my two pupils- Miloah being the other- took the forbidden tome and vanished. Now you are paying for my carelessness. Forgive me. I wish to make amends by teaching you the only way to undo Imhullu's power.
Marth: Which is...?
Gotoh: It is called Starlight. One blast is enough to break through Imhullu's shadowy protection. But to cast the magic, you need two orbs: the Lightsphere and the Starsphere. Heed me, Marth. When you find the Lightsphere and Starsphere, bring them to me. Then I will give you the magic you seek. Then you will have Starlight, and with it, Gharnef's reign will end.

@Opening 
After taking back the palace, the League rode across Akaneia, freeing the greater part of the kingdom as they went- all except the west. A landed knight there named Horace, who had betrayed Akaneia, to join Doluna, continued to stubbornly hold out against Marth’s forces. Nyna could not fathom why such a fiercely loyal knight would turn to treachery, but with her other knights calling for Horace’s blood, she had no choice but to give in and ask Marth to bring the traitor to justice.

@Intro 
Dejanira: Have you heard, Horace? I am told the rebels just recaptured the palace. That accursed Akaneian wench! Never mind Camus’s pleas. We should have put her to the sword with the rest of them...
Horace: ...
Dejanira: Hm, something bothering you, now? Don’t tell me you are toying with the idea of rejoining your motherland? Because if you do, I think you know exactly what will befall your people.
Horace: Yes, you’ve made it quite clear! I am an Akaneian knight no longer. I knew this day would come when I gave me lance to Doluna. I will not flinch.
Dejanira: Good. Then gather your soldiers and kill these rebels before they cause any more trouble.

@Battle 
Enemy Soldier: Lord Horace, our soldiers are in position.
Horace: Good.
Enemy Soldier: Shall we advance on the enemy?
Horace: ...No. That won’t be necessary. We’ll lure them in close, then strike. No one attacks unless the enemy makes a move first. Is that clear?

Marth: Lord Horace! I am Marth of Altea. I ask that you lay down your arms....
Horace: Is Princess Nyna safe?
Marth: She is- and she’s quite worried about you, sir.
Horace: So Her Highness is alive... The soldiers who died protecting her can rest in peace. ...Now then, Prince Marth. Draw your sword.
Marth: What? But...Lord Horace!
Horace:I chose to betray Akaneia, and now I must abide by that choice. Princess Nyna has returned to the palace, and Akaneia is restored. I have no regrets.

@Visit 
Old Man: Lord Horace, who rules this land, used to be a knight of Akaneia. After the palace fell, though, he bent his knee to the Dolunian emperor and has been servin’ him ever since. For that, folks call him a traitor and say he tarnished his knightly brethren’s reputation. Well, that’s a load of hogwash. He broke his knightly oaths to protect us! Not ’cause he’s some traitor. Please, sire, you have to help clear his name. Here...Lord Horace’s father, bless him, gave me this weapon as a gift long ago. I know he’d be glad to see it used to restore his son’s honor.

Young Woman:  Are you with the League? Please, sir, I’m beggin’ ya...You have to help Lord Horace. He’s always looked out for us small folk, before and after he inherited the land. He’s a pillar of strength, he is. We’d be dead if he hadn’t made the tough choices he did. The least we can do is rescue him from his plight now. Here, I’ve got this magic tome one of our villagers found after the last battle on our soil. You take it, and find some way to save him. Promise!

Horace: Bravo, Prince Marth. I yield. Spare the lives of my soldiers and treat my people kindly, and you may do with me as you see fit.
Villager: No! Wait, please! Lord Horace is a good man! Doluna threatened him, said they’d raze the land corner to corner if he didn’t comply. So you see-
Horace: Hush! You’ve said enough.
Marth: But, Lord Horace...
Horace:I betrayed my fellow knights and besmirched their good name. I will not dress up my sins as kindnesses! I accept my punishment. Allow me to die a knight’s death.
Nyna:I will not!
Horace: .....! Princess Nyna?
Nyna: Horace. I heard what you said. And you have it quite right. Your crimes deserve death, or worse.
Marth: Nyna, what are you-
Nyna: But I shall give you no knight’s death. I shall give you a traitor’s life. You say you will not dress up your sins. I say you will not run from them either.
Horace: Your Highness...! Are you saying you wish me to live?
Nyna: You did all in your power to protect these people. That was honorable, Horace. But if you die today, no one will remember you for anything but your one act of betrayal. Your soldiers will have to bear that shame in your stead. Do you call that justice?
Horace: .....
Nyna: Starting today, you shall prove to the world there was value in your actions. Show us a traitor’s worth. Show us what the soldiers who fought and died for you saw to be true.
Horace: I... I do not know what to say.
Nyna:I have claimed your life, Horace. You have no say. You shall fight for us...and you shall not die. I forbid it.
Horace: Heh... Very well, Your Highness. As you command...

Marth: Nyna, we have put down the western insurgence.
Nyna: And Horace?
Marth:I am sorry...
Nyna: Poor Horace. Marth, in his heart, I do not think he truly wished to betray Akaneia.
Marth: Nor I. Doluna must have threatened to do harm to his people.
Marth: So Horace capitulated, to keep them safe... He acted to save lives, yet the world will brand him a traitor. That one word will come to define him... and none will ever know the traitor’s worth.

@Opening 
The holy kingdom of Archanea had come into being six centuries earlier, when the region's numerous city-states were unified under one monarch. The first king, Adrah, had fought valiantly to accomplish this, wielding the three weapons he came to call his regalia- gifts from the gods, some said. The kingdom Adrah forged was pronounced holy; its kings were esteemed. With Archanea's aid, six more independent kingdoms sprang up in their own time. But Archanea was always the greatest - and now, Marth was about to take his first walk through its historic palace's halls.

@Intro 
Midia: Bishop, what do you make of this? I hear shouting in the corridors.
Boah: Hmm...Princess Nyna must have returned with an army in tow.
Midia: An army?! Really? Then we are saved!
Boah: Saved, perhaps...or doomed. Surely the enemy realizes we are more trouble alive than dead now.
Midia: You do not take my meaning, Bishop. By "we" I mean Archanea. Archanea is saved. If Princess Nyna has truly come to chase the enemy from our halls, to free us...Then my death will have meaning.
Boah: Ho ho...I admire your spirit, child. I always have. But think how Astram would grieve if you were to die.
Midia: I...I had hoped to see him one last time- to say goodbye. That alone I regret.
Boah: Ah, but you have not died yet. Midia. Hang on to hope.

Marth: I could not have done it alone, Nyna. The whole Archanean League fought tooth and nail this day.
Nyna: True, and yet all the same... I have little doubt your exploits are the ones that will live on in song. I have a gift for you, to celebrate your achievements here. This bow is called Parthia. It is one of the three regalia that have been passed down through House Archanea. The other two regalia- the sword Mercurius and the lance Gradivus are not here. The enemy took them when they fled. I am sorry. I had hoped to give you all three, and thus aid you in the battles to come....
Marth: Your concern for me is more than enough, Nyna. One day, I will get your family's treasures back and use them to crush Dolhr. I swear it on this emblem of fire!

For Gotoh to create the magic that could defeat Gharnef, he needed two orbs: the Lightsphere and the Starsphere. Marth and company set off to Chiasmir and the Fane of Raman to find them, but in their path stood a cohort of Grustian knights known as the Sable Order. The bridges across the strait would soon be choked with the brave and the dead...

@Intro 
Malledus: Prince Marth, I see them: a cohort of Grustian knights, out on the far side of the bridge. That must be the Sable Order...
Nyna: Marth, I heard the enemy forces have been spotted.
Marth: Yes, that’s right. The Sable Order, it seems
Nyna: Really? Tell me, who leads them?
Marth: Why does it matter?
Nyna: Oh... no, it’s just- they say the Sable Order is led by a brilliant general. I was... wondering if he was riding with them today.
Marth: You must mean General Camus. I am told Dolhr is not very happy with him at the moment, brilliant or not. Something about acting outside orders... They’ll be keeping him on a short leash; I don’t expect we’ll see him here.
Nyna: That... that is good news...

@Visit 
Young Man: You know how the Fane of Raman is supposed to be protected by a fearsome guardian? Well, I heard the “fearsome guardian” is nowt but a wee lass. If that’s true, you have to wonder why she’d stay all by herself in a dreary place like that. Mayhap she broke her ma’s favorite vase and got stuck there as a punishment? Ha ha, right.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Est
Est: Ah, you’re Prince Marth! I am Est, of the Medonian Whitewings- Palla and Catria’s younger sister. I’ve been looking for you. Initially I intended to join up with you along with my sisters, but then I heard Grust had made off with one of Akaneia’s three regalia- the sword Mercurius- so I flew there to get it back. This is Mercurius right here. It’s lovely, isn’t it? And powerful! In the right hands, I think you’ll find it a formidable weapon indeed.

@Battle-Talk
%Est,Catria 
Est: Catria!
Catria: Est! It's about time you made it back. I was so worried...
Est: Sorry... I won't leave you like that again. We belong together anyway. When the three of us surround an enemy, we're just about unstoppable!
Catria: True... but even so, I like having you somewhere I can keep an eye on you. Ha ha.
Est: Hey! What's that supposed to mean?

%Palla,Est 
Est: Hey, Palla. I'm not slowing you and Catria down, am I?
Palla: Why would you say that?
Est: I don't know... You and she have so much more experience. Sometimes I... I just feel like I'm not pulling my load.
Palla: Ha ha... Est... You're doing just fine. There are no half-Whitewings or almost-Whitewings. You're one of us because you're every bit as good as us. Have a little confidence.
Est: Right, confidence...
Palla: ...Feel better?
Est: Uh-huh. Thanks, Palla. It's funny... Whenever I talk to you, I calm right down. Promise you'll always be there for me, Palla.
Palla: I will... I promise.

%Minerva,Est 
Est: Commander, did anybody tell you? I flew all the way to Grust and brought back Mercurius. Pretty spiffy, huh?
Minerva: Yes, Marth told me all about it. Very brave of you to undertake such a dangerous task alone. Well done, Est.
Est: Hee hee! You mean it? Thanks, Commander! You should have seen the arrows whooshing past me left and right! But I'm a Whitewing, right? So I swooped down and let 'em have it! Just watch, though. I'll find some way to top it.
Minerva: I don't doubt it. I expect great things from you, Est.
Est: Hee hee! You mean it?

@Boss 
Sternlin: You shall not pass! Not today! Not ever!

Sternlin: You... shall... not... unnh...

@End 
Nyna: We’ve made it across the strait.
Marth: Yes. But the real battle may yet be ahead of us.
Marth: Malledus... Can we be certain the Lightsphere and the Starsphere are in the Fane of Raman?
Malledus: Yes, sire; but unfortunately, they may not be all we find. The fane is said to be guarded by a goddess, one with fearsome powers. Those who defile her sanctuary are punished by fire; none are spared from the blaze.
Nyna: Perhaps we should reconsider, Marth...
Marth: Perhaps... But if none are spared from the blaze, where do the rumors come from? Besides, we need those two orbs.
Malledus: Well, might I suggest you take in just a few able companions, and let the sleeping dragons lie?
Marth: Sage advice. I’ve no desire to tear apart a holy place, whether the goddess is home or not... I’ll choose a handful of elite to search for the orbs with me.

@Opening 
With the aid of the White Sage Gotoh’s powerful Warp magic, Marth and company were transported to the faraway city of Thabes. Once, Thabes was an advanced civilization; but only its decay advanced now. The League traced the lifeless streets to the temple at the city’s heart, somewhere within its walls Gharnef was waiting, and now, Marth must wrest Falchion and his sister, Elice, from the fiend’s grip.

@Intro 
Marth: The Temple of Thabes... He’s here... somewhere...
???: Heh heh heh... Come to play, little Marth?
Gharnef: ‘Tis I, Gharnef. I have been waiting for you.
Marth: Waiting?
Gharnef: Oh yes. For you to dance around the continent, collecting powerful weapons and killing off my competition. Thanks to you, Camus and Michalis will trouble me no more. You have my gratitude, diligent prince.
Marth: You... monster!
Gharnef: Tsk, tsk, don’t spoil the moment, now. You’re about to do me one last favor... Die, Prince. Heh heh heh!
Marth: That’s what you think. I have something else in mind.
Gharnef: Heh, is that a threat? If you mean to harm me, first you’ll have to find me, boy.
Marth: And what is that supposed to mean?
Malledus: My prince! Several sorcerers have been sighted throughout the temple! They’re... They all seem to be Gharnef, sire!
Gharnef: Heh heh! Fight, boy, fight! Wear yourself thin fighting puppets and shadows! But the only way you’ll claim Falchion is by defeating the real me. Heh heh, ha ha ha ha!

@Battle 
Malledus: Sire, we’ve pinpointed where Gharnef is keeping the magical apparatus that gives him his power.
Marth: Where?
Malledus: The Tower of Thabes atop this very temple.
Marth: Then we don’t need to fight Gharnef... If we find those apparatus.
Malledus: Gharnef’s power- a great deal of power- will be sealed forever.
Marth: Then let’s hurry and seize the entrance to the tower!
Malledus: A word of caution, sir. Stopping the apparatus will not undo Imhullu power- only Gharnef’s. He still has Falchion in his keeping; if you want the blade back, you must defeat him now, before seizing the tower.

@Boss 
Gharnef: Heh heh heh... You dare challenge me, fool? You must not value your life. Cower before the might of the dark magic Imhullu!

Gharnef: Agh! What... Where did you get...Starlight...? Still, you are a fool...Your power is not enough to defeat Medeus... I shall be waiting in the pits of the inferno... for when he sends you to join me... Heh heh, ha ha ha!

@End 
Marth: Malledus! Quickly! Find the apparatus and shut them down!
Malledus: Right away, sire!
Gharnef: ...Blast! How... how did they find the apparatus? All my power... Still, they are fools if they think they can defeat Medeus with such cheap tricks... Heh heh, ha ha ha!
Malledus: Gharnef is getting away, sire! Shall we give chase?
Marth: No... let him go. Without his magical apparatus, he has no power left to abuse.
Allied Solider: Sire! We found Princess Elice up in the Tower of Thabes! She’s on her way to see you right- Ah, here she is!
Marth: Elice!!!
Elice: Marth! Oh look at you. A man grown!
Marth: Sister, I was so worried. None had seen you since the castle fell. I... I feared the worst.
Elice: I was prepared for the worst, if that was what it took to ensure your safety. But they did not kill me. Gharnef spared my life.
Marth: Why would he spare you?
Elice: Marth, have you heard of the staff of Aum?
Marth: The staff that brings back the dead? It was lost to the world long ago, or so the legend goes.
Elice: Yes, but Gharnef found it... in the Resurrectory.
Marth: The Resurrectory? What was it doing in a temple in the middle of Dolhr?
Elice: I could not say. But that was why Gharnef kept me alive: he wished me to wield it. The staff of Aum’s power can only be channeled by women of royal blood. Marth, you are going to Dolhr, are you not?
Marth: Yes. I must settle things with Medeus.
Elice: Then take me to the Resurrectory along the way to claim the staff. Aum works but once, but I will use it to revive a lost comrade.

@Opening 
Grust would harry the League no more. Marth led his forces on to Macedon. However, Macedon’s Dragoons were ready to waylay them at the border; countless reinforcements hovered within the fortresses, waiting to strike...Would Marth be able to lead the League safely through the gauntlet?

@Intro
Marth: Princess Minerva, we will soon reach the Macedonian border. Are you certain you wish to join the battle? If you’ve any reservations about fighting your own countrymen-
Minerva: If I did, Prince Marth, I would not have offered you my axe.
Marth: But surely-
Minerva: You have the wrong idea. Perhaps you think I wish to spare my brother and former vassals, forgive them for seeing things differently?
Marth: ...Don’t you?
Minerva: I would be lying if I said I did not wish it were that simple. But history needs to remember that when Macedon went astray, it was a Macedonian who set things right.
Marth: Even if it means your own brother may die?
Minerva: Since I was little, I followed in Michalis’s footsteps. Whatever books he read, I read; whenever he practiced the sword, I was close by, watching, learning... He was always a step ahead: my hero, something to aspire to. Even now, some part of me loves him. ...I love him enough to spare him death on some stranger’s sword, you see? Let him be punished by my hands.

@Boss
Orridyon: Rebels! You have strutted into the wrong kingdom this time!
Orridyon: Nngh! I am but a pebble... in Macedon's unshakeable foundation...

@End 
Gotoh: ...Prince Marth...
Marth: That voice! Lord Gotoh, is that you?
Gotoh: I see you have made it to Macedon. You will find me in a village north of the Macedon aerie, their castle. If you possess the Lightsphere and Starsphere, have them in hand when you visit me here. ...Ah, yes. I also have good news. Your sister Elice is unharmed.
Marth: What?! You are certain? Where is she now?
Gotoh: Thabes, city of illusion. Gharnef took her with him when he fled. I pray you rescue her soon.
Marth: I will!
Gotoh: But first, bring me the two orbs. Without Starlight’s mighty blast, Gharnef will only add your life to the list of things he has taken from you.
/***EOF***/
@Opening
Marth and his knights took refuge in a forest near Altea's borders, lying low while they waiting for the right chance to escape the kingdom. Before long, the enemy grew less watchful: the time to slip away had come. Still, the prince could not quell the sadness in his heart for his sister Elice.

@Intro 
Malledus: Prince Marth. ...Sire? Sire! Are you listening?!
Marth: Huh? ...Oh. Malledus.
Malledus: Get ahold of yourself, Sire! I know how you grieve, but the Gra host that pursues us will not be interested. We must keep moving, and with all haste at that.
Marth: I...I'm sorry. These thoughts are hard to put aside.
Malledus: From here, we will cross out of Altea and begin our escape to Talys. I trust you are prepared?
Marth: Talys... I've heard the name. An island kingdom to the east, isn't it?
Malledus: That is correct. The king there was a good friend to your father- and perhaps more importantly, a true friend. It was Princess Elice's wish that you seek refuge in Talys should things ever go awry.
Marth: Me, but not her...
Malledus: I've arranged for a boat to take us from the northeast shore. But to get there, we'll first need to cut through a prison to the north. I managed to come by a key to the premises. Let me hand it over.

Malledus: Now, on the road, you may notice people who seem to be fighting for Gra against their own wishes. Before you resort to your blade, you should try talking to them first.

@Visit 
Young Man: Boy, I don’t envy you! The enemy horde is closing in on you faster’n a bolt of Thoron. You and your friends had better hightail it on outta here!
Old Man: Sometimes victory on a battlefield requires that someone you care about make a sacrifice. But parting with one comrade may be the only way to meet another. You need to accept your losses in life and move forward.

Woman: My word! Aren’t you–No, you cannot stay here! Run! Before their soldiers come back! Here, this is the bow my granddaughter always used. Take it, sire! Please, promise you’ll stay safe...

@Battle
Captain: Enemies south of the prison?
Soldier: Yes, sir. Not many of 'em, but the scouts say they're a tough bunch all the same. And guess who's with 'em...
Captain: ...You're saying the prince is coming this way?
Soldier: Yes, sir. How ought we proceed? The main force ‘as yet to arrive, and- to be honest, sir- we need 'em.
Captain: Bah! You're cowed too easily. We can win...if we set a trap.
Soldier: Er...a trap, sir?
Captain: The prince of Altea will be ours. Just do as I tell you, and we'll pluck this royal plum long before the main force can show up to steal all the glory. Heh...

Ruffian: You! Inside!
Gordin: Grrrmph...
Ruffian: Heh. I thought Altea was the great ‘ero Anri's kingdom! Didn't take more'n a couple of days to break you, now did it, Gaggles?
Gordin: Mmph! Arrumph!
Ruffian: What's the matter, Gaggles? Can't talk cause you're gagged, Gaggles? Ba ha ha! I'll letcha in on a little secret. Altea's little princeling is on ‘is way ‘ere right this moment.
Gordin: .....!
Ruffian: Ooh, but sad for you, you look awful dangerous in the uniform... MISTER GRA SOLDIER! Ha! Soon as the prince sees you, ‘e'll say, Yow! It's an enemy ambush!-And that'll be the end of you.
Gordin: Gugrrrmph!
Ruffian: Once the prince sticks you like a pig, we get to call him Marth the Tyrant, coz ‘e kills ‘is own countrymen.
Ruffian: Won't that be an ‘oot!
Gordin: Rrrmph.
Ruffian: So long, Gaggles! Better start praying to your ‘igher deity of choice! 

Jiol: Listen, men. Your target is the prince. Find the prince of Altea and bring me his head served on a shield!
Marth: Look there!
Malledus: No...Anri save us...Of all the places to be beset! Sire, that is Gra's main force- and they are accompanied by the knights of Grust's Sable Order. Our chances of routing them are slim, I'm afraid, and those of slipping away undetected afterward, all but nil...
Marth: Then we've no hope?
Malledus: I...I can think of one strategy. We could leave a decoy behind for when the enemy catches up.
Marth: A decoy?
Malledus: It's you they're after, sire. Were one of your men to stay behind disguised as you...Well, the enemy ought to take the bait. That would give you, and the others time to escape.
Malledus: One of your men must make for that fortress on the south highroad. He will act as a decoy by dressing as you and luring the enemy force away.
Marth: But Malledus, how will he find his way back to us?
Malledus: Sire...He may not. You must part with one of your comrades. There is no other way.
Marth: ...Well, I will find a way! You cannot expect me to agree to...to abandon one of our own to a death at the hands of the enemy. Surely there must be another way...
Malledus: Forgive me, sire...But this is our only chance. You know as well as I do that you must not die here today.

Malledus: No, sire! Get back here! One of your other men must take that position!

Enemy Soldier 1: Look! It's...it's Prince Marth!
Enemy Soldier 2: Oh yeah? Who's that, then? That bloke over there is dressed in the same clothes. Could be either of 'em.
Jiol: Simpletons! Use your heads! One of them ran; the other didn't. What does that tell you? Easy! The one who stayed behind is trying to buy time for the one who fled.
Enemy Solider: So, er...the one who took off is-
Jiol: The real prince, you idiot, yes! Hie, troops, after him! Put that craven whip to the sword!
Marth: Wait! Quickly, Malledus, we must head south and rescue him!
Malledus: No, sire. We have to press on.
Marth: Press on? (Insert name) might be dying back there!
Malledus: If he were, then why would you be so selfish as to let him die in vain? Honor him, by allowing his life and his choice to mean something!
Marth: ......
Marth: ...All right.
Marth: I will honor him. ...I will go.
Captain: The prince fled south? Bah! Seems the plum's fallen too far from our tree... No matter. Open the north door! We can still crush the Altean rabble he left behind...

Marth: Blast! That archer was on our side!
Captain: They killed the captive? Heh heh... What fools! Hie, let's give them the punishment fools deserve! Open the north door! Lure them out and strike them down!

Captain: All but the prince have been slain? Good. Open the north door! The little whelp is ours now!

Malledus: Sire, there is a village over yonder. Its residents may be willing to help. Why don't you try paying them a visit?

Draug: Prince Marth! Make haste, sire!
Marth: Draug, is that you? What are you doing here?
Norne: Draug, sir! The enemy has crossed the border from the west! They’ll be upon us soon!
Draug: Right, we’re on our way. Sire, this is Norne. She heard wind of our struggles and wishes to fight for Altea.
Norne: Prince Marth, ’tis an honor. By your leave, though, I’ll be savin' the curtsy-bobbin' for later. Quickly, sire!

Jiol: This is...the wrong prince? No! You dare make a fool of me? Kill him! Make this faux prince SUFFER!

Gordin: Gordin, sire! My name is Gordin. The enemy captured me and left me in this mortifying state.
Marth: I see. Well, I'm glad you're unharmed. But I'm afraid we cannot stay here a moment longer. Stay behind me and-
Gordin: I can fight, sire! If you have a bow I could use, I would be honored to fight at your side.

Jagen: Heh, these old bones are still good for something. Farewell, my prince. Live, and grow strong...

Gordin: I was dead anyway till you came, sir... If I'm to die again, at least let me die for you. Fortune protect you sire...

And so Marth and his knights left Altea, heavy of heart and bleary of eye...

Jagen: Look, sire. See how Altea shrinks on the horizon...
Marth: ..aven...
Jagen: I beg your pardon?
Marth: I am a craven. Powerless to save my sister, to staunch my kingdom's wounds; to ease my people's fears...
Jagen: This...was your only recourse, sire. But surely, one day, you will be able to set things right...
Marth: "Surely"? Why do words of such conviction smack so much of uncertainty when spoken? Not surely, Jagen. Assuredly. Gra will pay for their acts. Today, though, allow me to wallow in this pain, to feel every awful twist of it. I never want to forget.
Jagen: Sire...
Marth: I will return, Altea! Your prince will return to you one day!

@Opening
Long ago, Medeus, king of the dragonkin, conquered the continent of Archanea, beginning an age of fear and despair for all its people. That tyranny was broken, however, when an unlikely hero intervened. A young man hailing from the Altea region appeared with a divine blade in hand. He stood against the Shadow Dragon, and struck him down. For some time after, the land enjoyed an age of peace. However, after a century's passing, the Shadow Dragon returned. He forged an alliance with a fiendish sorcerer who sought to rule the world, and their combined might toppled kingdom upon unsuspecting kingdom.
Again, darkness threatened to engulf the continent. It fell upon the king of Altea, sole descendant of the dragon-slayer hero, to 'sally forth with the divine blade and fulfill his blood destiny.
His son, Prince Marth, remained at home with the boy's mother, his elder sister, and a garrison manned by Altea's neighbor and ally, Gra. Thus the boy applied himself to the ways of both pen and sword, until one day...
But he was betrayed by his closest ally, Gra- and both king and kingdom fell. Altea's prince, Marth, escaped the castle and found refuge on the isle of Talys, but at a dear cost: his sister stayed behind to buy his freedom."

@Intro
Soldier: Prince Marth... Are you awake? Beggin' your pardon, sire, but the princess has asked to see you.
Marth: Elice? Is she all right?"
Soldier: She seemed to be, sire, but her words implied a certain urgency. She bade you dress quickly and wait by the throne.
Marth: ...Has something happened?
Soldier: It's our forces off in Gra, sire. There seems to 'ave been some sort of incident, but... Well, I'm not privy to the specifics.
Marth: I see... Thank you. I'll be there shortly.
Marth: My sister said she would meet me by the throne.
Marth: An incident in Gra... If Elice had news of our father, I pray it's good news...

@Battle
Enemy Soldier: O'er there, that's him! Prince Marth!
Marth: Wha- Who are you?!
Enemy Soldier: We're soldiers of Gra, li'l prince. And if you know what's good for you, you'll surrender to us without makin' any trouble.
Marth: Surrender? But that's ridiculous... Why would I surrender to the army of an allied kingdom?
Enemy Soldier: "Meh heh heh... They don't tell you much, do they? No matter." You'll ‘ave the full story soon enough. Now...lay down your sword.
Marth: I will not. I am the prince of Altea. I will not yield to you or any other nation, here on my own land, under my own castle roof!
Enemy Soldier: Heh, you talk big, brat. Have it your way. If you won't lay down your sword, then we'll just have to take your life instead!
Enemy Soldier: What? He is fighting back? I'll show him!
Marth: No! The throne... I have to get rid of him before my sister arrives!

@End
Elice: Marth, are you all right?
Marth: Sister, what is happening?
Elice: Steady yourself, Marth. I have grave news. Our father was defeated by the Dolhr-Grust allied forces.
Marth: What? No...
Elice: It was Gra. Our own ally betrayed us and struck Father's army from the rear. I am... I am not sure if he is safe. The scouts who returned gave conflicting reports...
Marth: Father...It can't be...
Elice: As we speak, soldiers sent by Gra are trying to take the castle. Mother and I were separated during the escape. I do not know where she is.
Marth: .....
Elice: Marth, I need you to listen to me. You must flee the castle. Go on without me.
Marth: What?
Elice: We've not many soldiers left...This is hard to bear, I know, but the castle is lost. We must face that. I will look for Mother and join you as soon as I can. You find Jagen and get away from here- far away. Understand?
Marth: ...All right. But promise you won't be long.
Elice: "Goodbye, Marth. May you live long...

Grust had caught the League unawares, forcing them to flee to Pyrathi. But the kingdom of Pyrathi seldom made contact with the outside world, and their king, Mannu, was wroth when he heard of the League's unexpected visit. There were whispers Mannu was a dragonkin- rumors soon to be proved true.

Thankfully, they’re not half as bright as they are strong, and I managed to slip away when they were not looking. I heard you were on your way to Pyrathi, and that Princess Nyna was with you, so I came here to offer my help. Let me fight with you to save my land, and I will use this silver bow to show you marksmanship unlike any you’ve ever seen.

Will you rescue Princess Maria from their clutches, that my Whitewing sisters and I might join in your fight?

@Opening 
Trace a line around the continent’s north-eastern plains, and you have Aurelis. This kingdom alone had somehow resisted Dolhr’s attempts to conquer it, but only by some miracle. By the time Marth arrived in Aurelis, much of its territory had already been carved up by Dolhr’s ally Macedon. Still, the king’s younger brother, Hardin, refused to give up without a fight. The people called him Coyote, and he intended to live up to the name. Since its founding, Aurelis and the holy kingdom of Archanea shared close ties and months ago Princess Nyna of Archanea had come to Hardin’s aid. By his side, she had called on the people to fight- but few remained to answer. Macedon’s finest soldiers were closing in. Nyna knew they were out of time...

@Intro 
Hardin: Princess Nyna, I’ve spotted them! The Altean army is on the far side of the river.
Nyna: They’re here? At last! Prince Marth has come for us!
Hardin: So it seems. Now, what say you we turn this battle around? I’m going to take my men east to join our might with Marth’s. Together we will retake the castle. Stay here, my lady, and wait for the good news.

Old man: A castle like ours must be chock full o’ royal treasure! Ah, but only a thief could get inside chests locked that tight...

Young man: Word has it that the enemy is mustering its forces in the fortresses nearby. You’d better hurry and send units to bar their exits.

Young man: Well g’day, there, son! ...Why the wide-eyed stare? Ain’cha never seen a country village before? You know, speakin’ o’ rare sights, I once went to Pyrathi, where I saw me a real live Manakete! Cripes, let me tell you what a shock THAT was! In a blink, this regular old feller turned into an enormous dragon! I mean, I ain’t stupid. I’d heard of the dragonkin before. I’d just always assumed Manaketes looked somethin’ like parakeets. Sheesh... ...What? Oh, this? I picked this stone up while I was there. Dunno what it is, but how often do you spy a glowin’ red rock, ya know what I’m sayin’ But honestly, it’s been kinda creepin’ me out lately. You want it? Go on ‘n’ take it. Sheesh...

Wendell: Well, hello, Merric! What a surprise! Good to see you haven’s blown yourself up yet.
Merric: Not yet, sir. But I did find Prince Marth, just like I said I would. I’ve joined the Altean army in the fight against Dolhr. ...Why are you here, Teacher?
Wendell: Hmm... It’s Khadein, lad. The land is not as you remember it. That fiend Gharnef seized power, and now he’s draped the city in darkness. I fear Khadein is doomed... I could not stay and serve him. So, I snuck out alone.
Merric: Very brave of you, sir. Hmm... Why don’t you join us, then? If Gharnef is helping Dolhr, then he’s a bitter enemy of ours as much as he is to yours and Khadein’s. We couldn’t possibly leave the city in his clutches. And I’m sure the prince would be pleased as pie to have magic as robust as yours in his arsenal.
Wendell: Hmm, you do know how to argue a point. I’ve no taste for war, but war is what I’ve been served. Come, Merric. We’ll fight together. Tell your prince of Altea that Wendell is at his service.

His name is Gharnef, and he and the many mages who swear allegiance to him have allied themselves with Dolhr. Prince Marth, I ask you now: please lend me your help in thwarting his vile ambitions.

Marth: Lord Hardin, I am Marth of Altea. I’ve come to offer what help I can.
Hardin: And I very gratefully accept it. Stories of your exploits travel fast, young prince. I feel as though I’ve gained a thousand allies in one.
Marth: I’ve heard a few stories of you as well, Coyote. It will be an honor to fight alongside such a courageous man.
Hardin: I’ve left Princess Nyna someplace safe for now. We need to decide who will command here. I was hoping it would be you.
Marth: Me? But, Sir Hardin, you are far more qualified-
Hardin: Tsk, Princess Nyna would not be pleased to hear us nitpicking over who will be listed in the history books. Take command, so we can oust this Macedonian scum and be done with it.
Marth: You are sure?
Hardin: Make no mistake. Lord Marth. I consider myself an exceptionally good judge of character. If I thought you acted out of selfishness or ambition, I would not extend the offer I have. You have my trust.
Marth: Lord Hardin, thank you. That is an honor. If you don’t mind me saying so... I feel as though I’ve made a good friend. We share the same ideals, I think.
Hardin: That we do. May our friendship be a long one.

@End 
Aurelis King: Prince Marth, your arrival could not have been better timed. Please accept our gratitude. Princess Nyna of Archanea is en route from the fortress. I am sure she will wish to meet you. The battle is not won yet, though: many of the enemy continue to hold out within the castle’s halls. Stay wary.

@Opening
When journeying in from the borderlands, one particular peril would spring to mind: the Samsooth Mountains, whose gashing peaks rose up and divided the peninsula. Since before anyone could remember, the mountains had belonged to bandits, blights on the land whose acts of plunder, kidnapping, and arson knew no bounds. Out of fear, their victims gave these peaks another name: the Ghoul’s Teeth; while the bandits who ruled atop the Teeth’s craggy crowns took a name as well: the Samsooth Sires, or Soothsires...

@Intro
Julian: Hey, c’mon, Lena, shake a leg! We need to get out of the Teeth, and we need to do it yesterday! Rumor has it the knights of Altea are at the foot of the mountain. We won’t get a better chance. It’s just a little bit farther. Stick with me.
Lena: Julian, I’m sorry...but I left my Mend staff back there. It’s very precious to me...You go on ahead...Save yourself! Here, I could use this Warp staff to send you someplace safe--
Julian: Uh-uh, honey. No can do. I didn’t betray my boys back there so you could zap me on out of here alone. Forget the staff; I’ll come back later and get it for you myself. All right? Right now though, I need you to RUN. Tick-tack, now move that frock!
Navarre: .....

@Visit
Young Man: Take care around mercenaries. They’re quite skillful; if you’re unlucky, they may drop you at stroke.

Teenage Boy: Units with high skill deal more frequent critical hits. Units with high speed have an easier time avoiding enemy attack.

Old Woman: Hunters are stronger than archers, but they also have weaker defenses. Keep them out of close-range combat.

Old Man: Oh, ho ho! Don’t you look young and full of life! Such a warm smile here deserves a nice reward. Here, take this axe—this EVIL abomination of an axe! Beware! Its blade drinks blood and devours flesh. I’d hate to see you come to any harm!”

Marth: ...
Julian: Hm, not explainin’ myself very well, am I? OK OK, what I’m trying to say is--
Marth: Yes. You can come with us.
Julian: Oh... Well... well, good.
Marth: I’m inclined to trust you. If you’ve truly had a change of heart, you deserve the chance to prove it. Show me you’re ready to help people, and then I’ll know I’ve picked a man of character.

Lena: Yes... Thank you.
Marth: These mountains are dangerous. My forces will draw the enemy away; use that time to escape.

Marth: But... you... What?
Lena: Please, sire. I am a cleric. I cannot bear to watch others come to harm when I have the power to help.

@Opening 
It was General Ordwin, one of the Three Heroes of the War of Liberation, who put Grust on the map. His peerless knights tamed their neighbors the barbarians in the kingdom’s infancy, securing its place as one of the greatest of the Seven Kingdoms. However, the current king, Ludwik, was weak-willed and easily cowed: Dolhr had little trouble forcing him into an alliance. Now he had taken ill, even as Grust suffered its string of defeats at the hand of the League. The once mighty kingdom was poised to fall...

@Intro
Marth: Nyna, we’ll soon be launching the attack. If you have something to tell me... now is the time to do it.
Nyna: All right, Marth. As you wish. When the Dolhr-Grust allied forces seized control of Archanea, the entire royal family was killed, save me. I was given into Grust’s custody- the custody of the Sable Order, to be more specific. I am told Dolhr wished for my execution- and with it the end of the holy lineage of House Archanea- and Grust was willing to comply.
Marth: But you are not dead.
Nyna: That is right. I was not put to the sword. The Sable Order’s captain came to my defense. His name... was Camus.
Marth: ....!
Nyna: Camus protected me, knowing he risked incurring the wrath of the Shadow Dragon. He was the one who eventually arranged for my escape to Aurelis.
Marth: ...I had no idea. That certainly explains Dolhr’s displeasure with him.
Nyna: I hated him, too, at first. But in time, I found my hatred tempered by the compassion he showed me, my feelings... changed. And now, all I wish is to see him again... But not if it means you and he must fight.
Marth: Nyna... Do you... I cannot make any promises. But I will do what I can. I hope you can accept that.
Nyna: Thank you, Marth. I could not ask for more.

@Visit 
Old Man: Ah, Prince Marth! Welcome, welcome. Tell me, have you seen my granddaughter Lena? Is she well? If she happens to you, would you see she gets this Hammerne staff? It’s a staff of repairing passed down through our family. I’m certain she’ll make good use of it. Of course, not all items can be repaired; be sure to caution her about that.

@Battle 
Marth: General Camus! Can you hear me? It is I, Marth of Altea! I must speak with you! Please, show yourself!
Camus: Prince Marth. I am Camus of Grust.
Marth: General, I have no wish to fight you. You know this battle is pointless; surely you must!
Camus: So long as Grust continues to support Dolhr’s ambitions, it does not matter what I know or think. I am a knight; I have a duty to fight for my motherland’s glory till the very end.
Marth: But surely-
Camus: Prince Marth, there is nothing you can do or say. I am party to your father’s murder. Are you a man or not? Draw your sword.
Nyna: Stop! Camus!
Camus: Princess Nyna...
Marth: Nyna, what are you doing here?! This is the middle of the battlefield!
Nyna: I know, I know... But please, Camus, listen to me... Camus, you gave me back my life. And Marth, he gave me back my kingdom. I do not wish to see that the two of you fight. It is... it is unbearable. Please, Camus, fight with us. We need your strength. ...I need it.
Camus: I am sorry, Princess.
Nyna: What? But, Camus!
Camus: Were my heart my master, I would do exactly as you say. But what sort of knight abandons his kingdom- his king!- now, when they need him the most? Would you have me toss away the life I have built as if it meant nothing at all?
Nyna: No, Camus, I... I don’t know...
Camus: I have lived as a knight, and I intend to die as one. There are no other roads left for me to walk. Farewell, my princess. I shall never forget our days together at the palace, few though they were. I pray you meet someone who can bring joy back into your life.

%Caeda,Lorenz
Caeda: General Lorenz! My name is Caeda. I hail from Talys. My father has told me quite a bit about you.
Lorenz: Princess Caeda! My, look what a lovely young woman you’ve grown into. Your father was a good friend to me, many years ago.
Caeda: General, I heard you opposed Grust forming an alliance with Dolhr. Why didn’t you try to stop it?
Lorenz: You think I did not try, Princess? Our king is meek; in the end, Dolhr proved better at cowing him than I did.
Caeda: But sir, surely you know that Dolhr intends to use Manaketes to conquer humankind! You must act now- for Grust’s sake, if not the world’s! Join us, General Lorenz. We can put an end to this battle right now.
Lorenz: Hmm...What you say makes sense enough, but I serve Grust. I cannot simply betray my country.
Caeda: Ah, but what makes a country?
Lorenz: Pardon?
Caeda: Is it one man- your king? Or is it the countless innocent people who make their home here?
Lorenz: Well, that’s- Hmm...
Caeda: My father has a saying: “A kingless country is a country still; but a king without subjects rules naught but hills.” If you disobey your king to ensure his subjects’ safety, how is that a betrayal? You are protecting his reign.
Lorenz: Protecting his reign? ...Aha ha ha, ha ha! Ahh, that mad logic! I feel as though I’ve shed twenty years and I’m talking to your father again. You win, Princess. I yield! I will join you, in the interests of king and country. Har!

%Marth,Lorenz 
Marth: General Lorenz, hold!
Lorenz: What? You are Marth, the Altean prince...
Marth: Yes, sir. The king of Talys told me much about you. He said you opposed Grust forming an alliance with Dolhr, right from the very start.
Lorenz: That’s right.
Marth: Then fight with us! With your help, we can defeat Dolhr!
Lorenz: Forgive me, Prince Marth, but am I to just abandon my country, then?
Marth: ...
Lorenz: I know yours is the just cause. Still, I wish to remain a Grustian general, right to the end. I am fighting here because that is the way for me to honor my kingdom.
Marth: Forgive me, General, but... is it, really?
Lorenz: Pardon?
Marth: Since you are a Grustian General, then surely you fight for Grust’s future first and foremost. But tell me...from where you are standing now, do you see any future for your country?
Lorenz: ...I shall have to learn to mask my misgivings better, if you can pluck them from my heart so easily. You are quite correct. If I care what becomes of Grust, then I cannot continue to stand by Dolhr. So, I will stand by you instead, Prince- and hope the future is a bit easier to spot from there.

@Battle-Talk 
%Marth,Lorenz 
Lorenz: Prince Marth? I am General Lorenz of Grust. I have decided to join you, in the interest of my fellow Grustians.
Marth: I am honored, General. Thank you. Caeda tells me you and her father were close.
Lorenz: Yes. How the princess has grown, though! Sharp as a tack, that one. Such a change from when she was- Now what am I saying? Caeda has always been clever. Even as a wee girl she knew how to wrap her elders about her little finger.
Marth: You knew Caeda when she was little?
Lorenz: Oh, yes. The mischief she got into! Well, those are stories for another day. First, we’ve a battle to finish!

Nyna: No, Marth, I... I should not have made such a selfish request. I am sorry, so terribly sorry...
Marth: ....
Nyna: The worst part, Marth... the worst part is, I knew it would come to this. Ever since I gave you the emblem, I just knew... Have you heard the story of Artemis’s Curse?
Marth: No...
Nyna: The last time the Fire Emblem changed hands to save House Archanea, it was not without cost. There was a princess named Artemis who loved your ancestor, Anri, with all her heart. He loved her as well- but when Medeus appeared, the two were parted forever. She cursed the Fire Emblem- called it the end of war, but also the end of love. Now the emblem has changed hands again, and I am the one who is cursed...

Marth: Nyna...
Nyna: Look at me, so quick to fall apart... You lost loved ones in Altea and took it so bravely; but I cannot be so brave... Please... leave me for a moment. This is too much to bear. I need to... to confront my feelings...
Marth: ...Say no more, Nyna... Princess. I will step out. Send for me if you need anything.
Nyna: Thank you, Marth...
Nyna: Ahh...! Camus, Camus... Ahh... no... Oh, why...

Marth: Nyna- Princess.
Nyna: I am told Camus has not been found. Perhaps he still lives. I know how selfish it is to wish it... But if he cannot be with me, then I must cling to the hope his life has not been cut short. It is all I have left.

@Opening 
The Archanean heroes hurried to Altea, but they would not go unchallenged. Waiting for them at Fort Menedy were Grust's artillery regiment, the dreaded “Wooden Cavalry”. Missiles crashed down, rocking the earth as the enemy ballistae rumbled forward. Had Marth and the League any hope of triumphing over such firepower?

@Intro 
Nyna: Grust's artillery...Our opponent is mighty.
Marth: Nonetheless we must face them head-on; they stand between us and Altea.
Nyna: That hunger for danger worries me, Marth. Humanity's hopes rest on your shoulders. I would sooner not see them crushed.
Marth: Which? Humanity's hopes, or my shoulders? ...Have a little faith, Nyna. The enemy ballisticians can strike from afar, but they're powerless up close. All we need to do is move in and silence them before they do too much damage. Watch!

@Visit
Young Man: Ballisticians are really only vulnerable to one type of weapon: the thunderbolt. Fresh out of thunderbolts? Then you'll just have to dart in and hit ‘em at close range.
Young Woman: We and our countrymen wanted to fight for Archanea, you know. Not just us, neither. They say some of Grust's soldiers would sooner rally under Archanea's banner than Dolhr's. But General Camus conquered us ‘fore we could act, and Grust has had us under their thumb ever since. Here's hopin' you win this battle quick. We like bein' free, don't you know.

@Recruit-Visit
Beck: Prince Marth, I presume? The name's Beck. I fought in the battle at Castle Deil. After my shameful defeat there, see, I took refuge in this village. And when I heard your army was marchin' this way, I readied my ballista, hopin' for another taste of battle. So how 'bout it, princey? Take me along! I'm packin' thunderbolts, see?

Astram: I've a mind to break their fiddle, for all the evils they have wrought.
Midia: Now you can. We can take them together.
Astram: That we can. ...Midia. I am sorry I left you alone. I will not make that mistake again.
Midia: No, you certainly won't. Now that I have you back...you'll find me exceedingly reluctant to let you go.
Astram: Ooh... Yes, I can see that! Just take care you don't crush me instead of Dolhr!

%Astram,Marth 
Astram: You are Prince Marth?
Marth: Correct, Sir Astram.
Astram: ...Forgive my lack of courtesy, but you and I need to be clear on a certain point.
Marth: Oh?
Astram: While I have decided to lend you my sword, my allegiance lies with Princess Nyna-not you, my lord. I will follow your orders, but should I learn you have been false to her, or that you are manipulating her... Heads will roll.
Marth: Well, Sir Astram...in the interest of keeping my head atop my shoulders, let me suggest this: Fight with me. Watch me, and then judge for yourself whether I am worthy of your skill and of your help.
Astram: ...... Hmm, very well. Your orders, then, Lord Marth.

Grigas: Nngh... So, the prince can fight... But... your victories are numbered... General Camus and his Sable Order will be upon you rabble very... soon... and you will die... on the lance... of the greatest warrior... alive...

@End 
Nyna: Spectacularly done, Marth. ...Does something ail you? I thought you would be happier.
Marth: Today, there was this commoner... She mentioned Grust was divided about the war. Some of its people wanted to fight with Altea, she said...Ever since I lost my father and kingdom, I've held nothing but hate in my heart for Gra and Grust...but not once did I give any thought to what must have been going on in their heads.
Nyna: And now you find your hate for them has been lessened?
Marth: No... the hate remains. I will never forget the pain they inflicted upon me, the rage I felt. Yet now, at least, I can tell you it's not just hate...Not anymore.
Nyna: Not all evils are wrought of evil purposes. Perhaps this sounds naive, but...A true leader needs to look at his opponent and see more than just an enemy.
Marth: ....

Thus Prince Marth escaped Altea Castle with Sir Jagen and company at his side. However, this success would mean little to him once he learned the cost. The boy's woes were just beginning.

@Intro
Marth: Cain, how are your wounds? You should rest.
Cain: These scratches? It's my pride you're wounding sire. ...Anyway, we must talk. There's a reason I've returned. ...Sire, I am...I am to deliver to you His Majesty's last words.
Marth: Last words? You don't mean...Father...
Cain: My condolences, sire. The king died valiantly on the fields of Gra. The traitors took from him the divine blade Falchion and gave no quarter to those of our soldiers who remained...
Marth: I...I see...So they're all dead. Father, too...
Cain: His last words were as follows: Tell my son that I leave the future of Altea and our continent in his hands. He must rise now where I have fallen. As Falchion's rightful heir, he has been born into greatness... Now...he must be great.
Marth: ...Father. I will try...
Cain: ...Sire, I...I cannot bear this! Failing to protect His Majesty...then leaving my brothers to die, slinking away like some coward...This indignity is too much to bear! One day I will repay them in kind. I will avenge the fallen...I swear it!
Marth: Cain, you speak for us both. When that day comes, we will punish them together: Gra, Dolhr...all of them!
Jagen: Sire! We ought to pay a visit to these homes outside the castle.
Jagen: Your countrymen love you; perhaps they have knowledge that may serve us.

Old Man: Just ‘cause you see an enemy over yonder doesn't mean you should go runnin' up to him like a fool! Lure one out, then take ‘im down! Then go out and lure the next. That’s how we did it when I was a lad!

Young Man: Sir Jagen is a paladin: the champion of Altea! I’ve never met him, but I hear he’s strong as an ox despite his age. Still, you can’t have a champion like him do everything; that’s not fair to all your would-be future champions! Let our other units fight and gain experience, or you may find yourself in a real fix down the line.

Old Woman: If you get hurt, rest a spell at a fort. A short stay there, and you’ll be feeling hale as ever.

Young Man: Javelins and Hand Axes are versatile weapons that let you attack both up close and from a short distance away.

Old Man: Weapons aren’t indestructible, you know! When a weapon’s durability reaches 0, that’s it: no more weapon. So be sure to keep an eye on those numbers.

@Battle
Jagen: Look sire. Not all of Gra's might harries the castle. They've left soldiers here outside.
Marth: Elice will have no plans to escape... Let's seize that fort across the water. Perhaps we can squash enemy reinforcement at the source.

Marth: Mages...That will complicate things. They don't need to get as close to do us harm. We'll need to approach carefully.

@End 
Marth: There. That ought to do for the enemy soldiers around here. Malledus! Why arent you with my sister? Did you leave her someplace safe?
Malledus: ...Princess Elice will not be joining us. She has elected to stay at the castle.
Malledus: Hold, sire! Where are you going?
Marth: Where do you think!
Malledus: Stop! Sire, consider for a moment why the princess would go as far as to lie to you to ensure your escape. Your sister knows that you are the future of Altea- nay, the whole land!
Marth: .....!
Marth: I'm...our future...
Malledus: Sire... You must live. Drink deeply now of these injustices; sup on these slights they serve. Remember them! One day you will lead us back here to avenge the fallen and reclaim Altea in their names!
Marth: ...Then it seems my life is no longer mine to hazard.
Malledus: In your veins flows the blood of a hero- the blood of Anri. You are a son of House Archanea, and sole heir to Falchion- our only hope of defeating Medeus, Emperor of Dolhr. Sire, were't in my power, I would have you choose you own path...but I'm afraid your path has chosen you.
Marth: ......

Cain: Sire, it's really you...I feared the worst. That his message would go undeliv...Agh...
Marth: In that state, I don't know how you even stayed ahorse. Those gashes must be treated at once-
Jagen: No, sire. Not until we've escaped.
Marth: ...Cain, I trust you can put off bleeding to death for just a while longer?
Cain: Of course, sir... I aim to please...

Malledus: Princess Elice! The enemy is nearly upon us! Gather your things, quickly!
Elice: No, Malledus. I am staying here.
Malledus: S-staying here?! What madness is this?
Elice: Too many people have died to keep Altea and its castle safe. I cannot abandon what so many lives have brought. With Father and Mother unaccounted for, I am the natural choice to remain with Altea's people. And besides, by staying, I can buy time for the rest of you to escape.
Malledus: Nonsense. Just gather your things, and-
Elice: Malledus. I am not suggesting. I am commanding. If something befalls Father, Marth will become the last person in the entire world worthy of wielding the Falchion. I want you to guide him, Malledus- even when the rest of us no longer can.
Malledus: Princess...I will try my best.
Elice: There's not much time. Go, Malledus. ...Go!

Dolhr... Land of the Manaketes. Before Medeus, the dragonkin had few dealings with the human realm, but when the Shadow Dragon came, everything changed. He sunk all Archanea into a cycle of war, in which heroes rose and heroes fell- always claiming his cause was just and the humans' deaths deserved. But now Medeus’s empire was crumbling... He was nearing the end of his reign... even as Marth was nearing the end of his long quest.

@Intro 
Malledus: There, sire. Up on the mountains to the south, you can see Dolhr Keep.
Marth: And inside is Medeus, king of the earth dragons- the one they call the Shadow Dragon. ...Why doesn’t he leave the keep and face us?
Malledus: I recall Lord Gotoh saying his return is not yet complete; only within the keep’s walls can he maintain dragon form.

Marth: Lord Gotoh?
Gotoh: I know you mean to challenge Medeus. But you and your companions haven’t the power to win.
Marth: What? Why not? Because I failed to retrieve Falchion?
Gotoh: You also failed to save the divine-dragon girl.
Marth: I... did not mean for anything to happen to her-
Gotoh: You can put your heart at ease. Tiki is not dead. She has merely returned to her slumber. Still, without her powers... We must take other steps. ...Select a handful of your best warriors. I must send you into an unseen dimension.
Marth: An... unseen dimension, my lord?
Gotoh: A place outside the confines of our world. There you will find a tower; and once in the tower, you must pass its Keepers’ test. If your strength and your need are great enough, the tower’s master will answer... and then, perhaps, your fortunes will be changed for the better.

@Opening 
Gra's betrayal of Altea years earlier had come as a shock, of course, until that day they attacked Marth's kingdom in the name of Dolhr, Gra had been a trustworthy neighbor and ally. While the Altean army was out on an expedition, Gra struck from the rearm annihilating the Altean soldiers, killing Marth's father, King Cornelius and stealing Falchion, the blade of light. It was a crushing blow. Much time had passed since that sad day, and much had changed. Now it was Marth's turn to descend on Gra Bastion, and face King Jiol, the man who had robbed him of his father.

@Intro 
Enemy Soldier: King Jiol, they're ‘ere! The League is outside the Bastion!
Jiol: League? How dare you call them that! I see naught but a prince of ghosts and his pack of rebels.
Enemy Soldier: B-beggin' your pardon, sire, but everybody calls 'em the League now. Altea and Aurelis and Archanea...The League of A's, you might say!
Jiol: Shut up, you idiot! Hmmm...So the princeling has returned. And he leads all the might of Archanea, with the Fire Emblem in hand...Did you send to Dolhr for reinforcements like I asked?
Enemy Soldier: Of course, sire. Macedon's pegasus knights are on their way.
Jiol: Pegasus knights?! How am I supposed to stop the Lea- those REBELS with a handful of...of winged ponies! Send another messenger! Tell them we need Camus's Sable Order, or...or Michalis's Dragoons! Blast...I deserve the same protection as the rest of the Empire! Betraying Altean was Gharnef's idea! Let...let him fight the brat! Don't just stand there, DO something! I don't want to die!

@Visit 
Young man: At level 10, some units can change class- move up in the world, you might say! Cavaliers become paladins, mercenaries become ‘eroes, and, err- well, I forget the rest.

Young man: With a silver card, you can buy from shops at ‘alf price! Sounds like somethin' out of a dream, eh?

???: You must be Prince Marth of Altea. I have a favor to ask of you. This magic tome belongs to Bishop Boah of Archanea. General Volzhin of Dolhr has been keeping it stashed away, but it...found its way into my hands, you might say. I would appreciate greatly if you could return it to the good bishop in my stead. One other thing... Please take care of Princess Nyna. I am counting on you to keep her safe. ...I must go now. But our paths will cross again; you can be certain of that.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Palla 
Palla: Greetings, Prince Marth. I am Palla, of the Whitewinged Order of Macedon. My younger sister and I parted ways with Macedon the moment we heard Princess Maria was free. Until now, we had fought for Dolhr against our will- but no longer. You have freed us to do what our hearts tell us is right. I wish to fight with my mistress, Princess Minerva. My lance is hers, and yours. Still, sire, I fear for my youngest sister, Est. She flew to Grust some time ago and has yet to return. If the three of us- Catria, Est, and I- are reunited, we can serve you all the better. I hope Est is safe.

%Marth,Catria 
Catria: Hail, Prince Marth! ‘Tis me, Catria. We meet again. My elder sister and I heard our mistress, Princess Minerva, had joined your ranks, so we absconded from Macedon to come and look for you here. I will fight my hardest for you, sire. You need only give the command.

@Boss 
Jiol: Grrr... Altean rabble! I should have killed you stragglers back when I had the chance!

Jiol: Thus falls... the mighty kingdom... of Gra...

@End 
Nyna: Well done, Marth. Altea is just a step away. Now you can take back your home.
Marth: Yes, and take it back I shall, but...
Nyna: Something is wrong. What troubles you?
Marth: Falchion isn't here.
Nyna: The divine blade? Was it supposed to be?
Marth: Yes. When one of my knights returned from the battle where my father, Cornelius, fell....he said Gra had stolen Falchion. And if we are to defeat Dolhr and the Shadow Dragon, Medeus...we need that blade.
Malledus: Prince Marth!
Marth: Did you find it, Malledus?
Malledus: No...it seems Gharnef made off with it.
Nyna: Gharnef? Then, to find Falchion-
Marth: That's right. We'll need to go to Khadein, the kingdom of magic, where he resides. It pains me to turn astray when Altea is so close, but it must be done.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Not all of the League's soldiers took Catria of the Whitewings at her word. Some insisted her plea was a ruse, a trap concocted by Princess Minerva herself. Marth doubted that, though; he had seen the woman in Lefcandith Valley, and she did not strike him as a sort of conniving menace his followers feared. As the brunt of Grust's might drew closer, Marth led the League to Castle Deil, determined to attack the citadel and rescue the young Macedonian princess, Maria.

@Intro 
Zharov: Princess Minerva, what brings you here? You've left your post: not very wise. Might I remind you, poor conduct on your part could have repercussions on how...comfortable...your sister remains.
Minerva: I am aware of my sister, thank you. ...I did not come to make trouble. Just let me see Maria, for a little while. She's only a child, General. Think of what she must be going through.
Zharov: Impossible, I'm afraid. She is a hostage. If your sister's well-being concerns you, then start following orders.
Enemy Soldier: General! Grave news! The rebel army has been sighted east of Castle Deil!
Zharov: What?! Why in creation would the rebels come here? Blast...Order the Dragoons to sortie! And don't forget to send word to the main army. We need reinforcements!
Minerva: Rebels...? Then Marth has arrived...

@Visit 
Middle-aged Man: You know, once, there were three great magi in our world: Miloah, the Master of Aura; Gharnef, the Dark Pontifex; and Gotoh, the White Sage. But now Miloah is gone... If only there were somebody left powerful enough to stop Gharnef...

Young Man: "That Medonian princess, Minerva... She doesn’t seem like a bad sort. I have a sister, too, and if somebody threatened to hurt her... Well, I’m just sayin' you can’t always judge people based on their actions.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Maria
Maria: Oh! You must be Prince Marth! (My, he's so dashing!) ...Thank you for rescuing me. Please be sure to tell my sister I am free. She'll be grateful for the news. Now then. Shall we be off? I'm coming with you, of course.; ...No protesting! I wish to help!

%Marth,Minerva
Minerva: Greetings, Prince Marth. I am Minerva of Macedon. Thank you for saving my sister. Maria's plight forced me to treat you as an enemy when I knew you were not; suffice to say, I am deeply sorry for that. ...The whole world has gone mad. Most of Macedon fights for Dolhr now. My own brother Michalis leads them. And on their hands is the blood of their king, my father. They must be stopped; I must stop them. Still, I fear for my soldiers whom I can no longer protect, especially the three Whitewing sisters: Palla, Catria, and Est. Dolhr worried we would rebel, and forced us to separate. If they knew I was safe, they would join your ranks in a heartbeat. We are yours to command, sire. Let us help you defeat Dolhr, and repay them for sullying Macedon's honor.

@Battle-Talk 
%Maria,Minerva
Maria: Sister!
Minerva: Maria... Are you all right?
Maria: Fine. Have you heard? Marth made me one of his soldiers! Well...I made him make me one.
Minerva: ...What am I going to do with you? Listen to me, Maria... you cannot stay here. It's too dangerous. Real war is nothing like your stories of princes and damsels.
Maria: I'm not going anywhere! I want to stay with you!
Minerva: Maria, you're being selfish–
Maria: I am not! I'm just...sick of being helpless. I've burdened you long enough. How can I ever help you if you don't give me a chance to be strong? I'm staying here and fighting! No protesting!
Minerva: ...Ha ha. Somehow I knew you would say that. All right, Maria. If you feel that strongly about it, who am I to stop you? All I ask is that you be careful. If you need help, you come find me. Understood?
Maria: Of course! Thank you, Sister!

@Boss 
Zharov: Grrr... Must I do everything myself? Bah! You'll not get past me, rebel!

Zharov: They're a force... to be reckoned... with... Rrgh...

@End 
Nyna: Marth, have you ever heard of Pontifex Miloah?
Marth: The one who defended Archanea with the power of Aura? Of course; he and his magic are famous! But...I read Miloah died in a battle with Gharnef, soon after the fiend sold his soul to Dolhr...
Nyna: Alas, Miloah did die... But his daughter, Linde, yet lives. I am told she inherited her father's skill with Aura magic- but since the battle with Gharnef none have seen her. Wherever she is, it cannot be pleasant. ...Marth, please. Find Linde. With her father gone, we are the only family the girl has left.

@Opening 
After shattering Macedon’s main force outside Aurelis Castle, Marth next led his army into the castle’s halls to liberate the kingdom. A number of treasures slept in Aurelis Castle’s nooks and crannies but how to extract them before they could fall into enemy hands? “Only a thief could open chests locked that tight,” grumbled one of Marth’s men. But we don’t have any thieves with us. ...Do we?

@Intro
Emereus: What?! The rebels are inside the castle? Grrr...Very well! Armored units: intercept the intruders! Archers: defend the throne! Thieves, you go gather up the treasure while I make preparations to withdraw. You have your orders! Don’t let those rebels anywhere near this chamber!

@Recruit-Talk
%Julian,Rickard
Julian: What the- Rickard? What are you doin’ in here?
Rickard: Oh, uh... Hey there, Chief! Been a long time, huh? So, funny story: I decided to break in here and clean the place out- and then I got caught. Hilarious, right? Comedy gold. OK, your turn What are YOU doin’ here?
Julian: Me? I’ve washed my hands of thievery and joined the forces of justice.
Rickard: Ohhh really? Justice? So then this wouldn’t have nothin’ to do with some new lady friend? You always did have a soft spot for a pretty face and the right features-
Julian: Wha- Can it, you little fink! I said it’s about justice! I’m entitled to have moral crisis now and then! ...You know what? Just for that, YOU are gonna work for me, startin’ right now.
Rickard: What? Do I have to...? Well, all right. You drive a hard bargain, but what can I say? I missed ya, Chief. Just make sure I get a cut out of the haul!

%Marth,Rickard
Rickard: ...Wow! Really? A prince, you say? Thanks for springin’ me! I’m Rickard, just a small-time thief, mind you, but I’ve got big aspirations! I broke in here to clean the place out, and instead it was me that got my cloak cleaned... Since you saved my hide, I guess the least I can do is lend my services in return.

@Battle-Talk 
%Rickard,Marth
Rickard: So you’re the prince of Altea, then? Hello. I’m Rickard. Just a small-time thief, mind you, but I’ve got big aspirations! Julian asked me to help you out, see, and what the chief says, goes! So here I am.

@Boss 
Emereus: Blast! They're upon me! Why didn't those idiot soldiers stop them?!

Emereus: Rrgh... Why... ?

@End 
Nyna: Prince Marth... At long last. I am Nyna of House Archanea. ‘Tis Archanea’s burden to protect the world of crisis- a duty I have striven to fulfill. But Dolhr has laid waste to my kingdom, and now I find myself powerless to stop the world from falling into ruin. Marth... Please, pick up the banner where I have let it fall. Lead your might against Dolhr, and free us all.
Marth: Of course, Princess Nyna. Altea swore fealty to Archanea long ago, a vow we have always kept. And, as you know, it is in my blood – House Altea’s blood – to destroy Medeus just as Anri did before me.
Nyna: Thank you, Marth. Then let me give you this. This crest is called the Fire Emblem. House Archanea bestows it only upon a true champion, one we believe has the power to save the world. With it, you gain the right to open treasure chests across the land and wield the precious items within. I know you will use them well. Never give up, Marth. Fight, until the day you restore light to our world.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The League had routed Hollstadt's knights and recaptured most of the kingdom, but there was still the castle to deal with before Altea would be free; the mage-dragon Morzas remained entrenched within its walls. Unlike General Camus who preceded him, Morzas had been a cruel warden, slaughtering many innocent Alteans at the slightest provocation. Marth roiled to think such a monster still sat upon his noble father's throne.

@Intro 
Morzas: Kee hee hee... Wretched Altean whelp, stumbling home to the slaughter... What fool throws away a life already so preciously bought? Your mother, Liza, is dead; I killed her myself. Your sister Elice lives only because Gharnef wanted her. So what will become of you, little prince? Will you run for your life a second time? Or will you stay this time to die? Emperor Medeus would not put me on this throne if he thought you could remove me from it, kee hee hee...

@Boss 
Morzas: Kee hee... Witless human! None defy a mage-dragon and live to speak of it!

Morzas: Grrf... I stand... corrected...B ut you still lack the power... to defeat Medeus...

@End 
Nyna: Marth! Any word? Have you found your family? Your sister?
Marth: ...My sister was taken by Gharnef. She is no longer here... And my...my mother is... She is dead. Slain...by that Dolhrian dragon...
Nyna: ....! Marth, I am truly sorry...
Marth: I thought there would be something...some part of my old life I would be coming back to. I fought so hard...
Nyna: You fought wonderfully, Marth.
Malledus: ...Sire, might I have a moment?
Marth: All the moments you want, Malledus. What is it?
Malledus: Your people have gathered outside the castle. They are overjoyed to be free again, sire, and would like very much to see their prince.
Marth: All right, then. I'll go at once.
Nyna: Marth...perhaps you should let that wait, just until you are able to share their joy with them. We could send someone in your stead-
Marth: No, that would not do. Today is a momentous day for my kingdom and my people. I must celebrate with them now, not later. Anything else would be a disservice to those who died to save Altea. I am a prince before I am a son or a brother. Come, Malledus. Let us go greet my people.

@Narration 
Thus Altea was liberated. Its people, ragged from years of Dolhrian tyranny, scrambled to the castle and flocked beneath its walls, eager to celebrate what, for many, would be remembered as the happiest days of their lives. They clapped each other on the back, laughed; and when Marth, their prince, appeared up above, they saluted their hero with a thunderous cheer: “Glory to Marth, our prince of light! Glory to our star and savior!” Marth smiled down at his people and waved. The great commander's last victory of the day was commanding his tears not to flow.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Marth did as Gotoh instructed and chose soldiers for his journey into the unseen. What lay within the tower in this alternate world to test him? Marth’s heart wavered. But with neither the divine blade Falchion nor the divine dragon girl to aid him, the tower’s master was his last hope of defeating Medeus. Gotoh had told Marth to find a coffin. So while most of his companions remained in the material world to battle Doluna, Marth and his chosen few scoured the tower to search of a mysterious savior.

@Intro 
Marth: This must be the tower Lord Gotoh spoke of...
Malledus: Sire, it’s teeming with soldiers... Who are they? They fly no recognizable banner.
Marth: They are the Keepers whose test I must pass.
Malledus: You mean to fight them, then?
Marth: Gotoh says we must prove ourselves. Very well; we’ll seize the tower. Follow me!

@End 
Malledus: Sire, look! Stairs beneath the throne! Where could they lead?
Malledus: ...Do you think this is the coffin?
Marth: There are no others. And look: these markings around it are the same pattern we saw in the Fane of Raman...
Malledus: Hmm, you’re right...
Marth: We found a dragon girl in the fane... I wonder if these symbols-Huh?!
Malledus: Sire! The coffin... It’s opening!
Marth: What? No! It must be some kind of trap, or... or some kind of... er...
Marth: ...woman? Could she be the master Gotoh spoke of?
Nagi: ...Who are you?
Marth: My name is Marth, prince of Altea. And you, my lady?
Nagi: Me?! My name... is Nagi.
Marth: Nagi... I was sent here to find you, by a man named Gotoh.
Nagi: Gotoh... I know that name...But from where? I cannot recall.
Marth: You’ve lost your memory?
Nagi: I... cannot say for certain. But your voice... I heard you calling. Did you rouse me from my sleep?
Marth: I... er... Not on purpose?
Nagi: Your soul... called out to me...begging for my help. For this blade...
Marth: That...that’s Falchion! How did you get it?!
Nagi: I cannot remember... But you need it, I know that. And you need my powers.
Marth: Your... powers, my lady?
Nagi: Take me with you. I must... finish what I started... I think. I must fight with you.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
At long last, Altea was free again. Marth took the League to Helena Castle in the north, an old fortress and key supply point during Dolhr and Grust’s occupation. There he meant to seize the last of the enemy’s gold and provisions but Grust would not give up the castle without a fight...

@Intro 
Enemy Soldier: Lord Dactyl, I’ve brought the mage.
Dactyl: Good. Hold him up.
Etzel: ...Nngh....
Dactyl: Well, then? Have you been persuaded to fight for us?
Etzel: ...Never. I’d rather die.
Dactyl: You’d rather DIE? Ha! As if a spell-slinging vagabond like you has any choice in the matter! Enough. Strip him of all his possessions and lock him up someplace. Perhaps we can use him later.
Enemy Soldier: There’s not much to strip him of, milord. Just the tome and this ring...
Dactyl: Ring? Let me have a look at that.
Etzel: No! Don’t you- Grr, let me go! Don’t you touch Ursula’s ring!
Dactyl: Wha... what are you- yaagh!
Enemy Soldier: O-oi! Take your hands off Lord Dactyl!
Etzel: Rrgh... please, not the ring! ...Give it BACK!
Dactyl: Unhand me, you filthy maggot!
Etzel: Nngh! ...Unnh...
Dactyl: Take this wretch away. Now!
Enemy Soldier: At once, milord!
Dactyl: Hmph, all that for some tawdry ring. ...Hmm? That gives me an idea...

@Battle 
Enemy Soldier: I’ve brought him, milord.
Dactyl: Good. I’ve had a change of heart. I am considering giving that ring of yours back.
Etzel: ...!
Dactyl: BUT...you must face the League for us. How much considering I do hinges on how well you fight.
Etzel: ...And how am I to fight unarmed, my lord?
Dactyl: Hmm? ...Ah. yes, well, you can have your little book back. But you know what the consequences will be if you betray us...
Etzel: For now, I’ll just have to feign obedience...

@Boss 
Etzel: Sorry. I mean you no harm, but neither have I any wish to die here.

Dactyl: Blast! Where have those indolent guards gone?

Dactyl: Unnh... gwaaah!

@End 
Malledus: Prince Marth! Grust’s garrison left their war chest when they fled. This much gold should buy plenty of equipment. Might I suggest, sire, you avail yourself of this opportunity to outfit your soldiers? Our next opponent will be Grust’s Sable Order. By our scouts’ reports, they march to meet us as we speak. Many say their knights are the strongest on the continent. We’ll want to be well prepared.
Etzel: You’re Prince Marth, aren’t you? I wish to thank you.
Marth: ...Who are you?
Etzel: My name is Etzel. I am a traveling sorcerer. Those Grustian cowards stole a ring from me, and were it not for you, I might never have seen it again.
Marth: The ring must have been very dear to you, then.
Etzel: It’s all I have to remember my wife by. She got caught in the fighting back when Gra betrayed Altea...
Marth: Those were dark days. You have my deepest sympathies; I lost my father in the same battle.
Etzel: Will there be no end to this bloodshed?
Marth: There will, Etzel. I have sworn to end it; that’s the very reason all of us fight.
Etzel: And you think you can end it, just like that? From anyone else’s lips that would sound absurdly naive. But I can tell you are sincere. Tell me, Prince, have you any need for an extra... spell slinger? I’ve no taste for war, but I do have a fierce hunger for ending it. Let’s usher in a new era, you and I.

@Opening 
The Sable Order fought valiantly to keep Marth’s army from reaching Chiasmir, but in the end Grust’s knights buckled: the world’s mightiest only in song. The League marched on to the Fane of Raman, a holy sanctuary built by the divine dragoons to house their most priceless treasures. Here another story was set to begin...

@Intro 
Gharnef: Tiki... Tiki... Princess-that-was of the great divine dragons ...Can you hear my voice?
Tiki: ....Mm-hmm.
Gharnef: Defilers have set foot inside the fane- despoilers! Punish them. Let your fire consume them!
Tiki: Defilers... in the fane... Punish them...

Bantu: Yes, child. ’tis I, ’tis I. How I worried! Are you hurt?
Tiki: No, Ban-Ban, just...just scared...I feel as though I just woke from an awful nightmare...
Bantu: I am truly sorry, child. Truly, I am. I will not let us be separated again. From now on, I will be there to protect you.

Tiki: Meanie.
Xane: So how are you holdin' up, kiddo?

Xane: Still having those bad dreams?
Tiki: Sometimes. They're really scary...
Xane: I bet they are. (...Ugh, what does Lord Gotoh expect me to do?)

Tiki: I know.

Nyna: Marth! Tell me, was it a success? Did you locate the Lightsphere and Starsphere?
Marth: Never fear; I have them. We need to take these to Gotoh so he can undo Imhullu’s magic... But first, Nyna, we’ve a more pressing task ahead of us.
Nyna: Oh? And what is that?
Marth: We must defeat Grust once and for all. If we march south without finishing them off, we have our rear exposed.
Nyna: Then you mean to invade.
Marth: Yes. And this time, General Camus will be there to meet us. I am sure of it. Camus the Sable, they call him. Many extol him as the most able warrior alive. It will be a fierce battle... but one we cannot avoid.
Nyna: You are certain we must face him?
Marth: We have crippled Grust, but they will regroup and stand in our way again. No, we need to stamp this fire out before the wind catches it and starts spreading it anew.
Nyna: Very well. But before you attack, there is something I must tell you. Later, though... Not yet. I must sort my feelings out first...

Marth: The blizzard has gotten worse. I can barely see anything in front of me... Kris, I think I can see somebody ahead. Is that...
Kris: Ah! Sire, please stay behind me. I feel the presence of enemies. Several are currently targeting us.
Marth: What!? But, we can't see anything like this. How should we fight back?
Kris: We've no choice but to directly engage the enemy. It will probably be a dangerous battle, unlike any we've faced previously.
Marth: Indeed. We should select those who'll fight with prudence.

Marth: Athena! What brings you here!?
Athena: Huff... huff... They are coming after you, Prince Marth. Ve vanted to varn you...
Marth: Ah! I see. So you wanted to help me... Thank you, Athena. It's fine now; I'll handle the rest. We'll defeat the enemy!
Clarisse: That wench... How dare she get in our way. If she hadn't spotted us, I could have shot the prince dead. Tsk! Oh well. As long as this blizzard carries on... This battle is mine. You can't see anything, can you? But we can. Now it's time for you to die, blind and blissfully ignorant.

Katarina: Come on, hold on to me. Let's return to the hideout, together.
Clarisse: Wha...?
Katarina: You can't walk around wounded like this. And you'll freeze to death if you don't find shelter soon.
Clarisse: Why...? Why would you... go so far to help me...! I've always treated... you like dirt and yet you...
Katarina: Because you're my little sister.
Clarisse: ...Pfft. You know I'm not your sister. We're both orphans, remember...? We've always been alone...
Katarina: But, we were raised together by Lady Eremiya... I don't mind if you hate me. But, I don't want to lose you... If I were to lose this one bond... I'd be alone in the dark, again... And the same goes for you.
Clarisse: ...Reese...
Katarina: Please, hold onto me.
Clarisse: B-bah... This will be the first and last time I'm gonna obey you, you hear me...?

Eremiya: ...Yes, I am aware of Altea's actions. We will begin the next phase of our plan. Your wish is our command, Master Gharnef...
Katarina: Lady Eremiya...!
Eremiya: Clarisse failed, didn't she?
Katarina: Y-yes... She's severely wounded... We need to have her treated!
Eremiya: Dispose of her.
Katarina: B-but, Lady Eremiya!
Eremiya: She's of no use to me wounded like this. Just leave her and she'll die by herself.
Katarina: ...
Clarisse: What's with that face...? It's natural... that I'd die if I failed... I knew... this would happen... but, but...
Katarina: Clarisse...
Clarisse: Go away. I don't want... you to see me like this.
Katarina: ...Very well.
Clarisse: ...... Reese... Wait... Don't go... I changed my mind... stay with me. I don't want... to be alone...
Katarina: Clarisse... I'm right here. I'll always be by your side. After all, I'm your big sister.

@Opening 
Marth and the others once again moved out from Altea, and headed towards the imperial capital of Millennium Court. But, along their way, they passed through the Kingdom of Gra, a land allied to Archanea. In the previous war Gra sided with the Dolhr Empire, which resulted in their king, Jiol, dying in battle and the destruction of the kingdom. The country was once a part of Altea, but they sided with Archanea after listening to Hardin's orders. Hardin found King Jiol's daughter, Princess Sheena, and allowed her to ascend the throne, and he then ordered reinforcements from Gra. Sheena received wild support from the citizens of Gra. To them, Sheena was their only hope. The youths all volunteered to become soldiers. They were happy to move out and have the chance to defeat their bitter enemy, Altea. But their dreams were shattered in an instant... Before the fast approaching Altean elites, Gra's soldiers lost all morale, and fled for their lives.

@Intro 
Jagen: Gra's army is renowned for its mighty armor knights and generals. The late king Jiol--our enemy in the last war--was a general himself.
Kris: I see. An army with strong defenses...
Jagen: In the past, yes. I hear that Gra's army now consists of new recruits. Hardly worthy enemies. Speaking of strong defenses, Kris...
^start
Jagen: Your defense is truly overwhelming. Only a fool would dare approach you. Even Gra at it's prime could not compete with your defense. This battle has already been decided.

Jagen: Your defense is quite impressive. No man in Gra could match your defense. This battle has already been decided.

Jagen: Erm, your defense... could do with a little more work. This is quite worrisome. Kris, the enemies may be new recruits, but don't underestimate them.
^end 

@Battle 
Samson: Princess Sheena, it seems the Altean army has arrived.
Sheena: Really...? It's already the end. Samson, I have brought you much trouble. I need to watch the final days of my Kingdom of Gra. You may leave now.
Samson: Princess, isn't it already enough? Shouldn't you despise King Jiol for forcefully taking your mother? Isn't that why you hid at Millennium Court and stayed away from this country? Right now you are just being tricked by Hardin, and being used by him.
Sheena: Perhaps. I heard that the people of Gra wished for the restoration of the country, and that's why I agreed to help him. However Hardin is only interested in using us. He would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him. Still, I will not leave! How can I just abandon those fighting for my sake!?
Samson: Impossible... How can our fresh recruits resist Altea's elites...? Fine, if you're staying, I will also stay to the end. This could be interesting.
Sheena: Samson... Why are you doing this? Aren't you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold? I no longer have money to give you...
Samson: I don't know why either. It's just... Sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do. Also, I want to see how that kid fights this battle. If he truly is a hero, perhaps your mind may be changed...

Sheema: What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!

Samson: Prince Marth... How unfortunate. I thought you a better man.

Sheema: What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!

@Visit 
Old man: Hardin sent troops here to prevent Gra from rebelling. The Archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight. 

Woman: Princess Sheena is the child of King Jiol's second wife. But, she is different from the king. She is a very kind person. The princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers. Is there no way to save her?

Woman: The soldiers here are all foreigners. There's nobody else to protect this country, because the knights of this country all died. Right now, the actions of the Archanea soldiers are deplorable. Their just the same as thieves... Those lowlifes!

Young woman: Ah... Please leave me. I already have nothing to give you.
Marth: Ah, please don't get us wrong. We aren't here to steal.
Young woman: But, didn't you all come here from Altea for revenge?
Marth: No, we don't want to fight Gra, because Gra and Altea were originally like one family.
Young woman: Is that true...? Then, I will give my most important treasure... to... you

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Sheena 
Marth: You are Princess Sheena? It's great to see you safe. I don't view Gra as an enemy. Gra and my country were originally one country. The country may have divided after Anri's death, but we always got on well as allies. But, in the previous war, I felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did. Princess Sheena, please allow us to be friends once again. I don't want to fight Gra.
Sheena: Prince Marth... Once I heard that you didn't attack my fleeing soldiers, I was really surprised. You truly are the second coming of King Anri. I trust you. Please... Treat the citizens of Gra... as if they were your citizens. I will hand my whole country to your care... Prince Marth.

%Sheena,Samson 
Samson: That's great Sheena. Now I can finally leave without worry.
Sheena: Samson... Can you not leave...?
Samson: You don't need me anymore. From now on Prince Marth will protect you.
Sheena: Don't leave! I don't want you to leave...
Samson: Huh, what? Why keep me? It doesn't seem like you. ...Fine. If you say you need me, I won't go anywhere else. I will protect you wherever you may go. Is that fine with you?
Sheena: Yes...

@Recruit-Visit 
Tomas: Prince Marth, I've been waiting for you. I'm Tomas, an Archanean soldier--or was. I've since retired from the army. The Archaneans here just want to sacrifice the defenceless Gra soldiers. This act of brutality by my former homeland... I cannot tolerate. Please, Prince Marth. Let me fight with you in some way.

@Recruit-Battle 
Sheena: You... You dare treat my citizens like that... Die!

Sheena: Forgive me, citizens of Gra.

Samson: Prince Marth... I thought you were a noble person, but you're just a murderer... You disappoint me.*

Samson: Sheena...

@End 
Jagen: Sire, to keep fighting like this is pointless. All we are accomplishing is buying Hardin more time.
Marth: My thoughts exactly. If we continue like this, more blood will be spilt for naught. Kris, do you have any sort of plan?
Kris: According to our information, the enemy's primary force is concentrated along the highway. I wonder if we can avoid that route, by passing through the mountains?
Jagen: Hmph, we'd have to cross Adria Pass... But the steep mountains make it dangerous for an army of our size.
Kris: That's true, and I fear the enemy may have prepared an ambush as well. Our bravery could be our undoing. But it is the fastest possible route. If we could just break through there, we'd be in walking distance of the palace.
Marth: I am prepared for the danger. We managed to conquer the same perilous road that Anri walked. Compared to that... Jagen, Kris. We can overcome this challenge. Order the advance!
Frost: Oof... Seems I've finally caught up.
Kris: Hmm, and you are?
Frost: My name is Frost. I am a priest of Macedon. When Macedon was taken over by those warmonging rebels... You came and saved our country. Thanks to you, my family's now safe. I have come to return the favor.
Kris: I see. But hasn't it been some time since Prince Marth freed Macedon...?
Frost: Your army marched at speed and this old geezer just couldn't keep up. Eventually I lost sight of you... But then I heard that Marth had freed Altea as well, and I finally managed to catch up with you here, in Gra. I am old now, but I can still fight. Please, allow me to to join you.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Soon after reclaiming the Fane of Raman, Marth's army fears pursuit from the Archanean army and escapes towards Chiasmir Bridge. However, a new enemy attacks the Altean army upon reaching the central islet.

"The Archanean army is coming from the north; we'll be surrounded like this."

The situation is desperate! Can Marth and his friends overcome the many perils?

@Intro 
^locked 
Marth: Huh? Kris, what's with the hat?
Kris: This? Lord Wendell gave it to me so that my cold wouldn't get any worse.
Marth: From Lord Wendell, I see... Chiasmir Bridge has a strong sea wind, so it's good to have a hat to keep warm. It suits you, Kris.
Kris: Really? Thank you, sire.
^end 

Cain: Sire, you're safe! Kris! you too! You've guarded Prince Marth well.
Kris: Sir Cain! You made it!
Marth: I'm truly glad that you came back unharmed, Cain.
Cain: Yeah, somehow I managed to shake off the enemy and escape here. But the enemy is already approaching from the north.
Marth: Don't worry. We will crush them.
Cain: No, not this time. Hardin is being protected by a mysterious power: we can't lay a finger on him. So even if we fight him now, we haven't a chance of winning. Please, head to the northwestern fortress. There's a boat across the river, which we can use to escape to the Khadein desert.
Jagen: Sire, the free company to the south will probably make their move soon. Indeed, now's not the time to fight. For the time being, let's do as Cain suggests and make our escape. After that, we'll think of something...
Marth: I see... I don't like it, but we haven't a choice... Everyone, hurry to the northwest fortress!

@Visit 
Villager: If ya ask me, archers'll always get along well with archers.

@Recruit-Visit 
Bantu: Oh look, if it isn't Prince Marth. Long time no see, Lad. It seems so noisy out; I wonder what's happened?
Marth: Ah, Bantu! Fancy meeting you in a place like this. How is Tiki?
Bantu: Oh, she is no longer by my side. Lord Gotoh took her to the Ice Dragon's Temple again.
Marth: The Ice Dragon's temple? Where's that? I've never heard of such a place...
Bantu: It's in the icy lands, far north of here. But it's no place for humans. Besides the hero Anri, no man has been there yet.
Marth: Anri?! Are you, perchance, referring to the "Realm of the Gods" from Anri's legends?
Bantu: I'm not at liberty to say anything more. If you want to know more, you should ask Lord Gotoh. Anyhow, I have a favor to ask of you. My precious firestone was stolen by thieves. If you can get it back for me, I'll show you how it works. Thank you, Prince Marth.

@Battle 
Hardin: ...Hasten the preparations of the troops within the fortress. I want Marth cornered like a rat...

Hardin: Heh heh heh... Prince, your struggle is in vain. But let us continue this game for a while. Just know that you're fast running out of time. Soon, I will kill you myself...

Hardin: Heh heh heh... Prince Marth, it's been far too long.
Marth: Hardin... Why did you attack our country? What would compel you to do such an act? I... I can't believe this. Have you really changed this much?
Hardin: Prince, I am the ruler of this continent and the Emperor of Archanea. I will show no quarter to anyone who opposes me. That includes you, Prince... I must destroy this foul world... It is beyond salvation. Traitors, playtime is over. You will all die here. All soldiers, attack! Do not leave a single traitor standing!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Caeda,Roger 
Caeda: Good day, sir.
Roger: Ack! You, y-you're... Caeda!
Caeda: Thank goodness, Roger. It's nice to see you again.
Roger: Uh... Uhm, you should know, I've no plans to betray Archanea. I was just thinking about that time when you asked me "do you believe in love?" But I'm different from who I was back then.
Caeda: Really? But you still seem like a nice man. That's why I wanted to speak with you again.
Roger: Uhh...
Caeda: May I just ask, why are you fighting for Archanea?
Roger: Be-because Archanea has already taken over the world. Resistance is futile: no one can win. My life is precious to me. If I side with whoever's stronger, then I'm guaranteed to live longer...
Caeda: I see.
Roger: A-are you disappointed with me?
Caeda: No, never. As I thought, you're fighting for what you believe in. You're not different. You're the same, kind man as when I first met you and I'm happy for that.
Roger: Uhhh... Wait- you're leaving?!
Caeda: Yes. I too must fight for what I believe in. But I'll make a request to Marth so that we don't have to fight you. I'm happy that we could talk again, Roger.
Roger: W-wait! ...As I thought, you're still very kind. Dare I say, we don't have girls quite like you back in Grust or Archanea. Um, perhaps... I suppose I could... Aw heck, I'm going with you again!

%Marth,Jeorge 
Marth: Wait, Sir Jeorge. I wish to speak with you.
Jeorge: Prince Marth... Please, lower your weapon. I don't want to fight you.
Marth: I know. As do I. You taught Gordin how to use a bow. And you were an instructor to the junior knights of Altea. You've been a great boon to Altea: I could never fight you, Sir Jeorge.
Jeorge: Prince... I pledge allegiance to Princess Nyna. But I can tolerate Hardin no longer... Taking other countries by force, executing "rebels" without reason...
Marth: ...Hardin was my friend. But he has changed beyond recognition. If he is committing any sort of crime, then I shall stop him. Jeorge, please, help me.
Jeorge: ...I understand, Prince. To return the kingdom of Archanea to what it was once before... I will take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland.

%Gordin,Jeorge 
Gordin: Master! Please, wait!
Jeorge: Hm...? Gordin? Long time no see. You seem to have gotten a little sturdier, but has your bow arm improved any?
Gordin: Yes, at the moment, I... They call me Altea's master of bows. It's thanks to you, Master, that I've been able to progress this far.
Jeorge: And? Did you come here because you wanted to challenge your old teacher?
Gordin: N-no! It's not like that... ...I might be asking the impossible, but I'd like you to fight alongside us again, sir.
Jeorge: ......
Gordin: Please! Master!!
Jeorge: I pledged allegiance to Princess Nyna, but as for Hardin... I've had it with him. Taking other countries by force, executing "rebels" without reason. The Archanean army I see now is just a collection of hired thugs. There's not even a shred of chivalry left. To return the kingdom of Archanea to what it was once before... I must take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland. Gordin. Convey that to Prince Marth.
Gordin: Thank you, Master!!

@Recruit-Battle 
Roger: I don't want to fight you guys, but it's not as if I have a choice...

Roger: Ugh... I just wanted to meet her... once more... once more...

Astram: You traitors! I'll show you the might of Mercurius!!

Astram: Midia... My love...

Jeorge: You wouldn't have needed to die if you hadn't come so close, fools...

Jeorge: What fools...

Hardin: Who are you? Your face is unknown to me.
Kris: Kris. I am Prince Marth's Royal Guard. Emperor Hardin of Archanea, the prince told me you were once a trusted friend. Why would you do something like this?
Hardin: Kris, is it...? What does it matter to you? You will die here regardless.

#avatar-M
Hardin: Who are you? Your face is unknown to me.
Kris: Kris. I am Prince Marth's Royal Guard. Emperor Hardin of Archanea, I never knew you in the past. But I do know this: you are now the prince's enemy.

@End 
Jagen: Please hurry, sire. The enemy is closing in on us.
Marth: But everyone is still fighting. I can't just leave them behind.
Kris: Worry not, sire. I will remain here. I will regroup with everyone later.
Marth: Kris! But...
Jagen: Sire, you of all people know that Kris is more than capable. As long as Kris is there, everyone will escape safely and reunite with you at once. Now sire, to the boat!

Kris: I will be the rear guard. Everyone, hurry up and escape! Lord Wendell, you too!

Kris: Yes. Thank you, it was most comfortable.
Wendell: No no, 'twas nothing. ...By the way, should I be hurrying too?
Kris: Erm... Yes, hurry up and escape!

Kris: No... If it's all right with you, I'd like to hold on to it a little longer.
Wendell: Yes, that would be splendid. ...By the way, should I be hurrying too?
Kris: Erm... Yes, hurry up and escape!

Maria: Michalis... Minerva... Can we be a happy family again...?
Nyna: Camus... you're...
Elice: Merric... Thank you...

Gotoh: Marth, brave prince of Altea. Thanks to your valiant efforts, Shadow Dragon Medeus has been completely obliterated. Medeus's servants--the earth dragons-- have once again returned to darkness. As long as the Binding Shield exists, they will never see the light again. Marth, the chosen Prince of Light, descendant of the hero Anri. You have not only saved mankind, but us dragonkin as well...

Tiki: Mar-Mar!! Does this mean I don't need to go back to the Ice Dragon Shrine anymore? I'm so happy! I love being with everyone, after all. I don't want to be all alone ever again. This is like... a dream come true. I'm so happy, so very happy. I love you, Mar-Mar!!
Malicia: Honestly, Tiki, for how long do you plan on hogging Prince Marth? Prince Marth looks like he's enjoying it too. Doesn't he worry that you might get mad, Princess Caeda?
Caeda: Please Malicia, you're so silly. But you're right, Marth looks happy...
Malicia: Who wouldn't? Especially after having a heavy burden lifted from their shoulders? Prince Marth has always been forced to carry such a heavy responsibility. It must have been hard on him. But Princess, you didn't have an easy time either, am I right? With everyone surrounding Marth day and night, you could seldom talk to him. You must have felt lonely.
Caeda: Yes I did... but it's alright. As long as Marth is safe, I have no other wish. You see, I prayed to God. When I found out Marth had been tasked with such an important mission, I asked for God to take my life, should Marth ever have to sacrifice his... That's all I could do for Marth.
Malicia: ...Sigh, I give up. There's no way I could compare to you, Princess. But, you'll have to wait no longer. Because your prince has finally come back to you. Look, Princess, he's looking over here. Be brave!

Caeda: Marth...
Marth: Caeda, it's finally over. I've made you suffer, too. Please accept my apologies.
Caeda: No, I'm the one who ought to apologize... I wasn't any help to you.
Marth: Don't be silly. I've only come this far because you were by my side, Caeda. And besides, the hard part begins now. The seven kingdoms of Archanea are to be unified. And everyone expects me to accept responsibility of the new kingdom. However, there's no way I could handle such a position by myself. Caeda, I want your assistance. I need you.
Caeda: Marth, let me tell you something... When I left Talys, I made a vow. I swore that I would go wherever you went, and that I'd trust you no matter what happened. So, no matter how painful the war was, I was able to endure. Because, Marth... I...

Jagen: Sire... You've done such a magnificent job. I'm speechless for words.

Arran: The fact I could devote my last moments to fight under Prince Marth's banner is my life's pride.
Cain: Truly! We're honored to be by the prince's side.
Abel: Yes. Even though I'm no knight now... fighting together with Prince Marth was my honor.
Elice: Marth... Please be happy from now on...

Draug: Seems we'll be busy from now on! All the kingdoms need to be rebuilt, so we have a mountain of work to do.
Frey: True. And yet, we can see hope in the eyes of all people.
Gordon: If we work hard now, we can turn the world onto the right path... That's what I truly believe.
Norne: I'm sure the people of this world have received that hope. Because of Prince Marth...

Ryan: W-we've won? It feels so unreal... Somebody pinch me--ouch!
Luke: Hey, you asked for it! But truly, our battles will be told as legends for generations to come!
Rody: Getting carried away, I see... But, I'm glad everyone from the 7th Platoon is safe.
Cecil: Yup. The fact we can laugh together as friends like this is what pleases me the most. And Katarina, that you includes you of course.
Katarina: Yes... I feel everyone's happiness as well. Kris...
Kris: Yes, we'll be together forever.

Wrys: The bonds of people are truly a wondrous sight, no matter your age.

Yubello: Ah, Sir Sirius? Where did he go? He was here until a moment ago...
Yuliya: It's okay, Yubello. We must become stronger from here on. I'm sure Sirius wanted that, too...

Roger: I gotta return to Grust and work hard to rebuild my motherland. Say Malicia, you, er, wanna go back with me?
Malicia: Sorry, but this girl's taken. I have to look for my prince, after all!

Belf: Robert, Leiden. Let's move out. 
Robert: Understood. We shall now become knights who protect the weak.
Leiden: That's what General Camus would have wanted us to do.

Minerva: Palla, Catria, Est. The war is finally over. You've done well.
Palla: Commander, your ideal world where all can live in peace... It may finally become a reality.
Catria: I agree. As long as Prince Marth is here, I'm sure it will...
Est: Oh, that's right. Let's all go to Altea. We must thank Prince Marth!
Maria: Ooh, I would love that! I want to see his dashingness too!

Matthis: Lena! I was worried about you. Tell me, did Julian make any distasteful advances on you?
Julian: Hey, and why would I do somethin' like that? C'mon, at a time like this...!
Lena: Teehee, I see you two have been getting along while I was away.
Rickard: Chief, don't you leave me behind! We vowed to stay together, didn't we?

Warren: ...I don't like the noise. But, I've discovered the worth of friendship. Thanks.

Caeda: Ogma, fellow Talysians. I must express my gratitude to you all for protecting Marth in my stead...
Cord: Princess, we'd go through hell and high water for you and yer husband.
Bord: Well, that and Ogma asked us to. Right, boss?
Ogma: Yeah. Bord, Cord, you did well. Barst, you helped a lot too.
Barst: It was nothin'. I just wanted to live my days in peace again.

Castor: It's time I return to me hometown. Thankfully, I've saved up a lot of gold.
Darros: I should try and earn money too, but by doing honest work instead.

Linde: Princess Nyna! Oh, Princess, I'm so glad you're safe...
Nyna: Linde... I apologize for making you worry.

Astram: Midia, I'm sorry. I was overtaken by anger and forgot what was most important.
Midia: You needn't apologize, Astram. Just don't ever leave my side again...
Jeorge: Good heavens, it seems we're in the way here. Sir Horace, where might you off to?
Horace: I must inform the people about the advent of peace.

Dolph: Macellan, I shall not return to the military.
Macellan: Yeah, we oughta try and rebuild Archanea as part of its people.
Tomas: I'm coming along too. For the people of Archanea...

Radd: It's over at last. Now, we can save her. Aren't you glad, Caesar?
Caesar: Of course. And I have you to thank, Radd.

Navarre: ...
Feena: W-Wait, Navarre! Where're you going? Don't forget me! Wait for meeee!
Samto: Navarre! I want to become your disciple. Wait for meee!

Jake: Well, s'bout time I went back to Anna. Beck, what're you going to do?
Beck: I was reckonin' about a new journey. Let us meet by Anna's shop again, someday.

Ymir: I'm goin' back to the village. Everyone is waitin' for me.
Athena: Ve... Ve finally repaid favor. This voman vill return to her country...

Frost: I'm heading back home to my family. You two are really close, aren't you? You kinda remind me of my family.
Dice: That we are. Oh yeah, this 'ole family talk reminds me: I can't stay gamblin' forever. Gotta find a man for mah hardworkin' gal. Right, Maris?
Maris: Quit yer nonsense, Pops! I don't want no man!

Wolf: ...So it's over.
Sedgar: Yeah. Everything is...
Roshea: Coyote, did we do the right thing...?
Vyland: No, Roshea. Never question yourself.
Wolf: That's right. We must continue to fight. To clear Coyote's name.

Wendell: At last, a world without war is born. Merric, Elrean, you both did well.
Elrean: Teacher! The words you spoke to me... I think I understand them now. I must apologize to Merric...
Merric: Elrean... No apology is needed; I'm your friend. Ever since the day we met.
Etzel: Seeing the bonds of people dissolving the conflicts between them... 'Tis a promising new world indeed.

Sheema: The war is over. Samson, will you... stay with me from now on?
Samson: Didn't I already give you my answer, Sheema? I'll go anywhere you wish.

Tiki: Ban-Ban! Let's go to the village together again. It's been so long, I wanna see everyone!
Bantu: Ooh, indeed. Once they see your smile, I'm sure they'll all be happy, too.
Xane: Those guys are so carefree. But I suppose I can start slacking off as well.
Nagi: Indeed. I, too, can finally... return to my eternal sleep...

Marth: Thank you, Kris. For protecting and supporting me. No amount of thanks would be enough. But, among the people, your deeds are being told as things I've done alone... That just will not do. Once we return to the castle, I'll...
Kris: If you allow me, sire... I have no need for a name. I don't want stories to be told of me.
Marth: Kris...?
Kris: Sire. With this war now over, a hero will be needed. A hero called Prince Marth. There are still hostilities between people who have fought for so long. Those won't disappear easily. In order to have everyone's agreement, a king everyone recognizes-- a godlike hero is needed. And that hero must be you, sire, and you alone.
Marth: But then, what you've done so far will be...
Kris: Even if the world doesn't know, you do, sire, and that's enough for me. I shall stay by your side. I shall be your shadow.
Marth: Kris... You're... ...Why, I wonder? Ever since we met, I felt a special connection with you. Fate sent you to me... I can't help but think that. Thank you, Kris. Please stay with me. Kris, you're my other half, my true friend...

@Narration 
Thus, the long, tragic battle that would later be called the 'War of Heroes' finally came to an end. The seven kingdoms were unified under Prince Marth of Altea, and as the United Kingdom of Archanea was established, an era of peace began. The tales of the heroes who took part in this war brought excitement and tears to the later generations. Chronicles of the Archanean War of Heroes.. This is a story of love and courage, about the young warriors who fought with the continent's fate at stake...

@Intro 
Marth: Kris, just ahead is the Dark Pontifex, Gharnef--possibly the strongest sorcerer alive... or dead. Kris...
Marth: Your resistance to magic is impeccable. You might just be our strongest hope of defeating Gharnef. Yes. If you are there, then... we stand to win.
Kris: Sire... I'm honored. I'll give it my all!

@Battle 
Gharnef: So you've come, boy. How many times must you get in my way? Enough! I tire of our games!!
Marth: Gharnef, what have you done with my sister and the others?! Release them at once!
Gharnef: Heh heh heh... I've allowed them the honor of being sacrifices for the Shadow Dragon's resurrection. You will never see them again. Emperor Medeus will soon be reborn in his true and darkest form. And they will usher in a new era. 'Tis a pity. Their souls couldn't bear the suffering and shattered into pieces... Even I am powerless to help them. Shame, really. I have them to thank for the Shadow Dragon's awakening. Not even the Binding Shield can stop him now. I applaud you for coming this far. But... little prince... you will go no further. I will kill you here, and you will die knowing that you are nothing!!

@Boss 
Gharnef: Heh heh heh... Perhaps... a taste of Imhullu's might is necessary.

Gharnef: Heh heh... You're too late... The end is nigh...

%Marth,Gharnef
Gharnef: Your blade is blunt before me, Marth... I'll smash you and the Binding Shield into pieces!!
Marth: I do not intend to fall here. Out of my way, Gharnef!

Kris: I will not let Prince Marth die. I won't let the likes of you lay even a finger on him...!

@Opening 
Marth and his friends follow Xane, marching towards the northern lands. Before their eyes are walls of towering mountains, sheer cliffs, and deep valleys... After passing countless mountains, they are assaulted by scorching heat. Magma flowing like a river and rumbling like thunder blocks their way. Truly a dreadful scene, as if straight out of a nightmare.

@Intro 
Marth: This place... It's incredible... I feel as though I'm burning up just by standing here.
Xane: This is Flame Barrel... The fire dragons' graveyard. It's where the fire dragons who've degenerated into savage beasts come to wait for their death.
Marth: Degenerated, you say...? What do you mean by that?
Xane: I'm not sure if you're aware, but the dragon tribe is dyin'. Those who don't confine their true, dragon form in a stone eventually lose all reason and become monsters.
Marth: So that's why they become Manaketes? Xane, if you know something about the dragon tribe, please tell me.
Xane: If you really wanna know... Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragon tribe settled down on this continent, and created a civilization. They possessed intellect and abilities far exceedin' those of humans. But suddenly, outta nowhere, their day of destruction came. At first, they couldn't bear children. Then they began to lose their minds, goin' berserk one after the next. The elders warned that the end of dragons as a species was approachin'. There was no longer any way to prevent it. However, there was one way they could survive: to discard their identities as dragons and live on as humans. The dragons fell into a panic. Those who believed the elders sealed their forms within stones and became humans. But those who couldn't throw away their pride as a dragon; those who adamantly refused to become human... They eventually lost their minds and became naught but beasts...
Marth: Those fire dragons before us...
Xane: Yeah, they're a livin' example. And it's not just them. There are many others. But they've all gone feral now. There's no way for them to go back... Worse still, they've been manipulated and degraded like cattle by the fire clans who rule over this valley. Well, princey. Whadya say we get out of here? The clansmen around here ain't friendly; if we hang around, we'll end up as bait for their dragon pets.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Darros 
Marth: Darros! What brings you here?! I thought you had washed your hands of your pirating days...
Darros: Prince Marth... Forgive me. I was lookin' t'start anew, but there be no place t'go for an outcast like me... To resume and continue these crimes; 'tis dishonorable indeed.
Marth: I see... Darros, you cannot stay here. Come with us.
Darros: Prince Marth... Ye would still accept a fool like me...? Prince, I... This time, I be changin' for sure. Me life is yours!

@Recruit-Battle 
Darros: Please forgive me. I never wanted this.

Darros: Of course... 'Course I'd die... for what I've done...

@End 
Xane: Phew! And that be the end of the fire dragons' valley. How you doin', princey?
Marth: I'm fine... I think. Xane, I believe you said that there were other feral dragon tribes.
Xane: Yeah. In addition to this valley, there's the Wyvern's Dale, the Ice Dragon Shrine and the Dragon's Altar...
Marth: The Dragon's Altar?
Xane: It's a dragon graveyard in the mountains of Macedon. There, the earth dragons sleep. A long time ago... Thousands of years ago in fact... The mighty earth dragons lost their minds and attacked the humans. 'Course, the humans barely stood a chance. Most were annihilated, and the rest pushed into the desolate corners of the continent. And then... the divine dragon Naga, strongest of them all, waged a war for humanity. It was a fierce battle, but Naga emerged victorious in the end, and sealed the earth dragons below Dolhr, in a deep sleep. And so that the power of the seal would not wither, she created the "shield of the five orbs" and placed it in the Fane of Raman.
Marth: I see... I understand now. In other words, our guardian deity Naga depicted in legend was the divine dragon that saved humanity. But then, what about the divine sword Falchion?
Xane: Naga took pity on you humans, with no way of protecting yourselves, so she created it from one of her fangs. Then, together with the shield, she sealed it in the fane, and had the remainin' dragon houses watch over humanity. She put the newly born Tiki to sleep and thus ended her 5,000-year life. 'Cause of all this, Gotoh's tryin' his best to carry out Naga's order.
Marth: Wait, Xane... Are you telling me...!?
Xane: Yes: Gotoh is a divine dragon. And guess what? So am I.

Jagen: Blast... This heat is absurd. I wasn't sweating this much in the desert... I'm usually tolerant of heat, but this is simply unbearable... But Kris, you seem...
^start 
Jagen: You seem... unfazed. Are you not hot?
Kris: I have confidence in my strength. Sir Jagen, it seems that our companions are catching up to us. I'll go and carry them over here.
Jagen: What strength... It's as though you're invulnerable. Your reliability is astounding.

Jagen: You seem to be struggling too... Are you holding out alright?
Kris: Yes, I've still some strength in me. Sir Jagen, it seems that our companions are catching up to us. I'll go and support them.
Jagen: Good. I'm depending on you.

Jagen: You seem a little dizzy... Are you holding out alright?
Kris: No... I-I'm... not doing so well... Still... If I could just use my strength... Oh no, I feel all weak...
Jagen: Kris, are you well?! Oomph, how troublesome... You'd best hold onto me.
Kris: I-I'm sorry...
^end

Belf: Please pardon my sudden rudeness, but might you be Prince Marth?
Marth: Who are you...?
Belf: I am Belf, and these men here are Robert and Leiden. We rushed here because we wish to join your battle.
Robert: We were once knights of the Sable Order of Grust, but we have now separated from our homeland.
Leiden: We threw away our ranks as knights, and now live to protect those who are powerless.
Marth: The Sable Order of Grust... But in the previous war, we fought against the Sable Order as enemies. Despite that, you're willing to join our army?
Belf: Our general wished for us to protect the weak, regardless of nationality. He is gone now, so we would like to fulfill his final wish.
Marth: ............ I see. You seem to speak truly. Very well. I'd like you to fight alongside us.

@Opening 
Marth was unable to reunite with Princess Minerva, and so, in order to help Ogma and the Grustian royal children, he decided to visit Wendell, who was once the children's guardian.

However, the "Holm Beach" where Wendell resides is dominion of the infamous Macedonian Vikings. Countless pirates await in Marth's path. Will Marth be able to safely rescue the children...?

Marth: Kris, may I have a moment? Wh-what in the blazes!? M-may I ask, what happened to your hair?
Kris: Father Wrys cut my hair for me. Is something wrong, sire?
Marth: He, uh, certainly did. Well, if you like it, then wonderful. ...... W-well then, let's begin the war council.
Kris: Yes, sire.
^end 

Ogma: Yuliya, Jubelo. This place is notorious for the Macedonian Vikings. If we could, we'd stay the hell away, but the village where Lord Wendell resides is just past this area.
Jubelo: Mister Ogma... I'm scared... Can we go back...?
Yuliya: Jubelo! Get a hold of yourself! You're a man, are you not? Show some spine! You can use a Fire tome, can't you? So... fight with it!
Jubelo: But Master Wendell said that we mustn't fight... Besides, I don't like fighting.
Yuliya: Ugh, stop complaining! It's just you and me now. You have to stay strong, because I... sniff... I don't know what we're supposed to do...
Jubelo: Oh... I'm sorry, Yuliya... I'll do my best, so... please don't cry!
Ogma: Damn... This can't be good... We've been spotted. Kids, we've got no choice; we're going to have to cut through. Do not leave my side!

@Visit 
Boy: D'you know of a staff called Rescue? I hear you can bring faraway allies right next to you in a flash! It'd be so cool if it were true!

Girl: Oh, those "Star Shards" are so shiny and pretty. If you hold on to them, something good might happen to you.

Villager: These days, all them bandits and pirates've been doin' as they please. Geez. This wouldn't 'ave 'appened if it weren't for all them political tomfoolery.

Villager: Oh, you're... you're... the prince of Altea! How nice of you to drop by, sir!
Marth: I heard Lord Wendell was living here.
Villager: Yes, that, er... was correct... Yesterday, a group of Archanean soldiers suddenly came and took the pontifex away. Although, Prince... He did leave his magic tome behind. I believe it's wind magic. Please, take it with you.

Marth: Well, if it isn't Castor! What brings you to a place like this?
Castor: Ah, Prince Marth! Erm... Actually, I need money for medicine for me sick mother. But I couldn't find any work in Talys, so I moved here instead.
Marth: I see... That's terrible... I do hope your mother gets better. Well, goodbye then...
Castor: ......... Wait!! Me mother, she's really sick... I need money, sir...
Marth: Hm? Oh right, here. It's only a little, but I hope it helps.
Castor: Uhm... Thank you, Prince Marth. You don't have to be so kind to a guy like me...
Marth: Castor... That's a bit much... It's only natural to help someone in need.
Castor: No, Prince Marth! You've done so much for me. I want to help you. Please, let me fight alongside you. You have my life at your disposal!!

Ogma: And just who the hell are you? Are you in league with the pirates?
Sirius: I am Sirius, a mere traveler.
Ogma: Oh, I see. I'm a little bit worked up right now. Sorry about the mix-up.
Sirius: Those children...
Ogma: I'm taking care of them. Do you know them?
Sirius: No, I don't... But I do know that, as things stand, you won't escape with them. As I understand it, the Altean army should arrive here, provided you reach the southern village. Please, allow me to distract the bandits, while you make your escape to safety.
Ogma: I see. So Prince Marth is here, eh? Got it, thanks. I've got to ask though. Why help a group of complete strangers like us?
Sirius: I want to save the children. That is... all.
Ogma: I see... Sirius... You said your name was Sirius, right? Let's meet again after we both get out of here! There's someone I need to take care of... The guy in charge of Grust's occupation, Commander Lang. I want to avenge a man named Lorenz... You--join me...! If I've got you on my side, then I'll be that much stronger.
Sirius: Yes... That would be interesting. But first, you have to survive. Hurry and go!

Caeda: Marth!!
Marth: Caeda? Did something happen? Why are you here?
Caeda: Marth... Altea... Altea was attacked by the imperial army. The Archanean League... Gra and Aurelis ambushed us. Our forces were annihilated and we lost the castle...
Marth: Wh-what did you say?! This can't be happening! Altea is...
Kris: Damn! Our homeland has fallen to the enemy...
Jagen: This is terrible beyond words... That which I feared the most has come to pass. Emperor Hardin likely heard Lang's story, and had us branded traitors.
Marth: I refuse to believe it. Hardin would never attack Altea! You're telling me that he believed Lang and truly thought that I wished to instigate a rebellion? Never!
Jagen: No, I agree with you, sire. This attack was too soon. It happened far too quickly. For an attack of this scale, a great number of preparations had to have been in place. It is likely... that the Grust campaign was a setup. As was the situation in Macedon. It's quite simple, really. They had you leave Altea, with your elite knights in tow, and then proceeded to attack our weakened defenses. Hardin had this planned right from the start.
Marth: That's preposterous! Are you implying that Hardin--with no provocation whatsoever--decided to attack his fellow nation? Are you seriously suggesting this was all an elaborate trap? No! I won't accept it... Hardin... why?
Jagen: Sire... Princess Caeda, what of the others? Is Princess Elice safe?
Caeda: Elice, she... She gave herself up in order to let me escape with this message. Marth... I'm so sorry. She wanted me to warn you, no matter what... Sniff...
Marth: Caeda... Don't cry. I understand. Just knowing you're safe makes me happy. I should be the one apologizing. I shouldn't have left... You needn't have to go through this. We will take back Altea. Even if we have to fight Hardin, we WILL reclaim our homeland!

Jagen: Oh, by the way, Kris. About that hairstyle of yours... Have you decided to keep it that way?
Kris: ...Do you think it looks funny? Well, it'll grow back eventually, if I leave it alone... Do you think I should return it to normal?
Jagen: Well, it's your decision to make. You should do as you please. So what will it be? Are you going to go back to the hairstyle you had before?

^start 
Kris: Yeah. I'll have to apologize to Father Wrys later, but I think I'll change it back to normal.
Jagen: Yes. I do believe that would be a good idea.

Jagen: I-is that so? Well, if that's your wish, then I can hardly complain.

@Opening 
Once upon a time, the region of Macedon was a territory under Dolhrian rule. A century ago, the dragonkin rulers sent many slaves to these wild forests, to excavate ruins and build a country. Many slaves were forced to work to their limits, barely fed, and then slaughtered.
A young man stood up against such tragic conditions. Iote was his name. He and his companions fled to the forests and fought, astride wyverns, to free the slaves. After Dolhr's demise, the slaves established their own country in these now abundant lands. And the hero Iote was chosen as their first king. And so was born the Kingdom of Macedon, later feared as the domain of dracoknights.
However, the might Macedon was stripped of Prince Michalis, said to be the second coming of Iote, and is now on the brink of losing Princess Minerva, the so-called "Red Dragon."

Kris: Hah! Hyah!
Jagen: I see you train without the need for sleep. Most admirable, Kris.
Kris: Ah, Sir Jagen.
Jagen: A strong offense and a tough defense are obviously important, but... You cannot afford to neglect your skill. Without the skill to deliver it, it matters not how mighty your attack is if it does not reach the enemy. Speaking of which...
^start
Jagen: Your skill is like that of an expert... I have nothing to add. Keep up the good work.
Kris: Thank you, Sir Jagen.

Jagen: Your skill is not bad. Don't fall behind the other knights. The experience you gain from training and combat, will help elevate your skill further. Be ever diligent.
Kris: Yes, Sir Jagen.

Jagen: Your skill is still insufficient... It ought to be better than this. You may or may not have the talent for it, but don't give up... The more experience you gain from training and combat, the more you can refine your skill. Be ever diligent.
Kris: Y-yes, Sir Jagen.

Villager: This is just between you and me, but I heard that armory is in league with the rebels. If you're going to enter you should be careful not to get jumped.

Villager: I wonder what's going to happen to Macedon? They say that Prince Michalis is dead, and Princess Maria is nowhere to be found... On top of that, they say that Princess Minerva has been captured and that her life is in peril. I just hope... that this country doesn't end up like Grust...

Villager: You know, a little while ago, a paladin came here; said he was on a journey. He was wearing a mask, but I'm sure that underneath, he was a good person. He was kind, yet wrapped in a veil of sorrow. I wonder if I'll ever see him again...

Villager: The pegasus knight trio must be lonely without Est. And I was such a fan of their "Triangle Attack!" too... Oh, Est... Come home already, will ya?

Villager: Have you noticed the large drawbridge behind this village? Normally it's separated by the river, but if you use this key here, you can cross the bridge. Just, once you cross the drawbridge, the enemies on the other side will come and attack you at once. If you want to advance safely, you might be better off taking the long detour that goes right around the mountain. Here, take the key. No matter which path you take, do take care of yourself, m'kay?

Julian: Hey, Prince, it's been a while, hasn't it? It's me, Julian!
Marth: Julian? I'd heard that you'd gone to Macedon with Lena, but to think we'd cross paths here... How is Lena? Of course, she's with you, right?
Julian: Well, er, how should I say this... Lena suddenly up and vanished... I... I don't know what to do.
Marth: Wait, Julian, tell me what happened, in detail.
Julian: Lena's been missing since last night. The villagers speak of some sort of strange priest prowling around lately. It seems that somehow, Lena was taken by this man.
Marth: A priest...? Julian, as it turns out, Princess Maria has gone missing as well. I have a terrible feeling about this. Anyway, staying here won't solve anything. Come with us. I'm worried for Lena, too. We'll all help to look for her.
Julian: Prince Marth... Thank you. Nothing would please me more.

Rucke: U-uhh... but, Princess Minerva is barely breathing... Nobody could save her now...
Michalis: Do you want me to shove this spear down your throat? I said bring her to me.
Rucke: Y-yes, of course. S-somebody, bring the princess here!

Julian: You can relax... Lena and I would never work out. But even if it's just a little, I wanted to help her in any way I could.
Matthis: Ooh, you finally realized where you stand. Attaboy, Julian!
Julian: Er, that's not the kind of thing I want to be hearing from you... Well, whatever. If you're worried about Lena, then come with me.

Marth: What could have happened? She was supposed to be held inside the castle...
Lang: Oh-hoh, I knew this task was unworthy. Excellent work, Prince Marth. We'll take care of Macedon from here. Now, let us discuss your next mission.
Marth: General Lang, what in the world do you want this time?
Lang: Well, you see... My castle was attacked and the Grustian prince and princess were kidnapped. The perpatrator fled to Macedon, it seems. Prince Marth, you are to capture him and return the children to me!
Marth: You're asking me to send those children to their doom!
Lang: You're in no position to defy me. Now, off to work you go, my prince.
Kris: You...! Your rudeness towards my liege has gone too far...! Shut up! Prince Marth is not your minion!
Lang: What did you say?! Know your place, Altean soldier! Marth, it seems that your countrymen are devoid of manners!
Marth: ...I apologize on his/her behalf. But it is as Kris says: General Lang, I will no longer follow your orders from here.
Kris: Sire...!
Lang: What! Do you mean to defy my orders?! I see... I see. As I suspected, it was YOUR doing. The person who kidnapped Grust's prince and princess was the mercenary, Ogma. On your orders, no less!
Marth: I didn't know of this. But if I had the choice, I would have done exactly as you suggested. Back at Grust, even though they were meant to be our enemies, I should have helped those children.
Lang: You! You clearly speak words of treason! Perhaps I should report this to the Emperor!
Marth: Do as you will. But you're not the only person who intends to visit the palace. I will speak to Emperor Hardin and Princess Nyna and inform them of your crimes. Forgive me, Jagen. But I cannot stand for this any longer.
Jagen: I understand. You have endured well until now. Lang, my liege might forgive your frequent rudeness to him, but I will not. Come, draw your sword. Even though I, Jagen, am old and senile, I will not lose to the likes of you.
Lang: Wh... what did you say?! Damn you... I'll remember this!! Once the Emperor gets wind of this, I'll crush your puny little Altea!
Marth: Jagen... you're a bag of surprises. To think you'd stand up against Lang like that.
Jagen: Sire, are you underestimating me in my old age? Bwahaha... I'm not about to let youngsters like Kris hog all the glory just yet. Still, I'll admit it was somewhat foolish to contest with Lang, even if he did push my lord at every turn.
Kris: Sire, Sir Jagen. What is our next plan of action?
Marth: According to Lang, Ogma is on his way to Macedon. He probably intends to visit the village where Lord Wendell resides.
Kris: Lord Wendell?
Marth: Lord Wendell is a pontifex of Khadein; he fought as our ally in the last war. I hear he's living in Macedon now. It also happens that the children that Ogma saved were raised by Lord Wendell So I'm sure it would be the perfect time to pay him a visit.
Kris: Yes, understood.
Jagen: But, I worry about Lang... I pray that nothing bad shall happen...

Jagen: Kris, are you aware that we've been searching for the assassins who besieged Altea a year ago...?
Kris: Ah! I assume, since you're mentioning it, that you've found a new lead?
Jagen: We're not certain, but we've received information that might lead us to them. A few days ago, I heard of a suspicious group heading towards Macedon's northern mountains.
Marth: The northern mountains? What could they be after up there?
Jagen: Rumors say they are pursuing our former allies in the War of Shadows... And I don't believe they're after a friendly chat with them either.
Marth: I see. Then we cannot ignore this lead, especially if lives are at stake. Jagen, Kris, we shall pursue the enemy.
Jagen: Agreed. Let us prepare to march, with haste.

A stone bridge leading up the tall rocky mountain. This stone bridge seems to stretch to the heavens, as it spirals around. From the rocks fearful roaring and breathing sounds can be heard, as if the mountain was alive. The Dragon's Table... It is asn ancient ruin of the dragon tribe, and the place where the Divine Dragon King, Naga, sealed away the Earth Dragons. Now, after a period of 600 years, the Earth Dragons are currently awakening, and countless evil demons are being born...

@Intro 
Marth: ...... That's, uh, certainly one heck of a hat... A gift from Ymir, I presume?
Kris: Yes. It keeps me warm. Although I'm worried that it'll stand out...
Marth: I should be, if I were you. If you stepped out on the battlefield wearing that, you'd be a popular target...

@Battle 
Gotoh: Prince Marth, in this altar lurks many savage barbarians and mage dragons long gone mad. They have fallen under Gharnef's spell and will attack you given the chance. Gharnef's servants-- the heretic priests possess great power. They are not to be taken lightly. If you let this battle drag on, it may become fiercer than you can handle. Do not stop. Make for the end at once! Once you defeat Gharnef, retrieve the Falchion that he stole from your Altea. As you well know, without the Falchion, defeating Medeus will be nigh impossible...
Marth: I understand, Lord Gotoh. My friends and I shall sally forth to the deepest depths of the altar!
Gotoh: It would be wise to bring this ally with you. She has deigned to lend you her strength.
Nagi: ......
Marth: You're...
Kris: Another ally from the previous war, sire?
Marth: No, I don't believe we've ever met. But, why...? I have the strangest feeling that I know her...
Nagi: My name... is Nagi. I will... stop the enemy... You must hurry to the throne room... Go... This time... everything... must end......

@End 
Kris: Sire! Look, stairs! They probably lead further in. We must hurry, sire!
Marth: Right, Kris! ...By the way, do you intend to wear that hat from here on out?
Kris: Actually, I'm not entirely sure. It's very warm, as Sir Ymir said, but I stick out like a sore thumb...
Marth: Indeed, the enemies looked surprised. Well, what is your decision? Are you going to take it off?
^start 
Kris: Yes, I think I will remove it for this battle.
Marth: Excellent choice. Well, let's hurry!

Kris: No, I rather like it. It's so toasty.
Marth: I-I see. Well then, let's go!

@Opening 
It is the second month of the third year in the history of the empire... Archanea's holy city of Pales is in the midst of a time of mysterious silence. Archanea, because of a civil war begun by the paladin Midia, has arrested many capable knights. However, Archanea still has twice the military power of Altea to fill the streets of Pales with. It has already been nearly a whole year since the expedition to Grust. And now, at long last, the final battle, which would decide the fate of both countries, was about to begin...

@Intro 
#avatar-F
Marth: As expected, the Archanean army is extremely powerful. We must approach with great caution.
Kris: It seems that Hardin has assembled his entire army for the battle.
Jagen: Even so, the people have lost their faith in Emperor Hardin. They welcome us as liberators. It is certainly very reassuring. This is our final battle. It may drag on but all the same, I would ask that you take utmost care.
Marth: Kris, the enemy is the Archanean imperial army. The continent's strongest and most renowned military force. It's strange, but I'm not afraid. Kris, if you're here, then everything will be okay. Everyone, let's go!

Kris: Yes, sire! Please leave it to me!
Marth: Everyone, let's go!

@Battle 
Vyland: I knew it. You intend to invade Coyote's palace. The king forbade us from interfering... But I will do anything to protect Coyote! I'll defy his edict if I have to!

@Recruit-Visit 
Roshea: Prince Marth... It is I, Roshea of the Wolfguard. I received King Aurelis's pardon and have been waiting for you. I am truly sorry for the battle of the pass. I realize that an apology means little, so I will now fight under your banner. But... the other Wolfguard members have all sided with the Archanean army. I wonder if I could persuade them. Vyland, at the least... Vyland might listen to what I have to say.

@Visit 
Woman: Emperor Hardin was once a kind man, but he suddenly changed into such a frightening Emperor... Ah... If I say things like this, I will get killed as well.

Young man: Midia is the pride of Archanea. She was the daughter of th highest officer of Archanea, Duke Owen. This rebellion only came about because she could not stand and watch us suffer. No matter what, you must rescue her.

Young woman: We thought that Nyna and Hardin's marriage would finally bring peace to the world, yet this happened. Oh deities... What should we do...?

Old man: Midia is really pitiful. She only just retired as a knight to live together with Astram, and now she has been separated again. She's still a young girl, it's so sad. What can you do to help her...?

Man: The Archanea army has changed. The troops are all bloodthirsty savages now. What is going on with this country?

Old man: Oh, this is so sad. Those that opposed Emperor Hardin have all been killed... Could the Emperor be possessed by a demon...?

@Recruit-Talk 
%Roshea,Vyland 
Roshea: Vyland! Why are you here? The king told us not to interfere. Aha! Have you decided to join the Altean army like me?
Vyland: Roshea, I came to bring you back. Why have you turned to the Alteans? We are Coyote's subordinates. Open your eyes! You're being deceived!
Roshea: You're wrong, Vyland. The time I spent with the Alteans was short, but I know one thing for sure. It's not as Coyote says. They're not evil people.
Vyland: Roshea...
Roshea: Vyland, please. I don't want to fight all of you. Especially you, Vyland...
Vyland: ............ Well, Roshea... You were always the kindest out of us in the Wolfguard.. You've always been able to tell which were the good guys, and which were the bad. I can't fight you, Roshea. If you, our brother-in-arms, are this sure, then I believe you. I am your ally from now on.
Roshea: Vyland...!

%Vyland,Sedgar 
Vyland: Sedgar, hold on. It's me, Vyland.
Sedgar: What's the meaning of this, Vyland? Don't tell me you've defected!?
Vyland: Listen, Sedgar. I--I don't know. What am I supposed to do? I loved Coyote like a brother. All I wanted was to fight for him. But... But he has changed for the worse. It's as though he's someone else now...
Sedgar: ......
Vyland: I wanted to serve him, always. That's why I've been turning a blind eye. I shut myself, trying to remember the Coyote who loved us so long ago. It really hurt to face the truth. That Coyote's not who he used to be... I just don't know anymore. Hey, Sedgar... What the hell am I supposed to do?
Sedgar: Vyland... I too... I feel the same way. I know he's gone insane, but I looked the other way and blocked my senses. One day, he'll go back to being our Coyote... That's what I kept telling myself.
Vyland: Roshea has gone over to the Alteans. I cannot fight him. Sedgar, you should come too. I don't know what's right anymore. But I don't want to fight you, either.
Sedgar: Yes... Even though Coyote's madness was clear to me, I did nothing. I have to make this right.

%Sedgar,Wolf 
Sedgar: Wolf! Hold your fire!
Wolf: Sedgar! What are you doing?! So you've chosen to betray Coyote?!
Sedgar: No, it's not like that! This is for Coyote's own good! Something's wrong with Coyote. Even you must know that!
Wolf: That changes nothing! I will die at Coyote's side! I swore as much! Though all of you might betray us. Though I might be alone. I will not abandon him!
Sedgar: Even though you disobey his heart?
Wolf: What do you mean!?
Sedgar: Wolf, do you remember what Coyote said to you, the day you became commander of the Wolfguard?
Wolf: ......!
Sedgar: "If I should wander from the path of the righteous, please... lead me back onto it." That's what he said.
Wolf: I should never have forgotten. The words of Coyote himself... But, to tell me that time has come... That we must... That we must defeat Coyote...
Sedgar: We have to remind Coyote of the day we swore allegiance to him. No matter how painful it may be... That is our only recourse. I never wanted to believe it would come to this...
Wolf: Enough, Sedgar! For goodness sake... It would have been better had I died at Adria Pass... I am the commander of the Wolfguard... The life that Coyote gave me... I will not waste it. Even if that should lead to Coyote's death...

@Boss 
Nehring: What...? Our Archanea has been defeated? But as long as I'm here, I won't let you enter the castle!

Nehring: Glory to the Emperor...

@End
Boah: Oh, Lord Marth. I've been waiting for you.
Marth: Boah!? You've suffered a grave wound... What happened?
Boah: Mmm... It was truly frightening... I suppose the Archanea royal family is indeed under a curse. You should know about Hardin and Nyna's marriage, two years ago. To restore Archanea, a king was required, and only two people were suitable. King Aurelis's younger brother, Hardin, and Altea's Prince Marth, you... Those were the choices, and we pleaded for Nyna to make the final decision. Originally, she wanted to wait a while longer, but we begged for her to make up her mind immediately. In the end she said that choosing Prince Marth as her husband would hurt Princess Caeda, so she finally decided on Hardin.
Marth: Wait a second, wasn't that a little harsh on Nyna? I understand that Archanea needed a king, but Nyna, she already...
Boah: You are referring to Grust's Lord Camus? But that would be unspeakable... Unthinkable in fact. Princess Nyna was the sole successor of the royal bloodline of Archanea. I felt bad as well, but for this country we had no other choice. However, Lord Hardin was very happy. Compared to ascending Archanea's throne, he seemed happier about the fact that Nyna chose him for her husband.
Marth: I also understand Hardin's feelings. He could sacrifice his own life for Nyna. But, did he know about Camus? If he did, I don't believe he would be so happy.
Boah: Mmm... Of course we kept that a secret, and we also persuaded Nyna to hide it as best as she could. But, Lord Hardin was a very sensitive man. He quickly found out that Nyna's heart had no place for him. He felt very painful... He locked himself in his room, and didn't allow anybody to see him. Taking advantage of his broken heart, Gharnef appeared. He took on the guise of a merchant to approach Hardin, and showed him the Darksphere. The distraught Hardin was quickly consumed by the orb. From that day on, he completely changed. It was because I was only focused on restoring this country that I committed such a horrendous mistake. Please, forgive me, Prince Marth...
Marth: I can't believe all that happened. ..... Where is Nyna now?
Boah: When Hardin discovered that she had taken the Fire Emblem, he had her confined in her room. After that, she would still communicate in secret with me. However, Hardin found out and then wounded me. He also handed Nyna over to Gharnef.
Marth: Gharnef...!?
Boah: Mmm... Gharnef had always wanted to take Nyna. He said that the resurrection of the dark dragon required the blood of noble clerics... And so... He took Nyna... To use her as a live sacrifice... Lord Marth, I'm already done for. I will give my Thoron and Physic to you. I beg of you, please rescue Nyna. Even if Archanea is destroyed it no longer matters... I only wish for Nyna to be safe...
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Seeking the Lightsphere, Marth and his friends headed for the Tower of Thabes.

Thabes is an ancient city buried under the sands, along with many treasures. The legend of Thabes, city of illusion, lured many adventurous men to the desert. However, in the end... not one of them ever returned. As the sages once said... stay clear of Mamorthod, the desert of death. There lies the cursed Dark City.

@Intro 
^locked 
Marth: Huh...? W-who's there?
Kris: Sire, it's me, Kris.
Marth: Oh, it's just you.... You had me startled for a moment. Especially with that mask on you...
Kris: Is it that strange?
Marth: Well... perhaps a little. Do you mean to fight like that?
Kris: Yes.
Marth: I-I see.
^end 

Marth: Jagen, where in the world are we...?
Jagen: This is the path depicted in the Anri Saga. The first obstacle in Anri's Way: the Desert of Death. With its scorching sun, raging sandstorm, savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns that soar and dominate the skies. As the city of illusion shimmers in the distance, we can only stand and gaze... Or so the legend has it.
Marth: So Anri came through here as well. And by himself, too...
Jagen: That's right. Your ancestor and Altea's founder, King Anri... To save Princess Artemis, he set out on a journey to seek the Divine Blade Falchion.
Marth: King Anri was strong. I wouldn't be able to cross through here alone. I'm truly grateful to those who offered to accompany me through this desert.
Kris: I think everybody wishes to follow you, sire. Everyone wants to be with you. Wherever you go, they will follow. That's what I believe. It's because of your kindness, sire.
Marth: Thank you. I don't have Anri's power. But I have all of you. Wonderful companions like you, Kris. That's how I can keep going. Let's go, Kris.
Kris: Understood.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Caeda,Jake 
Caeda: Jake! What are you doing all the way out here...?
Jake: Is that you, Caeda? Hey, long time no see. I'm here to meet my beloved Anna.
Caeda: Huh? Anna lives in a place like this?
Jake: Oh, you didn't know? Anna's running a secret shop out here. It's a tiny bit troublesome coming here, but y'know, love conquers all barriers! Your turn Caeda. What're you doing in the desert?
Caeda: Listen, Jake. We're fighting for the peace of the continent again. Could you help us, like old times...?
Jake: I dunno, I kinda lost my ballista, so I doubt I'd be much use to you.
Caeda: That's not true. You'd help us a lot just by being there...
Jake: Aw, shucks. How could I say no when you say it like that? I bet Anna's worried about the war too. Alrighty, I'll join you then.

@Recruit-Battle 
Jake: What?! M-more bandits?

Jake: Anna... I'm... sorry...

@End 
Tiki: Mar-Mar!! It's been aaages. It's me, Tiki! I've wanted to see you for so long.
Marth: Huh... Tiki?! You came to welcome us? Oh, I see... you've been living with Lord Gotoh, haven't you?
Kris: Sire, do you know this little girl?
Marth: Yes. This is Tiki, a companion of ours during the war. Tiki was a great boon to our cause. She mowed down legions of enemy dragons with her tremendous power.
Kris: What?! This little girl did that...?
Marth: But you've certainly grown since last time. I'm glad to see you're well.
Tiki: Yeah... But I was so lonely. 'Cause you never came to see me...
Marth: I'm sorry. But I could never forget about you. I had intended to invite you back to Altea once things had calmed down.
Tiki: Mar-Mar... I... I love you!
Marth: What......?!
Xane: ...Gotcha!
Marth: Xa... Xane!!!
Kris: What the...?! T-the little girl is now a man!
Xane: Oopsy daisy. Took you by surprise, didn't I? Particularly you over there, newbie. I'm Xane. A friend of Marth's. Transformin' into other people's a special ability of mine. Hey princey, my Tiki impression was pretty darn tootin', wasn't it? Did I provide some comic relief? Well, shall we get goin'? You wanted to see Lord Gotoh, right?
Marth: Xane, how do you know Lord Gotoh? Just who are you?
Xane: Well, lemme see. I don't think that really matters right now. Hey, put that jaw back in place and follow me.

Marth: Kris, I noticed you fighting with that mask on.
Kris: Yes. The desert sun was strong, but it acted as a shield. Nevertheless, I suppose there's little point in wearing it now.
Marth: I see. Are you going to remove it then?
^start
Kris: Yes. I think I shall.
Marth: Yes, that's probably a good idea.

Kris: No. I'll keep fighting with it on.
Marth: I-is that so...? Does it not bother you in any way?
Kris: Not at all. I can fight just fine with it on.
Marth: I-I see. Well, if that's what you've decided then I have no problems with it.

@Intro 
Jagen: Sire, Lord Horace should be inside this fort.
Kris: It seems the enemy has already infiltrated the building. Please be careful, sire.
Marth: All right. Let us fight with caution.

Legion: Uwee hee hee... Horaces, was it? Youses a stubborn ones... Yous already killed three of our brotherses. But there are mores of us... moreses, moreses, moreses! How longs can you last? Uwee hee!
Horace: Who the hell are you? Who gave you the orders to attack me?
Legion: Uwee hee hee. Who knowses? We sure don't. But really, poor yous! You'll be killed by us, and won't even knows why!
Horace: My life isn't my own. Ever since I became a knight, my life is for my liege and my people. I cannot be defeated by cowards like you.
Legion: Uwee hee hee! Bring it on!! We are Legion. There are manys of us and ones of us, all in oneses. Want to knows how to defeats us, hmm? Simple. Just kills the real Legion. But can you findses the real Legion?! Uwee hee hee!!!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Kris,Horace
Horace: You are Kris, Prince Marth's Royal Guard, correct? 'Tis an honor to meet you. I am Horace, an Archanean knight in the service of Princess Nyna. Prince Marth saved me in the previous war. For Princess Nyna's sake, please allow me the privilege of fighting alongside you.

@Battle 
Legion: Uwee hee hee! You can kills us and kills us again. But there are mores of our brotherses... moreses, moreses, moreses of us! As longs as the real Legion is still standing, there'll be no end to the Legion... Uwee hee!!!

@Boss 
Legion: Uwee hee hee!!! Are we real or are we false? Try us and see!!!

Legion: Uwee hee... hee... how did you... know...?

@End 
Kris: Sire, the remaining enemies have fled. Victory is ours.
Marth: Good work. But either way, that was a strange enemy. Were they even human...?
Jagen: I've heard rumors about them. Those wicked assassins crushed their souls when they were young, and raised them as living puppets who follow orders without question...
Marth: How pitiful... Kris. I wonder if Katarina was raised under such circumstances, as well...
Kris: ...
Marth: However, we can't do anything about that now. Let us go ahead. To Anri's Way, where Lord Gotoh awaits.

Kris: Sir Jagen, I've found something most odd inside the castle. It's this mask. It seems like a different type from the one those assassins wore, but what's it for...?
Jagen: Heh... This is a mask for use in a masquerade ball, I believe.
Kris: Masquerade ball?
Jagen: Yes. Noblemen once donned these masks in order to conceal their identities. They were probably used in this old castle a long time ago. So, it's unrelated to the assassins.
Kris: I see... But, it sure is a strange mask.
Jagen: What of it? Don't tell me you intend to wear it?
^start 
Kris: Yes. For some reason, I feel like giving it a try.
Jagen: You are an odd one. Well, do as you wish.

Kris: No, I'll leave it where I found it.
Jagen: Yes, good idea.

Katarina: Lady Eremiya... I have a report. Legion, he...
Eremiya: I see, so he failed. Even though I took such good care of him... Such a troublesome child.
Katarina: Lady Eremiya, the Altean army is strong. Now that Legion has been defeated... Perhaps we should refrain from pursuing them.
Eremiya: No. Crushing Altea was an order of his.
Katarina: But...
Clarisse: What? Reese, don't tell me you're afraid?
Katarina: Clarisse...
Clarisse: Lady Eremiya, please allow me the honor. I'll take care of them.
Eremiya: My, you're a good girl, Clarisse. Would you?
Clarisse: Anything for you, Lady Eremiya.
Katarina: ... Lady Eremiya, about the remaining Legion brothers...
Eremiya: Ah, those. Get rid of all of them.
Katarina: Lady Eremiya...!
Eremiya: They can't fight now that they've lost Legion, can they? So, they're useless now. Broken junk is to be discarded.
Katarina: B-but, Lady Eremiya... They were with us in the orphanage... with you too, Lady Eremiya...
Eremiya: So what?
Katarina: ...
Clarisse: Reese, you sure are useless, aren't you? Don't worry, Lady Eremiya. I'll get rid of them.
Eremiya: My, Clarisse is such a good little girl. Completely different from a certain failure.
Clarisse: Ah, Lady Eremiya... Your praise makes me happy.

Kris: Yes, at once.

@Intro 
Radd: We did it, Caesar! Our ambush was a success. They're completely surrounded. Tactical victory is ours.
Caesar: I see. However, don't lower your guard. Our enemy is the Altean army... We know how strong they are.
Radd: But Caesar, are you really fine with this? We did fight under Altea's banner in the previous war...
Caesar: We're mercenaries. We have no liege. I need gold, and will do anything for it. Even selling my soul to the devil.
Radd: Gold, huh... Indeed, when we get the reward from Emperor Hardin... I'm sure we could save her. Alright, let's do it, Caesar!
Caesar: Radd, there's no need for you to follow me. My sister is my business. The Altean army is strong. You'll die if you're careless.
Radd: I'm doing this for my own interests too. So I'll tag along with you, Caesar. As I always have, and always will.
Caesar: Very well. Then, let's go!

Clarisse: Legion, you're ready, I presume?
Legion: Yes, yes, yesss! It's finally time for us allses! Uwee hee hee!!! Togethers with those mercenaries, we'll gives Marth a royal funeral!
Clarisse: It seems some of those mercenaries were Marth's allies in the previous war. I do wonder if they'll be of any use.
Legion: So whats? Doesn't matters. If they're uselesses, all we have to do is kills him ourselves.
Clarisse: Bah, I don't like you getting the best part. Oh well, do whatever you want.

@Recruit-Battle 
Caesar: The time for words is gone. Fighting is all we can do, now.

Caesar: You win, Prince Marth. I should have known you weren't a foe we could defeat with petty tricks. I surrender. Kill me or whatever; I'm all yours.
Marth: Caesar, I'd like to hire you and Radd if possible. I want you to come with us. You and Radd fought by my side in the previous war. You're both my comrades.
Caesar: Prince, forgive me, but we're mercenaries. All we did in the previous war was fulfill our duties as hired swords.
Marth: It might have been just a job for you two... But not to me. Both of you are my precious comrades. You were then, and still are now.
Caesar: Prince... I appreciate your willingness to say such kind words to mercenaries like us. However, at the end of the day, we're hired swords. Therefore, we ask for gold. Prince, Archanea occupies your country. It's obvious you don't have the extra resources needed to pay us.
Marth: Well, you have a point...
Kris: Gold shouldn't be an issue. Prince Marth will reclaim Altea, our homeland. Altea may be occupied by Archanea now, but we shall defeat them. And then, you'll have the gold you seek.
Caesar: Do you... honestly think you stand a chance? Against a powerful kingdom like Archanea?
Kris: Of course. Besides, I'm sure you don't have a choice, at this point. Since you've failed your mission, Archanea won't pay you the gold you seek anymore. If you're a hired sword working for gold, following Prince Marth would serve your interests better. Am I wrong?
Caesar: ...Indeed, your argument is sound. As we've failed, we have no other options. Prince Marth, Radd and I are now your hired swords. We shall accompany you for as long as you wish us to.
Marth: Thank you, Caesar.

Radd: No... Caesar...
Marth: Radd... You have my condolences. Radd, I'd like to hire you if possible. I want you to come with us. You and Caesar fought by our side in the previous war. You're both my comrades.
Radd: ...Me, work for you? Sure thing, Prince Marth. But I hate you guys. I could just feign joining you, Prince, and then try and kill you, y'know?
Marth: I don't mind.
Radd: Eh...?
Kris: Sire...!
Marth: Radd, listen to me. Caesar is dead... We killed him. And that's why I ask this of you. I don't want this... I don't want comrades killing each other!
Radd: ...Prince Marth...
Kris: Radd. This is the first time we meet. I don't know your connection with Caesar. However, I know this. Caesar's death... pains Prince Marth as much as it pains you...
Radd: ...
Kris: Radd, Prince Marth will be even sadder if you die, too. We don't want to repeat that tragedy again. So, please...
Radd: ...Alright. Prince Marth, if you so wish, then I'll tag along with you. I'll accept the money once this war is over. For Caesar's sake, too, I must save that girl...
Marth: Thank you, Radd.

Caesar: We lose, Prince Marth. I should have known you weren't a foe we could defeat with petty tricks. Kill me. Send me to where Radd is waiting.
Marth: Caesar, I'd like to hire you, if possible. I want you to come with us. You and Radd fought by my side in the previous war. You're both my comrades.
Caesar: Prince, forgive me, but we're mercenaries. All we did in the previous war was fulfill our duties as hired swords. Besides, do you think I'd just agree? Now that Radd's been killed...
Marth: That's right, Radd is dead... We killed him. But that's exactly why I'm asking this of you. I don't want this... I don't want comrades killing each other anymore!
Caesar: ...Prince Marth...
Kris: Mercenary commander Caesar. This is the first time we meet. I don't know your connection with Radd. However, I know this. Radd's death... pains Prince Marth as much as it pains you...
Caesar: ...
Kris: Caesar, Prince Marth will be even sadder if you die, too. We don't want to repeat that tragedy again. So, please...
Caesar: ...Very well. While I'm not fully convinced... This was something I brought upon myself. I have no right to blame others for it. Prince Marth, from now on I'm in your service. I shall accompany you for as long as you wish it.
Marth: Thank you, Caesar.

Kris: Sire, the battle is over.
Marth: Kris, Caesar and Radd were... our comrades in the previous war. Jeorge too, to think we'd be fighting our former comrades like this...
Jagen: Sire, you must be strong. Now that Archanea has become our enemy, we'll have to face this kind of situation many times over. But don't worry, sire. You will always have Kris and me--your loyal retainers--by your side.
Marth: Thank you, Jagen, Kris. It's only because you're with me that I can walk forward. Let us go, to the Fane of Raman.

@Opening 
Having liberated Grust, Marth and his companions accepted Wendell's request and stopped by the Fane of Raman in search of the missing orbs. However, the ancient temple built to worship Naga had been wrecked by constant warring, and was now nothing more than a den of thieves.

"They're escaping with the temple's valuable treasures. We must catch them! Stay clear of the free company guarding Chiasmir Bridge. We cannot defeat them. It seems a dancer is lost inside the forest. We must find her before the bandits do!"

As the soldiers received their orders, the flames of a new battle around the Fane of Raman were ignited.

Jagen: By the way, Kris. I have something I'd like to ask you.
Kris: Yes, Sir Jagen?
Jagen: From your perspective, what kind of person am I?
Kris: What kind... of person?
Jagen: I keep wondering about how I should have acted towards Lang... Our homeland Altea's position is important, but perhaps I brood far too much and offend people.
Kris: You worry about these things too, Sir Jagen? You needn't worry. Your concern for Prince Marth is more than evident. You're very strict, Sir Jagen, but also very kind.
Jagen: Is that so...? Ho ho, if you cheer me on enough, I may even age backwards!
Kris: Sir Jagen, when you look at me, what kind of person do you see?
Jagen: Hmm, well... You're very capable as a Royal Guard...
^start
Jagen: And you have an aura that attracts people.
Jagen: And you're wise, almost foresighted.

Jagen: And I can feel a hidden genius somewhere.

Jagen: And you have a kind heart.

Jagen: And you have an indisputably strong heart.
^end
Jagen: That's the kind of person you are.
Kris: What an honor.
Jagen: Well, we'd best begin the war council. Let us go, Kris.
Kris: Yes, Sir Jagen.

Phina: Huff... huff... Please... help me... The thieves... They're going to...
Navarre: ...
Phina: No, it can't be! You're... one of them... as well? Oh, fine... Do your worst! If you're going to kill me, do it fast!!
Navarre: Girl... Get behind me. The Altean army is marching towards the south of this forest. I'll take you to them.
Phina: Huh? You're going to help me? You mean, you're not with the thieves?
Navarre: Until just now, I was. But, I've changed my mind.
Phina: Why...?
Navarre: There's someone in the Altean army that I want to see. That's all.
Phina: Hmmm... But really, it's 'cause I'm cute, right? At any rate, I'm glad. My name's Phina. I'm a dancer from Warren. People say that once they see my dancing, they feel instantly refreshed! I can show you, if you like. Oh, I should tell you my story: I got separated from my troupe, and wandered into this forest. And then, those horrible thieves came and tried to take me by force... But it's okay now. You seem kind of scary, but actually you're very kind. However, your appearance is... Your face isn't bad, but your dress sense is kind of lacking. And, ugh, what's with your hair? You know, nowadays...
Navarre: Just stop talking! Anyway, don't stray too far. We'll cut our way to the west corner, and then escape through there. If you want to live, then shut up and come with me.
Phina: Ah... Y-yes, sorry...

@Visit 
Villager: The ancient Fane of Raman is just a treasure trove to thieves. You can see 'em carrying the stolen treasure all over the place. I hope they get cursed or something...

Villager: The ones protecting the bridge are Astram's free company: powerful men who stop at nothing. As a wise man once said: "Let sleeping dogs lie", eh?

Villager: I wonder if you've seen that young lady's dance? Marvelous, isn't it? Makes a tired body feel healthy again in the blink of an eye!

Villager: You must never go near that cave. I heard a rumor that in that cave dwells a terrible fire dragon.

@Battle 
Soldier: Captain Astram, we've sighted the Altean army to the south! Shall we attack?
Astram: Our mission is to hold the bridge. Leaving the bridge will not be permitted. Only attack if the enemy approaches.
Soldier: Yes sir. But what about the troops in the fort? I hear they will march out soon.
Astram: They were bought with coin by the Emperor. Let them do as they please. Either way, they won't win. WE will be the ones to stop the Altean army.

Jagen: Sire, please exercise caution! Reports indicate that a fire dragon has emerged from the cave to the west!

@Recruit-Battle 
Astram: Traitors! I'll show you the might of the Mercurius!

Astram: Midia... My love...

@Boss 
Dahl: Tryin' to take a cut from a thief's plunderin'... You people ain't even human!

Dahl: Murderers... the lot of you...

@End 
Jagen: Sire, we've driven away the thieves, but the temple was completely ransacked; anything that wasn't nailed down is gone. I'm sure even Guardian Deity Naga would be furious. 'Tis truly the end of civilzation.
Marth: Jagen, do you know the legend of Naga?
Jagen: Yes; only vaguely, however. Kris, do you know of it?
Kris: No, not really...
Jagen: Unknown among the youth, I see... Then, sire, allow me the honor.
Jagen: It's said that a thousand years ago... when there was not one king in the lands, people lived in small villages. One day, terrible monsters descended and the humans were massacred, pushed to the brink of extinction. The few who survived prayed to the gods for salvation. The gods heard their prayers, and a gigantic warrior was sent down to earth. The warrior carried a gleaming blade of light in his right hand, and in his left hand, a shield embedded with five orbs. Then, after a fierce battle, he eradicated the monsters and returned to the heavens. He was our guardian deity, Naga, and this temple is dedicated to him. "He was the avatar of the gods: our guardian deity..."
Marth: With the blade of light and the five orbs... That is the legend of Naga...
Jagen: Well then, sire. We have to cross the Chiasmir Bridge soon. We must hurry; if the enemy takes it, getting across will be nigh impossible.
Marth: Alright then, inform the whole army: We cross Chiasmir Bridge at once. We haven't a moment to waste!
Kris: Yes sir!

Kris: Lord Wendell, we're off to Chiasmir Bridge. I... A-achoo!
Wendell: Oh dear, are you alright? Have you caught a cold?
Kris: Perhaps. It's too early to tell.
Wendell: Don't push yourself too hard, and remember to keep yourself warm. Oh I know, shall I lend you one of the hats that I'm wearing?
Kris: Huh? Is that okay?
Wendell: Yes, I have many of these hats, so there's no need to worry. Well then, would you like to try it on?

^start 
Kris: Yes, please, if it's not a bother.
Wendell: No, no, don't be shy. Here you go. And do remember to watch your health.
Kris: You're a good person, Lord Wendell. I want to be more like you... Oh yeah, if I wear this hat for a while, I wonder if my hair will start to look like his? And then, maybe I'll be a bit more like Lord Wendell!

Kris: No thank you, but I appreciate the gesture. I'll be just fine.
Wendell: I understand. But, do remember to watch your health.

@Intro 
Jagen: Sire, we have detected an enemy presence in the mountains. It seems there is a battle ongoing.
Marth: Alright. Jagen, Kris, let us hurry with our preparations!

Wrys: So I'm surrounded... How sad, I guess this is the end of the road for me...

Clarisse: Alright, he's right where we want him. Now to savor his pain as we slowly draw the life from his tormented soul...
Katarina: Clarisse... The Altean army has arrived.
Clarisse: Tsk! What a nuisance. Reese, I hate to admit it but you were right about this outcome. Alteans never abandon their comrades... You sure learned a lot about that trash from your time staying with them.
Katarina: ...
Clarisse: My job is to kill, one by one, everyone who sided with Marth in the previous war. Because if his allies live, they'll eventually join him, one after another. And that would be dangerous.
Katarina: ... Clarisse, are you really up for the task?
Clarisse: I don't need to get MY hands dirty, do I? My underlings can get the job done. We're hardly dealing with strong enemies.
Katarina: You'll die if you underestimate Kris and the others, Clarisse. I served as Kris's tactician, but I wasn't much help as one; I didn't give them the advice a tactician should give. Even without me, Kris and the others are strong.
Clarisse: What? Have you become attached to the Alteans after your little frolic with them? Then, just sit there and watch. Watch hard and well as I kill your beloved companions. Oh yes, and please... don't get in my way, okay?

@Battle 
Clarisse: Alright, I'm leaving the rest to you. Others are coming to help you soon, so hurry and kill them already. If by some chance those rats aren't dead when I return... I'll make sure YOU'RE dead, got it?

@Recruit-Talk 
%Kris,Wrys 
Wrys: Oh, my savior Kris. Thank you kindly for coming to my rescue. I cannot fight, but I can heal your wounded. Take me with you and you'll be very glad you did.

@Boss 
Clarisse: Wait... what? Where did you lot come from!?

Clarisse: Tsk! This is bad... To think I'd run from the likes of you... I'll remember this!

@End 
Kris: Sire, are you unhurt?
Marth: Yes, I'm alright. Thank you, Kris.
Jagen: We've repelled the assassins, but we cannot afford to linger here.
Marth: I agree. I'm worried about Ogma. Let us hurry to Lord Wendell's place!

Clarisse: ...Hmm. The Alteans are better than I expected. Oh well. We can always snuff them out later. I'll let them live for now.
Katarina: I warned you. The Altean army is strong...
Clarisse: Gosh, Reese. You can be annoying sometimes. Whose side are you supposed to be on? Don't tell me you're thinking of betraying Lady Eremiya?
Katarina: ...No. That thought could never cross my mind. We all live for Lady Eremiya. For her sake, I must defeat Kris... I know that well enough.

Wrys: Greetings, Kris, my friend. It's been a while since we last had a decent conversation.
Kris: Yes. Ever since the knight training, eh, Father Wrys?
Wrys: Indeed, and you've become even stronger than you were then... ...Oh, did your hair grow a little?
Kris: Really? Well, it is true I haven't had the time to take care of it since we left Altea...
Wrys: You know, a haircut like mine is astonishingly easy to take care of.
Kris: I-I can imagine...
Wrys: If you so wish, I could shave your head, so it's like mine.
Kris: Eh?
Wrys: As I'm a monk, I'm quite used to shaving heads. It's quite alright. If you don't like it, you can just let your hair grow and have your previous haircut back. What do you say? Would you allow me to shave your head?
^start
Kris: Yes, please.
Wrys: Very well. Then, give me a moment to prepare. ...Are you really sure?
Kris: Y-yes...
Wrys: Then, please sit down. Now, close your eyes...

Kris: I-I think I'll pass.
Wrys: I see. It's a pity, but perhaps it's for the best. In any case, Kris, I'm counting on you from now on.

@Opening 
Saint Archanea is the largest country on the continent. Its golden capital of Millennium Court has bathed in 600 years of proud history. Under the attack of Altea's allied army, it fell in just one day. The citizens of Archanea welcomed them as liberators, and supported them to their fullest. They also mentioned of their hatred towards Hardin and his personal guards. Everybody now calls Hardin the Dark Emperor. This was in hatred of Hardin, the murderer of countless people. If possible fighting would be avoided, but it as already reached this stage... Marth ra

@Intro 
Jagen: Your highness, we've entered the castle! But don't forget that Hardin is being protected by the Darksphere. To fight him , you must have the Lightsphere!! Be sure to let the person fighting him carry it.

Hardin: Midia, even you betrayed me. Archanea's paladins have lost their touch.
Midia: You fool!! Don't you see it? What you're doing isn't normal. Where did you take Nyna to? Bring her back to us now!!
Hardin: Nyna! That woman betrayed me. I just wanted to destroy Grust. And she had to go and give the Emblem to that boy... Those who betray me must die. Midia, you're no exception!!
Midia: If you want to take my life, go ahead. But Hardin... Do you know how much suffering you've caused because of your stupid jealousy? Just open your eyes and see!
Hardin: Stupid jealousy...? Haha... You can say what you like. This world is corrupt and full of annoying people. Is this kind of world even worth anything? It would be far better for it to be destroyed. Midia, you shall watch here... As Prince Marth dies by hand!!

@Battle 
Hardin: Marth...? As a servant of the Empire, you dared to invade Millennium Court. I am disappointed in you. So Altea's Prince of Light is just a lowlife.
Marth: Hardin! Your are being controlled by the Darksphere, and have lost your just heart!! Please, you must return to normal!
Hardin: Hahaha...! You are so naive, Marth. I attacked Altea solely because of my hatred of you. In the previous war, it was only because you were the descendant of Anri that Nyna gave the Emblem to you, and chose you to become the leader of the alliance. Prince of Light... What nonsense! If you hadn't received my support you would have died long ago, so don't act all big, Marth!! From that day on, I hated you. I kept silent for Nyna, but I knew I would have to deal with you eventually. This has nothing to do with the orb!
Marth: Hardin... Is that true... Your hatred of me... I didn't know...
Hardin: Ha... That's why you're just a boy. Marth! Come to me, so I can use my Gradivus to pierce your heart!! In this tiny continent, I am the only hero that is needed!

@Boss 
Hardin: Rebels... Did you come here to get yourselves killed? I'll show you to fear my Gradivus!!

Hardin: Marth... Your highness... I have finally awakened... From my deep dream... Your highness... I am deeply sorry... I fought with my inner demon. However I was too weak... I resisted with all my might... But I still lost... I hoped for your highness' hand to end my life... That way I could be saved... Your highness... Nyna... Please take care of Nyna... She... I hope you... can tell her... In the... end... I still... loved her... I hope... She can... forgive me...

%Marth,Hardin
Hardin: So you've come, Marth!! I'll run you through, just as you wish!
Marth: Hardin, that's enough!

Kris: Sire, the battle is over. We have won.
Marth: Yes, and with this, finally...
Jagen: Sire! Look over there! Your sister and the others...
Marth: Elice! And Princess Nyna...! Lena, Maria; you're all safe!
Nyna: Marth, I'm so happy you made it... Ngh...!!
Gharnef: You--you carry the Binding Shield...! Gah! My magic has been dispelled? Withdraw, my priests. At this rate, he will... Let us hurry the Shadow Dragon's return!
Marth: Gharnef...!
Kris: That man was the Dark Pontifex Gharnef! His servants were impersonating the princesses.
Marth: What was he playing at? He mentioned something about the Shadow Dragon's return... So as we suspected, my sister and the other clerics must be in Gharnef's hands...
Jagen: Forgive my interruption, sire, but Lord Gotoh has arrived.
Marth: Lord Gotoh? Take me straight to him!
Gotoh: Excellent work, Prince Marth. You managed to obtain all of the orbs. Thanks to your efforts, the lost Binding Shield is finally complete.
Marth: Incredible! It felt as though the shield itself pulled in all the orbs... So this is the fabled Binding Shield. But what now, Lord Gotoh? From Gharnef's actions, it would seem he has the noble clerics imprisoned. I worry for their safety.
Gotoh: Hmm... I understand how you feel... However, we have a far greater task to accomplish--we must seal away the earth dragons. Soon they will awaken from their slumber. They will rise up from the ground, destroying everything in their wake, and turn this world into a living hell. Go, Marth. Entomb the awakened dragons once more!

Jagen: Marth, it's finally over. Now, the world is safe. Look, the princesses are over there...
Marth: Sister! And there's Princess Nyna... And Lena and Maria as well. It's great to see that everybody is safe.
Nyna: Marth, you finally came. I am so happy... I will need your help to restore Archanea.
Elice: You really worked hard, Marth. You are my pride.
Lena: Lord Marth, with our combined strength we have already vanquished Gharnef. Please relax.
Maria: The world is safe now. Your highness, please hurry back to Altea.
Marth: Really? It's good to see everybody well. But you all don't look too good...
Nyna: Everybody is tired from battling Gharnef. But it doesn't matter now, so please don't worry.
Marth: Really...? Nyna, I am sorry about Hardin. I couldn't save him.
Nyna: It's fine. He was devoured by his own ambitions, so it is not unexpected that he was lost. Well, Marth, you should hurry back to your homeland. Everybody is probably worried about you. With your remaining time, you must live well. As long as there are still people in this world, your name will never be forgotten.

Jagen: Kris, new information regarding the assassins has reached the palace. As you may have guessed, they were dispatched by Hardin and Gharnef. The head of the organization is a woman named Eremiah.
Kris: Eremiah... And where is she now?
Jagen: Here, in Archanea. Apparently, she runs an orphanage in the mountains.
Marth: An orphanage?
Jagen: Yes, so it would seem. However, it's an orphanage in name only. She confines the children to a basement devoid of light, and teaches them all manner of wicked things....
^start 
Kris: ......Sire. Please, let me go. I'll crush them-- I won't allow such a travesty to stand.
Marth: I understand, Kris. I, too, cannot allow a situation like this to carry on.
Katarina: ...Please, wait.
Marth: Katarina? Were you listening the whole time?
Katarina: There's a hidden passage to where Lady Eremiah is... I'll show you the way.
Marth: ......
Katarina: Please, allow me to go. I'll be fine. I don't believe for a moment that this will atone for everything I've done... But while I live I want to help in any way that I can.

Kris: ......Sire. Please, let me go. I'll crush them-- I won't allow such a travesty to stand.
Marth: I understand, Kris. I, too, cannot allow a situation like this to carry on. Let's go to the orphanage then.

@Opening 
This truly is an unimaginably treacherous journey. 5000 meters... No, higher than that. Looking down, a sea of clouds can be seen. They have reached the summit of the cold mountain peak. Breathing is difficult... Dizziness is felt... Their vitality is fast approaching its limits.

@Intro
Jagen: Well, Kris, is everyone making good use of the drill grounds? Of course, if you win often, you'll be that much stronger. Kris, you...
^start
Jagen: Oho-ho, you... You've done very well, haven't you?
Kris: Yes, I go there often.
Jagen: I see. Then there is nothing I have to add. I should recommend the drill grounds to the others.

Jagen: Oho-ho, you... You've been winning quite often, eh? Not bad at all.
Kris: Thank you. But I hope to improve further.
Jagen: That's the spirit! I should recommend the drill grounds to the others.

Jagen: Hmm, you... It seems you haven't won much yet. Are you purposely avoiding the drill grounds?
Kris: S-sorry, I don't really have the money, so...
Jagen: Well, it's fine if you're not struggling now, but when things get tough, that experience will be the clincher. Just remember, if you ever feel that your foes are too strong, there is a place where you can hone your skills.
^end

Marth: Xane, we've already climbed this high. It's so cold... Even breathing is hard.
Xane: We're almost there. Look, can you see over there? That's the Ice Dragons' Temple where Gotoh is.
Marth: But, that was quite a shock. Tiki is actually the daughter of the Divine Dragon King. Also, both Gotoh and you are Divine Dragons.
Xane: Ah... When the Divine Dragons fought the Earth Dragons they over-exhausted their dragonstones, and so practically became extinct. Aside from Naga, only Gotoh, me and the just born Tiki survived. However, after the war we discarded our dragonstones, so we could no longer become dragons again. Even so, I still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans. Gotoh followed Naga's orders to protect humans, but that's got nothing to do with me. I don't like humans. They scorned the Manaketes, even though they had lost their power, and treated them like filth. I can fully understand why Medeus and the others hated humans so much. The Earth Dragon King, Medeus, tricked his own tribe and became a Manakete by himself. He used to follow Naga's orders and guarded the Dragons' Altar. However the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive. They even started to attack the Manaketes that lived in peace. The Manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans, and gathered at the Dolhr region. They formed their own kingdom of Manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans. To save the humans, Gotoh handed the Falchion to Anri and he created an academy of magic at Khadein. But whoever won wasn't any of my concern.
Marth: Then, why are you helping me? I'm also a human...
Xane: You're different from the others. You don't seem like an unreliable person either...
Marth: Mmm... Thank you, Xane.
Xane: Don't... don't be silly. I'll get embarrassed. Anyway, let's head to the temple, but be careful of the Ice Dragons. Although they're also wild dragons, they will instinctively try to protect their temple. Poor guys...

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Beck 
Marth: You, you're Beck! To think we'd meet here of all places!
Beck: Me too, Prince Marth. Boy am I surprised to see you. It's been far too long. After the war, I was travelin' the continent. And, um, somehow...
Marth: ...You landed up here? Well, thank goodness. There's no way you would have joined the barbarians. Beck, we're fighting another war. Why don't you come with us?
Beck: I don't have my ballista any more. Just my horse-buddy right 'ere. But if you're fine with that, then sure. I'll help you princey.

@Recruit-Battle 
Beck: What's the point of war?

Beck: D-damn... it... You too... Pony...?

@End 
Marth: Hey, Xane. Gotoh didn't really mention anyting about the five orbs, but I thought they were very important. Do you know anything about them?
Xane: Gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didn't say anything. I will tell you. However, after I've told you, you'll probably think it was better off not knowing. The orbs rest on the shield that seals the Earth Dragons... Basically they are part of the Shield of Seals. Since ancient times, the Divine Dragons have passed down these sacred jewels, each possessing different powers. To put it simply, the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal. So if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken.
Marth: Hmm, is that so? But, how come the orbs were scattered?
Xane: Because the shield was broken. The Shield of Seals was displayed at the Fane of Raman, and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it...
Marth: When did that happen?
Xane: Around 600 years ago. To recover the shield, Gotoh spend many years searching the lands. In the end, he only found the five orbs, with the shield nowhere to be seen. Not only that, but the five orbs, which he painfully collected, were scattered again after Raman was attacked in the previous war.
Marth: Really? ...So that was why Gotoh was looking for the lost jewels... the orbs?
Xane: Yep, the Starsphere, Lightsphere and Geosphere... as well as the Darksphere and Lifesphere. The Lightsphere is in Gotoh's possession, that Starsphere was shattered and the Darksphere was given to Hardin by Gharnef.
Marth: The Geosphere is in Altea and all that remains is the Lifesphere.
Xane: Ah... Anyway, let's enter the temple. From now on I will also help you fight. Well, let's go!

^locked 
Jagen: Sire, please wait. Kris, you as well.
Jagen: I just received a distressing message. People have been sighted not far behind us. There seems to be a battle underway.
Marth: Out here? Could it be the barbarians? Or perhaps it's the assassins...
Jagen: In any case, this area is almost entirely uninhabited. So it can't be any old people... To make matters worse, the snow is becoming heavier... Fighting will be difficult in this weather.
Marth: But if there are allies...
Kris: Indeed. We cannot abandon them. If there are allies that is...
Marth: Then we'll just have to find out for ourselves, before the battle is over. Let's go!

Marth: Please, calm yourselves. You may stand at ease.
Katarina: Yet you summoned us so suddenly, milord... Is it to do with the bandits we subjugated? Are you, sire, reprimanding us for disobeying our orders?
Marth: Not at all--it's quite the opposite. Your actions have saved many. As ruler, my duty is to protect my people, and I am truly grateful for what you did.
Katarina: We're honored to be of service, but that was tougher than any of our training. Phew...
Marth: Kris, and you as well, Katarina... I hear from Jagen that you've been exemplary cadets.
Kris: Is that so, sire? Sir Jagen never intimated as much...
Marth: I've seen your skill, and I agree wholeheartedly with him. Why, the both of you are suitable for the Altean army. Should the two of you pass your test, I'd love it if you would become my Royal Guards.
Kris: Royal Guards, sire?
Marth: Though the stories tell of me as a great hero, it is not so. There is only so much that I can do by myself. That much, I know to be true. The War of Shadows was won with the aid of comrades who wished for the same future as I. 'Twas not a lone romp across the land. I realized, whether in peace or war, I need people I can trust--young, dynamic soldiers who can support and guide me.
Kris: B-but the Royal Guard exists to protect the king... It is a role of immense importance... Are we even fit for such an esteemed duty?
Marth: Yes, I believe so. I want you to be my Royal Guard. Jagen feels the same as I. But... don't feel obliged to promise me; I won't think ill of you if you decline. And so, I ask this of you once more. You need not answer right away. It's quite alright. Please think it over carefully.

@Opening
Khadein is an independent city-state, taking orders from no foreign nation. The Archmage has many pontifices under him, governing according to their counsel. In the previous war, Pontifex Gharnef allied with Dolhr and dragged Khadein into war, and the city suffered great damage as result. As Khadein had lost all its pontifices, Wendell became its Archmage and started rebuilding the city. However, Wendell left on a journey to fulfill a mission given to him by Gotoh. He then left Khadein in the care of two young men. They were two skilled and promising young mages... Merric and Arlen.

@Intro 
Kris: So this is the School of Khadein... The sanctuary of those who study magic.
Marth: Indeed. Merric studied here since he was a child. I personally have no magical ability, but as for you, Kris...
^start
Marth: You're incredible. I don't think you'd lose to even Merric.
Kris: I wonder if I could study here, in Khadein?
Marth: Actually, I think they'd want you to teach.

Marth: You have potential. I'm sure you'd qualify to study here.
Kris: Thank you, sire.

Marth: You too, hm...? You're not very good at magic either.
Kris: Yeah... I'm not really cut out for it.
Marth: Well, everyone has their own talents. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
^end 

Arlen: Merric. It's time to put an end to this.
Merric: Wait, Arlen! Why do we have to fight? We were both Master Wendell's pupils: we're friends, are we not? Why do you despise me so?
Arlen: I was Master Wendell's disciple before you, and I was the stronger one. Even so, Master Wendell gave you Excalibur. He should have given it to me! Clearly, I was the only one worthy to be his successor, yet he...
Merric: But I have no intention of succeeding Master Wendell. I hold no ill feelings for Khadein, but once I finish studying I plan to go home. Back in Altea, there is somebody I must protect for the rest of my life... So, Arlen, please! Why don't you join us so we can take back Altea?
Arlen: Altea, you say?! Why should we help a country that rebelled against the empire and attempted to invade their fair nation? The mage corps of Khadein have sworn allegiance to Emperor Hardin. Oh, I see... I knew it was you... YOU dragged the Altean army here!
Merric: No!! That's not how it is!
Arlen: Shut your mouth, traitor!! I won't listen to your lies any longer! Your Excalibur and my Thoron; we'll put them to the test!

@Recruit-Talk
%Wendell,Arlen
Wendell: Arlen! What are you doing?!
Arlen: Master Wendell...
Wendell: You still don't understand my decision, do you? Indeed, as a mage, your power surpasses mine. But you lack compassion. That is why I did not grant you Excalibur.
Arlen: ... Compassion...?
Wendell: I had decided that you were to be my successor when the time came. To think you would harbor a grudge towards me... Does that not make you the same as Gharnef?
Arlen: The same as Gharnef...? Teacher! What are you saying?
Wendell: Arlen, listen to me... Gharnef, along with Pontifex Miloah, were Lord Gotoh's best pupils. But Lord Gotoh saw Gharnef's weakness, and so he left Khadein and the Aura tome to Pontifex Miloah. Gharnef, overcome by jealousy, stole the Darksphere from Lord Gotoh, and created the Imhullu tome. As a result... His heart was trapped within the Darksphere for all eternity. Wrath and envy led him to ruin. Do you understand now, Arlen...?
Arlen: ...Teacher... ...Teacher! I'm so sorry. I... I was wrong. Please... find it in your heart to forgive me!
Wendell: Arlen, you will use that power of yours for the good of the people. Understand?

@Recruit-Battle 
Arlen: I won't lose to someone like Merric. Anyone who sides with him is my enemy. Thunder, strike them down! Thoron!!

Arlen: Master Wendell...

%Wendell,Arlen 
Arlen: Why does everyone side with HIM...? Even though... even though I'm stronger!
Wendell: How horrible... Consumed by your hatred, you have forgotten what is truly important.

Gotoh: Marth... Do you hear me?
Marth: Lord Gotoh! Yes, I can. You are speaking to me through magic, are you not? Lord Gotoh, I must ask: what has happened to cause Hardin to suddenly change so much?
Gotoh: Hmm... The Darksphere is the culprit... Hardin's soul is trapped within the Darksphere...
Marth: The Darksphere? What on earth is that?
Gotoh: Light, Star, Earth, Life and Darkness... In this world, there exist five sacred orbs. The Darksphere is that which complements the Lightsphere; in battle, it possesses the enemy's mind, negating their attacks. But the Darksphere also amplifies wrath and envy, and can turn their owner into a demon. Hardin must have obtained the Darksphere from somewhere... And now his heart has been lost to it.
Marth: But why? He should have been happy after his union with beloved Princess Nyna, so why the envy?
Gotoh: Prince... Humans are never simple creatures... In any case, the only object that can overcome Hardin's Darksphere is the Lightsphere. If you want to do something about him, then you had best come and get it from me.
Marth: Huh? Really, Lord Gotoh? If we have the Lightsphere, then we can save Hardin?
Gotoh: Well... If his heart is not completely consumed, then perhaps.
Marth: Lord Gotoh! Please, lend the Lightsphere to me.
Gotoh: If you come in person to the Ice Dragon's Temple where I reside, then you shall have it. But that will be no easy task. So, Marth. Do you have the courage to walk the path that Anri walked?
Marth: Yes, I do! I will go!! Please, allow me to go! I must have the Lightsphere!

Jagen: Kris, may I have a word? As this army's tactician, I have been observing each and every of our battles. If I were to sum up your recent style of fighting, I would say...
^start
Jagen: Most impressive! To the end. All of your comrades support each other, and you fight as one, so as to not lose each other. With Prince Marth as our core... and your support, we shall not falter.
Kris: It is an honor, Sir Jagen.

Jagen: Excellent! There is no other word. At times we lose comrades... But even so, we have always prevailed. With Prince Marth as our core... and your support, we shall not falter.
Kris: It is an honor, Sir Jagen.

Jagen: Unsatisfactory... It pains me to say it. But your comrades have fallen, one after another... At this rate, I worry for the future. You must protect them from now on. Their lives are in your hands, Kris.
Kris: Yes, Sir Jagen.
^end

Malice: Hey, can I talk to you for a second? I came here 'cause I heard Marth's group was passing by, but, erm...
Kris: Sorry, who are you?
Malice: I'm Malice. A mercenary, and not a cheap one. I'd like to ask you something: is yer prince okay with paying gold? Oh, of course, it's okay if I have to wait until this war's over. So, erm... If you, er, paid us, say... 590 gold for our services, that ought to do, I think.
Kris: Huh? If it's only that much, then Prince Marth would gladly pay...
Malice: Phew! The rumors are true. He's completely different from all our employers up till now. Right, Pops?
Dice: He IS different. Looks like we hit the jackpot coming to this desert. I'm Dice. On behalf of the both of us, it's great to be in your service.

^locked 
Jagen: Sire, we've just received new information. It concerns the assassins' movements... Lord Horace, who thought to ally with us, is in peril.
Marth: Lord Horace...! Kris, Lord Horace is an Archanean knight in Princess Nyna's service. He was our ally.
Marth: Lord Horace! I am Marth of Altea. I ask that you lay down your arms...
Horace: ...... Is Princess Nyna... safe?
Marth: We cannot abandon Lord Horace. Jagen, Kris, let's hurry!

@Intro 
Luke: Sigh.
Ryan: What's wrong, Luke?
Luke: Don't you think it's a crying shame that there aren't any cute and caring clerics around?
Ryan: W-what do you mean...?
Luke: Well, a knight thrives on romance, right? Like if I were wounded in battle, and a lovely cleric came to my aid... Hey, Kris the Ordinary. If we had a cleric like that with us, I bet we'd all fight twice as hard!
Kris: Well, I don't know about the romantic part... But it would make our lives easier if we had a healer on our side. Unfortunately, I don't think there are any healers around, Luke. It might be a good idea for us to ask someone for assistance on this matter.

Katarina: Kris, everyone, please listen. I bring good news. They've found us someone who can support our platoon! It appears we might be joined by a healer.
Luke: She's finally here! My lovely cleric! Out of my way! Let me at her!

Wrys: Pleased to meet you! I am Wrys, a humble curate. I cannot fight, but this staff I carry can heal your wounded.
Luke: ........
Wrys: Yes, yes, I heard the whole thing from Sir Jagen. If you like, I could lend you my services as a healer. ...Oh my, has something terrible happened? Your face looks awfully pale... Have you been taken by illness, my boy?

#avatar-M 
Kris: It's nothing... He's just overwhelmed with joy right now.

#avatar-F 
Kris: Ah, no, it's nothing... (Be careful what you wish for, Luke!)

@Intro 
Katarina: Pay no heed to Luke; we're all fine. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Wrys.

Cain: Well then, let's continue the combat training. Everyone, you had better be prepared! I've decided that you will have a rather unusual instructor for today's practical training.

^start
Cain: This is Miss Athena, a foreign myrmidon who helped us in the last war.
Athena: Ve are indebted to this country, and ve vish to return the favor. Any voman would do the same. Ve are bad at teaching. But if ve are using swords, ve will not lose.
Katarina: Athena is a myrmidon with excellent speed and an opponent whom you must be very cautious of. Kris, do your best!

Cain: This is General Jeorge, who is visiting from the kingdom of Archanea.
Jeorge: I came to instruct Gordin in archery, but once I heard your story, my curiosity was piqued, to say the least. So I asked a big favor: to be allowed to take part.
Katarina: Sir Jeorge... A true master of the bow and arrow, they call him greatest archer on the continent. Kris, do your best!
^end

@Boss 
Athena: Ve vill challenge you!

Athena: ...Ve give up.

Jeorge: I am Jeorge, a bow knight of Archanea. Let me see how you fare in battle.

Jeorge: ...That was magnificent...

@End 
^start
Athena: You are strong. Especially you. You, vat is your name?
Kris: The name's Kris. Junior knight Kris.
Athena: Kris... Ve vill remember that. You, you are our friend. Ve vill aid you if you vant.

Jeorge: Not bad at all. That was a splendid fight. You, what is your name?
Kris: The name's Kris. Junior knight Kris.
Jeorge: Kris... I'll remember that name. I'm afraid I cannot join your cause, but... Gordin, could you go in my stead?
Gordin: Yes sir. I'll gladly fill in for you.
Jeorge: Kris, you are someone I'd like to fight alongside one day. I look forward to the day we can meet again.
^end

Cain: Today's training is now over. With that, I shall give you an interim report.
Kris: Interim report...?
Cain: From the very first test until now, I have evaluated your manner of combat. The more of your allies that have been injured and forced to withdraw, the poorer your score. Get ready to listen up!
Kris: Yes sir.
Cain: Commander Kris of the 7th Platoon! Of the twenty junior knight platoons, you place...

^start 
Cain: First! Wonderful work, Kris! You are most talented!
Katarina: A-amazing! We did it! We did it, Kris! It's all thanks to you, Kris.
Cain: But don't let your guard down. Placing first doesn't give you an excuse to start slacking off. That is all! You may return to the castle!

Cain: Third! Impressive, Kris! I'd say that you've placed rather high.
Katarina: We did it! We did it, Kris! It's thanks to you, Kris.
Cain: But don't let your guard down. You are still in-training--so from now on, you must aim even higher. That is all! You may return to the castle!

Cain: Tenth. Just in the middle, Kris. I've got nothing good to say, at this rate.
Katarina: I'm sorry, Kris. It's because I can't do anything...
Cain: But don't give up. You are still in the middle of training, so I expect more effort from now on. That is all! You may return to the castle!

Cain: Last... Kris... None placed worse than you...
Katarina: I, I-I'm terribly sorry, Kris... It's because I can't do anything...
Cain: ...But don't give up. You are still in the middle of training, so from now on try as hard as you can. That is all! You may return to the castle!
^end

Kris: ...Wow, this castle is absolutely massive. It's a huge difference to the house in my hometown... Now, where were the 7th Platoon's chambers again...?
Elice: Oh my... You are a junior knight, are you not?
Kris: Ah, yes. I'm Kris. I came here hoping to become an Altean knight. And you are...?
Elice: I am Elice. Marth's elder sister.
Kris: Oh! Prince Marth's elder sister... Please excuse my lack of manners.
Elice: It's alright, Kris... I think it's very admirable that you've come to help Marth.
Kris: It is an honor to serve Prince Marth, the Hero King.
Elice: "The Hero King"... you say? It does seem that our people have grown fond of calling him that. But the truth of the matter is that Marth... Marth is just a weak, vulnerable child...
Kris: Prince Marth is weak...?
Elice: Yes. Of course, he was the hero who triumphed in the battle against the Shadow Dragon. However, behind his heroic face, Marth is an idealistic child who firmly clings on to his beliefs. And as you too must know, the real world... cannot be saved with just ideals.
Kris: Yes...
Elice: Even as we speak, somewhere unknown to us, our people's lives are being lost... Marth cannot save those people.
Kris: Yes, that's true... Even the most excellent of kings is not an omnipotent god. A king is no more than human, and there are limits to what he can do.
Elice: Yes. Precisely. Most people realize this and can come to terms with that reality. But Marth cannot do that... He truly thinks that he can save everyone. In war, losing just one companion is unbearable for him... He suppresses his feelings with all his willpower, but I know that inside, his heart breaks and bleeds...
Kris: ......
Elice: In this cruel world, it will become increasingly difficult for him to continue to hold these ideals... Kris, if some day you should achieve knighthood... Please, protect him somehow and keep his ideals safe...

@Opening 
Leaving painful memories behind, Marth and his companions left Grust. They landed in Macedon; their new mission to rescue Princess Minerva. After the War of Shadows, Macedon was led by Minerva, who exiled the oppressive generals and attempted to reform the military. However, the influential General Rucke opposed Minerva's peace-seeking ways. He assembled the exiled officers to instigate a coup d'etat. Caught unprepared, Minerva was captured by Rucke's followers, and his rebel army seized control of Macedon. Then, they dispatched powerful dracoknights to guard the country's forested borders.

@Intro 
Jagen: Macedon's main force consists of pegasus knights and dracoknights... Both are fast and highly mobile units. In particular, there are the Whitewings, who fought under our banner in the last war... There aren't many in these lands who could match their terrifying speeds.
Kris: I would have loved to witness their prowess...
Jagen: Kris, while we're on the subject of speed...

^start 
Jagen: Your speed can be summed up as exemplary. Even the Whitewings would have trouble keeping up with you. As I'd expect of an Altean Royal Guard.
Kris: It is an honor to receive such praise, Sir Jagen.

Jagen: Your speed is satisfactory. But the Whitewings would simply fly straight over you.
Kris: I see... I'll be more careful, Sir Jagen.

Jagen: Your speed is, sadly, terribly lacking. The Whitewings would probably reach their destination in half your time...
Kris: I-I see... I-I'll be more careful, Sir Jagen.
^end 

Anna: Hello there Kris.
Kris: Hm? You're...? Why do I feel like we've met somewhere before...?
Anna: Oh, don't worry about little old me. The important thing is that I came here to share a wonderful tip with you. Have you heard about "How's Everyone"?
Kris: How's... everyone?
Anna: "How's Everyone" is all the rage! By checking it, you can see how everyone in your army is faring. You can watch your allies train, discover useful items, or even listen to their thoughts... So if you ever want to know how everyone is, then take a look at "How's Everyone." Easy, right?
Kris: I... see. Thanks, I guess.
Anna: The more time passes, the more things you'll be able to see. If you ever feel the urge, then go ahead and take a peek! Well, I'll be off now. Buh-bye!

Catria: Prince Marth!! Thank goodness you've come to Macedon!
Marth: Catria?! I received word that there was a rebellion in Macedon. Are you unharmed?
Catria: Yes, I'm fine. My older sister Palla and I managed to escape somehow. But Princess Minerva was captured by the rebels. Prince Marth, please... You have to rescue Princess Minerva! At this rate, her life will be in danger!
Marth: Of course I will help her. Catria, please take us to where she is.
Catria: Yes, my lord! But first we have to break through these woods. General Rumel's dragon knight squad is lurking within this area. If we approach from the front, we'll be easy pickings for them.
Marth: I see...So you're suggesting we flank them from the left or right. Thank you, Catria. Leave it to us!

@Visit 
Villager: Warren's a bit of an idiot. Just 'cause they paid him well, he went ahead and joined the rebel army! Ahh, to think a fool like him was once acquainted with the fair Catria...

Villager: Look out for those pilfering thieves. If they take off with your precious treasure, you won't ever get it back. Never let them escape from your sight.

Villager: Because of the last war, every nation has been forced to lead hard lives. The only well-off country is Archanea, ruled by Emperor Hardin.

Villager: Some dirty thieves took our village treasure, the Lady Sword, and ran off with it. Only women can wield the incredible power of that sword. Please, prise it back from their filthy hands.

Villager: Beware when dracoknights are around. Even from a far-off distance, they can move all at once and swoop down on you!

@Recruit-Visit 
Cord: O'er here! Prince Marth!
Marth: You're... Cord! What are you doing so far from Talys?
Cord: I couldn't sit still when I heard you's fighting again, so I came to join in. We're Talys's mercenaries, right? If ya died, Princess Caeda'd cry. Prince Marth, lemme fight too. I'll join you's army.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Catria,Warren
Catria: Warren?! Even a good man like you has sided with the rebel army...
Warren: Catria the White, huh? It's been a while. You know I'm just a common hunter. If they pay me enough, I'll do anything.
Catria: Warren, listen to me! Princess Minerva endeavored to create a country where its people could live at ease. She exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute to accomplish that goal. But General Rucke, despite knowing this, roused the soldiers into a coup d'etat. Can't you see? He's just trying to make this country into his own! And you can honestly say you're okay with that?
Warren: ...I see. Well, I don't like the military acting as if they owned the place... Alright then. If you're going to help the princess, then so will I.

@Recruit-Battle 
Warren: No hard feelings. I don't have anything against you, but this is the way I live. Forgive me!

Warren: Damn it... I should've seen this coming...

@Boss 
Rumel: Taste the terror of Macedon's fearless dracoknight squad!

Rumel: General Rucke, I leave the rest to you...

Jagen: Sire, we found someone most unusual confined in one of the fortress rooms.
Marth: Hm? ...Linde! How did you wind up in a dangerous place like this?
Kris: Sire, do you know this woman?
Marth: Yes, this is Linde. Her natural talent for magic helped us a great deal in the last war.
Linde: Prince Marth! Thank heavens. What a pleasant surprise meeting you here. I desperately needed to see you again, so I set out to find you. But the Macedonian soldiers found me suspicious and they dragged me to this fortress...
Marth: Is that so? I'm glad you're safe. But, why were you looking for me? Shouldn't you be by Princess Nyna's side?
Linde: I was requested by Princess Nyna to deliver you this.
Marth: Huh? This...! This is the Fire Emblem! The royal heirlom of Archanea: the Emblem Shield!
Kris: The Fire Emblem... I heard that in the last war, Princess Nyna entrusted you with it, sire...
Marth: Indeed. I looked after this as Archanea's representative in the last war. But why give this to me now? Especially at a time when Archanea has so much influence under Emperor Hardin's reign? In this peaceful age, why is Princess Nyna giving me the "Champion's Proof"...?
Linde: I don't understand either. Princess Nyna didn't explain why, just that I had to give it to you... I remember her eyes seemed so sad... I think she may have been crying...
Marth: Princess Nyna crying?! What on earth has been happening...? Linde, after this battle ends, I will go see Princess Nyna. Until then, I want you to remain with us.
Linde: Yes, Prince Marth!!

Luke: I'm a soldier of love, seeking out only the most beautiful women, but I... haven't gotten any dates yet.
Katarina: I'm sorry to say, most of the girls here think of you as small fry. I mean, people think Ryan is a "cutie," or Roderick is "Ohmigosh, so cool!" Quite a few people seem to secretly lust after Kris too.
Luke: Exactly! I didn't get it at first. I thought, "what am I doing wrong?" That's when I realized: it's my hair!

Luke: My feminine grace'll win hearts, just like Kris!
Ryan: Your "feminine grace" is scaring me actually...
Katarina: Luke, maybe if you did something about that attitude of yours, you'd be more popular. Oh, it's time. Apparently, today, Sir Jagen wishes to have a word with us before training.

@Intro 
Jagen: Three months have passed since you first came here. During this time, I've witnessed many a platoon desert because they couldn't stomach the harsh training. Not to mention platoons that failed due to miserable results... Of all who remain, there are only twenty names.
Katarina: Eep, the requirements are incredibly strict!
Kris: True. But we still remain in the game. That's what matters. As long as we keep working hard...
Jagen: From now on, the practical training will be far more gruelling. As such, we will be introducing lectures to advise you.
Kris: Lectures?
Frey: I am Frey, the knight in charge of lecturing. In my lectures, you will learn essential knowledge that all knights should possess.
Jagen: From here on, this is the real thing. Prepare to be pushed to your limits.

Frey: Now, firstly, I'll talk about the preparations you need to make before a battle. Before you fight your enemy on the battlefield, you must ensure that you are sufficiently prepared.
Frey: Selecting those who will fight, organizing their weapons and items... Kris, you will do all these things, as part of your role as commander.
Kris: I understand. I'll do my best.
Frey: One more important thing: Pay attention to party members who wish to speak with you. Talking to your party members will often yield tactical advice. The more stars displayed, the more important a conversation is. When you come to a new battlefield, it's always a good idea to check if anybody has something to say.

@Battle

Cain: Well then, let us begin today's mock battle. From here on, I will prepare an instructor based on your performances until now. The 7th Platoon's opponent, today, is...
Draug: I am Draug, armor knight of Altea. Your opponent is none other than me.
Katarina: Draug is an armor knight famed for his sturdy defense. Kris, he'll be a formidable enemy.
Draug: These soldiers are your opponents. You must defeat all of them if you wish to fight me.

Cain: Well then, let's begin today's practical training! Your opponents from here on will be the toughest yet, so show me that fighting spirit of yours! The 7th Platoon's opponent, today, is...
Ogma: I will serve as your opponent.
Katarina: What? We-we have to fight Ogma...? Kris, Ogma is a hero from the last war... He'll make for a formidable enemy.
Ogma: The soldiers here will be your opponents, first. If you defeat all of them, I'll step up to fight.

Cecil: Huff... puff... I-I made it. Hey, where's this Commander Kris person?
Kris: That would be me, but who are you?
Cecil: I'm Cecil, a junior knight like you! I know it's very sudden, but I was invited by Katarina to join your group.
Kris: ...Very sudden indeed. But, the more the merrier. Could we talk after the battle?
Cecil: Sure, I'm glad you understand. Oh yeah, I brought along some strong weapons that Katarina prepared for you! Just give me the orders and I'll give you them to replace your worn out ones.

Draug: You're not bad at all. But I won't be beaten so easily.

Ogma: Not bad. As promised, I will fight.

Ogma: ...Not bad. That's quite some skill you've got.

Katarina: We did it, Kris! Good job!

Katarina: Excuse me, Kris, do you have a moment?
Kris: Huh? Of course. What is it?
Katarina: That Royal Guard position that Prince Marth offered us. Did you think about it? I... I'd like to be a Royal Guard, if you're in with me. Together, we'd be an unstoppable team... When I imagine a future like that, I feel very happy. ...Um, what about you, Kris? Do you, perhaps, feel the same as I...?

Marth barely succeeded in escaping, disembarking in the desert of Khadein. He elected to await his subordinates' safe arrival.

Khadein, the city of magic, is a sanctuary for mages. Many prospecting mages come here and undergo rigorous training. Magic relies on containing nature's energies in "tomes" and "staves", freely manipulating these energies to harness great power. A few centuries ago, a lone sage founded an academy here, teaching magic's secrets. However, instead of bringing happiness, magic was soon used as a tool of war and a thing to be traded. The sage was disappointed, and vanished from the pages of history. Though there is no confirmation, some say that was the Archsage Gotoh. Currently, advanced magic like Aura cannot be made without the orbs' power, and their use is restricted to a few chosen ones. Those conditions are set by their creator, and they can only be inherited by those who qualify.

Khadein, the city of magic... the proud Sanctuary of Sorcery.

@Intro 
Kris: Sire, am I glad to see you!
Marth: Kris! Thank goodness. Is everyone else okay?
Kris: Yes, everyone who survived is here.
Marth: Amazing. I don't know how you all managed to escape that onslaught...
^start
Kris: We were most fortunate. A sandstorm was brewing as we were making our escape... Thanks to the obscuring sands, the enemy lost sight of us, and we were able to escape with ease. Even during normal battles, I seem to have lucky moments like that.
Marth: I see. Kris, you must be loved by the goddess of fortune.
Kris: It would be my honor.

Kris: Your thoughts are mine. But somehow we were able to shake off the enemy and escape.
Marth: I see. Thank you, Kris.

Kris: Me neither. The way was blocked by earth and sand, and we lost our way as well... B-but somehow... Somehow we escaped.
Marth: How horrible for you... Even during normal battles, Kris, unlucky things always seem to befall you. I have to wonder if the goddess of fortune hates you?
Kris: It would certainly seem that way...
^end

Michalis: Minerva, if you wait in this village, you will most certainly run into Marth. I don't like him, but he is indeed noble. Join forces with him.
Minerva: Brother, what are you going to do now? Won't you come with me...?
Michalis: I have no intention of doing that. I only wish to find Maria and bring her home to Macedon.
Minerva: You've changed, Brother... Or should I say, you've returned to how you used to be. As I thought, back then you were being controlled by Gharnef's dark magic.
Michalis: No, no magic could bend my will. I wished to crush the arrogant Archanea, and establish Macedonian supremacy over this continent. But Father, without bending his ear to me, distanced himself from me and later had me banished.
Minerva: Are you saying that's why you murdered Father? What a fool you were... Didn't you realize that was Gharnef's plotting all along? Yes, Father was strict with you. But it was only because he loved you. Why couldn't you see that?
Michalis: Enough, Minerva. Do you take me for a fool? After I was defeated, I wandered the gap between life and death. When I had come to, in front of me, I was Maria--her eyes full of tears--praying to the gods. While I treated her like a pawn, Maria, she shed tears for me... Minerva, I'm going now. I have to save Maria. At least that can be my atonement!
Minerva: Michalis...

Kris: Sire. How shall we proceed from here?
Marth: Hmm... I want to go home to Altea, but if we can't prevail against Hardin, then we can't go back. What in the world are we supposed to do...?
Kris: We need to find out the secret of the strange power that's protecting Hardin. Forgive me, sire. As your Royal Guard, I was supposed to strike down your foes...
Marth: No, it's not your fault, Kris. I too felt a strange presence emanating from Hardin, almost like...
Jagen: Sire, it's an emergency! I have just come into some new information. The Khadein mage corps has launched an offensive against us.
Marth: What!? Even Khadein means to be our enemy... Merric, what are you...
Kris: Sir Jagen, what should we do?
Jagen: At this rate, it seems we have no choice. Sire, we need to break into the sanctuary, but you must be prepared to make sacrifices. If we don't hurry, Archanea's pursuit force will reach our rear and we'll be trapped.
Marth: I understand. We've no choice. Everyone, let's break into the sanctuary! But avoid needless fights if possible!

@Battle 
Jagen: An update, sire! The Archanea army is, at present, approaching from the south.
Marth: I see. Hasten the march; don't let them catch up!

Villager: A swordslayer will demonstrate your might against a mercenary or a hero. You should definitely get one if you can.

Villager: From here on north, you won't see no more shops. If you're going that way, you should stock up now.

Villager: The person commanding Khadein's mage corps is a young man named Arlen. He's not a bad man, but he can be a bit uncooperative. Seems he regards his old rival, Merric, with disdain. Hmm... I reckon only Lord Wendell could talk some sense into him.

@Recruit-Visit 
Marth: Huh? Princess Minerva, why are you here?
Minerva: My brother... Michalis, he helped me.
Marth: Really? That's good to hear. I was so worried once I heard that Prince Michalis had taken you. But, for him to rescue you: what in the world happened?
Minerva: Maria saved Michalis's life. She's kind, unlike myself... Maria's kindness was able to touch the heart of even a man like Michalis.
Marth: But, isn't that what you wanted? That's why you deliberately avoided killing Michalis. Am I wrong, Princess?
Minerva: Hmm......
Marth: I can understand. No one can sever the ties between family so easily. Princess, please lift your spirits. I would like you to fight with us again, just like before. I would like Macedon's strength and yours in order to put a stop to Hardin's designs.

%Marth,Etzel
Marth: You're... Etzel! Why are you here?
Etzel: I have my ties to Khadein as well. "Prince Marth has succumbed to his ambitions and invaded Archanea." When I was told that, there was no way I could sit still!
Marth: ......
Etzel: But... No matter how I put it, I just couldn't imagine you'd become that sort of person. Prince Marth, you said to me long ago that you wanted to let the era of war end. Do you still stand by those words?
Marth: Yes, I do. I do not seek to fight.
Etzel: ...I see. I, too, do not seek as such. Allow me to join you once more.

Marth: Yes, let's go!

@Opening 
The shocking news brought by Caeda was a terrible blow to Marth. Hardin was once not only a comrade-in-arms, but a trusted confidant and irreplaceable friend.

"Yet... why attack Altea? What have I done wrong?"

Filled with frustration, Marth hurried his return to his homeland, but the first barrier stood in his way: Olbern Keep, headquarters of the Grustian Occupation Army led by the evil General Lang... also known as the "Nest of Evil."

@Intro 
Jagen: Kris, it's been decided that we're going to war with Archanea. Archanea will not be an easy opponent. They have one of the most powerful militaries on the continent.
Kris: We're ready to face anything, sir. Although... we still lack experience, I admit. We have to grow stronger...
Jagen: Indeed. Kris, are you aware of the "drill grounds" that operate across the continent?
Kris: Drill grounds, sir?
Jagen: It costs a bit of money, but if you go practice in one, you can get stronger. It might be a good idea to let our more inexperienced men have a go.

Toras: Commander Lang. The... A-Altean army has arrived...
Lang: You moron. Why are you so panicked? With their nation and name in ruins, the Alteans are of no consequence to us.
Toras: But, Sir Jeorge's archers left to quell the rebellion. Can we win with just our troops?
Lang: Why didn't you tell me earlier? Call Jeorge back to the castle this instant! While you're there, find that hired sword, Navarre, and bring him here. General Toras! I'm heading inside. You will defend this location till your last breath. Do NOT let the enemy get close. Do I make myself clear?!

Soldier: Captain Jeorge. We've received orders to return to the castle immediately.
Jeorge: Orders from Lang, huh? I'm not fond of that man. His treatment of our people is simply intolerable. To work beneath him is an insult. Pay his orders no mind.
Soldier: But, Captain! You'll be accused of treason! Captain?! You can't be planning to defect to Altea...
Jeorge: No, that's not an option. If I were to defect now, I'd drag the entire platoon down with me. So for that reason alone, I will absolutely not take any risks that might besmirch our name.
Soldier: Captain Jeorge...
Jeorge: Anyway, inform everyone: Do not move from your stations. However, if the enemy approaches, you may engage them.

@Visit 
Villager: Y'know, lately I haven't seen that mercenary, Samuel. I thought that he might have joined your ranks, but I guess not... He's as lax as they get, but you can't go wrong with his skill.

Villager: Oh, Alteans, hear our plea! Please, defeat General Lang! As long as that man lives, peace is but a fleeting dream.

Elder: Ohh, if isn't Prince Marth! I wonder how my granddaughter Lena is faring, hm? What, you don't know? I see... Th-then... Do you still want this Hammerne staff? At least, if Lena's pupil Marisha were around, I'm sure she could use it... Well, whatever be the case, I've no use for a souvenir. Please, make good use of it.

Kris: Sire. I, too, do not intend to let him go. Say the word and with these very hands...
Jagen: This is Lang we are talking about. We don't know what he's planning. Kris, we must take extra caution when fighting inside the castle!

@Opening 
The surprising truth from Xane was a shock to Marth. Tiki was created as the daughter of the Divine Dragon King, Naga, and slept in the temple because of the king's will. The king's fear of Tiki's power was that of a loving mother's. If Tiki was to awaken, her tremendous power would eventually cause the destruction of the world... That is what the Divine Dragon King feared. However, Bantu, the king's servant, became attached to Tiki after watching over her for a period of hundreds of years became(sic). He awoke her from her sleep, and took her away. So Tiki only had 10 human years' worth of memory... "That is so sad, Tiki..." Marth was too bewildered to think.

@Intro 
Marth: This is the Ice Dragons' Temple. Anri's final destination...
Gotoh: Prince Marth, can you hear me? Come to the front of the center room. I shall await you there.

@Battle-Talk 
%Marth,Gotoh
^start 
Gotoh: What!? You found all the shards? Thank you, then the Starsphere can be restored. Please wait a moment...
Gotoh: Marth, this is the Starsphere. You can take this with you as well.
Marth: Huh? Gotoh, why are you giving such an important item to me?
Gotoh: The only person that can restore the Shield of Seals is you... The Shield, itself, has chosen you.
Marth: .....?
Gotoh: You still don't understand? The Emblem shield you're carrying is the stolen Shield of Seals. To be honest, it was only recently that I noticed; its exterior had completely changed... After stealing it from the Fane of Raman, the thief removed its jewels and sold them off as treasures. The money was used to fund an army, which, along with three stolen weapons, was used to conquer the world. The thief that went on to become the king of Archanea had the shield, which brought him such good fortune, it became the emblem of his royal family. Now do you understand, Marth? It is what you are carrying, Archanea's Fire Emblem.
Marth: !! What... ...The first king of Archanea was originally a thief!? Is that true...? In that case, I can kind of understand the curse of the Fire Emblem... Then, Gotoh... If I can collect all five orbs, can I restore the Shield of Seals?
Gotoh: Mmm... But please hurry up. The shield has already been broken for 600 years... It is almost time for the Earth Dragons, sealed underneath Macedon, to awaken from their slumber. Those evil Earth Dragons number several hundreds... No, several thousands. Once they awaken there will be nothing that we can do... I will leave Tiki in your care. You can find her in the room to the right. That Divine Dragon child should be able to help you battle the Earth Dragons. But, I will state clearly, if the Shield of Seals is not restored, Tiki will be destroyed.
Marth: Huh...!? Why is that...
Gotoh: That child is still developing. Without the Shield of Seals she will begin to degenerate. Eventually she will become wild and attack humans. I made her sleep, because I felt sad for her. But, if the Shield of Seals is restored I will no longer have to worry, because the shield will protect Tiki. Marth, please take care of Tiki. You must rescue that child from the path of ruin.

Gotoh: Is that so. You couldn’t find them all... There’s nothing you can do about it... Please hand your collected shards to me. Tiki is sleeping in the room to the right. But since the shield isn’t restored, I can’t let you see her. That child is still developing. Without the Shield of Seals she will begin to degenerate. Eventually she will become wild and attack humans. I cannot allow Tiki to awaken again. It is for her own good... Marth, once you’ve obtained all the treasures, head to the room to the left. I will be waiting for you...

Marth: Tiki!? Are you alright...
Tiki: Uh...
Marth: Tiki, it's me, Marth. Hey, open your eyes!
Tiki: ...Marth... .....! Oh Marth!! You came! You came to see Tiki!!
Marth: Yes, I hadn't seen Tiki in a long time. Are you feeling well?
Tiki: Uh... No. The bishop told me that I had to sleep again. But I don't want to... Because when I sleep I'm always alone. During my sleep, I dreamt many nightmares. There, I became a wild dragon, like those poor Fire Dragons and Ice Dragons. I attacked humans, and I killed them. No... No... When I awoke I was all alone in the dark room... I felt so strange, but also very scared... So very scared... But I couldn't leave that room. I cried many times, and then Uncle Bantu would come to comfort me as usual. One day he took me away, and took me to a human village. Living in that village was very fun, and everybody treated me well... In the short time, until I was discovered by Gharnef, I felt really happy. I don't want to sleep anymore... I feel that if I close my eyes once more, I will be unable to open them ever again. I don't want that. I want to live with everyone, I don't want to sleep again!
Marth: Tiki, it's alright now. I will protect you, so don't cry...
Tiki: Really...? I won't need to see those scary dreams again!?
Marth: That's right! Once the shield is restored, Tiki can live together with the rest of us. Don't worry, believe in me!
Tiki: Ah! I'm so happy!! Thank you, Marth!

Gotoh: You should go, Marth. I will send you to Altea with my powers.

Marth: Lord Gotoh, why don't you come with us?
Gotoh: Hmm... At the moment I've one thing I must still investigate. Gharnef has returned.
Marth: Gharnef...!? But we killed him!
Gotoh: Yes, you killed his body. But his soul was held prisoner by the Darksphere, and within it, his hatred only grew. Afterwards, his former disciples--the heretic bishops--resurrected him. And they seem to be planning something foul.
Marth: I see. Very well, Lord Gotoh. We shall split ways here.
Gotoh: Indeed. If I find something, then I too will visit Altea afterwards. I'm counting on you, Marth. Everything rests on your shoulders. You must save both our races from the path of destruction.

Kris: Huh? Do you know how to?
Xane: 'Course, just hold on a second.
Xane: Ta-da! Kris, you know about Tiki, right? Tiki's still a kid, but the real reason she can fight is because of her hairstyle and tiara.
Kris: Wait, what?! Are you serious?!
Xane: Yeah, if you wear your hair like this, then you'll be that much stronger. So all you gotta do is wear this tiara, and wear your hair like Tiki. If you do that, then a legendary power will flow through you! ...Well, maybe. So? Do you wanna give it a try?
^start 
Kris: Sure, why not?
Xane: Alrighty then. I'll be sure to do this properly.

Kris: I can't seem to sleep. What about you, Katarina?
Katarina: I... well... There's a lot on my mind, I suppose. ...Kris, have I ever told you about the town I was born in?
Kris: Now that you mention it, you're never told me anything about your hometown. It wasn't Altea?
Katarina: I was born in a town called Knorda. Have you ever heard of it? I... know it all too well. In Knorda, I was treated like an animal, beaten for fun. Whenever I couldn't stand the pain, I'd just close my eyes and think of nothing, taking refuge within my heart's confines...
Kris: Katarina...
Katarina: ...But someone was there to save me. She showed me the meaning of life. I felt that I would do anything for her. Kris, do you have someone like that in your life?
Kris: Yes. To remain loyal to a lord: that's the sort of knight I aim to be.
Katarina: Yes, that's right. You're also doing it for someone else... Not long now, is it...? It won't be long until we become Altean knights. When that happens... ......... Good night, Kris.

Kris: Well then, time to get some rest...
Katarina: U-um, Kris! I'm sorry, I forgot one thing... Please take this, if you would.
Kris: What's this? A headband?
Katarina: It's from Cecil. "Give this to the new platoon commander," she said. Supposedly if you wear this, you'll be more... "psyched". Cecil really wants you to wear it.
Kris: So once I put this on, I'll have a hairstyle like Cecil's? But will being like Cecil really suit me?
Katarina: I'm sure it would. Oh, I know! How about you just try it on? If you try it and it feels a little strange, you can just go back to your original hairstyle.

Katarina: Kris. I... had a dream. It was short... but it was a very happy dream. Kris, you and I... Both of us became Royal Guards... We saved many people, received many thanks... And then, the two of us... Kris... I... I'm sorry... I'm talking nonsense. There's no going back for me. ...Let us resume our battle, Kris.

%Kris,Katarina 
Katarina: Kris... There's nothing left for us to say. You and I are enemies... Please fight me. If you don't, I'll kill you...

%Kris,Katarina 
Kris: Katarina! Listen to me.
Katarina: Kris... Why? Why do you refuse to fight...? You must know that you'll die if you don't kill me... And yet, why do you hesitate...?
Kris: Because you're my friend.
Katarina: ...
Kris: You can't have forgotten: Our days training as knights... The times we fought together with Luke, Rody, Ryan and Cecille... "Together, we'd be an unstoppable team"... That's what you told me.

@Flashback 
Katarina: Kris, that's a wonderful name. We're here for the same reason, then. My name is Katarina. I came because I wish to serve Prince Marth.
Katarina: Thank goodness... Kris, you won. I knew you could do it.
Katarina: I... I'd like be a Royal Guard, if you're in with me.. Together, we'd be an unstoppable team... When I imagine a future like that, I feel very happy. ...Um, what about you, Kris? Do you, perhaps, feel the same as I...?

@Boss-Talk 
%Kris,Katarina 
Katarina: That was... That was all... a lie. Everything I did was to deceive you... It was all just a ruse... The truth is... I don't care about you...
Kris: If that's the case... Then why are you crying, now?
Katarina: ...I'm... not...
Kris: Katarina. You don't belong there. You want to fight alongside me, for Prince Marth. I'm certain of it.
Katarina: It's... too late for that. I've committed too many unforgivable sins...
Kris: Then, you'll just have to start atoning for them. It won't be easy. Many people from both Altea and your organization will turn you a cold shoulder... But, I can promise you this. No matter what happens... I'll stand by your side.
Katarina: Kris...
Kris: Return to us, Katarina.
Katarina: ...Sob... sob... ...Kris... Kris... Kris...!

@Boss 
Katarina: I am a puppet... I exist only to serve Lady Eremiya... My life has no value...
Katarina: Thank... you... ... Now I... won't have to hurt Kris... anymore... Kris... I'm... glad I could meet you... During those days of training... you showed me a beautiful, happy dream... Hey, Kris... Today's training... is about to begin... Look, there's Prince Marth and the others... Don't... wait for me... ... ...

@End 
^start 
Katarina: ...Prince Marth, I have committed many unforgivable sins. Please, hand me punishment... worthy of my crimes. Please execute me...
Marth: Raise your head, Katarina. I have no intention of taking your life.
Katarina: But... why? I don't deserve to live. Please let me atone with my death...
Marth: That's no atonement. You're just running from your sins.
Katarina: Oh...!
Marth: If you truly regret what you've done, then live. I want you to atone with your life, not your death.
Katarina: Atone with my life...? But, how? What should I do...? How could I even begin to atone?
Marth: I cannot give you that answer. Until now, you've only followed orders, never thinking for yourself. But that's going to change now. You will think for yourself, and find your own answer. That is my punishment to you.
Katarina: Prince Marth...

Kris: ...
Marth: Kris... I've forced you to play a painful role. I won't forgive the villain who led her to this path. Let's go, Kris.

@Intro 
Jagen: The 7th Platoon and its commander, Kris, are all present and accounted for, yes? From today forth, you will train together as a team in your bid to become fully-fledged knights. The first half of your training will focus on developing your practical skills. Without further ado, I will introduce the senior knight who is to be your instructor.
Cain: I am Cain, the knight in charge of your practical training! To hone your practical skills, we will have a contest in the form of combat. If you let your guard down, it won't be just an injury you'll be walking home with!
Jagen: Even amongst the Altean knights, Cain is one of our strongest men. You must all become strong enough to earn his approval.

Cain: Well then, let's begin today's training! Your enemies will consist of us Altean knights, as well as brave warriors whom I am proud to call friends. The opponents are determined by the ability of each platoon. 7th Platoon, your opponent is...
Caeda: My squires, my friends; please go easy on me.
Katarina: Oh, it's Princess Caeda! Prince Marth's fiancee! She's so pretty... I feel nervous at the thought of fighting her...

@Battle 
Caeda: Let us see if you've got the ability. Talys's mercenaries shall fight you first.

Caeda: I see you know how to fight well. In that case, I will fight you next.

@Boss 
Caeda: Fear won't help you; approach with confidence and the intent to fight.

^start
Caeda: You're a mercenary, aren't you...? Tee hee. This looks promising. Come, show me what you can do with your sword!

Caeda: An armored knight... I'll be at a disadvantage with the way that I fight. But I won't lose so easily! Come, show me what you've got!

Caeda: You're a cavalier, huh? Looks like you'll be a good match for me. Come, show me what you've got!

Caeda: So you're a fighter, Kris? Of the lance and the axe, the axe is advantageous... I might be at a slight disadvantage, but I won't lose easily! Come, show me what you've got!

Caeda: Kris, you're an archer!? The bane of us pegasus knights... B-but I will not sit idly by and lose to you! Show me everything you have!

Caeda: So you're a mage, Kris? Pegasus knights are resistant to magic, you know. I'm not going to lose this one. Come, show me what you've got!

Caeda: Kris, you're a myrmidon, huh? Teehee. I feel somewhat drawn to you. We should be friends from now on. But that doesn't mean I'll go easy on you in this fight. Come, Kris, show me what you can do with that sword of yours!

Caeda: Well, well, Kris, you're a pegasus knight, just like me. Teehee. We have so much in common... But I won't go easy on you for this battle. You and your pegasus... Shall we take to the skies?
^end

Caeda: Ngh...!

@End 
Caeda: That was a thrilling fight. You are the first squires to have bested me in combat. Promise me that you'll become knights worthy of helping Marth.
Kris: Of course, Princess Caeda.
Caeda: If you ever need help during the practical training, do call on me. And I'll fight, but as your companion.
Kris: Hm? We'd gladly appreciate your help, but I'm not sure if we would be allowed to.
Katarina: What should we do? I know, how about we ask Sir Jagen?

Jagen: I have no qualms about your proposal. You may borrow the help of friends if they offer as much.
Katarina: What a relief. I'm certain Princess Caeda will make a reliable ally.
Kris: But, is it really alright to rely on others? I don't see how this fits with our training...
Jagen: Hmph. Don't tell me you're still in the dark about Prince Marth's method of fighting in the War of Shadows?

^start
Kris: Yes, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar with the details.
Jagen: Then I shall tell you. Our victory in the previous war was not just by merit of Altea. Gathering and fighting together with allies of various positions and statuses... This is how Prince Marth fights. No matter when an ally came to our side, they could instantly join the battle with us. That is also a necessary skill for an Altean knight.
Kris: I see... I understand now.
Katarina: If we can combine our strengths when we fight, I'm sure we can achieve anything. Right, Kris?
Kris: Yes, you're right.

Kris: No, this I know. The League led by Prince Marth didn't just consist of Altea: It went beyond the frontiers of nationality, and included friend and foe alike...
Jagen: Yes. Our victory was not just the accomplishment of us Altean knights. Overcoming status and position; being able to fight together as equals... That is how Prince Marth fights. No matter when an ally came to our side, they could instantly join the battle with us. That is also a necessary skill for an Altean knight.
Kris: I see... That will be important to our training. I understand now.
Katarina: If we can combine our strengths when we fight, I'm sure we can achieve anything. Right, Kris?
Kris: Yes, you're right.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
In the past, there was a war known as the War of Shadows. It began when the fearsome Shadow Dragon, Medeus, launched a sudden invasion. The Kingdom of Archanea, protector of the lands, clashed with Medeus's forces. But against such superior might, Archanea was overwhelmed and trembled in defeat. Nyna, princess of Archanea, had no choice but to flee from her beloved homeland. To rescue Archanea, the Kingdom of Altea, its allied nation, sallied forth. However, it too was defeated by Medeus. With its king lost to war, Altea fell to ruins...

From his exiled shores Marth, young prince of Altea, swore he would retake his homeland. Marth never forgot his oath. Years later, he rallied an army at Talys to defeat Medeus. Starting with Caeda, Talys's princess, Marth gathered together many allies. Duke Hardin, Nyna's guardian, also became one of his trusted comrades. With Archanea's treasured "Fire Emblem" awarded to him by Nyna, Marth led the Archanean League, as its commander.

In the following battles, the League wrestled back control of both Archanea and Altea. Finally, after a long and fierce battle with Shadow Dragon Medeus's forces... Marth vanquished the Shadow Dragon... And thus did peace return to the world. These are the events that transpired one year ago.

@Intro 
Katarina: Kris, we have been designated as members of the 7th Platoon. I'm glad we were grouped together.
Kris: As am I. Who else do we have in our platoon?
Luke: I'm Luke! Or if you prefer, you can call me Luke, the Paladin of Dawn!
Roderick: I am Roderick. It is a pleasure to meet you. So, is that everyone?
Ryan: U-um... I'm a new recruit, too. My name is Ryan. I'm an archer.
Kris: It looks like that's all five of us. Well, what's the plan for today?
Katarina: There was an order from Sir Jagen. Today's mission is to decide who the new commander will be.

Roderick: Luke, how should we go about this?
Luke: Roderick, you wait at the back. I'll fight alone! It's just Kris and that kid, right? If that's all, I should be able to handle it. I'll show them my true strength.
Roderick: You're at it again...? Fine, have it your way. But I think underestimating your opponent will get you into trouble.

#avatar-M
Luke: Commander? Gotcha! Well, I'll be commander if you guys all insist!
Roderick: Nobody's insisting anything, Luke...
Katarina: Excuse me. I'd like to recommend Kris.
Kris: Katarina...?
Katarina: Kris is a really strong individual. And he didn't abandon me during the mock combat yesterday, even though I couldn't fight.
Luke: Alright then, I challenge him! Kris, if you beat me, I'll cede the position to you.
Katarina: Huh? H-how has it come to this?
Luke: It's a challenge, man-to-man! Kris, you're not afraid to fight me, are you?
Katarina: Don't be silly. Kris won't lose to you.
Roderick: So we'll decide with a battle. That'll let us know who's got the skill to be commander.
Katarina: I'm sorry, Kris. That was selfish of me... But I couldn't stand hearing them make fun of you...
Kris: It's okay. When my grandfather trained me, he used to say the same thing. He said that the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting.
Katarina: Huh. Y-your grandfather sure sounds colorful... Anyway, our opponents are Luke and Roderick. It's been decided that Ryan will be on our team.
Ryan: Y-yes. I'll do my best.

#avatar-F
Luke: Commander? Gotcha! Oh, what's that? Luke should be the one? Yes, I completely agree!
Roderick: Don't make up our words...
Katarina: Excuse me. I'd like to recommend Kris.
Kris: Katarina...?
Katarina: Kris is a really strong individual. And she didn't abandon me during the mock combat yesterday, even though I couldn't fight.
Luke: Alright then, I challenge her! Kris, if you beat me, I'll recognize you as leader.
Katarina: Huh? H-how has it come to this?
Luke: It's a challenge, man-to-man!
Kris: But I'm a woman...
Luke: Well then it's a man-to-woman challenge!! Kris, you're not afraid to fight me, are you?
Katarina: Don't be silly. Kris won't lose to you.
Roderick: So we'll decide with a battle. That'll let us know who's got the skill to be commander.
Katarina: I'm sorry, Kris. That was selfish of me... But I couldn't stand hearing them make fun of you...
Kris: It's okay. When my grandfather trained me, he used to say something similar. He said the best way for men to understand each other is by fighting. Well, I'm a girl, but...
Katarina: Anyway, our opponents are Luke and Roderick. It's been decided that Ryan will be on our team.
Ryan: Y-yes. I'll do my best.

@Battle 
Roderick: As I thought, Luke couldn't win alone. I guess I'll have to fight, too.

@Boss 
Luke: Guah...?! I-impossible... The future hero, Luke, defeated...

Roderick: Urgh! I see... You are even stronger than I had imagined...

%Kris,Luke
#avatar-M 
Luke: Kris, I've heard rumors about you! Sir Jagen said that there was a recruit who stood out from the rest of us!
Kris: Is that so?
Luke: Yeah, that's right! And I bet you're hogging all the attention, overshadowing the rest of us! I'll beat you here to prove I'm the best! Prepare yourself!

#avatar-F 
Luke: Sorry, Kris, but I won't hold back just because you're a girl!
Kris: That's fine with me.
Luke: I'll show you what I've got! Kris, try not to fall in love with me!

%Ryan,Luke 
Luke: Kiddo, just stand back and watch! Only Kris is worthy of fighting me!

%Kris,Roderick 
Roderick: Kris, I've heard the rumors about you as well. I need to see your ability firsthand, especially if you're to become the commander. I ask you this, as a fellow squire of Altea.

@End 
Katarina: Thank goodness... Kris, you won. I knew you could do it.
Luke: Alright, I'm a man of my word. I'll keep my promise. From here on, the commander'll be Kris. Gah, but I don't get it! I was so confident in my skills! How did I wind up losing?!
Roderick: Because we didn't fight together. We took turns fighting Kris one-on-one. That's why we lost to him/her.
Ryan: Yeah, my brother once said the same thing... Even if we are weak individually, we can become stronger by working together with our friends.
Kris: That's right. Fighting with your friends: That is the way of an Altean knight.
Luke: ...I see. I thought I could be the victor through my strength alone. But I guess I was wrong. Fighting together is far more important...
Katarina: Luke... I'm so glad. You understand now.
Luke: Yeah, it's all clear to me! It looks like being the leader is more trouble than it's worth! So I'll leave this bothersome job to Kris! I'm sure it'll be a joy working under him/her! Kris, I'll be looking forward to your help!
Katarina: ...Does he really get it?

Luke: Alright then, Kris! Now that you're the commander, how about I give you a cool title?
Kris: A title?
Luke: Yeah. All the legendary heroes have their own awesome title! Hm, let's see... Looking at your eyes... It's got to be Kris the Ordinary!
Kris: I don't really understand... Nor do I think it's something worth celebrating.
Luke: Aw, don't worry about it! Kris the Ordinary!

@Opening 
Under the guidance of Archsage Gotoh, Marth and the others headed to Macedon's north, to the "Wyvern's Dale". It is an undeveloped region populated with wyverns, and ruled by barbarians. But, there is no time to stop, because the fate of the world is in Marth's hands!

@Intro 
Marth: Jagen, where are we? Macedon? Or Dolhr?
Jagen: Both--we are precisely on the border. I hear this place is home to Macedon's great wyverns. But since the area is overrun with barbarians, even the Macedonian soldiers dare not set foot in here.
Marth: I see. You learn something new every day...
Kris: According to our scouts, a large number of wyverns and barbarians have gathered nearby. It's like Anri's Way... No, it's worse. Sire, please be careful.
Marth: Got it. Let's go, Kris. I need to know what's happened to my sister and the others... I have a dreadful feeling about this.
Ymir: There you are, Marth!
Marth: You're...!
Kris: Who are you?! A barbarian of this dale? Please stand back, sire.
Marth: It's alright, Kris. This is Ymir, another ally from the last war. When I met him, he was holding off an entire army to protect some villagers. He's a kind and brave man.
Ymir: Yeah, the name's Ymir. I heard Marth was fightin' here and figured I'd come along too.
Kris: I-I see... How rude of me, Sir Ymir. Please forgive my insolence.
Ymir: Oh, it's okay. My face is a bit on the scary side, I gotta admit. What's your name?
Kris: Ah, yes. I am the Altean Royal Guard, Kris.
Ymir: Kris! What a name! It's a real pleasure to meet you.
Kris: Likewise.

@Visit 
Young man: On the other side of the mountains is a small hill, called the Dragon's Table. Recently, there have been eerie roaring sounds coming from there. Grandfather and the others are afraid a demon is about to awaken. You mustn't get to close to that place.

Man: This is the Wyvern's Dale. Don't go any further. Otherwise I fear you'll be burnt to death by the wyverns.

Marth: Prince Michalis!? What are you doing here? And you've suffered a grave wound. What happened?
Michalis: ...Marth... ...I have been waiting... for you...
Marth: Huh!?
Michalis: ...Take this...
Marth: ...! This is the Starlight tome. You're giving it to me!?
Michalis: That's right... Gharnef... Only with this spell can he be harmed. I managed to take it back from his possession...
Marth: Gharnef!? Where is he now?
Michalis: The Dragon's Table... Ha... I was careless... I could be... Defeated by Gharnef... Marth... Good luck... I'm already finished. If Minerva is still around... Tell her to... In my place... Rescue Maria...
Marth: Michalis!
Michalis: Your highness... I leave Maria's fate to you... Urgh.

Minerva: ............ Brother...? Could it be... Is it really you...?
Michalis: ...Minerva...?
Minerva: Ah! You're wounded! I'll go get help!
Michalis: Don't bother... This wound is beyond help. I'd rather you call for... Prince Marth. I have... something I must pass on to him.
Minerva: The prince will be here soon. Hold on, Brother! I'll tend to your wound...
Michalis: Heh... To think I'd need your help in the end... Guh... ngh...!
Minerva: Brother!
Michalis: Minerva... I have something to ask of you. Should I die... Give this tome to Prince Marth. This is as far as I can go... I leave the rest... to you...
Minerva: B--Brother... Michalis...! No... This isn't like you! When did you become so weak!? The brother I knew was strong and noble... He always found his own way, never relying on anyone else... Do you hear me? I won't accept this! You're going to pass this on yourself, without the help of your younger sister.
Michalis: Hmph... Am I being scolded now...?
Minerva: Brother, listen to me... You cannot die here. You have to live...!

@End 
Marth: So this is the Dragon's Altar. The place where divine dragon Naga banished the earth dragons...
Gotoh: Indeed. Medeus, the altar's guardian, could not tolerate the human race's atrocities against the Manaketes. Thus, he gathered the surviving dragonkin, forming the Dolhrian Empire. All to obliterate mankind. He was vanquished by Anri once and then defeated a second time by you. However earth dragons boast tremendous life force, and cannot be completely eliminated so easily... Even now, they sleep at this altar.
Marth: You mean to say they'll awaken?!
Gotoh: Not exactly. Even sleeping earth dragons should not awaken for centuries or so. The next time Medeus awakens though, he will rise as a terrifying Shadow Dragon... No, wait...! Perhaps...? Yes, I see... So that's why Gharnef...
Marth: What's the matter, Lord Gotoh?
Gotoh: Prince Marth. I have finally realized the reason why Gharnef kidnapped the clerics. He intends to use them to resurrect Medeus. To hasten the awakening of a dragon requires the life force of pure, maiden women. Knowing this, Gharnef kidnapped them.
Marth: So that means Elice and the others are in this very altar?
Gotoh: Indubitably... Marth, you must hurry. They are in grave danger! Medeus's awakening... is only a matter of time!!

Kris: Sir Ymir, please forgive me for earlier.
Ymir: It's fine. I don't mind at all. It's rare to see someone like me anyway. But it's so warm dressin' like this. Why doesn't anybody else do this? I don't get it.
Kris: Oh, is it warm?
Ymir: Yeah, it's great during winter. Hey! Why don't you try wearin' this for a change? It's a hat made from animal hide. Just wear it! You're gonna see how amazin' it is right away.
Kris: This is... Wow, it is a pretty great hat.
Ymir: See, it fits you well. Do you want to wear it for a bit?
^start 
Kris: Yes, I'd love to.
Ymir: Whoa! I'm so stoked you said that! It'll look great on you! No doubt about it.

Kris: Oh no, I don't think it suits me.
Ymir: That so...? Too bad. But, oh well.
Kris: I'm sorry. After you went to all that trouble too...
Ymir: It's fine, it's fine. I don't mind at all.

Minerva: Brother...... Brother... why...? Why here...? I--I never wanted to fight you...! I just wanted things to be like they used to... With you and Maria... Brother...... Michalis... Bro...ther......!
Michalis: ...Your tears... How long has it been since I saw them last...?
Minerva: What...? M-Michalis?! Are you...?
Michalis: I don't plan on dying in front of you, Minerva. I'd be an endless laughing stock. The Michalis you knew... would never die in a place like this. Am I right?
Minerva: Brother...! Oh, Brother!
Michalis: Hmph, don't get the wrong idea. You and I are still enemies... That will not change. The incompetence of your army sickens me, so you leave me with no choice but to help.
Minerva: Thank goodness... You've finally returned to your old self. I understand. Until the Shadow Dragon breathes his last, let us borrow your strength.

Kris: It's pitch black. Visiblity's practically non-existent... We'll be in trouble if we have to fight.

Kris: Katarina...
Katarina: I'm... not like them anymore. Kris... I want to be of use to you. That feeling is mine and mine alone. Not just some order! But my own truest desire... My treasure. Let's go, Kris.

Eremiya: The Altean army is here? Gosh, that junk puppet betrayed me... Who would have expected that she'd wrestle free from my control. But, I bet you didn't know this: There are many puppets here far superior to you, my dear. Come, my sweet little children. The bad men have come. Darkness is our friend. What our enemies cannot see, we can. Let them experience... the feeling of pure terror.

Eremiya: Oh my, if it isn't the broken puppet. I wonder... should I call you ungrateful trash or traitorous trash? But I must say, it's very brave of you to show your face in front of me again, Eine.
Katarina: Meeting you again... crushes my heart. I'd rather die, frankly... But, if I can be of use to Kris, then I will not run away!
Eremiya: A junk puppet talking like a human being? The only word you're ever allowed to say is "yes". I'll make sure that mouth of yours starts working properly right away.

@End 
Kris: Sire, we've seized control of the area. The assassins shall target you no longer.
Marth: I see, thank you.
Jagen: According to the villagers nearby... That woman called Eremiya used to be a kind bishop who looked after war orphans. But during the war, her orphanage was burned down and all the children killed... Ever since then... she changed.
Marth: So she was yet another victim of the war? That does not erase her sins, but... 'tis truly a tragedy.
Kris: However, at the very least there won't be more victims like Katarina.
Marth: Indeed. That's my only comfort. Let us go, Kris! There are still things we must do.
Kris: Yes, sire.

Gharnef: ...Bah! ...So you failed in the end... ...Eremiya.
Eremiya: Master... Gharnef... Forgive... me... For not... fulfilling your order...
Gharnef: Oh, you don't need to apologize. The ritual to revive the Shadow Dragon shall soon begin. You and your underlings were useful enough, for capturing the clerics. Heh heh, it was worth the trouble casting that spell on you...
Eremiya: What? A spell... on me...?
Gharnef: Yes, don't you remember? But of course. Poor, poor Eremiya. My spell stole that memory as well. Once upon a time, you felt grief. The corpses of the orphans killed in the war haunted your very existence. You wondered what you could have done so that they might have survived...
Eremiya: I... never wanted... to let those children die...
Gharnef: And then, I told you. You had to make the children stronger. Twisted, yes, but they became stronger so they wouldn't die, just as you wanted. Well? Have you remembered now?
Eremiya: That's right, I... I made those children...
Gharnef: Heh heh... Hypocrites like you and Marth disgust me. Despairing over the orphans' deaths, you fell all too easily under my spell. And then you gathered children, subjecting them to hellish training, just as I told you to. You watched the children cry and scream... and yet, you smiled... Heh heh, 'twas quite a sight.
Eremiya: Ah... Ahh... ...Aaaaah... ...My... ...My... children... AAAAAAH!
Gharnef: Heh heh... Worry not, Eremiya. The despair you feel now is nothing. This world will soon be enveloped in the darkest despair... You had better look forward to it, Marth. Heh heh heh...

@Opening
Grust has been liberated.

All that remains is Olbern Keep, where General Lang remains barricaded. Lang used his influence to steal belongings, daughters, and lives from the people of Grust. Was there ever a man as cruel as he is?

"I cannot forgive him. I shall take him down without fail!" Prince Marth raised his sword to the skies and ordered firmly: "Altean knights, charge!!"

@Intro 
Jagen: Kris, you should be aware that Lang is a general with high defense. To defeat him, you would do well to attack with magic or a special weapon like an armorslayer.
Kris: Duly noted.
Jagen: If you plan to defeat him with strength alone, you'd have to be extremely powerful.
^start
Jagen: Kris, your strength is simply tremendous. Against a blow from you, Lang's armor would crumple like paper. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.
Kris: Yes sir!

Jagen: Kris, your strength is quite impressive. You might just be able to defeat Lang. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.

Jagen: Kris, you are, sadly, not very strong. But you could fight using your other talents. Please, in my stead, kill that insolent man.
^end 

Lang: Heh heh heh... So the Alteans have come. Reinforcements are arriving soon; if we can hold out a little longer, we can make a pincer attack. Swordsman Navarre. When they open that door, you make your move. There is no need for restraint; slice them to pieces!
Navarre: Yeah... sure. Though the knights of Altea are hardly worthy enemies.
Lang: Oh-ho! That's my Navarre. They say not even Ogma of Talys is your equal.
Navarre: What? Ogma?! N... Naturally... A guy like him is no match for me.
Lang: I see. Glad to hear it. Then I'll leave this place in your capable hands, Navarre!

@Battle
Jagen: Sire, there seems to be movement near the front of the castle. And it would appear to be moving towards our forces.
Marth: Are they enemy reinforcements? Or allies to our cause...?
Jagen: I do not know, but... I do hope they are allies.

Frey: Sire!
Marth: Frey! Thank goodness you're safe.
Frey: You too, sire. Norne and I escaped from Altea Castle and we rode here as fast as we could.
Norne: But the rest of our forces were scattered... I'm sorry we couldn't all make it.
Marth: You don't have to apologize, I'm just glad that you're safe. The others can take care of themselves.
Frey: Sire. From here on we shall accompany you. Please give us your orders.
Norne: Oh, and please be careful! I caught a glimpse of enemy troops approachin' the castle behind us. I expect they'll be enterin' the castle soon.
Marth: Enemy reinforcements? I understand. Thank you.

Caeda: Navarre, please hear me out! Lend your sword to our case, just once more!
Navarre: What? Who are you? I'll have no business with women or children... But, there's a first for everything... (Whoa, she's smoking!) What business do you have with me?
Caeda: ...... Y-you're not Navarre! Who are you?
Samuel: Yikes, I've been exposed, huh? I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as Samuel. Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this famous "Navarre" swordsman guy. I got tired of it after a while, so I decided to pose as him and got myself hired. But I don't like this General Lang guy either. If you're alright with it, I'll lend you my sword.
Caeda: Yes... You'll do just fine...

%Ogma,Samuel 
Ogma: Navarre... You bastard...
Navarre: Stay away... This evening, my killing edge hungers for blood...
Ogma: Do you mean to kill me, no matter what? Hmph, very well. I knew that we'd have to settle our score eventually.
Samuel: Wait... Stay your blade! ...I'm no Navarre, I'm just a sham. I... it's me, Samuel. Have you forgotten, Ogma?
Ogma: Samuel?! Samuel, the gladiator from Knorda?
Samuel: Yes, I was a slave gladiator at the time, and you really helped me out. Even when everyone was making their escape, you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught...
Ogma: ......
Samuel: I heard everything from my friends. How you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse. How, by chance, the young Princess Talys, tears in her eyes, stood up for you and saved you. And that's why you swore your blade to Talys. Or rather... to the princess...
Ogma: Enough... Say no more! No more. It's in the past now... No more...
Samuel: ...Ogma... Anyway, I want to repay you! I'm following you from now on, okay?

@Recruit-Battle 
Navarre: I pity your soul. But I can at least grant you a quick death. Take this! My killing edge!!

Samuel: Doh, I shouldn't have said that I was Navarre...

@Boss 
Lang: W-wait, please! I'm sorry... Please forgive me... I've only done as the Emperor ordered me to. I didn't agree with him, but I had no choice. So... so please, s-spare my life... I'll do anything you say. Yes... Just like this... Mwahaha! You shouldn't have let your guard down! You fool... Now die!

Lang: Urgh... Impossible... I have been defeated...

%Marth,Lang
Marth: General Lang, I have--with my own eyes--witnessed a number of your crimes. I cannot forgive you. But if you have something to say, I will listen.
Lang: S-silence... silence! You damned country-boy prince! You're a fool for coming here! Just die already!
Marth: Is that your answer? Then prepare yourself!

%Kris,Lang
Lang: Y-you! You're that impertinent little girl/boy from before...!
Kris: Lang! You have oppressed countless people, and insulted my liege. You can only atone for these sins with your life!
Lang: W... Why you!

@End 
Marth: Lord Wendell! Thank goodness you're unharmed.
Wendell: Lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned. Even though I told him that I must fulfill a mission assigned to me by Archsage Gotoh...
Marth: A mission from Lord Gotoh?
Wendell: That's correct... You have seen the "Starsphere"--the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface. In order to pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil, Lord Gotoh created a sacred spell named "Starlight" from that orb.
Wendell: Unfortunately, the strain on the Starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards, which scattered into the sky. Lord Gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power, and that if even one of them is lost, the world will fall into irreparable ruin. By any means possible, we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the Starsphere.
Marth: Is... Is this a joke? That the world could just end... This is all very hard to take in. But aren't these the star shards? If so, we already have a few. After we retake Altea, we'd be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs.
Wendell: Of course... Your country was only just invaded by the Empire... I understand, Prince... I too shall fight to restore Altea, then. Thinking about it, my meeting with you is like a sign from Lord Gotoh himself. In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate. But, please, let's stop by the Fane of Raman. We may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple.
Marth: Understood. If it's the Fane of Raman, we can go there on our way to Altea!

Marth: General Lang has been defeated. And now the people of Grust no longer have to suffer.
Kris: That's right, sire.
Marth: Kris, since leaving Altea, we've had a great deal of fights... Looking back at them now...

^start 
Marth: None of our companions were hurt and none of them died. That's what I'm happiest about. Kris, it's because you've been here. Thank you so much.

Marth: It couldn't be helped, but... Some of our comrades were injured or passed on. I don't want to lose anyone from now. I know we can do it if you're there. Kris, please, help me.

Marth: All I remember is seeing our companions fall, one by one... Enough! I don't want any of our comrades to suffer that pain. Kris, please, help me.
^end 

^locked 
Jagen: Sire, some new information has come in from the patrol. Just ahead, the enemy seems to be preparing some kind of ambush. It's not the Archanean Empire, but likely, I fear, mercenaries hired with coin.
Marth: Mercenaries, is it...? Do we continue as we are or take a longer, safer route? Personally, I'd rather not detour. We have to return to Altea as soon as possible.
Jagen: Hmph, if you would allow me to speak as your tactician... I think we ought to stay here and fight. We will be facing mercenaries. The Altean knights would never lose to mere mercenaries.
Marth: Kris, your thoughts?
Kris: I agree with Sir Jagen.
Marth: I see, thank you. Jagen, Kris! The whole army shall move on as they were. We'll hit the mercenaries head-on!

@Dialogue 
Anna: Welcome! Today, another hero will be born. One who will help decide the world's fate... What's your name, hero?

Anna: Are you a boy, or a girl?

Anna: What's your occupation?

Anna: And what do you look like?

Anna: I shall now predict your journey using your past, present, and future. Beginning with your past, what sort of circumstances were you born into?

Anna: And what about you now? What is your most impressive attribute?

Anna: Finally, your future. What kind of future trait do you strive to attain?

Anna: With everything now complete, let us begin your story posthaste...

Katarina: Eek!
Kris: Hey, are you okay?
Katarina: I-I'm sorry. I was in a hurry, and... Excuse me, did you come here to become an Altean knight as well?
Kris: Yeah. I came here all the way from Sera village when I heard they were recruiting new knights. My name's Kris.
Katarina: Kris? That's a nice name. We're here for the same reason then. My name is Katarina. I came because I wish to serve Prince Marth. But there sure are a lot of hopefuls here. Look, there's one over there and another there...
Luke: Here it is! This is where my shining legacy starts! The first chapter of my epic saga to become Altea's greatest knight!
Roderick: ...Luke, I'm going up ahead.
Luke: Hey, wait up, Roderick! Don't leave your partner behind!
Kris: There's no doubt those two were knight candidates like us.
Katarina: We should follow them, Kris. I think the leader of the knights, Sir Jagen, has something to say to all of us.

Jagen: Altea's gates have opened today so that we may test you as potential knights. Knights will be chosen by their ability, not by their blood. The path is not easy, however. We have gathered a hundred men and women today, and only a handful of you will succeed.
Katarina: T-this is nerve-wracking.
Kris: I'm nervous too, but I've been training hard for this day.
Jagen: We expect every one of you to show us the results of your arduous training! Apprentices, I want you to gather in pairs! You will be facing real Altean knights in mock combat!
Katarina: Huh?! We have to fight? T-this could be a problem... Kris, would you please partner with me? I'm training to become a tactician.
Kris: A tactician?
Katarina: Y-yes. I can give you advice on how to fight, but I can't fight at all...
Soldier: Hey, you two! You're up next. Grab your weapons and get into position. Hurry!
Kris: Got it! Let's go, Katarina! The test is about to start.
Katarina: Y-yes! Let's do our best.

@Battle 
Katarina: Kris! Let's move to that spot over there.

Soldier: So you made it to the right place. I'll be your first opponent. Attack me whenever you like!

Jagen: ...I'm your final opponent for the day. Don't hold back!

@Boss 
Jagen: Excellent. Show me what you've got!

Jagen: Urgh... I've been beaten?

@End 
Kris: Phew... we won, somehow.
Jagen: Yes... splendid work! I see we can expect much from this year's apprentices.
Katarina: You did it! We won, Kris! ...But I didn't really do anything... It was all thanks to you that we won, Kris!

Jagen: Prince Marth wishes to address everyone who passed the test. Sire, if you please.
Marth: I humbly thank you all for coming.
Katarina: Ah, it's Prince Marth! He looks so majestic. So that's the face of the hero who saved the world. I love the stories about Prince Marth in the last war. How about you, Kris?
Kris: Of course. After all, Prince Marth was the hero who brought an end to the previous war.
Katarina: Yes, he defeated the Shadow Dragon and Dark Pontifex, restoring peace to the world.
Jagen: You there, silence! You stand before Prince Marth!
Katarina: Eep!
Marth: Everyone. I'm truly happy that so many came to help shoulder Altea's future. With the war over, peace has returned. However, peace isn't something we can simply take for granted: It is my duty, as ruler, to risk my life to protect it. Alone, I am powerless. So, everyone. From now on, I want you to lend me your power, as my knights.
Katarina: Hear hear, Prince Marth! It was wonderful hearing Prince Marth speak, wasn't it, Kris?
Kris: Yes, it was. We have to do our best so he can rely on us.
Katarina: Let's keep at it together!

@Narration
Once, there was a war known as the "War of Shadows," An epic battle between Prince Marth’s heroes and the Dolhrian Empire, which ended with the defeat of the Earth Dragon King, Medeus. The warriors who had united under the Fire Emblem returned to their own lands, devoting themselves to the reconstruction of their homelands. Among the nations that made up the "Seven Kingdoms of Archanea", Gra and Grust were devastated. Altea, Aurelis, Macedon, and Talys were left deeply scarred, and even the mighty Kingdom of Archanea was undergoing restoration.

However, in the palace still shaken by war, one important event took place. Hardin, the younger brother of King Aurelis, was married to Princess Nyna, becoming the twenty-fourth king of House Archanea. After ascending the throne, Hardin aggressively restored the country in the twinkling of an eye, and formed a powerful army by gathering many soldiers. He then proclaimed the restoration of the Holy Archanean Empire, and himself Emperor.

One year has passed since the war with Dolhr. The world seemed to be moving towards an era of peace. However, unbeknownst to man, the cogs of destiny had started spiraling out of order.

@Opening 
It has been a year since the War of Shadows ended. The war-ravaged kingdom of Altea was finally starting to regain stability thanks to Prince Marth’s efforts. Prince Marth’s engagement to Princess Caeda was announced, and the people of Altea rejoiced, sharing their happiness. However... Nearing the day of their wedding, an unexpected letter arrived from the imperial palace, containing an imperial edict.

"Dear Prince Marth of Altea, In the Kingdom of Grust, now under imperial rule, a large-scale rebellion has broken out. I request your kingdom’s assistance in its subjugation. Your Highness is to lead the entire army of Altea and sortie at once, suppressing the Grustian rebellion. - The Emperor of Archanea"

The Kingdom of Archanea was Altea’s suzerain, so its orders were absolute. Forced to comply, Marth ordered the knight Cain to protect his homeland, and together with Jagen, the paladin Arran, and the young, newly appointed knights, left Altea on the Grustian expedition.

@Intro 
Marth: Kris, we'll be arriving shortly. This is your first real battle, is it not? Battles will be different from here on out. Defeat on the battlefield means death. Any allies you lose will never return... That is the harsh reality of war. You must take the utmost care not to get yourself killed.
Kris: Of course, sire.
Marth: You, and everyone else... It would be wonderful if we could end this battle without losing anyone...
Kris: Sire...
Jagen: Sire, we have made arrangements for a transport convoy. We will also have merchants accompanying us, who will sell us weapons and items. I daresay they will be invaluable during battle preparations.
Marth: Thank you, Jagen. Then let's begin our preparations at once.

Jagen: Sire, this is General Lang, the commanding officer of the occupational forces.
Lang: Oho, so you are Prince Marth? Glad you could make it here. Since you've come all this way, I suppose I'll let you have the glory of capturing the rebel leader, General Lorenz.
Marth: What?! General Lorenz leads the rebels?! What would possess him to rebel of all things?!
Lang: Who knows? I haven't the foggiest idea, and frankly I don't care. Prince. You are to kill General Lorenz, and reclaim the children of the Grustian royal family that he's hiding. While you do that... We will slaughter the families of those who participated in this rebellion and raze their homes to the ground.
Marth: Are you insane?! They're innocent civilians!
Lang: "I-insane"!? Young man, are you questioning my orders?! Perhaps Altea, too, plans to rebel against Archanea...?
Marth: Of course not! That's not...
Lang: Prince Marth, your tiny country means absolutely nothing to me. Your rude behaviour is merely an irritation. Do not forget that I have the power of the empire behind me: I can crush weak, pesky insects like you any time I wish.
Marth: Jagen... What in the world is going on here? How could Hardin have entrusted this country to such a vile man?
Jagen: Sire, I understand how you feel. However, Lorenz has begun a rebellion. That much seems to be true, so we ought to do something about that first. Sire, why don't you try speaking to General Lorenz personally? Allow me to stay by your side and serve as your tactician. Royal Guard Kris! When Prince Marth is in danger on the battlefield, protect him at all costs. That is an order!
Kris: Acknowledged.
Marth: Kris, I have no need to worry if you're here. Let's clean up the bandits, and head to General Lorenz's position!
Kris: Yes sir!

@Visit 
Villager: After the last war, Princess Nyna let this country keep its sovereignty under the rule of General Lorenz. However, as soon as Hardin became emperor, General Lorenz was banished and Lang's troops came crawling in. Lang stole everything from us. He stole our gold, of course, but he even stole our food and our loved ones... Ah... If only General Camus were here! Then we wouldn't have to live in fear of people like Lang!

Villager: There aren't any young girls left in this country. They were all taken away by the imperial troops. They say General Lang keeps the really pretty ones to himself. What a dark, insane chapter in Grust's history...

Villager: The late King Grust had two children. Princess Yuliya and Prince Jubelo. They're still young. Maybe thirteen, or fourteen; cute little twins, both of them. In the last war, Gharnef, the Dark Pontifex, kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king. They were taken to Khadein, the city of magic, and locked away in a pitch-black room. At great personal risk, Pontifex Wendell saved them. He took them to a monastery to protect them.

Villager: General Lorenz took the royal children from Lord Wendell and raised them in Grust. The empire demanded their extradition, but Lorenz was afraid they would be killed, and hid them. The empire branded Lorenz a traitor, and sent General Lang here. Lang did horrible things to find the royal children. That's why we rose up. But, we lost. And now Lang is going to kill everyone in this entire country!

Villager: I heard that General Lorenz lived in Talys when he was young. Talys wasn't unified at the time, so there were a number of noble houses contending for control. Lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch of one house, and together they unified Talys into one country. Lorenz and that patriarch--now the king of Talys--remain close friends to this day.

Villager: I only saw him briefly, but that knight, Arran, looked awfully pale. You know, he's probably hit the wall, so to speak. I doubt he'll get any stronger, no matter how much he fights...

@Recruit-Visit 
Villager: Oh... Please, show mercy to just this child. She's only ten years old.
Marth: Ma'am, please calm yourself. I am not here to take any children.
Villager: What... You're not imperial soldiers?
Marth: No... We're not. We didn't come to fight. If there's anything you need, please ask. It's not much, but we can give you food.
Marisha: Wait... Please, take me with you...
Marth: Huh...? You're... Are you really ten?
Marisha: No... I'm a grown woman, but Granny lied so that I wouldn't be taken away by the soldiers. Lang's soldiers are all monstrous. But you're different. You have very sweet eyes. Please, take me with you. I want you to take me away from this country, and take me to yours.
Villager: It's not safe for her to stay here. Please take her with you, and protect her. You can marry her, too, if you like. Marisha is a beautiful, good-natured lady, just like me! I'm sure she'll make a fine wife.
Marisha: No-no-no! Granny, it's far too early for that! Now you've made Marisha all flustered!

@Battle 
Bandit: Oh? A battle, is it? We're in luck, boys! Let's loot 'em villages before 'ey realize what's hit 'em!

Lorenz: Alright, that will do for now... Sir Ogma, please forgive me for getting you involved in this mess.
Ogma: I am here on King Talys's orders. As such, I will do everything in my power to help.
Lorenz: I see... Then I have a favor to ask of you. I want you to escort these children to Macedon. These children... Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya, are King Grust's orphans. Please. Take them safely to Lord Wendell in Macedon.
Ogma: Understood... I will guard these two with my life.
Lorenz: Thank you, Sir Ogma... Now, Prince Jubelo, Princess Yuliya, you will be leaving with Sir Ogma.
Yuliya: No! I'm not going! I won't leave you behind!
Lorenz: Princess... I cannot go. With this wound, I can barely even walk. It saddens me, but you two must go on without me.
Yuliya: You took that grievous wound to protect us... How can you tell us to just leave you behind now?! I will never leave. We will never leave your side, Lorenz!!
Ogma: What shall I do, General?
Lorenz: Hmm... this is most troublesome. Princess Yuliya is not one to change her mind easily... We will remain here.
Ogma: In that case, I will find some other way to help you. I will find Lang and bring him down... I will bury him with this sword, I swear on it. General Lorenz, you must hold out until then...!

@Boss-Talk 
%Marth,Lorenz 
Lorenz: Prince Marth! So it is you... How unfortunate, that I must fight... the Altean army and its prince...
Marth: Please, wait. I do not wish to fight with you. I heard about everything from the villagers. I've heard of all the atrocities Archanea has committed. I promise, I will inform Emperor Hardin of the truth and rescue Grust. So please, lower your weapons.
Lorenz: Prince... I am grateful for the offer. But, I am afraid that I cannot comply. Prince, you know nothing. Do you think that a man of Emperor Hardin's caliber would make a general out of a man as worthless as Lang without good reason? He called for an invasion: to crush the kingdom of Grust and make it a territory of the Empire.
Marth: No, it can't be! Hardin would never do something like that.
Lorenz: I know it's hard to believe. But I'm afraid that, ever since he became emperor, he has changed a great deal. He is no longer the Hardin you once knew. Prince, I have one final request of you. In this stronghold, I am protecting the young prince and princess of Grust. Please, find a way to help them. If you can do just that, I will have no regrets.
Marth: What... General Lorenz, what are you saying...?!
Lorenz: Prince Marth... My life in exchange for theirs... By any means necessary, please help them... This is the last thing I will ask.
Marth: General Lorenz!! ......This can't be happening......

@Boss 
Lorenz: What?! You're... the Altean army?! So even Altea has turned on us...

Lorenz: Forgive me, people of Grust...

@End 
Elder: Prince Marth... General Lorenz entrusted everything to you. You spared his life, and even heard him out. We, the people of Grust, thank you. Please, let me offer you a token of our gratitude. Here. We're protecting Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya in this stronghold. I beg you, do what you must to protect our last fragments of hope...

Marth: You, you're... Grust's royal heirs... Prince Jubelo and Princess Yuliya?!
Jubelo: Sniff... Lorenz... He's gone... How can we live on without him?
Yuliya: You monsters!! Stay away! You're going to murder us just like you murdered Lorenz!!
Marth: No, you have it all wrong!! We just...
Lang: Ah... Prince Marth. You finally caught these filthy traitors.
Marth: General Lang! Wait, please! These children have done nothing wrong. Allow me to take custody of them.
Lang: Don't make me laugh. These brats are coming with me to my castle. Besides, my dear prince, you have other, more important, priorities. I have received reports that there has been a military revolt in Macedon, and Princess Minerva has been imprisoned.
Marth: What...?! How could that happen to Macedon?! I understand my obligations, General Lang. Still, these children... Let them stay with me, please.
Lang: Prince, do not try my patience! Listen up you two! You're coming with me!
Yuliya: No, let me go!! Jubelo... help me!!
Jubelo: Yuliya... Yuliya...!!
Marth: Wait!! Lang! Release them at once!
Kris: Sire! Give me the order, and I'll get them safely back at once!
Jagen: Sire, don't do it!! You too, Kris! If we oppose Lang right here, right now, we run the risk of being branded traitors by Archanea.
Marth: But Jagen, are you telling me to simply allow Lang to take them?! I cannot stand for that...
Jagen: I understand how you feel, sire... But please remain patient for a little longer. If we head to Macedon... then rescue Princess Minerva, Macedon will surely lend us its strength.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
To avoid needless battle, the Altean army decided to cross the central mountain range, said to be impassable for a large army. Going through Adria Pass, one will soon reach the city of Pales. Hurry, we can't let the enemy spot us! We must charge straight through!! Marth and the others were anxious, but they carried on advancing across the narrow mountain road. But they didn't expect, in the middle of the cliff, to be ambushed by an unfathomable enemy. They were the northern Kingdom of Aurelis' elite squad, the "Wolfguard", who had headed south to aid Archanea.

@Intro 
Marth: Kris, if we can get through this pass we will be on Archanea's doorstep. Just hang in there a little longer.
Kris: Yes, sire.
Marth: Despite all the odds, we've surpassed Anri's Way and taken back Altea... The battles we've faced up to now... have been nothing short of difficult. And in those battles...
^start
Marth: We've managed to keep everyone alive. With the strength of all our comrades, we can accomplish something worthy of Anri... I'm so proud of everyone.
Kris: Sire......

Marth: It's thanks to our friends that our country is free; I cannot help but think of the fallen. I want to become stronger for them. From now on, let's live so that no one falls again...
Kris: Sire......

Marth: ...The feeling of pain overwhelms me. When I think of the severely wounded, and the many who have fallen... Perhaps if I had been stronger like Anri, then everyone would still be alive... From now... From now on, I will definitely...
Kris: Sire......

@Battle 
Roshea: Wolf, Sedgar, Vyland. Is this really okay...? Can we really fight this battle?
Wolf: Roshea! What are you trying to say? Look, the Altean army is marching long the narrow mountain road. Now's our only chance to defeat them.
Vyland: Yes, Roshea. We swore that we could sacrifice our lives for Lord Hardin. Lord Hardin was the one who freed us plains people from slavery. If we don't fight Altea now, Millennium Court will fall. Do you want Lord Hardin to be defeated by them?
Sedgar: That's right! Prince Marth wants to destroy Archanea, and conquer the world. And that's why he joined forces with Macedon to crust Grust. Now he even has Gra under his rule. If we don't do something, the whole world will fall under his control.
Roshea: I still don't believe it. I cannot believe Prince Marth would have such ambitions.
Wolf: What? Are you saying that Emperor Hardin lied? Do you think that he would stoop to such a low!? Enough, Roshea!! You disappoint me, if you want to betray us then go ahead. Sedgar, Vyland, let's go. If we're too slow, they will pass us.
Roshea: Hey, wait! I won't betray you. I understand... I'll go.

Marth: The Wolfguard of Aurelis! Must we fight them as well...?
Jagen: Sire, please hold on. We've just received word from a messenger of King Aurelis. It seems Aurelis has no plans to war... According to the messenger, King Aurelis wishes to parley with you in the village.
Marth: What? What could this mean? That the Wolfguard is moving independent of Aurelis's orders?
Jagen: I don't know, but... Depending on how negotiations go, it's possible the Wolfguard may signal a retreat.
Marth: I see. It would benefit us all if we could avoid pointless fighting. Let's hurry to the village!

@Visit 
King Aurelis: Oh, Prince Marth. It is good to see you.
Marth: Huh, aren't you King Aurelis?! What are you doing here?
King Aurelis: I came here to stop my country's army. Also I must apologise to your highness. I believed Hardin's words and followed Archanea, but I now realize my wrongs. Archanea's Empress Nyna secretly sent me a letter, saying that Hardin isn't normal and is ill... My country will remain neutral, and its knights will return to Aurelis. I hope you won't attack my men anymore.
Marth: I understand, your highness. I don't want to fight with you. Please forgive me for taking so many of your knights' lives.
King Aurelis: Oh! You really are like what the rumors say. My body is frail and I have no children, and even Hardin, my younger brother, has completely changed. Prince Marth, please protect Aurelis in my place. I will hand my whole country to you. I give this jewel to you as a gift. This is a magical jewel containing the divine power of life. I spent a lot of gold to buy it from a travelling merchant. I believe it will be useful to you. Don't worry about Hardin. Since he is a knight, it is natural for him to die in battle. That is his fate. Well, Prince Marth, I will go on ahead. I hop you will all be safe...

@Recruit-Battle 
Roshea: I am Roshea of the Aurelis knights. I don't want to fight, but I can't betray my companions. Please forgive me...

Vyland: As long as we're here, we won't let you get to Millennium Court. If you don't want to die, run back to your country!

Sedgar: You... Why are you invading other countries? Have you been blinded by ambition?

Wolf: The leader of Aurelis' knights, Wolf, is here for your head!

Wolfguard: Lord Hardin...

Kris: No, it's not like that. It was your decision, sire. I just came up with the idea.
Marth: That's hardly the whole truth. The times when I'm lost in my thoughts, if you're there, I have confidence. I'm thankful for that; more than anything.
Jagen: Sire, we've just received urgent news. Apparently a coup d'etat broke out in the palace. The knights and citizens who opposed Emperor Hardin's ways rose in rebellion.
Marth: What in the blazes?! What has happened to them now?
Jagen: Unfortunately, the instigators were all defeated and captured... Rumor has it that the rebels are being executed by the day.

Marth: Damn it, Hardin... I can't believe it. It's decided. We will head for the palace at once and end this. Kris, let's go!!
Kris: Yes, sire!
/***EOF***/
@Intro 
Marth: Kris... The final battle is nigh. Medeus awaits us up ahead. It won't be an easy battle... I dare not imagine how many of us will be left standing at the end... Either way, the fate of this world rests on our hands...
Kris: Sire... Worry not, sire. We will emerge victorious. That's what the fortune-teller said.
Marth: Fortune-teller?
Kris: When I was a child, I asked our village's fortune-teller for a reading... The old lady held the palm of my hand, and said to me... "Ah, your fate is clear to me, child."
Marth: And? What did she say?
^start 
Kris: She said that I would "grow up to be a legendary hero..."

Kris: She said that I would "live out my life quietly..."

Kris: She said that I would "follow my calling like an arrow..."

Kris: She said that I would "devote my life to the service of others..."

Kris: She said that I would "be stupidly rich and famous..."
^end
Marth: Oh...? I can imagine that happening...
Kris: And she said that I'd live until I was a hundred years old...!
Marth: 'Til a hundred...? That is an awfully long time... Oh, I see...! If the fortune-teller was right, then...
Kris: Then we are definitely walking out of this hall victorious. I'm not quite that old yet... So, rest easy, sire.
Marth: Haha, you're quite right. I... feel much calmer now. Thank you, Kris...

@Battle 
Marth: I see my sister and the others... But who are they guarding...? No, it can't be... That's--that's Medeus...!
Jagen: With the princesses around him, sire, you'll be unable to strike down Medeus. If we don't do something soon, then the other dragons will awaken, and this battle will rapidly escalate into mayhem.
Marth: Then, what do you suppose I do? How on earth can we save them?! Tell me, Jagen!
Jagen: I... I do not know... But, if we are to defeat Medeus, we must stop at nothing...
Marth: What?! ...You can't mean to kill them?!
Jagen: It may be... necessary. As they are now, they suffer greatly. We must save them, even if it should cost them their lives...
Marth: Jagen, this--is this really a decision I must make?
Jagen: You are Altea's crown prince, sire. A ruler must be ready for anything, though it may cost them their happiness. That is all.
Marth: Enough, Jagen. I understand. Still, I cannot accept it. There must be another way. Even till the very end, I will never give up!!
Jagen: Kris, I know how Prince Marth feels. Please, I beg of you... Please find a way to save them.
Kris: Understood. I will try my best. But if the occasion should arise... Even if Prince Marth himself refuses, I shall release them from their misery... But for now... I don't want to think about it. I still want to hope.
Jagen: Kris......

%Julian,Lena
Julian: Lena, snap out of it! C'mon, it's me! Julian! What's wrong with you, Lena? I know I'm a good-for-nothing scoundrel, but for you, I'd do anything. I don't want anything else-- I just want to see your smile again. Hey, Lena; could you smile for me? Please...
Lena: Oh... Julian...? You came. I knew you'd find me. I knew it. That's why, I could continue struggling in the darkness of my soul... Julian, I'm sorry. I've always been a bother to you.
Julian: Are you kiddin' me, Lena...? I'm just happy to hear your voice again.
Lena: Julian, there's something I'd like very much. Will you listen?
Julian: Huh? Sure, Lena, hit me. So long as it's within my power...
Lena: Could you call me... "honey"? You're always "Lena" this and "Lena" that. You speak as though we're barely friends-- and I don't like that feeling. That just won't do, especially not after we settle down together in Macedon.
Julian: Huh? ...What're you talking about, Lena...? Er... I mean... H-honey... Don't tell you and I are gonna...
Lena: Uh-huh... I'm sure God will forgive me. After all, you... You mean the world to me.

Minerva: Maria! Please, wake up! It's me, Minerva! What's happened to you?! Get a hold of yourself.
Maria: Unh... Ah... Minerva... A-ahhhhhh! Medeus is...
Minerva: Shh. It's alright now. Everything's going to be okay. I'm so sorry, Maria. I've left you alone for so long...
Maria: Minerva... I was scared... I was so scared... Oh! How is Michalis? I think he fought Gharnef to save me.
Minerva: Michalis... is fine. Don't worry, Maria.
Maria: Really? Then, once we go home, we'll be together again just like before? I'm so glad, Minerva! Oh, I hope we can see him soon.
Minerva: Maria......

%Sirius,Nyna 
Nyna: Ahh... I've done something terrible. I was too foolish... I hurt Hardin... I drove him to despair.
Sirius: My queen... Prince Marth has ended Hardin's suffering. The Emperor loved you till the very end. He was sorry for what he'd done to you. It's alright now. You need not worry. It was all just a bad dream...
Nyna: ...... Who......? Oh...! You're... Camus...?! Camus!! Why... Why are you... This is a dream, isn't it?
Sirius: Nngh! ...My queen... You are mistaken... I am Sirius, a soldier of the allied forces. I know not of this Camus...
Nyna: Sirius...?! ...It can't be... No! You're wrong!! You're...
Sirius: Please, calm yourself; you must be exhausted. I must depart soon. Queen Nyna, listen to me... You should head to Prince Marth.
Nyna: You... Where are you going?
Sirius: I must go to my country. There's... someone waiting for me.
Nyna: Is... Is that so...? I see... Sirius... Thank you. I am most grateful.
Sirius: ...Forgive me...
Nyna: Pardon...?!
Sirius: No... It is nothing... Now, Queen Nyna; go!

%Merric,Elice 
Merric: Princess Elice! It's me, Merric. Snap out out of it! I--I studied magic ferociously, all so that I could protect you... I'm sorry... I failed. I couldn't be by your side, when you needed me most. Elice... Please. Please open your eyes!
Elice: Merric...? ...Ah! Oh, Merric! Help me... Gharnef is... I'm so frightened... Please help me!
Merric: Elice! Thank goodness, you've come back! It's alright now. I'm here, so... Oh... but Prince Marth is... Everyone's watching, so we can't... Oh well... *ahem* Elice, I'll never leave your side again. No matter what may come between us... Never again shall I abandon you!

@Battle 
Elice: Forgive me, Marth... I've been such a burden.
Nyna: We're all safe now. We're free of the Shadow Dragon's power.
Maria: Prince Marth! Finish him off!
Lena: We will heal the wounded, so that no one else shall die...
Kris: Sire, good news. The princesses have come back to us. Your kindness has saved their souls.
Marth: Thank goodness. I'm too happy for words. I suppose some battles require sacrifice... But that matters not... I won't give up--not now, not ever! Together, we will win this battle!
Medeus: YOU PRESUMPTUOUS HUMANS... HOW DARE YOU--!
Marth: Shadow Dragon Medeus! Now, nothing stands between this blade and you. Come, let's settle this!

@Boss 
Medeus: I HAVE... REVIVED... FOOLISH HUMANS... I WILL LEAVE... NONE ALIVE...

Medeus: GWAH...! WHY......? WHY... HAVE I... BEEN DEFEATED... SO EASILY...? IS THIS... THE POWER... ...OF NAGA'S... BINDING SHIELD...? KNOW THIS, HUMANS... THIS LIGHT IS ONLY A BRIEF RESPITE... SO LONG AS EVIL LURKS WITHIN THE HEARTS OF MAN... SHOULD THIS ACCURSED SHIELD BE LOST, WE SHALL RISE FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL... DO NOT... EVER FORGET...

Medeus: GAHAHA... NAIVE HUMANS... DON'T THINK YOU'VE WON! YOUR NAIVETE... SHALL BE YOUR UNDOING... MY NOBLE THRALLS... BECOME MY FLESH AND BLOOD... GIVE ME YOUR STRENGTH!

%Marth,Medeus
Medeus: DO YOU PLAN TO... DEFY ME ONCE MORE... DESCENDANT OF ANRI...?
Marth: No matter how many times you return, mankind will never surrender! This long battle... I will end it here, once and for all!

%Kris,Medeus
Medeus: A MERE HUMAN SUCH AS YOURSELF... WISHES TO CHALLENGE ME...? HOW FOOLISH...
Kris: I have come this far, just for this moment. My death means nothing, for Prince Marth will create a bright future for us all...! As long as I have that hope, I'll fight on. I'll come at you with everything I've got!

@Recruit-Battle 
Elice: WE WILL KILL ALL... WHO DEFY... LORD MEDEUS...

@Opening 
Marth and the others were transported to Altea's outskirts by Gotoh's magic. They were ready to begin the battle to reclaim their homeland. The commander of Archanea's army, General Eibel, had ordered the Gra Knights to charge, to buy time. At the same time he prepared many dishonorable tactics, and waited for the chance to defeat Altea's army in one swift blow. Before his fond homeland, Marth's battles were about to begin once again. "We will reclaim our captical of Anri!! We will reclaim our homeland!!" Prince Marth's voice resounded through Altea's skies. They had travelled a difficult journey, but their destination was finally reached.

@Intro 
^locked 
Kris: Sire, the war council will begin soon.
Marth: Thank you, Kris... Huh? Wh-what happened to your hair...?
Kris: Sir Xane did it for me. He said that a legendary power would enter me if I wear this tiara. And this hairstyle complements it. Anything to become stronger...
Marth: ...L-legendary power? Oh, Xane's handiwork, I see. He can certainly be a handful...
^end 

@Intro 
Soldier: General, the missing Altean remnants have finally returned.
Eibel: Really? Haha...! What good timing. We will follow our original plan. Have Gra's soldiers move out to lure them and then defeat them in one go.
Soldier: Understood, but, what about "him"?
Eibel: The paladin, Abel? It doesn't matter if he betrays me! If he does, you will kill the female hostage!! He has already retired from the army. He won't swear loyalty to the prince again. Ha ha...! How will they avoid fighting Abel...? This will be very interesting to watch...

Dolph: Prince Marth, I have been waiting for you. And you have finally returned.
Marth: Oh! Dolph! You're a general of Archanea, though; why would you come to my side?
Dolph: I've given up my position and have left Emperor Hardin's side. There is no justice left in Archanea. But justice lies in your Altea. And that's why I've come to you.
Marth: I see. Then Dolph, will you fight with us?
Dolph: Indeed I shall. Let this battle be a testament to my faith in you.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Abel
Marth: Abel!? Why are you... I don't believe this, you're betraying your homeland!?
Abel: Lord Marth... Please forgive me... They took Est... If I didn't fight... They would kill her. ...But after meeting your highness, I can no longer... fight... against Altea... Est... I'm sorry, please forgive me!!

%Est,Abel
Est: Abel... I’m sorry, you must have suffered.
Abel: Est!! You’re safe.
Est: Yes, Lord Marth rescued me. I’m alright now.
Abel: Really...? Damn, Archanea... But how should I apologize to Lord Marth...?
Est: I’m sorry... It was all because of me.
Abel: No, Est! It was nothing to do with you!! Those fools... I won’t forgive them... I’ll show them how deep my anger is!!

@Visit 
Old man: In the forts are many enemies. Don't be careless.

Woman: Oh, you... Where did you all go to? You all went missing for so long that everyone became very worried about you.

Young man: The Kingdom of Gra views Altea as its enemy. But, in reality, they were forced to fight because of their alliance with Archanea.

Woman: After Altea fell, Elice was taken to an unknown place by a black-robed bishop... Oh... Princess Elice... I pray that you are safe and well...

Young woman: Since being ruled by the imperial army, our days have been difficultly passed. But, we all believed that Lord Marth would definitely come back for us. He would rescue us all from our suffering... Because, our Lord Marth is the warrior of light chosen by the deities... the Starlord!

Young man: Nearby are enemy spies. Be careful! They will come from the forts.

Young man: The mercenaries protecting the castle are Altea's elites. It would be great if they could become your allies.

Man: Oh, your highness, you've finally come. I have been waiting, to give this to you. However this village and the neighboring village...
Marth: Mmm, I understand. But, for the sake of everyone, you should start to make up with them...

@Recruit-Battle 
Abel: Your highness... Please forgive me... I don't want to lose Est...

Abel: Est...

@Boss 
Eibel: What! Being able to defeat my great army. Are you even human?

Eibel: My Archanea army could be defeated...?

Marth: That was quite a battle. Is everyone alright?
Jagen: There's no need for concern, sire. Everybody has eagerly awaited this day.
Kris: Sir Jagen speaks truly. We've been fighting for this day-- the day we reclaim our homeland.
Marth: Yet, because of Archanea's actions, so many innocent lives have been lost. How can I face them...? I've caused them great sorrow. Because I was too weak... Was I presumptuous in believing I could protect my homeland?
Kris: Sire... Do you remember, sire? The words you said to us on the very first day of our training?
Marth: Kris...... Of course. I could never forget......
Marth: Alone, I am powerless. So, everyone. From now on, I want you to lend me your power, as my knights.
Kris: Upon hearing your words, I decided that I would work hard, so that I could be of assistance to you, sire. I want to become like you. There is no need for you to shoulder everything on your own. Your pain, and your suffering... They are not yours to bear alone. I will always be by your side.
Marth: Kris......
Jagen: Sire, chin up! We must still recapture Altea Castle. I believe that our enemies are well prepared for us, but it is our castle. We know it better than they do. Sire, give us the command! We will fight to recover our home!!

Marth: That was a tough battle. Is everyone alright?
Jagen: Don't worry, sire. Everybody has eagerly awaited this day.
Kris: Sir Jagen speaks truly. We've been fighting for this day-- the day we reclaim our homeland.
Marth: Yet, so many innocent lives have been stolen by Archanea. No apology is worthy for them... I've caused them great sorrow. Because of my unreliability... Was I presumptuous in believing I could protect my homeland?
Kris: Sire... Do you remember, sire? The words you said to us on the very first day of our training?
Marth: Kris...... Of course. I could never forget......
Marth: Alone, I am powerless. So, everyone. From now on, I want you to lend me your power, as my knights.
Kris: Upon hearing your words, I decided that I would become your strength, sire. I wish to be your sword. There is no need for you to shoulder your burden alone. Your pain, and your suffering... Do not let them be yours to bear alone. I will always be by your side.
Marth: Kris......
Jagen: Sire, chin up. We must still recapture Altea Castle. I believe that our enemies are well prepared for us, but it is our castle. We know it better than they do. Sire, give us the command! We will fight to recover our home!!

Marth: By the way, Kris, About your tiara... Did it work? Did you feel the, er, legendary power?
Kris: No, I didn't feel any different.
Marth: As I suspected... Kris, I believe Xane pulled a fast one on you.
Kris: I-is that so...?
Marth: In light of this, would you like to return your hair to the way it was before?
Kris: Yes, thank you.
Marth: Good, I'm glad we've sorted that out.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
This was a fierce battle like no other. But, their homeland of Altea has been liberated. All that remains is the castle... If I could regain Altea castle, where I was born... Everybody, thank you... I really must thank you all for placing your trust in me... Before Marth's face flowed shimmering tears... Even the girl, who gently wiped his tears away, couldn't prevent her own tears...

@Intro 
Jagen: Kris, we've returned at long last. We're back where it all began...
Kris: Yeah. It's a curious feeling. It feels like yesterday that I first stepped foot here and yet it seems so far away...
Jagen: Yes, I remember. When you first arrived here for training, you had no experience of battle. And now...
^start 
Jagen: You've grown into one of the continent's finest young soldiers. Kris, with you here, I have no doubt that we can reclaim our homeland. We're all counting on you.

Jagen: You have gained much experience as a knight of Altea. Kris, your efforts will decide whether or not we will succeed in reclaiming Altea. We're counting on you.

Jagen: Hmm... You haven't really changed very much from how you were back then. Kris, you must work harder on the battlefield from now on. I'm counting on you.

Marth: How disgraceful... Thieves inside our fair castle? What if they've stolen the Geosphere?
Jagen: Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking thief making his way north. We should capture him before it's too late.
Kris: Sire, if you'd allow me the honor, I will go. Your orders, please.

Marth: How disgraceful... They let thieves inside the castle? What if they've stolen the Geosphere?
Jagen: Sire, we've sighted a suspicious-looking thief making his way north. We should capture him before it's too late.
Kris: Sire, if necessary, I shall recover it. Your orders, my lord!

Macellan: Prince Marth. Please, hold on.
Marth: Macellan! Did you come here with Dolph?
Macellan: Correct. Dolph and I are going to be your reinforcements. Archanea has nothing left for me. For the justice that I believe in, allow me to fight by your side again, Prince Marth.

Soldier: Lord Willow, permission to open the door and attack?
Willow: Wait. Don't be so hasty. Inform me as soon as any of the chests in the treasury are opened. We will sortie the moment that happens. Both the thieves and the Alteans will want their greasy hands on the loot. While they're busy trying to unload the chests, we will take that chance and attack. Heh heh... This is a battle of intellect, not brawn. Don't forget! Attack when the chests are sprung!

Willow: What's that? The chests have been sprung? Now! Open the door! Heh heh heh! Their panicked faces will be glorious!

Jeorge: Astram, how are you doing?
Astram: So it's the traitor, Jeorge. What do you want with me?
Jeorge: Wait, Astram. General Eibel has already fallen. You won't be able to win even if you continue fighting.
Astram: You want me to surrender...? Never! Even if I am the last one standing. I am a warrior of Archanea to the end!!
Jeorge: Why are you... Who are you fighting for? Are you fighting for Emperor Hardin?
Astram: No! It's not because of that man, but because of Nyna... And for Archanea!!
Jeorge: But, did Nyna tell you to fight here? Do you really think that Nyna would hope for this kind of battle?
Astram: Well... I hadn't seen Nyna for a while. I was told that she fell ill, and that I couldn't see her. But... Since Hardin is Emperor of Archanea, I have no choice. If I don't follow his orders I will become a traitor, and I will be betraying Nyna.
Jeorge: Astram, Nyna already entrusted the Emblem to Prince Marth. Do you understand the meaning of her actions?
Astram: Wh-what!! When did this happen, Jeorge? Nyna requested Prince Marth for help?
Jeorge: I believe that is the only explanation. Astram, if you want to find out the truth then come with us... If you die here, what will Midia do? You must live on, for her. You must live on, so you can confirm with your eyes what is happening.
Astram: Hmm... I guess I have no choice. But, Jeorge. If this war is as Hardin said, and was caused by Prince Marth's ambitions. I will never forgive you! Remember that!!

Gotoh: Prince Marth... Can you hear me? I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but it would seem that Princess Elice has been kidnapped by Gharnef.
Marth: Lord Gotoh... Do you speak truly?!
Gotoh: I have found out that Gharnef commanded his priests to search for clerics of noble birth. It is most likely that Lena and your sister were spirited away by Gharnef.
Marth: It can't be! What does he intend to do with them!?
Gotoh: That, I do not know. But something foul is on the cards. There can be no doubt of Gharnef's involvement in this series of unfortunate events.
Marth: Lord Gotoh! Where is Gharnef now?
Gotoh: I believe Princess Nyna is his next target. He is probably... at Archanea's palace.
Marth: I understand. Then I too shall go to Archanea. I still have to free Hardin from the Darksphere's influence. I will defeat the Dark Pontifex Gharnef, and rescue my sister--no, I'll save all of them!
