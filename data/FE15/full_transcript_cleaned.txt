the sages hamlet yes ive heard of it its said to be hidden away at the heart of the lost treescape past the fortress built at the woods edge by jedah of the duma faithful one of his men guards the path there— a loathsome creature called dolth
the sage halcyon was once a high priest of duma himself but he was driven out by jedah jedah was always jealous of the loyal followers who flocked to halcyon so he worked diligently to seal him away from the outside world
oh ive really gone and done it now  here i am entrusted with the silver platter and i drop it in the waterway that platter is one of milas most cherished artifacts i cant go back without it—shell be furious she might even smite me but how do i begin to 
oh what a relief i was sure there was some major smiting on the way  here this is for your troubles please accept it i insist
if you do happen to see the silver platter please let me know
thats milas silver platter the one i dropped in the waterway please that platter is a ritual artifact much beloved by the earth mother may i please have it back i beg it of you
no you must reconsider
milas silver platter lies at the waters bottom oh what to do what to do 
i made the pilgrimage here in search of medicine to treat my ailing daughter but with the temple in this state it seems my long trip was in vain ive waited days for an audience with mila but still havent been granted one all i need is a medicinal syrup made of mana herbs if i had that i could likely cure my daughter the theraputic way and if mila wont intercede finding that syrup may be my only hope
when i think of my daughter writhing in pain while i waste time here  i must find some way to get the medicinal syrup i must
is this a medicinal syrup and one made from mana herbs oh thank you thank you my daughter will live oh i cant begin to express my relief  please let me repay you this is all i have but you must take it
no i understand it must be more valuable than a mere childs life 
ah celica im glad to see you safe child
nomah what in the world are you doing here
not to put too fine a point on it but i was worried about you i followed you as far as this temple but this place is just so large im embarrassed to say i got a bit lost little one heh heh heh
oh dear well im glad to see you in good spirits nonetheless
perhaps wed both enjoy more peace of mind if we stayed together might i travel with you from here on
i see well i would hate to be the cause of worry little one i thought i had some action left in me still but you know best
ah hello again decided you couldnt quite rest easy without me at your side eh
this place gives me chills  small wonder its got a charming name like dead mans mire
i can handle dead men its this humidity thats killin me lets clear a path and get going already
no arguments here
anthiese 
huh
what is it lass
i thought i heard someone calling my name 
you sure i didnt hear anything
perhaps this place is simply preying on my imagination
heh heh heh  yessss come to me im gonna lay you to sleep at the bottom of this beautiful swamp
no i was meant for so much 
curse these bones  i cant stand fightin with mud squishin in my boots we need to get out of this place yesterday whaddya say lass
yes lets 
anthiese  this way  come to me  if you wish to save mila and the boy 
gasp what just who are you
celica where the hell are you going
keh heh heh  welcome anthiese crown princess of zofia bearer of the brand and one marked by fate
who are you
my name is jedah first disciple to the great and glorious duma
you  youre the one holding mila
oh indeed i am however if you wish for her release i propose a bargain
what kind of bargain
mila is well and good but what i truly desire is you if you will offer up your soul to lord duma i will cede mila she will be free to return to zofia
what kind of a bargain is that why is my soul of any value to you
have you never thought it strange princess anthiese rigel and zofia are twin nations founded on the backs of divine dragons and yet dire changes currently befall them both duma seeks power vast enough to destroy all balance in the world meanwhile milas intemperate bounty drives the zofians to depravity
mila provides for her children
her soul as dumas is host to the madness shared by all dragonkind duma will grow stronger till that power brings his ruin—and rigels alongside it it is no different from how zofia now rots in milas absence
her absence by your hand and what is this madness you speak of do you truly claim that mila and duma are fated to destroy themselves
i do which is exactly why your soul is required it is rare and precious—born of zofian royal blood and marked by the brand such a soul could set dumas path to rights and ensure his survival and with mila restored to her place both our peoples might be saved as for the boy alm—if you do this he could lay down his arms
gasp
well what say you i think it is a most generous offer myself 
 perhaps youre right in fact it may be too generous how can i possibly believe a thing that youve told me
i have spoken only truth princess but you neednt give your answer now i will await your reply atop duma tower keh heh heh 
  
there you are
oh saber 
the hell happened back there it aint like you to just charge off
im sorry  im so sorry
hmm whats going on lass you look pale
 nothing come we need to hurry
celica 
whats this another graveyard  of course it is
ugh seriously how are you not used to this by now if youve seen one ghoul ridden deathscape youve seen em all
i suppose you have something of a point fine lets press on
actually looks like this place is full of necrodragons so thats new
eeeyaaaaugh
heh heh heh welcome child of fate once your soul is offered up to lord duma our aims will be realized surely there is no call for needless struggle this way your highness 
i 
guess what pal i dont care what kind of whacko nonsense youre spouting— i wont let you lay a finger on celica
hmph the buzzing of ignorant flies is so very vexing perhaps the jaws of my necrodragons will silence your interruptions
such stubborn children  it appears a lesson in pain is in order
impossible 
wait  anthiese
hes still alive
how long will you place the lives of your friends at risk your highness youre more clever than that
thats not 
come to dumas side
whats wrong with you lass run
dont be a crazy person celica you cant let him take you
silence
aaah
stop leave them alone please ill do whatever you ask
milady no
youve made a wise decision your highness now come anthiese 
dont go celica you cant  celica
gwaaagh
what 
  
you
  
aaah
hey what do you think youre doing
would you so easily cast your life aside
i  thats not— my choices are not your matter sir
not my matter
you have aided me more than once and i am grateful for it but who are you to presume to know better how i might spend my life what could you possibly know about me
celica  whats going on its not like you to act out like this 
nothing is going on mae please just leave me alone none of you can possibly know what im feeling
celica thats not fair
thats not true celica i know  as only a brother can
 what
its been a long time huh sis
you  but thats  conrad i dont know how but  is it really you i was certain you were dead
i managed to escape the night they burned the villa some of the attendants led me to safety from there i fled straight to rigel my mothers home desaixs reach is long but even he couldnt follow me into the empire
i should hate you for letting me mourn all this time and yet im so happy  but how did you come to possess my circlet
it was entrusted to me i had orders to pass it on to you once you grew into your role
entrusted by who
sorry but i swore an oath never to reveal that information once i received it however i learned youd left the island i was so worried about you i decided to follow and make sure you were safe i never wanted to lie to you but  well you werent the only one in hiding
heh so thats why you wore the mask
well it is rather dashing isnt it
hah you think that thing is—
mae hes celicas older brother you know royalty
oh right sorry but man he sure is a lot less moody once that mask comes off huh hes like a completely different guy
almost as if he pretends to be someone else while in disguise  imagine that
oh yeah  hee hee yeah that was dumb
i actually hadnt intended to reveal myself at all halcyon—who looked after me at the sages hamlet—made me swear not to ill have to work on my apology before i go back there  hes right though the most dangerous thing i could be is not dead but after watching you  i couldnt listen to you speak as if you were all alone in the world it drove a knife right through my heart
conrad  im so sorry
please dont apologize i understand i watched you come this far after all i saw you bear the weight of the world by yourself as zofias crown princess but from this point on id like to share that burden with you ill be at your side and protect you with my life but you have to promise me something first  dont ever try to throw your life away like that again
youre right im sorry conrad 
this marks the entrance to the lost treescape the sages hamlet—where halcyon lives—lies within
ive heard it said a curious power is at work in these woods and that the trees themselves conspire to hide the path to the hamlet im grateful we have you to lead the way so then brother—which way do we head first
er yeah  see this was actually my first time leaving the woods alone and im not exactly sure how to  you know get back but hey adventure well just find the path together
y yes adventure  shall we get started then
this wood is thick and dark and plays havoc with ones sense of direction the tall stone pillars stand as sentinels keeping watch over our intrusion
er sage halcyon sir im—
ah celica child of fate im glad youve come
child of fate  youre not the first to call me that but i have no idea where my fate lies please halcyon grant me guidance tell me what fate holds for me im so lost  i dont know what to do
i know you have suffered much along the path here celica but i fear i ken no more of anyones fate than you do what i do ken however is this two things exist to guide you one is the brand you bear the other is your souls pair with the selfsame mark
the selfsame  do you mean alm
indeed why were you born with the brand and why are there two of you these are the questions you must consider and always remember that you are not alone
 right thank you sage halcyon
of course child but while i cannot read the future my magic may yet assist you if there is anything you wish for tell me
i i wish nothing for myself but i am worried for alm please if such a thing is possible use your powers to help him
the other child of fate yours is a generous heart very well 
ah what just happened
i sent my powers on to alm with them he will be able to draw on new strength beyond himself he need only will for it
oh thank you halcyon
tell me celica do you wish to see alm
what well of course i do but  i doubt alm is eager to see me i said terrible things to him when we last parted
heh heh the fire of youth at work all the more reason to meet and speak again no i can send you to him if you desire it not your physical form but a projection of your mind enough to speak at least
is that really possible
it is close your eyes child   
alm 
hmm i heard my name 
alm its me its celica
celica how are you here actually where are you come out already
alm i cant believe i actually have this chance 
celica is this just an illusion is it really you
yes its me sage halcyons magic is allowing me to speak with you oh ive missed you so much
im happy to see you too
alm listen i  sob i 
whoa whats wrong  celica did something happen are things not going as well as youd hoped augh i wish you were here in person i dont know what to  please dont cry
y youre not angry i said such terrible things to you back at the castle
huh wait thats been bothering you i mean sure i was sad you didnt seem to see my side of things but id never get mad at you
why not
 why not you sure do like putting me on the spot didnt we have a similar conversation years ago
ha sniff i suppose we did you were always so nice to me while i— while im always thinking only of myself im sorry alm 
celica whats wrong
ive finally remembered why i left the island in the first place im going to see duma
what no celica the duma faithful are— its too dangerous theres no telling what theyll do to you
even so i have to go mila wasnt in her temple alm
huh what does that mean
emperor rudolf attacked shes being held captive in duma tower that must be the reason why zofias land has gone barren
no  the emperor
and thats why i must go— i have to free mila im the only one who can
wait celica  i finally figured it out but  youre actually  youre the princess of zofia arent you princess anthiese
 i am heh i guess my secrets out
ugh now im cringing at what i said to you before talk about thoughtless forgive me celica but dont worry—i promise ill get your kingdom back so please promise me in turn that you wont—
its kind of you alm but i have to just winning this war isnt enough
what i dont understand
itll be clear to you soon ill do everything i can here please just be safe
celica wait celica celica
duma tower is just ahead be well prepared before you go
this place is called the sages hamlet the great sage halcyons magic shields us from evil if you wish to speak with him youll find him at his home
halcyon was once a priest of the duma faithful there he struggled against jedah who sought to rule by force and terror but in the end he was driven out  this place has been his hermitage ever since
this whole area has been tainted the legacy of dolth and garcias wicked experiments i had always thought emperor rudolf a wise man but only a fool would suffer the abuses of the duma faithful to grow so bold if im honest im cheering for zofias deliverance in all this
do you all really mean to fight jedah i urge you to reconsider hes a terrifying man if you must fight him theres only one way four  eight  twelve  nraagh i it hurts  j jedahs curse 
conrads mother was of rigelian noble birth she was forced to wed the king of zofia in order to procure food for rigel  can you imagine such a fate my blood boils to even think of it
ive spent my life here brewing nectar drink of the gods duma and mila both have partaken of my humble creations know you how nectar is made  no then let me enlighten you steep one gargoyle ear in medicinal syrup to form the base pour in bonewalker oil and mix well then allow it to ferment while agitating season the result with duma moss and the work is done voila nectar a libation fit to make the grandest gods salivate youre drooling over the prospect as well no doubt bring me the ingredients and i might be convinced to make you a batch thats medicinal syrup duma moss a gargoyle ear and bonewalker oil
medicinal syrup duma moss a gargoyle ear and bonewalker oil  excellent youve all the ingredients required to make nectar however the fermentation process takes three days return to me then but do return for a taste of heaven itself awaits you
you dont desire a taste of nectar  how odd are you sure you are well
you havent the ingredients i need medicinal syrup bonewalker oil a gargoyle ear and duma moss if you wish to taste nectar you must procure those items
i need medicinal syrup bonewalker oil a gargoyle ear and duma moss if you wish to taste nectar you must procure those items
ah there you are ive been waiting youre dying from anticipation no doubt but here your nectar awaits
if you ever desire another taste return once more with the ingredients
ive been poring over these resources in my studies to create new medicines one book tells of a foreign lands theory of food as medicine it prescribes liver for those with ailing livers brains for headaches and so on i found the idea most fascinating consider the gargoyle—it hears the faintest sound of its prey then strikes imagine what a medicine brewed from its ears could do for a person which brings me to a request  could i impose upon you to procure three gargoyle ears please my research needs you
have you managed to find three gargoyle ears
what splendid specimens please take this for your time
ill begin work on formulating that new medicine immediately things are about to get busy around here
but what use could you have for  mmm perhaps i dont want to know
you persist in your ignorance of dumas teachings at your own peril
dumas blessings be upon us 
  
something wrong the closer we get to duma tower the quieter you become
what no i dont  er do i i suppose im just getting a bit nervous as we draw near
and thats really it youre not hiding anything
conrad youre worrying over nothing
well all right if you say so
  
keh heh heh im so pleased youve come anthiese
enough talk jedah ive come to judge the truth of your claims i will meet with mila first any decision i reach will come after
as you will but my bargain was with you alone the rest will die for trespassing upon this holy place
what but my life is the only one you need
this is true but ive no fondness for interruptions and theyve proven the meddling sort i trust you will forgive me for being cautious
gods hes completely mad  everyone be careful
ive no use for any of you save anthiese now begone
keh heh heh  your struggling is most precious but ill not end your meager little lives quite yet anthiese you will ascend duma tower and join me at its pinnacle  unless you wish to lose your precious alm that is
jedah
well if it isnt sonya
youve no idea how long ive waited for this day you stole the lives of my sisters and cursed them to become witches i will avenge them with your blood
their souls were offered to duma freely and both received endless bliss in turn only a fool would refuse to see a truth so plain you are a burden to your wise sisters and i shall relieve them of it now
im so sorry i never thought it would play out that way
youre sorry what in the name of hell just happened here you know that dog jedah and whats this “bargain” he was talking about
i  i cant say i know thats not what you want to hear but—
just stop youve been full of secrets from the start and i knew you had your reasons but i thought youd at least give me a little bit of trust at this point
i do trust you saber i trust all of you with my very life but this is something different
dammit lass thats—
im sorry saber but right now we have to get to duma tower mila is there and its imperative that i speak with her once i do that i swear ill tell you everything until then i have to ask that you place your trust in me one more time
 ah hell you know i trust you but you better start talking as soon as youre done with mila—got it
i will i promise
the tower is massive  oppressive like dumas power given form what lies beyond the quest for ever greater power perhaps that answer lies at the towers peak
impressive i did not expect all of you to make it here
enough talk i will see mila now where is she
keh heh heh  such impatience is unseemly your highness and at any rate im afraid mila isnt here shes underground—on lord dumas altar
i dont understand
i can grant you sight if you so desire gaze now upon your precious earth mother
oh no what have you done
sh shes been turned to stone
look there piercing her brow is that falchion
you have a keen eye boy it is indeed the divine blade you will likely doubt me when i say this but that was milas doing the moment emperor rudolf sealed her power mila sealed away falchion do not ask me her motive in this for i understand it not but no force in this world now remains which can harm lord duma shes left her children to their fates kyaaaaaa ha ha ha ha
no  this isnt possible
mila i dont understand why would you do this have you truly forsaken us
heh heh heh your lamentations are wasted child if you truly wish for her release you know what must be done you must offer up your soul to lord duma
did he just say what i think he said
offer her soul oh gods celica no he wants to turn you into a witch that is a really bad idea
sigh theres no other choice without the divine dragons power all of valentias people are lost and the only thing that can save the dragons is the soul of a brand bearer
so  thats what you couldnt tell us
sadly sigh
anthiese you made me a promise remember you promised not to throw your life away again
im sorry conrad im sorry everyone please forgive me  i cant tell you how much it means to me that weve come so far together
anthiese
you lot are no longer necessary begone to wherever you will
huh
screams
no
calm yourself your highness ive merely sent them below as for your preparations i fear they will take some time yet you can while away the hours here watching the boy suffer
alm no
/***EOF***/
  
a word alm
clive did we receive a reply to our petition
unfortunately no the empires silence is likely its answer i believe it wise to resign ourselves emperor rudolf has no intention of treating for peace he means to continue his march on zofian soil
damn 
our men are approaching their limit and rigels climate is far colder than what they knew in zofia further delaying here will only sap their strength and morale
all right clive i trust your judgment lets get ready to march
understood ill pass word to the others and prepare them to cross into the empire
   whats all of this leading to
hey alm i heard the news—guess the times finally come eh
yeah were headed into rigel well need to be more careful than ever past this point
hey careful is my middle name  no really i had it legally changed  not even a chuckle really come on whats with the glowering weve got this hell ive got this were not the same scraggly runts we were when we left ram you know ill forge a new legend in battle heh clairll probably throw herself at me if tobin comes crying about suddenly wanting to leave dont get mad okay
heh heh that would be a problem i need tobin right where he is thanks gray for everything im counting on you
course still i dont see why the wind heres gotta be so damned cold
is it really that bad
youre not freezing your tenders off im impressed
its not that it doesnt feel cold its more like i know this feeling like the air heres familiar
never mind come on lets go
this sluice gate was built roughly one hundred years ago one marvels at our ancestors for crafting something so complex sadly none have operated the sluice in so long that the machinery is rusting id like to do fix the problem before the entire works become unusable but alas ive run out of the special oil i need to perform the maintenance do you think you could help
perhaps youve seen terrors called bonewalkers those with heads aflame the reason their heads burn is because of a special oil stored in their skulls that same oil works wonders on machinery takes the rust right out once youve gone bonewalker oil theres no going back  heh so if its not a hassle could you hunt some bonewalkers and gather their oil
have you obtained the bonewalker oil
ah this is bonewalker oil all right i can use this to polish the sluice parts until they sparkle thanks for going through the trouble heres a little reward
as you can see the sluice machinery is massive you can never have too much bonewalker oil around here drop by whenever you acquire some
wait you want the oil for yourself but its useless terrible for the skin
hey do you like cute things ‘cause i love cute things
mamma mila thats adorable are you sure i can have it thanks soooo much oh and you can have this cause youre nice
eeeew gross i dont want that
that is not even slightly cute puh lease
dont try to fool me just cause im an adorable little girl
thats not quite what i had in mind
you havent shown me even one iota of cute yet why did i even ask siiiiiigh
alm were ready to march according to our intelligence rigels forces await in the forest ahead general berkut is commanding them personally
berkut  i guess theyre serious about holding the border
indeed yet weve no choice but to cross it
 right
you kept me waiting alm i was starting to wonder if youd actually come
berkut
thats quite the little army youve assembled im almost impressed for a ragtag group of gathered scraps the deliverance actually looks the part
  
still it seems youve all let a few meager successes go to your heads who are you to dare threaten rigels borders lowborn fool do you truly fancy yourself the next king of zofia you must learn your place
youve got it all wrong berkut
clive
ive been at alms side from the outset watching all that he has done hes a brave warrior and a good man worthy of the crown hes made such clear to me time and again the right of kings is not decided by blood or station it lies in what a man believes what keeps him up at night it lies in a mans actions
enough already you would throw away your pride as a zofian noble and bow to a commoner i see now that the clive i once knew is well and truly dead now it falls on me to bury him
were all ready sir
understood
what is it sir
sorry im ready
warriors its time time to defeat emperor rudolf and bring this bloody war to an end now then—who will defend zofia
we will defend her
then charge
my lord
follow me these worms have no right to crawl onto our soil
only death awaits those who would profane rigels soil consider it a mercy your bones will rest here in sight of your homeland
nrgh  no  am i to lose again again
your existence is a black mark on the honor of zofia it ends today
gyaugh how how can i lose to such rabble 
nnngh  damn you
youre plenty strong berkut no one would deny that but thats why i must end this here
i cant believe its come to this 
whats—
nnnh  waaaaaugh wh whats happening alm
tobin everyone are you all right
screaming h help me please
by the gods  are those hands sprouting from the earth is this some kind of magic
no at least not as we know it our own magic doesnt seem to have any effect this is something else entirely  waugh
lukas ive got to do something before   berkut what have you done
so this is dumas power its its hideous 
you did this
youve no need to know any more youll die here with the rest
berkut wait wait  rragh i wont let it end here not before i see you again celica
 huh
whoa what was that light
celicas charm then maybe  celica can you hear me please im begging you help me help us all
what impossible dumas spell is broken how did you do this
i dont know i just said a prayer to someone i love
bah spare me your treacly platitudes i was meant for greatness but you youre just a just a 
lord berkut the spell is broken but they havent the strength to give chase you must use this time to escape
you would have me retreat in the face of these dogs
i would ask that you live his excellency the emperor will understand now go quickly
rragh
did that power truly come from duma there is no pride in resorting to such unholy means what is it the empire—no the duma faithful—are trying to accomplish
theyre gone alm should we go after them
no pursuing them in our current condition is only asking for further losses
well what you did just now was pretty incredible but uh  what did you do exactly
honestly tobin i panicked i said a frantic prayer to the charm celica gave me and then  it must have been her she saved us
huh  guess i owe somebody a big thank you next time we bump into her
yeah tobin i think we all do
damn him why why cant i beat him to be humiliated so by a commoner and twice no less
my lord please you must try to calm down you are safe thats all i need to be—
silence woman what could you possibly know
gasp berkut 
from childhood all thats ever been asked of me is strength it is my duty as one born to stand above others to rule ive been taught that all my life by my father my mother how am i to remain calm in the face of defeat at the hands of peasants i even debased myself by making use of that deviants powers and its still not enough
call to me 
hngh
you who thirst for power  call to me 
who is  identify yourself
berkut whats the matter youre frightening me 
you dont hear it what was that voice 
where do these woods lead exactly
to fear mountain home to nuibaba of the duma faithful most would cross the rigel plains to the west to reach the imperial palace so theres no need to take this route should we wish for safer passage 
i propose that we advance regardless
why is that lukas
ive heard grim reports of this arcanist nuibaba shes of a kind with general jerome who controls the rigel plains theyre tyrants both and their subjects suffer terribly under their yoke but if a pack of good hearted invaders such as us were to take them out well we might find ourselves with new support among the rigelian masses 
interesting 
granted we run the risk of losing men we cant afford to be without so im not insisting we do this i only offer the suggestion
ill think on it lukas thank you
my name is xaizor and im afraid your path ends here while i bear you no grudge my masters orders are absolute
i can serve you no longer  forgive me emperor rudolf 
so alm have you made up your mind as to where were headed
yes i think so
alm 
huh
what is it alm
this is going to sound crazy but i thought i heard celica
celica the priestess girl from the castle im sorry to say i heard nothing 
alm  i need you alm 
it is her where are you celica
huh whats  alm wait
celica where are you celica
alm  im so glad youve come 
celica what is this  an illusion
yes  alm im being held prisoner in nuibabas abode
what are you hurt
help me alm  i have faith  i know youll come  im waiting for you  ive always been waiting 
wait celica dont go dammit was that really her
eee hee hee  what next child of fate you slipped my grasp at the border but now you run straight to my snare despite the bungling of that useless berkut  tsk no matter all will be mine soon enough ill not let the likes of jedah claim a bearer of the brand the power of such a soul could grant me life eternal eee hee  eeeeee hee hee hee
oh dear such naughty children lashing out at lord duma so youve earned quite the punishment 
another witch listen to me—youre being controlled you have to fight this
im sorry alm you cant help her only death can break dumas hold over those who have offered up their souls
no 
hee hee 
hee  ill sing you a lullaby  its time for all the good little children to go to sleep
oh dear  such stubborn children  you should listen to your 
i can feel an uncomfortably warm breeze pushing back at me attended by a low rumbling the voices of the dead perhaps calling from the land beyond hungry again for life valentia knows no deeper pit than this the guts of fear mountain
a single word from her lips was enough to snuff out life itself why did alm go to this place and what exactly did he hope to find upon that terrible peak
eee hee hee  welcome warriors of the deliverance my doors stand open to receive you
are you nuibaba wheres celica
you poor fool theres no one here by that name i merely used a vision of whomever you held fast in your heart to draw you in
so it was a trap
eeeee hee hee hee oh and how clumsily youve fallen into it the specter of love ever draws fools such as you like butterflies to nectar and yet the real feast is yet to come  when i dine upon your souls
groans get ready everyone
come forth medusa honor the pact youve sworn to me
come close  let me share with you deaths embrace
ahhh  it cannot be  i wont be 
nuibaba gathered young and comely girls from all across rigel she made sacrifices of them—fed them to monsters to preserve her own youth
ooo youve met lord berkut youre so lucky hes amaaaaazing every woman in rigel wishes they could be his sigh alas its an impossible dream now that hes to wed rinea 
are you all right nuibaba has been dealt with in case youre wondering
shes gone you mean it oh thank you ive been searching for my zeke but coming here was clearly a mistake if you dont mind my asking who are you exactly
were the deliverance
then its true  zofia really has invaded s stay back zeke help
um we just got finished saving you you realize that right and we sure didnt come all this way just to start harming innocent rigelians so long as we dont meet on the field of battle youre no enemy of mine
im not sorry my heart was racing a little faster than my brain there but i can see youre a man of his word please forgive me
er its all right i know youve been through a lot and technically we did invade so 
well you still seem more honorable than the troops lording over the village   gasp oh no
huh
to clive are you the leader of this deliverance of course you are you must be just look at you in that case i need your help my lover zeke is in peril
forgive me milady but i fear you stand corrected i am not the leader of the deliverance
but youre so tall and dashing i thought for sure  hmm  to lukas its you isnt it yes it must be witness the focused air about you
heh wrong again i fear alm here commands us
what
uh hey there
ack f forgive me its just that youre so young and  young
dont worry about it tell us more about this “zeke” person
ah yes zeke ezekiel youre on your way to rigel castle right then youre certain to meet zeke on the rigel plains along the way when that happens dont kill him dont you dare his superior officer jerome is a no good rotten lout he and nuibaba have brought immense suffering upon the locals zeke tried to stand up to jerome and his wicked ways but once i was taken captive my love had no choice but to obey if you tell zeke im free however i know hell fight for whats right
all right but this zeke—er ezekiel— is a rigelian solider isnt he if he attacks us well have no choice but to answer in kind

ah zeke its you
tatiana but how
it means you dont have to heed another word jerome says
thank you tatiana now you have saved me as well to his soldiers men set your sights on the target we march on jeromes army prepare to attack
you must be general ezekiel
how do you know my name
tatiana told me about you
you know tatiana as well
we rescued her from nuibaba you should have no further cause to follow jeromes orders
i am reluctant to trust in these times yet how else would you know all this you have my thanks for saving her allow me to show my appreciation in deed as well as word to his soldiers men set your sights on the target we march on jeromes army prepare to attack
you dare i didnt think you fool enough to betray me ezekiel you know what fate awaits the girl now that—
shes free and now so am i youve ground the people here under heel and threatened my love prepare to answer for your crimes
forgive me—it is not my wish to fight with you i pray youll bear me no grudge in turn
forgive me tatiana  ah  then youre  good thats 
you upstarts have brought death upon yourselves
h how is this  i am a blue blood  a general ill not lose to such—
you must be alm let me thank you again for helping tatiana
were happy to help general i heard you were opposed to this war will you lend us your strength not a man among us wishes this conflict to last any longer than it must
   im afraid i cannot offer you an answer here and now theres a village a ways ahead ill await you there until then
ah 
oh look whos here welcome you dont have to feel uncomfortable i dont care what land you hail from you got rid of that rotten jerome and that makes you a hero around here he and nuibaba from up fear mountain have caused us nothing but suffering and who came to our aid not the emperor nor the duma faithful the only one who fought for us was general ezekiel doesnt matter who he was or where hes from—hes a good and noble man
keep walking you dastards youll find no welcome here you killed general ezekiel you you monsters he only sided with those scum because they took his woman hostage in truth he fought this whole time to shield us from jerome and his tyranny
i got no love for zofia but i spose i owe you a worda thanks anyway  eh why do i hate zofia ‘cause i pour mblood and sweat into workin this here barren land is why you zofians have milas blessin or bounty or whatever blasted thing it is you eat yer fill without workin a day lifes just one big party for you lot  makes me sick it does pah
 hmph what are you lot doin here emperor rudolfs a good man a hero not that you lazy pigs over in zofiad know anything about it
are you all headed to rigel castle i see i see  perhaps thats best for his excellency as well but the mountain ahead is cursed with a blight of fell beasts necrodragons spawn there without end or so the travelers say even if youve the luck to elude them eruptions often bury the path in stone
hrmph  so you beat jerome a petty tyrant who cares for such deeds youll still never cross mount dragonsblight your proud little band will march right down a necrodragons gullet
ezekiel says he has no memory of his past tatiana found him washed up ashore one day badly wounded she was nursing him back to health when  well youve seen his face wasnt a fortnight before she was in love dont suppose i can blame her
i always loved ezekiel i did though i never had the courage to tell him  fie on you all i hope you rot in the belly of a necrodragon
have you ever seen a dracoshield before they soften physical blows mitigate magic and can even heal you it just so happens my family has forged these shields for generations my grandfather even presented one to the emperor himself you cant make them without dragon scales though no sir you need no less than four dragon scales to make a proper dracoshield if you happen to find four and want to try the shield of shields come see me ill make you the finest dracoshield you ever did see
great galloping gargoyles you found enough dragon scales sounds like someone wants me to make a dracoshield right here and now well bad news—super ultimate dracoshields dont just happen you can come pick yours up at a later date
 huh you dont want a dracoshield whats wrong with you
sorry but it looks like you failed to scale you havent got enough i need four dragon scales come back when youve got em
sorry but your dracoshield isnt ready yet dont be pushy now come back another day and well see if ive finished it
a ha there you are ive got your brand new dracoshield right here ready  ta daaah
if you manage to scrounge up four dragon scales bring em here ill make you the finest dracoshield you ever did see
are you familiar with a delicacy called ambrosia its valuable stuff some even go so far as to call it the food of the gods some say sages hamlet in rigel is the only place its made but ive studied the subject for years now and i can say beyond a doubt  that ive discovered the secret recipe for ambrosia and can make it right now  mmmm how about that is your stomach growling yet im just missing a few ingredients yogurt duma moss and an orange bring me those three things and i will whip up some legendary ambrosia
ah youve brought what i need now watch as i cook up some food fit for the gods themselves
really are you sure this stuff is the food of the gods i tell you well its your choice i suppose dont come crying to me later
alas it seems you dont have all of the ingredients yet i need yogurt duma moss and an orange got it
i only need three ingredients yogurt duma moss and an orange bring me those three things and i will whip up some legendary ambrosia
we meet again alm
general ezekiel have you given any more consideration to what we spoke of before
   now that i have turned my lance on jerome rigel will not have me but neither can i offer that lance to you i still have no recolection of who i am or from whence i came
youve lost your memory
i have all i know is that i washed up on the shores of rigel grievously wounded i was thrown in prison and accused of being a spy or worse but emperor rudolf saved me he gave me a name and took me in he raised me as a father would his own son and yes i may have betrayed him  but never would i help you do him harm
i didnt know im sorry forgive me for asking so much of you
you are not in the wrong gasp alm by the gods
wh whats wrong
where did you get that mark on your left hand
what this i dont know actually ive just always had it
is that so some time ago emperor rudolf gave me what i thought was odd advice he said that if i met a man with a mark on his left hand i was to follow him for that man is chosen he said he shall save all of rigel and with it all of valentia
thats very strange
i agree but now that i have met you i must heed my emperors words i am yours to command my lord
i see i would do as my emperor commanded but if you are not of the same mind 
allow me to join my strength with yours the emperor wished for this
  
whats wrong alm you get some bad pottage in the mess tent again
hmm oh  i was just wondering what this mark on my left hand really means
no surprise what with zekes speech about saving valentia and all he shall save all of rigel and with it all of valentia heh no pressure there
no kidding 
wait you dont actually believe what he said do you
what no no i dont harbor any delusions of grandeur but its true that were fighting to save zofia at the very least so i got to wondering if that wasnt part of helping all valentia
huh yeah i guess that makes sense  in a messed up kind of way celica has one of those too right that mark
she  yes she does
so maybe you guys are destined to save the world together or whatever i mean it has to be fate or something that the you two of you met right
fate i dont know about that gray its a coincidence for sure but 
kidding i was kidding  sheesh man youre really starting to worry me here if you dont laugh it off it makes me sound like a lunatic for saying it
heh sorry youre right im not sure about the rest of it but me and celica meeting really could be fate  id like to believe it is at any rate
heavens what is that infernal noise
it sounds like  earthquake everyone take cover
i dont believe it  that last quake cleared out some of the rocks—the roads passable again
goodness what a stroke of serendipity come now alm lets hurry across before the next tremor hits
right 
hmm is something the matter
it feels strange is all a little too convenient its almost like i can feel someones intent behind it
an intentional rockslide really alm you worry too much now chop chop one mustnt dawdle ill await you on the far side
   i dont like this at all i hope youre all right celica 
why do you refuse dumas truth it is incomprehensible 
why  ive done nothing wrong 
honor demands i allow you to pass no further
i am bested you fight well 
what a strange place this is a secret shrine closed off and hidden away from the eyes of man what a strange place this is a secret shrine closed off and hidden away from the eyes of man why was it made and to what end
this fortress is the last thing standing between us and rigel castle good news for us but to them its their last line of defense and men always fight hardest when their backs are to the wall lets take every precaution we can
right we only get one chance well make it count
bwa ha ha ha ha marvelous welcome ladies and gentlemen of the deliverance
slayde
indeed and i am dearly glad to see you again boy you really are full of surprises to think a mere farmboy like you would become leader of the deliverance or that you would now stand poised to claim the rigelian empire as well its the stuff of legends this is simply astonishing
why are you here last i checked you served desaix
true but that was in a former life when i was still a knight of zofia
what
you lot ran me out of the castle thanks to that clod desaixs incompetence so i defected to rigel turncoat or no they paid good coin for a nobles intelligence on the enemy they were so grateful in fact they appointed me to captain this fortress
you lack even a modicum of shame slayde how dare you call yourself a noble after trading away your pride
pride ha pride has never filled a mans belly or warmed him in the snow and while were speaking clive let me tell you this ive always despised you you and your pathetic platitudes pride this  honor that  only a naif believes that righteousness will keep a man drawing breath
which of us is truly naive slayde youre focused on naught but survival yet survival to what end with no core belief to steel your spine you turn tail at every shadow men broken by lifes unfairness who cast all principle aside will never triumph you slayde will never know victory we will not lose to the likes of you
clive 
nrgh  silence  silence this is merely the desperate barking of a cur faced down by a lion well dont stand there attack paint the halls red with zofian blood silence their lies even if it means cutting the tongues from their mouths
impudent whelps  youll regret this
nrgh damn you  damn youuu
i cannot allow you any closer to his excellency the emperor prepare yourself
your excellency  forgive me 
 then the fortress has fallen
it has your excellency i fear its a matter of minutes until the deliverance reaches the castle doors
very well we shall greet them with a sea of blades i leave the rest to you massena
as your will commands your excellency
now go
your excellency wait
berkut
sire why have you not given me leave to join the front lines i know i failed you at the border but all the more reason i beg for this chance
a merciful leader may grant a second chance only a fool allows a third
your excellency
my army has no place for the weak youll remain here and watch in quiet
no  please have mercy sire your excellency uncle
brave warriors of rigel you have fought with courage and skill at my side these long years but the hour of reckoning is upon us our empires light is guttering now heed my words well if i should fall my final order is that you lay down your arms and surrender i hear the young zofian general is a man of mercy if you have any love and loyalty for me youll not waste your lives this day
  
thats emperor rudolf  this is strange  im not sure what im feeling at the moment hes caused so much suffering and i know i should hate him but i cant instead he just feels  i dont know familiar somehow
alm snap out of it will ya this is no time for daydreaming were at rigel castles doorstep buddy we need you focused now pull yourself together already we didnt ce this far to lose here
a ah right sorry gray all right everyone lets do this
come  strike me
whats going on why wont you attack what are you planning rudolf
  
youve done well  im proud of you my son
 what
i knew i was right to entrust you to my dearest friend
your friend  you mean mycen whats going on here what are you saying
id thought youd have realized by now your true name  your true name is albein alm rudolf you are my one and only son
i  what that cant be true  youre lying why should i believe a word you say
nnngh  be still alm i havent time left  to explain but i beg you to grant me one  final favor
you want a favor from me
take the divine falchion that  sealed milas strength  duma has become a thing of mindless evil use the blade  destroy him  please my son  you must—
no wait emperor rudolf were you truly my father then ive just    oh gods what have i done aah  aaaaaaaugh
stop please no more alm how has it come to this
the boy will come to slay lord duma erelong a fools erand i fear without falchion
alm is coming here please you mustnt hurt him my soul alone is all you need yes
oh then you will offer up your soul to lord duma willingly
i will if it saves alm i will surrender my soul gladly
laughs as you wish your highness now come with me
l long live his excellency rudolf ii
 welcome home prince albein
i was present when emperor rudolf marched on the temple of mila i know the blade he used to seal her power away—the divine falchion— had long been housed in the treasure vaults beneath duma tower though i fear i do not know what became of it after 
welcome home prince albein i am massena captain of emperor rudolfs imperial guard his excellency told me everything before facing you in battle afterward i gathered the remnants of his forces and awaited your arrival
he told you everything are you telling me he knew he was going to lose that he expected to die by his own sons hand
 i am afraid i cannot speak to his excellencys intentions i humbly ask that you visit the throne and listen to what sir mycen has to say
mycen is here
please my prince visit the throne and hear what sir mycen has to say
so youve come alm
grandfather  what the hell is going on what are you doing here rudolf said i was his son and now all these people are calling me a prince
its only natural that youre feeling confused but there is no denying fact—you are the only son of emperor rudolf scion of the rigelian imperial bloodline and true heir to rigels throne
 how could you you knew all this time and yet you kept it from me  you knew and you still sent me off to kill my own father
please remain calm alm sigh let me explain  best i start at the very beginning as you well know valentia has always been divided north from south— split between the two gods mila and duma but their involvement with mankind eventually grew too deep when madness takes a god man is lost and where gods meet ruin men die too that is the plight valentia now faces
youre saying the gods are dying
i fear so rudolf was among the first to understand the signs he saw dumas growing madness and knew it for a harbinger of ruin but then you were born alm
what does that have to do with any of this
you bore the brand—sign of the hero who would rise to save valentia hearing that prophecy rudolf knew you must be kept hidden from the faithful he concealed the news of your birth and entrusted you to me in zofia i will never forget the pain on his face when he placed you in my arms 
  
that day marked a change in him he donned the mantle of one who would destroy the old world order— one whod free men to live by their own power even if they hated him for it he knew such heresy would bring forth those who wished for his death so for that death to come at the hand of his beloved son was a mercy he told me himself that he could imagine no more peaceful end
and what of my peace
this is not the time for mourning or self pity boy rudolfs purpose now falls to you the true foe you must defeat is duma as well as the zealots tainted by his madness who seek control of valentia jedah and his duma faithful if you do not hurry celicas life will also be in peril
oh gods celica she set out in search of duma in order to save mila
a passage beneath this castle leads to the temple of duma go alm go and finish this return the mad god duma to the darkness  from whence he came
his whole story was a lie alms youth  his days of training with mycen  all were but calculations in a far reaching plot by his lord father emperor rudolf alm had taken his fathers life and that sadness would stay with him always but destiny would not permit this son of the brand to simply walk away valentia lay yet in the grip of duma— the wicked god the war father—as well as alms dear celica who would become dumas willing servant 
/***EOF***/
ah  quiet everyone
heh heh 
that must be garth and his men probably best to avoid them lets go around that way
but celica look

oh good i was hoping wed find you you really saved us back on the coast weve managed to dig up some additional information since then turns out our sister est is being held by a thief named grieth your strength is beyond reproach that much is certain  if youre headed to grieths citadel perhaps youd let us join you

i see my sister is traveling with you thats wonderful i trust its all right if i accompany you as well
i see well ill not doubt your judgment nor your reasons
yes did you need assistance or perhaps youve decided to take me with you
im the head of the fugue family surely youre familiar with the name recently a thief stole into our home and took an heirloom—a shield it bears the family crest and has been handed down for generations its irreplaceable and if not retrieved it will be a black mark on our honor the burglar in question is in grieths employ im certain the fugue shield is languishing in his vault about now the cur will likely sell it to a foreign buyer after which it will be lost forever youve the look of warriors about you impressive to a man might i enlist your help in retrieving the fugue shield from grieth youll be well rewarded of course fugues are known for our generosity
our family shield oh this is a sweet sight indeed in truth id nearly given up hope of seeing it again my sincerest thanks please take your promised reward
with both shield and honor restored i must hurry home to the family estate
is this just a jape to you oh how you twist the blade
by the gods this shield bears the mark of our sworn enemies the rion clan pah the very sight of it disgusts me take it away
pardon me but i serve as chef to one of the noble houses or i did until a tiny mistake provoked the ire of my employer now he says that if i dont prepare the worlds finest fish hell have me killed a man mistakes salt for sugar once and now must pay with his life cruel as you might expect from such a man my employers tastes are quite fine a run of the mill fish wont get me off the hook  er pardon the pun i need to catch a legend i need dagon but thats not something you find in a fishmongers stall down at the market please aid me my life is on the line  er pardon the pun if theres any way you can find a dagon fillet let me know at once
word is theres a master angler here in zofia harbor but he set out to sea a while ago and has yet to return the timing lines up with a bad storm so i fear he may have capsized im told he usually fished the waters around the seabound shrine
word is theres a master angler here in zofia harbor if anyone could reel in a dagon fillet it would be him if hes not out at sea fishing youll likely find him at the tavern
ah yes well i suppose youve your own business to worry about
any chance youve found a dagon fillet
the color  the glow  dagon for true youve actually found it and such a fine cut the perfect dappling of fat exquisite surely this will satisfy even my temperamental employer thank you im afraid this is all i have to give you in return but i insist you take it
please im about to be gutted  and that is not a pun
oy its you from the seabound shrine i owes you a debt i do if ya need anything just go on and ask    eh a dagon fillet mmmm  dagons are fearsome beasties—closer kin to dragons than fish yet for its terrible look the meats said to be sweet as nectar trouble is their visions frightful good they see yer line and steer clear you need a line thats strong as steel but clear as glass track me down somethin like that and ill happily dip mpole for ya come find me again if ya find a line thatll snag a dagon
hoo never thought id see something like this in all mdays this just might make for a line that even a dagon wouldnt see coming ill put out to sea straightaway and see if the fishing gods are kind come find me in a couple of days and pray for fair weather eh heh heh
are you waitin for me tbeg
i needs strong clear material for a line bring me that and i just might be able to hook ya a dagon eh heh heh
well look who it be  howzabout ya feast yer eyes on this landed me a dagon i did and all thanks tyer magic line as promised heres yer cut enjoy that now eh heh heh heh
guess what i went and landed me another dagon eh heh heh heh im in a sharin mood so why not take a cut for yerself
oh great  another graveyard filled with even more terrors 
oh grow a spine already so what if those guys sprout up like weeds its perfect target practice after this little warm up we can storm the temple of mila with spells blazin
why would we want to storm the temple 
that grieth is a real piece of work he gives the orders to every scoundrel and sneak thief in zofia hes attacked this village time and again and taken all the young folk theres not a man who would stand up to him even when the king drew breath
have you been to the dragon shrine north of the village theres a well there whose waters are rumored to revive the dead but alas fearsome necrodragons stand watch there allowing none to pass
to reach the temple of mila cross the valley approach and continue north the temples more than just a place of worship for the goddess you know— it also defends the sluice gate at the kingdoms border however the gate opens only to members of the zofian royal family with his highness lima iv gone the sluice may lie closed forever 
is it true the deliverance has retaken zofia castle i worry if so oh everyone talks of chasing out desaix and the rigelian empire  but soon as they have to decide the next king you know war will come again
i was off fighting on the frontier until a short while ago came home to find my village in ruins and my brothers taken by grieth i want to tear that thiefs head clean off his body  but i cant do it alone are you lot going to grieths stronghold if so let me come and have my revenge
ah i see well you have your reasons im sure apologies for the sudden request ill try my luck alone if thats what it takes
hm changed your mind did you
oy you ever had dried shieldfish its simply grand so it is odd lookin thing shieldfish bign flat and covered in a hard shell looks a bit like a shield—thats why they named it as they did i reckon but if ya dry em in the sun they taste like nothin else i get cravings i do terrible cravings  but i cant find em to save mlife id kill for a bitea shieldfish  well not literally but you get my meanin
shieldfish delicious shieldfish how i yearned for your touch er i mean uh here take this you earned it
cant blame you i wouldnt share mine either heh heh heh
you got no shieldfish aint very nice getting my hopes up like that
sure could go for some dried shieldfish right about now 
please can you help me find my son
after losing my husband to the plague that hit our village i fell apart my son felt he had to help me i tried to stop him but it was no use he left for the dragon shrine in order to find the well of revival they said it can give life to the dead so he seeks to return my husband though i fear im more like to lose a son than reclaim a husband that shrine is a horror of a place i wont let my son die there please find him and bring him back to me i beg of you
did you find my son
this this is my sons journal  oh oh no you sweet stupid boy  how many must you take mila how many more will satisfy you
pardon me the other day you helped me find my my late son at the time i was too overcome to thank you please forgive my rudeness im still working through my grief it will take time im sure but i wouldnt even be able to do that if i didnt know his fate for certain i know im late in this but please let me thank you for finding my son
 eh its too much oh hardly i sold my house and land you see this village is full of memories it hurts too much to be here i aim to wander the world and take a long hard look at my life perhaps well meet again somewhere until then stay safe
what a mess  ive been a woodcutter in this village since i was old enough to hold an axe but when grieths men swept through they stole it  my axe i mean i cant do a lick of work without it and ive got a wife and kids to feed and dont tell me to go buy a new axe because i cant afford it no axe no money no money no axe you get my problem here
wait a sec—youre just giving me this sweet duma this is gonna turn my whole life around youve got yourself a new friend pal take this with my thanks
yeah i suppose thats not the kind of thing you just have lying around
im not much of a woodcutter without an axe—and im broke to boot i need to get my hands on a new axe and soon 
oh hey its my best friend here have a look at this pal i tried my hand at carving a likeness of duma with the axe you brought me figured maybe his blessing would help me chop through the forest yeah and it worked when im holding it i can feel strength surging through my chopping arm the forest best watch out now that ive got this duma carving gya hah hah
oh hey look who it is terrors from the cemetery attacked the village a while back except they didnt attack the village so much as come straight to my door they took the duma carving i made turned around and beat feet i never should have made it duma must be angry i took liberties with his image im terrified his punishment is only just beginning  o duma forgive me
hey thats the duma carving i made get that awful thing away i never want to see it again in my life
you dont look half as scared as you ought dont you value your lives its time you had the fear of death put back into you
no  ill not surrender  not like this 
say boss i got some uh news kinda bad like
 well dont just stand there idiot spit it out
the desert strongholds been taken
whaaaat was it deliverance it was wasnt it those lousy no good dung eatin—
actually it was a girl and her friends some kinda priestess or somethin kind of an odd mix if ya ask me a mercenary couplea kid mages—
kids youre tellin me that wolff lost to a girl and some children who is she i need information all of it gimme the goods
i got nothin boss im sorry all i know is what i told ya kids a priestess yeah  oh and she had a mark on her right hand er so whatta we do now boss our men are sayin shes coming here next shes gonna come here and kill—
shut up for a second did you say she has a mark on her right hand
y yeah boss thats right
well ill be dipped in hog fat  thats the lass desaix was searchin for that mark is proof a member of the zofian royal family is still alive and you say shes headed here now  heh haw bwaaaaa ha ha ha ha looks like lady luck finally decided to let me take her to the barn dance working with desaix was good business for a while but hes finished now but if i serve that girl up to rigel on a silver platter  then even if they take over all of zofia well still be sittin pretty deen sonya
you called
did you need something
were expectin guests some little girl and her merry band of friends deen set up in the northern desert sonya you take the south i want the girl alive as for the rest  well have some fun you earned it  ya got it
you dont need to shout sir theres nothing wrong with my hearing if theres nothing else ill be going
understood im off as well
bah impudent louts still i spose they get the job done and once they do ill have a zofian princess in my collection heh heh  ha ha ha bwaaaa ha ha ha ha ha
whew you really saved the day thanks a million names jesse by the by im just your average garden variety merc so i spotted this girl at the port of zofia real cute ya know anyway then i hear shes about to get sold off as a slave you believe that well i dont let ladies get sold into slavery on my watch no sir so i up and chased after her and wound up getting caught turns out trying to take on a group of slavers single handed is a terrible idea anyway thats my story—whats yours youre all traveling together yeah looks like a real fun group dont suppose you got room for one more
oh yeah well thats a shame i wont take it personal though come on back if you change your mind
hm whats up decide you want to deal me in on the fun after all
im sorry to bother you but it seems my father has gone missing hes a pious man who was going on a pilgrimage to the temple of mila but that was some years ago and ive heard nothing from him since when last i saw him he was wearing his lucky red tricorn hat sadly thats the only clue i have to go on i managed to follow his trail this far but i fear its grown quite cold he couldve been attacked by bandits or done in by terrors or worse but id rather know for sure than lie awake at night with such grim thoughts well theres nothing for it but to return home to my mother er but if you come across a man in a red tricorn hat tell him to hurry home take care
grieth didnt become king of thieves by being a fool hes a shrewd one hes been sending desaix bribes aplenty to escape justice for his deeds and his men are no better the pirate barth was one such in fact i hear there are still captives rotting away in his dungeons some have been there for years poor souls  if theres any way you can help them 
deen and sonya are feared for their strength even among grieths men deen a master of the sword is a flinty loner of a man and sonya is a deadly mage beautiful though if the rumors are true they also say she was rigelian originally 
jesse youre familiar with this area are you not were headed to grieths citadel and the way seems perilous could we ask you to guide us there
grieths citadel er look you seem smart and capable and all but i wouldnt recommend it his payrolls a veritable whos who of zofias nastiest thugs and no matter how tough you are i dont like those odds
but there must be some way
hrrrrmm  maybe ask the deliverance theyre nuts they might be up for it they chased off desaix didnt they  which is actually pretty impressive
the deliverance force marches west to the border to fight the rigelian army
do they now well thats optimistic i guess that means youre out of luck
sigh
aw cmon dont give me that look damsel in distress types slay me just break my heart i mean not that youre a damsel or anything but  hmm  well i suppose there is one thing you might try 
and whats that
deen and sonya two of grieths best theyre a tough lot but its not loyalty that keeps them in grieths service i dont know the specifics but its clear theyve their own ambitions they guard his citadel from the north and south ends of the desert break through one and youll have a clear path to move on grieth whichever you fight the other wont go out of their way to chase you down  er probably
hey hold on 
like i said going up against grieths entire force at once is suicide but knock out deen or sonya and focus on grieth and his men at the citadel well then you might just have yourself a chance
and if youre wrong and they chase us down while swearing bloody revenge
yowza yeah in that case im guessing youre probably dead
the fact youve worked as a mercenary this long staggers the imagination
aw shucks you little flatterer thats sweet of you to say look your ultimate goal is getting to the temple of mila right so this thing with grieth is just a bit of what community service thats admirable but think long and hard before you make the trip
  
nothing personal but i have to kill you i promise to make it fast
rgh  ive too much left undone 
naughty children you ought never have made an enemy of grieth still this is mere business for my part no hard feelings i pray
 it seems today is the day  my star goes out 
grieth boss that girl and her band of idiots are here
grargh what the hell are the rest of the men doing i need em here to fight
um it doesnt look like theyre moving boss
what  dammit so ive been betrayed have i gah fine just fine ill just go out there and crush this stupid girl all by myself
well lookie here—its zofias crown princess aint you just fancy
how  who told you that
well lemme think a second  who could it have been you know what it dont matter fact is i owe you my thanks while you royals were lounging about ignoring your own kingdom i was becoming a very rich man you people turned zofia into a place where only the strong survive hell now its the spitting image of rigel itself doncha think
you may think yourself something fine  but your days as a predator are done
oh yer highness  my kingdom may fall today  but im gonna drag you all to hell with me
you didnt win nothin  theres gonna be another me  theres always another me 
atlas did you manage to find your brothers
yeah theyre safe everyones safe youre our savior mlady from this point on i am yours to command you just say the word now want me to bust the skulls of any of grieths men we mighta missed
n no thats  thank you atlas but i dont think thatll be necessary why dont you go spend some time with your family instead
you sure  well all right ill do whatever you thinks best
i owe you thanks beyond measure for saving me my name is irma and i serve at the temple of mila  or did i suppose in truth this place has been my only home for many a long year i fear greatly what may have transpired at the temple 
so youre an attendant to mila interesting  were actually making our way to the temple right now
is that so then might i ask—  by the mother are you  no you couldnt be 
er im sorry
ah  f forgive me its just that you bear a striking resemblance to lady liprica
liprica thats my mothers name
then its true youre her youre princess anthiese mila be praised youre alive
are you saying you know my mother please you you must tell me anything you can about her i never had a chance to know her you see 
it would be an honor your highness where shall i begin 
like myself lady liprica was a sister in the service of mother mila but all that ended once king limas royal procession arrived at the temple lady lipricas beauty caught his eye and she was stolen away in the night he took her to his castle and forced her to join his seraglio of countless brides despite the luxury i expect life in the castle proved most difficult for her she soon took ill and left this world shortly after bearing your highness
mother 
 i am so very sorry princess anthiese but i would implore you to spare your tears lady liprica thought only of your health and happiness until her final breath  lady liprica also left something for you your highness
for me
aye milady it is a circlet that proves your royal standing she asked that it be given to you once you were of age
a circlet  you cant mean the royal crown surely my mother had cause to hate the monarchy above all else
i fear i know not what her intentions were milady nor have i the means of asking now but your highness  i know a time will come when your mothers heart grows clear to you
  
the circlet is stored in the temple vault i shall make my way there now i must tell everyone that her highness anthiese has returned to us i will await your arrival at the temple may milas blessing be upon you always
thanks so much for saving me my names est by the way i was kidnapped by pirates in archanea and brought here id really like to hurry home but  well it wouldnt be right to run off before thanking you for your help id like to fight with you if youll have me what do you say
wait youre sure you dont want me to help you i see  well ill wait around here a while in case you change your mind just say the word if you need me
yes did you change your mind about taking me with you
palla catria
est oh im so glad youre safe do you have any idea how much worry youve caused us
im sorry palla but i  i  i was so scaaared catriaaa
wha— hey stop this at once est youre not a child anymore
b but  but i  cant i be the kid sister just this once after everything i went through
but its not just “this once” thats the problem youre never anything but the kid sister
that is totally not true
enough you two were reunited for five minutes and already youre at each others throats honestly 
hee hee
oh celica i apologize for the scene my sisters caused
dont be silly—im just glad the three of you are all right
we wouldnt be if you hadnt helped us theres no way catria and i could have done this by ourselves thank you celica truly
you celica
i am and you are 
deen i worked under grieth the northern desert was my watch
ah so youre deen we owe you thanks had you pursued us we couldnt have defeated grieth your restraint was much appreciated
heh quite the gamble fortunately it paid off  youve got stones little one i like leaders with stones what say i throw in my lot with you
figures well i wont force you
you here to ask for a hand
my goodness you really are but a child
im sorry who are you
sonya i assume youve at least heard the name
ah so thats you we owe you thanks had you pursued us we couldnt have defeated grieth your restraint was much appreciated
i get the feeling you knew all along thats how i would react quite the clever one arent you  its a bit infuriating still ill wager your friends are seldom bored maybe ill just have to join up and see if theres room for one more that is im certain you wont regret it
right all full up well dont come running back to me if you regret it later
you came running back after all i told you not to do that hmm  i wonder if this is really such a great idea
ah its you thank you again for your help with that coral fragment business but alas i fear im in deep once more for another deal has fallen through a sizeable one this time now i need to source a boatload of steel lances with all speed with desaix dead my only connection on the the inside was grieth and i dont have to tell you how that one ended i wonder what sort of monstrous men were finally able to put greith down even the zofian knights couldnt touch that one in his prime well whoever it was they owe me some steel lances on the double my client on this one is a nasty type and my failure will be repaid in blood ive scraped together as many as i can but im still five short of the quota if you have any spares lying around id be happy to buy them from you id even pay extra since its my skin hows 50 silver marks apiece sound
my friend can i get you to open your heart and part with any steel lances ah youre a life saver literally take this with my compliments
youre killing me literally
im still short of steel lances so if you come across any ill buy them
whew that should be enough lances to save my poor hide thanks to you its looking like ill keep my head and turn a tidy profit for now though i must rush these to my client take care
ah its you so in a twist my angry client doesnt need steel lances anymore however he was still furious i didnt get the order together in time dangerous furious if you please so im going into hiding for a bit
at last the valley approach cross this and well finally reach the earth mothers temple take heart everyone were nearly there
aye but are you
who— oh by the mother what are rigelian forces doing all the way out here
ray think on it for a moment im sure the answer will come to you
no no that cant 
youre a priestess aye other of your kind have tried to cross this valley and seek milas blessing  but nary a one of them have completed the journey in one piece ignorance is a pitiable thing aye so it is doubly so when its the very mother whos responsible for your suffering 
what is that supposed to mean
why waste time explaining when youre about to be dead like all the rest
what are you waiting for soon youll all serve as scabbards for my shadow sword
damn  youre stronger than you look  shame youre too late  mila is already 
dangit i hate it when they die right before they say something important what do you think celica what beans was he about to spill there
i dont know but whatever it was i dont like it we must hurry to the temple
where are you going thats not the way to grieths citadel if you insist on heading in that direction ill excuse myself
youre not going to grieths citadel then im afraid our paths part here farewell
hey that isnt the way to grieth i dont have time for detours if youre taking the long way our deals off
what a strange place  clean but in the sort of way that comes from being devoid of all life hostile to it that sound in the distance  waves against a shore i remember as a child hearing it said that somewhere in zofia a sea spans the gap between the living world and the dead
at last celicas band had reached the temple of mila but what they found there was not the grand splendor of yore but instead a twisted shadow of it
thats the rigelian army has the temple already fallen to the rigelians
what have they done to the mother you dont think 
we need to confirm her safety immediately everyone infiltrate the temple as quickly as possible
heh heh heh 
who are you
i am mikhail cantor of the duma faithful i have come to teach dumas greatness to the fools who cling to milas lies now rue your ignorance from inside the bellies of my gargoyles
 take care everyone hes a cantor—hes likely to summon forth some manner of terrible beast stick close and watch each others backs above all else
hmph  ignorant slothful heathens serving as food for my beasts is an honor greater than you deserve
heh  killing me changes not your fate  it changes nothing  heh heh heeeeeh 
weve won  somehow
yeah but look at the temple its in shambles i always thought it would be crazy beautiful you know i mean mila cant actually live in a place like this right
i dont know lets go see for ourselves we must discover exactly what came to pass in this place
 there aint no one here wheres this earth mother of yours hiding lass
i dont understand  why isnt she here shes supposed to be here
princess anthiese
irma tell me what happened
i beg forgiveness your highness i had no idea the temple fell to the empire while i was prisoner they took mila and your highnesss circlet as well its unthinkable theyre no knights— only blasphemers and thieves
the rigelians hold mila captive youre certain of this
i am your highness emperor rudolf led the charge himself sealed her powers and took her away to where i fear i know not
rudolf himself 
quickly
mother mila intruders
mother mila you must save us
mother please
this is zofian soil the rigelian emperor would do well to state his intentions
the kingsfang 
the mother may deduce my intentions  from this blade you know what it signifies
indeed stands up from her chair it means  you are in violation of the accord
damn you duma
now hold on just a tick we get to the temple and everythings taken care of that was the deal
unfortunately none of us expected the mother to have stepped out nothing like this has ever happened before
well i guess now we know why the soils gone barren its been cut off from milas bounty
   what do we do now milady
the only thing we can we find the mother and bring her back
uh please take this as kindly as possible milady but are you mad how exactly do we bring her back and from where
i dont know but if the rigelian army took her shell be somewhere in the empire and since weve already come to the border  well we might as well continue into rigel
hold on just a moment youre saying we invade rigel this isnt a motley band of pirates or thieves—its an entire empire of them we should all take a step back and consider our opti—
no amount of thinking will change the situation come boey this isnt the first time weve faced hopeless odds and when people told us to give up did we run we need to trust in our abilities weve come this far for a reason and that reason is restoring mila to her rightful place shes still the only one who can save the world from this chaos
nay she isnt
hmm
  
well go on please dont leave us in suspense
mila cannot save this world but you can princess anthiese
ah how did you—
i bear you a gift
lady lipricas circlet
what how is it that you possess this
a question for another time are you prepared to accept it princess
how do you mean
this is no mere memento of your mother it is a crown—and accepting it is a kind of coronation as princess of zofia are you prepared to wear this and ascend the throne
i  im afraid i know little of kingdoms or the scope of rule but i have people i wish to protect both here and elsewhere i wish for this by my will alone for my own happiness is that resolve enough
it is indeed
princess anthiese this crown is now yours to bear
i accept it willingly
wow celica  you look so beautiful
its not celica anymore dummy to celica isnt that right princess anthiese er your highness  uh maam
hee hee celica is just fine you two to everyone though from this day on i will no longer conceal my identity i expect that will bring even more hardship than weve faced till now but i hope i can still count on you all
yeah all right guess ill go along and swear fealty it suits you lass or should i say princess anthiese anyway our loyalty belongs to you for now and always
thank you all truly
mila was taken by jedah priest of the duma faithful theyre keeping her in duma tower the seat of their foul cult
then thats where we must go
if youre headed into rigel seek a man called halcyon in sages hamlet he is an able soul and will mostlike assist you however he can
i will seek him out thank you
  
surprisingly enough i think im starting to get used to him
hes not a bad sort—and he clearly cares about my well being i cant really ask for more in such times and yet hes not without his mystery  i get a strange sense of nostalgia when im near him though ive no clue why
thank you for your kind aid masters but im afraid theres nothing left here now 
the lands north of the temple are ruled by a man called dolth as an archcantor of the duma faithful he summons necrodragons to his aid its said all who trespass on his land become fodder for the arisen beasts 
only one of zofias royal bloodline can open the temples sluice gate with his highness lima iv deceased who is left to take his place whats more i hear the western gate has been occupied by rigelian forces at this rate zofia is at risk of a flood the likes of which weve never seen
you wish to know what happened here beg pardon but i fear i cannot be the one to tell you irma one of our longest serving sisters was taken prisoner even now that black dog grieth holds her in his citadel alas there are things i can speak of only with her leave
rudolf used the divine falchion to seal milas powers before taking her a treasure given him by the wicked god duma no doubt aye finding mila may just be a matter of reaching duma tower but duma himself can only be slain by falchions edge
someone at the castle said that when lady liprica first held you in her arms she swore she would never let you stand before mila what do you suppose she might have meant by that
eh who are you sposed to be  me im the one what guards this here sluice gate  hows that you want me to open it bah i wont do nothin of the sort the gate opens for zofian royal blood not some random whippersnappers go on—shout orders at an old man wont change my mind none
by the mother that circlet symbol of the zofian throne it is then you must be the missing princess anthiese i thought id never have the pleasure your highness you must have come to inquire about this here sluice gate eh  well of course i can open it all is as your highness desires
er one small issue your highness openin this here gate isnt enough what to let water flow freely you also have to open the western gate
the western sluice gate you say that wont be a problem
oh then youve news from the west
not exactly—but i cant imagine alm would let this situation continue hell see the gate opened im sure of it  wont you alm
/***EOF***/
its not possible  alm is the emperors true son which makes him the rightful successor to the imperial throne all this time  all the effort what has it all been for  no it isnt true it cant be i refuse to believe it nothing but lies  lies lies lies lies lies notices an erupting flame is that an altar how did i get here whats happening
heed me 
who are y—
heed me you who thirst for power  call to me accept me unto your soul
that voice  duma is it really you
sighs which displayed as   
what
offscreen lord berkut
rinea 
ive been looking all over for you this is the last place i would have expected to find you you always hated the faithful after all
this is true  but then i had the throne snatched from under me by some magical heir plying the gods mercies is what men do in hopeless situations is it not
i didnt mean   forgive me i shouldnt have said anything
panting desperately which displayed as   
please dont despair so alm seems a kind and generous man im certain hell treat you fair
and im to be content with that
ah
i wanted to beat him rinea to dispatch him and claim the throne i wanted to make you my empress and hold all valentia in our palms together but what of those dreams now even rigel alone is now forever beyond my grasp so im to live in this alms shadow throw myself upon his mercy i would sooner an honorable death at the executioners blade
berkut you mustnt say such things i never   the truth is i never wanted to be empress
gasp  what
to stand at your side is all ive ever desired i dont care if youre the emperor or a swineherd so long as we   berkut
in shock and sadness which displayed as   you too rinea
what
were you laughing along with them rudolf massena and all the rest watching me toil away while you knew i would never become emperor was every kind word part of the act every smile an act of pity
berkut youre frightening me
duma o ancient god i call out to you now grant me the power to set this land to ruin  for good and all take of me what price you will i care not anymore
eeek
lord berkut lord berkut 
wh who are you what have you done to lady rinea
grandfather whats this door
it leads to the altar beneath duma tower but know that it is a path not easily returned from prepare well before you enter
a moment prince albein i ask that you show lord berkut compassion he weighed heavy on emperor rudolfs mind for many years the emperor knew that keeping the boy in ignorance could only bring him pain and yet the prospect of your being discovered was too great a risk still berkut was his nephew and the same age as the son he parted with so i beg leniency of you if only to respect emperor rudolfs wishes
it leads to the altar beneath duma tower but know that it is a path not easily returned from
blast it all this place is crawling with terrors so much for “begone to wherever you will” you damn useless priest
and what is that supposed to mean youre not actually thinking of leaving celica in there and running away
did you hear me say anything about running away gimme some credit here you little snot
stop flapping your jaws and focus on the fight id prefer not to die here if its all the same to you two fools
whatever lies at the end of these corridors possesses a frightful aura— it sets the hairs on the back of my neck on end the lord of this temple awaits  and here i am terrified of him but we must press on if we are to put an end to this long war
hold up everyone
what is it alm
someones coming its fernand
what
that voice  clive
fernand
gods whats happened to you
spare me your pity ive none to blame for this but myself  such trivialities matter not at this point but you  you made it here then you truly intend to slay duma
we do for it was emperor rudolfs dying request
i see  then he must have known of dumas madness
duma is mad
oh yes  duma is a god no longer merely an incarnation of the lust for power   you there alm
yeah thats me
listen well  you must beware of berkut he   hes no longer   hngh
fernand
please alm  stop duma i know ive no right to ask anything of you  but i beg it of you regardless  youre the only one who can end this let no one else be tainted by his madness let this tragedy end
i will i swear i will lay duma to rest
then i leave it to you  ngh
fernand are you all right
haah ha ha  strange isnt it  me begging boons of you 
not in the least i still count myself among your friends
you always were too nice for your own good always so quick to pardon me  along the way i i forgot how to ask for forgiveness 
fernand please—
i knew i always knew none of my misfortunes were anyone elses fault  yet if the world is rotten then who permitted it to be so its me and no one else i took anger better aimed at myself and turned it on the defenseless masses ive failed my duty as a nobleman 
enough fernand youve suffered enough you neednt flog yourself any further
good  i am rather tired tired of despair  tired of rage  but clive im glad i got to see you one last time you were right  you chose the right king you always were the friend i was  proudest to—   
 fernand fernand no dont do this look at me fernand  fernand
i simply wont accept this fernand i insist you wake up this instant were all returning to zofia together  fernand fernand say something
hes gone clair  hes gone
no  oh fernand  sob
are you two going to be all right
 yes grief will have its day but it will not be this one right now let us do what we must lead the way alm
all right fernand  i wish i could have fought beside you in the army you created at least now your fight is over  farewell
that statue  mila is that really the earth mother
but how could the goddess have been turned to stone only the sacred blade can seal a divine dragons power  look there the blade protruding from her forehead must be falchion but given that 
 alm alm is that you
celica youre safe oh im so glad  wait are you alone where are the others
  
ahh  so this is alm
who are you
my name is jedah i must thank you for disposing of emperor rudolf
well then jedah enjoy your last moments—im here to put an end to you and duma ill see zofia restored to celica
alm you cant you mustnt
what why not
if duma is gone rigels lands will turn as barren as zofias have even more people will starve
but celica we cant let—
and even if you wanted to stop duma you cant nothing can stop him now mila has chosen to seal falchion away with her
what but then all this fighting what was it even for f father
alm 
laughs maniacally alm and anthiese you stand at the pinnacle of your respective kingdoms the hour is come for the world of man to return to the gods control it is the dawn of an age of fear and chaos cradled in dumas shadow
well never let that happen
rejoice anthiese for you have the honor of serving as its cornerstone
celica what is he talking about
im sorry alm  this is the only way theres no other choice 
the girl will offer up her soul to quell the madness in dumas heart she does so for the sake of rigel and zofias people both
what no celica you cant tell me hes lying
im sorry alm 
do not think me a monster i shall grant you the time for a farewell but be quick about it
celica
im so sorry please forgive me
this is crazy you cant do this im going to get you out of here just hold on
you dont understand alm i came here knowing what awaited me
what
back on the island i had a dream a dream where something terrible happened to you so i decided to petition mila for the strength to protect you yet for all my travels youve still faced terrible danger and you were even forced to end your own fathers life  id seen it all i knew it was coming but i couldnt change a thing i failed to keep you safe alm
thats not  celica none of whats happened is your fault youre not to blame for any of it
but i wont lose you  i wont let any of you die i dont want you to fight duma i dont want anyone to be hurt or killed thats my only desire in this life
celica
and this is the only means i have of ensuring that comes to pass so again alm im sorry i wish it could have been different i always have i wish i could have gone home to the village and lived there with you
celica please wait celica
  
alm i dont wish to be vulgar but  well what is the proper course of action for us now emperor rudolf bade us defeat duma but princess anthiese asked us not to have we come this far simply to reach an impasse and accept it
one thing seems abundantly clear as things now stand the chances of zofias recovery are nearly extinguished with mila in her current state there is little hope of change
no  but celica is going to take care of mila and duma for us right
are you serious tobin youre going to just sit around on your butt and let celica die for us
what n no i dont want that any more than you do but what other choice do we have theres nothing left we can do
  
im not giving up
huh
im not giving up on her every part of me—every fiber of my being—says this is wrong so were going to take down duma and bring celica home safe
sure that all sounds fine and well but how do we do that exactly
consider your position alm youre no longer just the leader of the deliverance you are to be rigels next emperor you must set your personal feelings aside no matter how difficult it may be all of valentia depends on you now that must be what steers your decision
fine then i decide to follow the will of the previous emperor rudolf
alm
oh come on whats wrong with personal feelings all of you fought this far because you hold some kind of hope for the world its mans individual hopes and fears that shape the world that drive it and thats how it should be i truly believe that should we let the world crumble on a gods whim or his absence
youre right of course but 
i dont want to lose anyone else i care about i dont want to see anyone else lost because of duma dont you feel the same clive
   even if we escape from dumas control a starving people can know no peace villains and thieves will arise to feed on the weakest and most vulnerable are you prepared to inflict that upon the world
i will dedicate my life as emperor to ensuring such a thing doesnt happen and yes i know as well as anyone that there will be losses along the way i think ive learned that much by now  but when i think of the next thousand years i dont want this i want to leave behind a world where we shape our lives by our own hands where we make our own mistakes and fix them—as many times as necessary thats a world worthy of a future
 so be it if you have the determination to see it through ill not object i am yours to command your excellency
count me in im not living my life bowing to duma and his little idiots ill take going hungry over that any day of the week
i  im just not sure
oh quit your whining and hop on board already
if it were just me i would but i have little brothers and sisters to think of
i will gladly take up a trowel and work the land with them
wai—but youre a noble lukas
such things will mean precious little in the world ahead of us myself i refuse to be controlled by duma or go hungry if it means working the barren earth then i shall do just that
and you wont do it alone in truth ive always been curious about farming im sure we can reap or sow or  whatever it is enough to stay alive though i admit i think all this talk of doom and gloom is entirely premature
this is great guys count me in too im pretty handy with a plow actually ill show you guys how its done
an emperor plowing the fields i never thought id see the day
huh
milas statue is glowing 
whats going on here wasnt she sealed away
she  shes calling me 
alm
lets go mila is calling to me—we might still be able to pull this off we have to find a way to the altar
 
it is time anthiese lord duma is waiting
not yet not before youve released mila that was the arrangement
im afraid that what you ask is beyond my ability mila has sealed falchion herself we mortals have no say in the matter
you   you lied to me
if you are displeased princess i suggest you point your ire at mila lay blame upon the merciless goddess who forsook her zofian children
mila no  how could you
cease your lamentations and come along girl ill send the boy to you shortly that i can promise
no not alm you swore to leave him alone
keh heh heh  how hopeless a fool can you be to duma rejoice lord duma i have brought the brand bearer who threatens your order take her soul unto you and feast
no stop let me go aaaaalm
ohh  such potent energy bwaaaa ha ha ha my lord duma is pleased you neednt wait much longer i shall offer up the other brand bearers soul to you presently
anthiese i declare you reborn as dumas faithful pawn now go fall into the darkest depths and rot with mila below
there  its him
heh  heh heh ha ha ha  you kept me waiting alm or should i say your excellency perhaps emperor rudolf ii of rigel
berkut listen to—
tell me how does it feel to possess both zofia and rigel i imagine its wonderful though its a sensation ill never know
this isnt a conquest for me i have no illusions the people of rigel will suddenly welcome me as their ruler but my father placed this land in my care and ill do anything for it whatever it takes to keep valentias people safe
  
the path ahead is a difficult one for us all so help us berkut lend us your strength rigels people trust and love you far more than me you and i are cousins after all family i didnt think i had any family in this world and yet here you are i know we can be close friends as well lets work together berkut put all we have toward ensuring all valentia is—
silence
um what
listen to you offering mercy and trite platitudes from on high work together us dont make me laugh strength isnt lent its taken pried from the grip of your dead foes
what the 
so this is what fernand warned us about alm berkut has taken in dumas power hes no longer the man we knew
no
ah my beloved rinea  beautiful isnt she
oh gods  you offered the woman you love up to duma
  
how could you whats the point of power if you have nothing left to protect
i finally realized something power wont betray me power wont deceive me blood ties years of life lived together all meaningless the only thing in the world a man can rely on is his own strength
years of  are you accusing my father of betraying you youre wrong he loved you he worried about you to the last you knew him so much better than i did how can you not see that
silence im tired of listening to your pretty little lies to rinea its time rinea come with me well hold our wedding atop his funeral
berkut
you  you took everything from me you will suffer for what youve done
graugh
nnngh 
why berkut to have finally found family after all this time  why did it come to this
heh  i have no family nor do i want for one now stop talking and finish this end me and you can stand alone as inheritor of rigels royal blood
i never wanted that dont you get it ive spent enough of my life alone
my lord berkut 
 rinea rinea is that really you
dear proud berkut  even without crown or throne or castle  you were ever my emperor a just right and noble man 
rinea 
you were born to lead  this just wasnt your empire so come with me now let us find our empire together if youll still take me for your empress
youre right  you were always right the moment i turned to a power beyond myself the man you loved was dead rinea forgive me  if youll have me id be honored to set out with you 
berkut
is that you alm  here take this
a ring
a memento of my mother  let it be of some use   ngh
berkut no please  i dont want to be alone again help me rebuild rigel tell me about my father
youre not a child anymore  alm  you must make valentia a land not  of gods but of men  a world where people never again  are corrupted by divine power  you can do it  i know you 
berkut berkut  why someone please tell me  i never got to know you  or my father 
what is this place
why its a treasure vault of course  isnt that obvious mmm whats this say “these doors bar all save those of royal blood”
the royal treasury  this is where falchion was supposed to be stored
so weve been told yes though i believe it found a new home in milas skull one shudders to think of it regardless weve no business here
you sure about that i doubt falchions the only trinket tucked away in there who knows what might be left gold jewels magical doodads whatcha think alm
maybe so 
 huh the brand  its glowing
alm you okay there buddy
im feeling something strange i need to take a look
take a look at what  alm uh alm hey where you going
waugh what in the  oh come on i cant get past
it appears the vault really does bar all but the royal family how cheeky but oh dear i do hope alm will be all right on his own
thats  what are mila and falchion doing here and what the heck happened
gasps celica youre all right
nraugh celica celica what are you doing its me
growls meancingly displayed as   
celica 
keh heh heh  your words cant reach her boy
jedah
the girl has already offered up her soul to lord duma what you see now is a husk a witch a puppet loyal to the dark gods will
no  no celica please you have to wake up
go witch offer up your fellow brand bearers soul to your new master ah the sight of fates twin children fighting to the death  how marvelous a reenactment of duma and milas struggles from legend
celica dont do this
alm please  listen alm  you have to stop me before i kill you you know what you have to do alm do it now kill me
are you crazy you know i cant do that
hear me bearer of dumas brand
grasp falchion now in your hand
whats this what is the boy doing
impossible no one should be able to unbind that blade
trust in falchion
gods no 
dont leave me celica  you cant
celica celica say something please
celicaaa
 alm
celica 
celica oh celica thank goodness youre okay  but  how
ha  i dont know either but i heard a voice a very  kind voice it said everything would be all right and to have faith in falchion noticing something alm look what is that
alm  anthiese children of fate bearers of the brand 
that voice
i am mila your kind call me “goddess” together with my brother duma i shaped this land
earth mother
some have called me by that name  but no such power remains within me
what
see well falchion which you now hold it was carved from the fang of naga ruler of dragons to sever the gods for naga knew there was but a creeping madness waiting at eternitys end it is a ruin all dragons share and the only end is one of total destruction thus it was that naga bestowed falchion upon duma she did so to prepare for the day our madness would drive the land to ruin that the people might have a means to destroy us that falchion might become the fangs they lack and the hope they deserve and yet in my foolishness i sealed the blade away i did it to protect my brother  i loved my brother even as we loved mankind where we strayed i cannot remember
mila 
alm anthiese children of fate  you have overcome much to reach me here and i thank you both you have shown me the strength possessed by mankind perhaps men have long been walking on their own without our aid perhaps i simply refused to see it and alas duma was no different i entrust falchion to your care i pray you will use it to free my brother  from the depths of his pain
mila
 lets go celica we have to save duma for her sake and ours
alm i 
listen celica i know you sacrificed your own life to protect me and the others but i never wanted that i couldnt ever be happy in a world you died to create
oh alm  im sorry im so so sorry
dont apologize just know that i need you all right without your wisdom all i know how to do is fight whatevers in front of me so please  will you fight with me believe in me believe in us believe in our combined strength
i do its as mila said  weve had the strength to live and fight for our world this whole time i lost faith in that somewhere along the way  but right now it seems the most obvious thing in the world i trust in mankind like i trust in you alm absolutely and without hesitation
i feel the same celica this isnt where things end for us even without gods this world has a long and prosperous future ahead of it now lets go claim that future together
lets be ready for anything
celica thats really you right
mae everyone youre safe you have no idea how happy this makes me
right back at ya sister that chump jedahs magic sent us off to who knows where we were surrounded by terrors and junk—i thought we were dead meat but then we heard this weird voice kinda talking i guess so we followed it because hey why not and thats how we ended up here
a voice it must have been mila
no  no this cannot happen falchions seal broken foul mila duma is your brother would you truly betray your own kin
stand down jedah your schemes end here and now prepare to pay for your atrocities
rudolfs worthless spawn  youre both disgusting heretics how dare you wish harm on duma
open your eyes jedah no matter how it pains you you must see the truth dumas gone mad—he brings only suffering to his people now this is the divine dragons fate
silence girl you know nothing of what you speak and if suffering is the gods will what of it without their strength at its foundation valentia cannot sustain life
no youre wrong its time for us all to stand on our own feet to live as free men and women
foolish boy you truly believe such heresy to be possible
it is possible weve come all this way to prove it
presumptuous human child  go on then prove me wrong show me this strength to “stand alone” show me the true limits of man
all were asking is the ability to live as we think best is that really so bad
even without gods i have my friends with them i can survive anything
its all strength and power with you if youre that desperate for a show of force ill be happy to oblige
this world belongs to alm to all of us theres plenty of room for hope in it  but theres no room in it for you
a battle between god and mortal sounds exhilarating to me
merciful mila  i carry your will within me i will see duma freed from his suffering
this business of relying on gods and  so forth all seems quite absurd to me the creepy man will excuse himself now
ill take a proud death as my own man over a life of kneeling to a mad god
i have no deference for one who would wield unjust power over his people such a despot is no god of mine
ugh people who go on and on about power are just the worst
your spirits voice is ghastly dark i have no use for magic so foul
i alone will decide who i choose to worship but i can promise you one thing it certainly wont be you
come on who needs gods when youre as strong as me
this is my world and zekes as well i wont allow you to endanger it
emperor rudolf  your loyal servant will see your dreams realized
this is a battle i cannot lose for my own sake or yours rudolf
youre gonna pay for what you did to celica buddy youre gonna pay hard
sorry but ive got no interest in the way people like you operate thats reason enough for me to want to put you down
ill never accept a god so horrible 
well hell ive come this far might as well see the damn thing through to the end lass
foisting your way on the world by force youre no better than pirates and it just so happens i dont take kindly to pirates
i get the feeling my luck ran out the day i got mixed up in all this  but meh why not may as well see things through to the end
your fetish for power is simply barbaric wheres the joy the love your perfect world is as dull as dirt
the greatest of powers is but one mistake away from utter tragedy we know that all too well and i refuse to stand aside and watch it happen
this world doesnt exist as a plaything for dragons
its our world and well be the ones to shape it—archanea and valentia both
ruling the world with might and terror talk about your stale clichés whats the point in living if youre not having fun im not about to find out
yours isnt the world i fought to protect im taking every one of you down
ugh its almost painful to watch  just how hopelessly ignorant can someone be
i wont say a world ruled by might is unappealing per se  but a world where i bow to you is out of the question
divine duma you have lived long enough  it is time to leave a world of hope and possibility to the next generation
duma  o ancient benefactor consider this is an act of mercy a great god is deserving of a proud and glorious end
bow before dumas eminence kneel before his awesome power
aah  this cannot be  it mustnt  lord duma  my lord duma 
such naughty willful children  why wont you be good and listen to father
do you really hate father so  such lost misguided children 
thats no fair sonya  why should you be the only one allowed to live as she chooses
oh  it seems so obvious now i should have just lived as i pleased  like you 
only power holds meaning only strength holds sway call to me thirst for me thirst for power
its over duma berkut fernand mila  even my father they and countless others lost to us— tainted by your precious power but that chain of tragedies ends here
my heart is full of thanks for all youve given man o divine duma without yours and milas bounty valentia could never have existed we would never have been born into this world never tasted joy and sorrow so please do not suffer any longer let all of our pain end here allow your great and weary soul the rest it deserves
so be it alm i leave valentias future to you her hero take from us what lessons you will and shape her into a land to remember make her strong like duma and fill her with milas love let our grave mistakes be warnings of where not to tread as you lead her forth now we shall sleep and never shall you disturb our slumber
 
so this is where you were
huh oh hey celica
you arent going to be late to your own coronation are you
no  of course not im just still wrapping my head around sitting on your fathers throne none of it feels real
 it isnt my fathers throne this isnt zofia any longer alm its the one kingdom of valentia and youre going to be its first ruler
celica 
please dont misunderstand i dont bear him any grudge not now i just think he was a very sad man perhaps if id been there with him i might have helped him change if i have any regrets its that
i know what you mean  neither of us got the chance to stand by our fathers if wed been given the opportunity to learn more about each other maybe things wouldve turned out differently for us
perhaps it was the same for mila and duma
hmm  i wonder theyd been fighting for centuries right seems like a lost cause to me
alm thats a terrible thing to say
ah sorry i didnt mean any disrespect but theyre at peace now you know asleep  together
yes theyll look down over this new valentia forever from their mountaintop graves  and the trees do you know of them alm they say that where divine dragons sleep sacred trees take root and grow
wow must be some trees
in time yes they grow for hundreds even thousands of years who can say what valentia will look like once theyve matured will mans endeavors continue without the grace and strength of the gods
they wont continue on their own we have to make it happen well forge a land where we can do just that all of us—together
that sounds lovely alm and youre right i know we can do it
we can and we will i think mila and duma gave us one last gift  the strength to trust in our own abilities  anyway its time lets go celica
gladly
war will come again when man grows proud and slothful once more and its flames will devour one and all raging until the very earth itself lies scorched and bare of life for whatever madness lay in the hearts of gods  a darkness deeper still beats wild in the hearts of man 
/***EOF***/
once upon a time there was a god named duma and a goddess named mila who fought each other bitterly for an age
hey why did mila and duma have to fight so much couldnt they just say they were sorry
lets promise well never end up like that okay
yeah nothing will ever come between us
gods no 
dont leave me celica  you cant
celica celica say something please
celicaaa
 alm  alm sigh where did he go this time
whats the matter faye dont tell me youre after him again

ha ha ah there you are you guysll never believe this
hey tobin believe what
somebody saw a knight in the woods a real knight from the castle come on lets go check it out

yeah
huh h hey wait up
alm over here come look at this
what is it celica you find something
i made a wreath out of these flowers here put it on
wh what no
why not i think itd make you look very handsome
i think you mean very stupid boys dont wear wreaths
dont call it stupid it took me a long time to make this fine then maybe ill just give it to grandpapa instead
youre kidding right
grandpapa knows a manly wreath when he sees one unlike some boys ha ha
har har very funny
youre picturing him wearing it ha ha admit it
 heh heh
theres the smile i was looking for  huh what is something wrong
no i just  im glad youve cheered up is all when you first came to the village you always wore such a dark expression  plus you never spoke a word grandpapa told me to be nice but i wasnt sure how to make things better
well i think you did just fine each story that you told me each flower you picked for me each walk you took with me here in the woods— that all made a difference alm
come on i didnt do anything special
or maybe you did im sorry that my first words to you were so unkind
are you talking about when you called me a boor or a clod
hey i said im sorry ive just never had any friends my age so i guess i wasnt used to boys like you
well id never met a girl like you either dont let it get to you
say alm why are you so nice to me
 why do i need a reason i mean i guess its because i never knew my parents i have no siblings  and grandpapa has always forbid me from setting foot outside the village youre like a window to a world that ive never had the chance to know is that a good enough reason or   oh hey
what is it
see this we have the same mark
um yes except yours is on your left hand and mine is on my right 
well that makes us close er doesnt it
ha ha i suppose it does in a strange sort of way i wonder why the marks are so similar
its because theyre special they prove that the two of us belong together always that is if youre not already tired of a clod like me making you laugh
of course not so do you mean it well always be together
yes i promise isnt that what you want
yes of course you have my word ill never lea—
offscreen eeeeeek

b but we cant just  well get the scolding of our lives if we bring strangers to the village
good sir knight if i may  ahem our home is but a small village—to call it a line of hovels is too generous we do not wish to offend you when you are clearly deserving of so much more so please we humbly implore your great mightiness to—

take shelter in the trees there they can provide cover remember always use the surrounding terrain to your advantage
youve done all you can for now now brace for their attack
damn they nearly have me  but not today i must return to the castle general desaix will be eager to learn that we have found her the princess who refuses to die heh heh heh 
we did it we actually did it look at em run grandpapa

grandpapa celica that was great
mmm 
  
what youre not happy we saved the village from those despicable knaves were heroes i mean if nothing else were not dead you could at least crack a smile
alm you dont understand
now that they know celica is here they will stop at nothing its no longer safe for her to stay in the village
 what but why it doesnt have to be like that tell him celica
im so sorry alm i know that you would have kept your promise

you dont need to apologize sir mycen i regret nothing the days i spent here with you and alm were wonderful the experiences i had and the friends i made all mean the world to me you dont have to be my shining knight sir mycen— you just have to promise to always be my grandpapa

i could never forget you alm and i promise too ill be waiting for the day we can meet again but for now i have to go to mycen grandpapa
yes child
 do you think ill ever see him again
i do so long as destiny wills it
destiny  so be it
sibling gods named duma and mila the elder god duma believed mankind must be ruled by strength lest we become corrupt while his sister mila believed we should be free to pursue lives of pleasure and comfort the two clashed ceaselessly it was a long dark age before the bitter conflict was resolved with the binding of a divine accord valentia would be divided in twain—with duma ruling the north and mila ruling the south—and in order to secure a lasting peace each pledged never to violate the others dominion
for millennia this accord was honored and peace did indeed reign in time the kingdom of zofia which mila founded in the south prospered with the goddesss love and blessings hers were a happy people who knew no toil and lived free of hardship but milas gifts spoiled the zofians and it was only a matter of time before they sank into depravity
meanwhile in the north duma had built his own empire tempered by harsh lands and the even harsher teachings of their fierce god the people of rigel had grown strong but in their quest for power the rigelians had let their hearts grow cold and numb to all kindness
both halves of the continent were in a fragile state and the cracks had begun to show and now valentia lies on the cusp of a terrible war that could forever alter its history 
/***EOF***/
i am a researcher unearthing shocking new truths from zofias history  or i very well might be if i had any of the resources i needed might i ask your help in this matter you are familiar with the underground cemetery at the deliverance hideout well at one corner of that site lies the royal grave where zofias kings sleep at the risk of sounding grave robby i desire the lima armlet from it but the place is crawling with terrors and i am not the terror type yet those terrors are drawn to riches its said they raid the graves for gold one may drop the armlet i require bring it to me and ill pay you well
ah the lima armlet precisely as the records describe it  it bears the royal emblem of the late king himself if i can translate this inscription it may even offer up new insights er pardon me for getting so excited im only eager to return to work this isnt a huge sum but please take it youve done me a great service
wa what no please what will become of my poor beleaguered research
oh you dont have it and here i got my scholarly hopes up 
how goes your investigation of the underground cemetery
theres a strange old man ive not seen before hanging about the throne room theres something not right about him almost like hes some manner of ghost
i have long stood watch over this castle and its masters  but some fool has violated the grave where zofias monarchs lie theyve broken the seal and now a massive fiend has made its home there it sullies the site with its foul presence barring the fallen kings from slumber i ask this of you warrior—rid their holy tomb of this blight
fine work child of fate you have proven your strength my master too has acknowledged you as worthy to inherit the kingdom that royal shield is your proof use it well and know that my master and i will watch over you always
you must destroy the beast that has made its home in the royal grave
mmm where did the strange old man who was in here go i wonder who he actually was 
its over  all over  theres nothing to be done
i am the eldest son of the rion family one of zofias oldest houses but that dog desaix demanded we give him our greatest heirloom—a shield the rion shield was a gift from queen zofia i passed down ever since if i cant find some way to recover it my ancestors legacy will be lost the deliverance is marching on desaixs fortress is it not if you chance to find the rion shield please see it returned to me you will be rewarded handsomely of course i thank you in advance
yes  yes this is our family shield you have my thanks and here a token of that gratitude
now that ive recovered the shield i must be heading home
what is your intent in this why would you play at such a game
please recover the rion shield i cannot bear to return home without it
this shield bears the crest of the fugue family—our sworn enemies a pox on those dastards even looking upon this sets my blood to boil
sir alm our scouts have spied rigelian forces up ahead
    then the battle begins here
so it seems the fights ahead will be nothing like our skirmishes in the south youve wounded rigels pride and they will strike back without mercy but the spirit of zofia demands you prevail theres no turning back now
i know
there you are whelp i thought youd never arrive
wait a second 
fernand you march beneath rigels standard now
does that really surprise you clive you and the deliverance took all i believed in and trod it into the mire in rigel they still have ideals worth upholding
damn you fernand listen to yourself
my king is dead my country fallen but ill not hand this land over to you now it is the rigelian empires turn lord berkut shall lead us and unite valentia under one noble order
come to your senses fernand you have always fought for your motherland—for zofia
only one of us has lost his senses clive
what
allow me to enlighten you that boy you have been parading around as your new hero he was never mycens grandson
 what is this folly
 oh i can assure you it is no folly my source has known sir mycen for years the old knight has no family heh perhaps he made some orphan his ward so he wouldnt have to die alone
you lie  and yet there is the matter of what the old man at the castle said 
ha ha ha oh clive youve become the very picture of absurdity once you were a man to whom the lineage of our noble houses meant all but now you take for your future king a boy you dont know from a gutter rat
  
come at me surely you detestable vermin dont think you can stand against a true nobleman
nnngh  i have no choice  i must fall back and rejoin lord berkut in the main force 
you dont look half as scared as you ought dont you value your lives its time you had the fear of death put back into you
no  ill not surrender  not like this 
weve emerged victorious but  the survivors will be making their way back to the main force we cant rest on our laurels now wouldnt you agree clive
 hmm oh yes quite
what is it you look shaken  oh right forgive me you and fernand were good friends
no its not that  well its not just that  in any case its nothing you need trouble yourself with if youll excuse me
whats with him
a moment please alm i have a fresh report from our scouts apparently the enemys main force has retreated west through the forest but before we give chase we should deal with desaix it wouldnt be wise to pass him by while his fortress lies in reach
all right that makes sense but listen lukas  do you know anything about the rigelian general fernand mentioned berkut i believe it was
lord berkut yes i am no stranger to the rumors at least they say he is about your age a talented young general of royal blood  its no wonder fernand is so smitten with him
yeah  does it really matter so much where youre born or who your father was
i beg your pardon
oh—sorry i was just  i dont meant to speak ill of nobles or anything
well i should hope not your own grandfather was a count after all
yeah i know but 
   enough of this talk alm beyond this forest lies a great army— you shouldnt trouble yourself with anything but the battles ahead
youre right clive i apologize
  
as i live and breathe  the deliverance well this is simply delightful
huh fernand and whos this
my name is berkut i am nephew to his majesty emperor rudolf
so here he is 
alm was it i must say i was most impressed by the battle at zofia castle i nearly mistook that motley band of rustics you were leading for an army
what are you doing here your main force has retreated
lord berkut longs for sport and wishes to test your might
ive gone too long without fighting and felt i needed a spot of practice now then do try to make this little exercise worth my time
gods hes charging right at us
hah whats the matter farmboy afraid you wont land a single blow
the name is alm—not “farmboy”
oh my mistake wait a second 
that mark on your left hand  where did that come from
what do you care are you here to fight or not
no  it cannot be the brand not on one as unremarkable as you it must be false just like its bearer
come then are you going to entertain me or not
theyre stronger than i thought  but no  i came here to be entertained not to give up my life
i neednt test you as lord berkut does i already know how pathetic you are
careless  but next time will be different
im not quite sure how we just pulled that off  there were only three of them—how did they give us so much trouble
rigel may be stronger than i first believed  what if this is a mistake
did you say something clive
 it was nothing come we must plan our siege of desaixs fortress an ally of ours is being held there and we must rescue her
 youre talking about mathilda right i heard what happened shes special to you isnt she
she is we promised to share a future together and because of that promise she has suffered for far too long it relieves me to know she will soon be free of this burden
im glad to hear it and you know ill do everything i can to help
thank you alm
youre too late aint nothin left for you in this village we never made trouble for no one honored the old laws we did but desaix and them rigelian brutes raided and pillaged us all the same youre with the deliverance aint ya then think kindly on us when ya give that dastard desaix whats comin
are you with the deliverance im afraid i have some ill news one of the enemy soldiers mentioned a female knight theyre holding captive desaix plans to put her to death soon as an example to others 
what they intend to execute mathilda
i fear so good sir knight if shes dear to you youd best march on his fortress before its too late
desaixs men come here without pause to raid pillage and upend our lives one of their more wicked knights even made off with some poor lass and now the empire is trying to start a flood and put half of zofia to ruin sigh will we never have peace
luthier and delthea descend from the founder of our village so they do she was a mage one who was said to be the champion zofias finest disciple for generations children in their family have been born with a gift for magic though only those in our village and the late king knew of it so what fool told those damned rigelians sigh
gasp you there youre with the deliverance are you not
i am who are you
my name is luthier merely a humble mage from a humble village on this day however i cry your aid for my younger sister is in trouble
what happened
first of all you should know that my sister is named delthea she possesses magical potential beyond that of any in our village one of rigels arcanists tatarrah caught wind of this and kidnapped her hes using his powers to control her and make her guard the northern sluice they plan to block the sluice until it collapses and zofia is flooded
what but that would be catastrophic
indeed it would surely youre planning to stop them correct if so i ask that you also rescue my sister ill even go with you if you like if we defeat tatarrah that will release his hold on her
your decisions are your business see to your own desires then i will be here if you find your mind changed
so  will you let me accompany you or no
soldiers of the deliverance i require your assistance gargoyles have kidnapped my daughter and taken her to the western shrine if it is at all in your power you must not let any harm befall her i know i ask much so if you manage to save her my treasure is yours
ive been waiting for you deliverance i hear you saved my daughter from the shrine to the west i insist you help yourself to my treasure
tee hee thank you for coming to save me brave sir
please i need your help my husband went to zofia castle to sell his wares but hasnt returned what am i to do our child will be born soon and i cant survive without him and actually i heard a girl from our village was taken to the sylvan shrine  what if my husband was taken there as well oh i cant bear it if youre heading to the sylvan shrine would you please look for him
did you find my husband i think hes being held in the sylvan shrine
wh what aaaaaah
mathilda 
fernand what are you doing here have you come to rescue me
no milady i fear i no longer serve the deliverance
what what do you mean
exactly as i said sadly clive and i no longer share the same ideals i have sworn my lance instead to lord berkut of the rigelian empire
the general who leads our enemies has madness taken you a lance sworn to him is a lance through my heart dont you care about zofia
zofia you mean the proud kingdom whose riches fell to wild and ignorant savages zofia is dead to me i have buried her and will not look back
how can you say such a thing fernand you and clive were like brothers its not too late to fix this return to the deliverance i know clive would welcome you back with open arms
 with you by my side i might have chosen differently
fernand
what is done is done  desaix intends to put you to death it wont be long now
gasp
on the morrow i depart for rigel at lord berkuts side farewell mathilda
fernand wait
chancellor the rebels have reached the fortress
and damn them for it why cant that clive see reason he would sooner have me kill his woman than lay down arms the obstinate fool ah well it seems she is of no further use to me  archers kill that wench in the cage but do it slowly i want her suffering to last
it seems i vastly misestimated you ill grant you that but today you vermin will die at my hands
damn you mycen  you think to hand zofia over to rudolfs pup  t traitorous dastard 
we did it alm desaix is finished
yeah 
huh whats wrong i thought youd be thrilled
i am thrilled but  desaixs dying words have been troubling me something about my grandfather and emperor rudolf
huh you sure youre not imagining things what would sir mycen and the rigelian emperor have to do with each other
thats what concerns me somethings been bothering me lately something i cant shake it feels like every victory i secure takes me one step further from zofia
ha am i allowed to point out that thats literally whats happening were a long way from ram village kid look im worried too about my family about everyone else we left behind  i miss them all terribly so i get that youre homesick but thats okay alm
thanks but im afraid thats not what this is tobin this is different sigh
desaix has fallen  it is but a matter of time until the deliverance reaches the sluice gate your moment to shine has come my dear delthea
possesed moan
that traitor is certainly proving himself useful  heh heh heh 
whoa look at this hey alm
you find something tobin
i sure did feast your eyes on this baby you think this is the treasure desaix stole from zofia castle
well it certainly looks important should we open it
whooooooa check the sword that is one impressive piece of hardware im just gonna—
hng  whu  huh this thing weighs a ton it wont budge 
this must be the royal sword of zofia
whats that
long ago rigel presented this sword to zofia as a symbol of friendship its a very special treasure—only one of royal blood can lift it
hmm  interesting here tobin—let me have a go at it
you pfft please if i cant lift it theres no way that— huh
sometimes i dont get you tobin this things light as a feather was this all some kind of jape who put you up to this
but but it wasnt a jape zero japes i thought my arms would snap just trying to lift it
hmm but that means 
by the gods  you can wield the royal sword  hmm what does that mean alm are you 
   o oh come on its just some legend you dont actually believe it right im sure everyone can use this thing well except tobin and um  look im sure the zofian royals made up a story to keep folks from nicking it
 well that didnt exactly work out now did it but perhaps youre right tales do have a habit of getting taller with time either way it seems clear the blade belongs with you
are you sure i mean we could have other people give it a shot
it wouldnt work you alone seem able to tame this legend and we wouldnt want to see so fine a treasure wasted would we take it
well all right 
clive im  im so sorry about mathilda i couldnt save her i didnt have what it takes
 no you did not
huh
you have ruined everything first you cost me my best friend and now the woman i love is dead is that what you would have me say  it will not close these wounds
look im 
   i wish i could stand by my choices unwavering i have always done what i thought to be right even when my heart disagreed but now i must face cold reality i may have made a terrible error
what are you talking about clive
oh no no no no were not going down that old road now dont you dare say that making alm the deliverances leader was a mistake weve been through way too much to start in with second guessing now
yeah i mean i know you lost so much and that youre hurting but dont take it out on alm hes been doing as good a job as anyone
the two boys will hold their tongues my brother will not be subjected to your abuses
ah 
you are a loathsome cad gray as are you tobin clive has just lost someone dear to his heart if you possessed hearts yourselves you would leave him in peace to grieve
b but 
would you all please calm down
but alm—
clive is clearly privy to some information he cant share with us am i right clive
alm please 
youve been acting strange for a while now whatever secret youre harboring i know it weighs heavy on you ive been scared to broach the subject because i could sense it was about me
  
but if nothing else i want you to know this  i will always be grateful for the trust you have placed in me and i will be honored for each moment i can fight for the deliverance she wanted to know why a nobody like me would risk so much to fight the answer was i just wanted to make a difference in peoples lives i had to leave ram village it was just a matter of when when lukas came to the village that was my “when” i want to repay that kindness clive lukas—let me help you let me help fernand
fernand but he has insulted you at every step
and i cant claim to understand his motivations for all of that but he helped you and mathilda found the deliverance didnt he hes part of the reason weve come this far so he deserves my respect no matter how hes treated me in the past if he returns to the deliverance ill gladly welcome him back
you would do such  pray forgive me alm i withdraw my words from before but there are yet matters i need time to consider
take all the time you need
mathilda
gasp clive oh how i have missed you my sweet clive
forgive me mathilda i should never have left you to suffer for so long speak now your loathing for me and i will gladly bear it all
oh stop your nonsense you did what any commander ought your judgment was sound and i bear the blame for my capture not you i was careless so let us speak no more of blame
as you wish
good now i wonder what comes next 
what indeed 
  
what a woman yowza  um alm youre blushing
wh what no im not
ah you must be alm
y yes milady
i would not be alive if not for your fine leadership i thank you from the bottom of my heart alm and with your permission i wish to take up arms at your side will you have me
very well i have confidence in my ability to fight but will respect your judgment please come find me if you change your mind
yes what is it i stand ready to fight for you you need only speak the words
i saw fernand he visited me in my cell the other day
i see then you know what has transpired
yes it feels like a different age when the three of us started the deliverance though we were once brethren we now must come to blows
sad sigh i wish i could stand by my choices unwavering i have always done what i thought to be right even when my heart disagreed but now i must face cold reality
what do you mean
i may have made a terrible error
huh what are you talking about
sad sigh
oh no no no no were not going down that old road now dont you dare say that making alm the deliverances leader was a mistake weve been through way too much to start in with second guessing now
yeah i mean i know you lost a dear friend and that youre hurting but dont take it out on alm hes been doing as good a job as anyone
would you all please calm down
but alm—
clive is clearly privy to some information he cant share with us am i right clive
alm please 
youve been acting strange for a while now whatever secret youre harboring i know it weighs heavy on you ive been scared to broach the subject because i could sense it was about me
  
but if nothing else i want you to know this  and i will be honored for each moment i can fight for the deliverance  you know a friend once confronted me about this she wanted to know why a nobody like me would risk so much to fight the answer was i just wanted to make a difference in peoples lives when lukas came to the village that was my “when” dont you see every one of you has set my life moving in ways i never imagined i want to repay that kindness clive lukas mathilda—let me help you let me help fernand
but he has insulted you at every step
oh im well aware and i cant claim to understand his motivations for all of that but he helped you and mathilda found the deliverance didnt he so he deserves my respect no matter how hes treated me in the past if he returns to the deliverance ill gladly welcome him back
you would do such i cannot speak for fernand but  thank you alm
what a mess ive gotten myself into 
you see chancellor desaix asked me to procure him a coral ring but what happened when i acquired the coral shards and crafted the ring the damned deliverance came along and killed the buyer i sunk all i had into this coral ring if i dont sell it ill be ruined er say do you want a coral ring its crafted from the finest coral fragments a merchant can scrounge up since you seem woefully poor  hmm  well ill cut you a deal and part with the ring for a mere 30 silver marks
then we have a deal  and thank the mother we do now i can finally go home
hmph fine skinflint
ho there friend are you interested in the sale of the century this is a coral ring made from only the finest coral fragments and i am willing to part with it for the low low price of 30 silver marks
the rion shield no i aint seen it but i hear that desaix sold off some of his plunder to grieth
so this is the zofian sluice gate  its massive
indeed it is and were it to collapse the damage would be more massive still
then we need to get it open before its too late
heh heh  so the deliverance finally deliver themselves to me 
are you tatarrah
the one and only ermit me to introduce my new servant as well 
  
that girl 
go delthea put the fear of duma back into these faithless fools smite them with your aura
aaah
enemies of tatarrah must die
alm what are you doing snap out of it strike her down before she ends you
no i promised luthier i would bring his sister home safe
but alm youre going to—
everyone stay clear of deltheas magic and whatever you do do not kill her thats an order
alm if we eliminate tatarrah that should release his hold on my sister i beg of you—please help her
you have defied tatarrah i shall give you death
ah  what am i doing here luthier are you there it it hurts 
heh heh heh  you imbeciles think yourselves a match for the mighty tatarrah such a dire misjudgment cannot go uncorrected
wh what  impossible  father dumaaa  aaargh 
 huh what am i doing here luthier brother are you there
zofian dullards  ill dismantle you limb by limb
so this is the end  forgive me sire 
you have taken your last step in this realm now prepare to visit the next
to die at the hands of worthless vermin  how shameful 
just imagine how many generations these massive ruins have stood witness to the dusty air carries more than the scent of broken rusty iron its like im breathing in centuries of history and yet i can see the signs of men of ill intent having come and gone with no regard for the place at all
aaah oh it was so awful
back so soon berkut
sire i was merely—
are the tales true you challenged the deliverance for sport and lost
 forgive me uncle they proved to be more skilled than i first imagined
hmm 
what a most distressing turn of events our own lord berkut broken by a band of farmers and cowhands did you mean to drag your knights honor through the dung whilst playing
hold your tongue you are a servant to our house and you dare insult rigels finest its far more sensible for clods such as you to stay cowering in your robes
you forget that we answer to none but duma father of all rigel though i may be a servant it is certainly not to you we shall see who cowers in the end
what are you implying
emperor rudolf allow me to put your heart at ease it is true that the deliverance is nearing the sluice gate at our border however it is guarded by tatarrah one of the duma faithfuls finest arcanists and as i understand it he has come across a most interesting toy i have the utmost faith he will make short work of those rebels
 sire
what now berkut
tatarrah may yet fail permit me to take my men to the border if the deliverance does break past the sluice they must reckon with me
mmm 
this time i will smash their puny rebellion once and for all i swear it you must give me one last chance
 very well if they try to set foot on our land they are to pay dearly am i understood
what silliness the rebels will be dead long before they reach the border heh heh heh 
grumble
urgh 
berkut my lord have you finished your report to the emperor
yes we march for the border
again but we only just returned home
it was my choice—i had to beg the emperor for a chance at redemption all because of that maggot alm because of him i had to sit there while that snake jedah spat venom at me  i will make him pay for this disgrace a hundredfold
why lord berkut what grieves you
ugh nuibaba not you 
these halls have been dark without your unique fire to light them my lord i shall treasure this meeting when i return to my post on fear mountain master jedah honors me  yet i hear he has not done the same for you perhaps because of your embarrassing loss at the hands of those rebel scum
you faithful are in dire need of a lesson on how to speak to nobility
and i am certain you would be a most fearsome teacher regardless you wrong me lord berkut i merely wish to aid you
heh how could you help me all of you claw at the heels of your god while ignoring his first teaching he wished for men to be strong not a pack of supplicating fools
so you do not need our power  i see then i pray you fare well in your battle at the border for should you lose  well i doubt your uncle would give you a third chance or is this the fourth
  
for all your stubborn words you have some wisdom you have seen what the faithful are capable of in battle i know it father dumas power is vast and not to be looked down upon yes its true—marla and hestia both in turn the father rewarded lord jedah with incredible magic
his own daughters how dreadful
do you see now lord berkut come to my abode 
 never victory over alm would mean nothing if not won by my own hand
so prideful  very well but at least allow me to give you this
what is this  a mirror
one filled with my sorcery of course i believe you when you say you have no need for such tricks but one day you may find yourself cornered and without recourse if that day comes shatter the mirror i dont need such baubles 
are you certain
  
think of it as a safeguard if that helps something just in case hee hee hee 
gasp luthier brother
delthea thank heavens youve returned to your senses
hmm whats that supposed to mean whatever game youre playing lu i wont fall for it this time pauses wait tatarrah was controlling me eeeeew i am so sorry i must have been a real handful but i swear i dont remember any of it
its all right delthea all that matters is that youre safe and back with us
im sorry i worried you lu good thing the deliverance came along huh yup thanks deliverance so if lu is sticking with you guys i get to come too right im pretty darned tough you know ill give all your enemies what for
what aw come on why not well dont come crawling back to me later  or you know do
aha i knew it you need me  say you need me i wanna hear it
oh youre those folks from before whats going on i cant remember a thing    wait tatarrah was controlling me eeeeew i am so sorry i must have been a real handful well anyway my name is delthea its super nice to meet you hey but you look like you could use my help want me to tag along
what aw come on why not well dont come crawling back to me later  or you know do
aha i knew it you need me  say you need me i wanna hear it
ha ha delthea sure isnt short on energy is she
i know shes simply incorrigible she was spoiled growing up and now look at her she just runs amok i feel your pain 
well i admire how close you are i never had anything like that im glad youre a team again
its appreciated alm but there arent words enough to thank you proper so ill speak with action from here on out sire i am your most loyal man
yeah maybe lets not have any of the whole “sire” thing
ha ha ha and why not youre our king arent you
sigh i wish luthier hadnt said that 
alm
hello clive
i just wanted to say  fine work there rescuing the maiden as you did
whats this are you maybe possibly admitting that i did the right thing
heh heh i am as shocked as you it appears you are more fit to be king than i will ever be
oh no dont you start
unlike you alm i have been too willing to put peoples lives on the line i stand by my belief that a commander must put reason before emotion but failing to rescue mathilda or my sister was cowardice not reason the truth is i chose not to act for fear it would undermine my authority
stop it clive youre no craven
arent i just look at what you did in my stead i criticized you roundly for diverting our army to save one person but you did it anyway because you have something i do not—strength of heart you understand what is precious and fight for it no matter the cost clive i dont know what to say 
open the sluice gate hah impossible wed flood the bloody continent someone has to open the sluice at the temple of mila first
now that the temple sluice is open we can open the gate here as well  still i do find it curious only members of the zofian royal family can open the sluice at the temple
are you serious
makes you wonder if princess anthiese is alive after all hah it would make for a fine story thats for sure oh my yes ha ha ha
anthiese  did a member of the royal family really open the gate celica are you 
so theyve opened the sluice this is a fortuitous and most welcome turn of events that feisty girl is certain to come looking for mila  and when she does i shall be waiting to scoop her up perhaps i might even go greet her myself  heh heh heh 
through the combined efforts of alm and celica the empires plans to flood zofia were thwarted the arc of her destiny now clear celica embraced her identity and set forth meanwhile alm having learned his friend was in truth zofias princess anthiese renewed his own oath to defend zofia from the rigelian empire however a dark creature had his own plans for these fated children who bore the brand 
/***EOF***/
well done alm well end todays training here your swordsmanship has come a long way ive always known you had talent
you really think so youre not just saying that are you grandfather
either im getting old or youre getting better—and we both know im not old
ha well good then that means youre ready to let me travel outside the village
hmph dont misconstrue my words boy the rule still stands
but why im not a child anymore you just said i can fend for myself if i meet with any dangers ill have my sword and my wits
alm thats not what this is about
then what is it about
alm 
look ive heard from the others i know the droughts made zofia a scary place people are starving and many have turned to thievery and plunder brigands loot villages for a mere sack of grain and soon theyll be at our door and dont think i havent heard what the rigelian army has been up to theyve been crossing the border for years in violation of the divine accord and with that sacred bond broken now the terrors have resurfaced as well 
 all true
zofia is full of innocent people who are looking for help please grandfather i want to make a difference in a world bigger than a handful of houses i want to see all the amazing places youve told me about— that celica told me about
suppose you do set forth with your sword and your wits so what
  
will the grand story of your life be how you met the end of a brigands axe before you dream of changing the world learn your damned place in it and no more talk of leaving
 whats his problem why teach me to use a sword if youre not going to let me fight every day in this place is exactly the same as the next i know im meant for more than this but you have to let me find it
huh whats all the commotion its coming from the gates hmm 
good day you must be sir mycens grandson alm was it my name is lukas i fight for the deliverance
the deliverance whats that arent you one of the knights of zofia the kings knights
oh i see i suppose that means word hasnt yet reached your village in that case please forgive me for heralding such dark news but  king lima iv is dead he met his end some days ago at the hands of chancellor desaix
what youre saying it was regicide
i fear so it seems desaix sold zofia to the rigelian empire along with his soul no doubt they promised him lands perhaps even a title upon limas death the chancellor and the rigelian army seized zofia castle and began to visit unspeakable injustices upon the kings people sir clive—of the knights of zofia you mentioned—would have none of it he formed an army to free us from rigel and named it the deliverance however we are outmatched and fast losing this war we need a heros aid and so i have come to the home of one of zofias greatest heroes sir mycen
do you see alm sir clive would not have sent me were it not urgent will you take me to see your grandfather
y yes of course
good goblets  i knew zofia was in hot water but is this guy serious
so theres going to be a war
there already is one from the sound of things
but thats  thats awful if sir mycen rides off to war whatll happen to alm
you got me
sigh
lukas were you able to speak with my grandfather what did he say
he said no sir mycen made it clear he has no intention of joining the deliverance
what but hes ridiculously strong he could defeat some stuffy chancellor with his eyes closed why would he refuse when so many people are suffering
i cannot speak to sir mycens thinking but it seems we misplaced our hopes ill have to return to our hideout and bring sir clive the ill news perhaps mycen has simply grown too old for the battlefield
  
it was good meeting you alm i must be on my way thank you again for your assistance
hes not old  hes tougher than men half his age
lukas wait
alm what is it
ill go ill join the deliverance
you
alm what the hell you cant do that  wait can he do that
ill admit you fight like a beast and theyd be lucky to have your sword but this isnt sparring with your gramps alm youre volunteering to go to war
i know what it is and if grandfather wont do it then ill do it for him consider my sword as his
alm i understand how you feel but—
sir mycen has been teaching me to use a blade since i was a boy ive received tutelage in military tactics medicine weather terrain  i know as much about war as any man who has never seen one can let me fight for you with my grandfathers gifts ill prove hes no cowardly old man hes a warrior who trains warriors
hmm  that might just work
huh then you mean 
oh come on you cant be serious
why not alm presents a good case he has a heros blood in him  and clearly a heros fire his presence is sure to raise the troops morale and for my part im curious to see what a self proclaimed warrior can do especially now that hell be doing it for the deliverance
thank you lukas  you wont regret this
ive seen a lot of cake taking in my day but this really takes the cake
alm you should back out of this its far too dangerous if anything were to happen to you id  i mean  just dont do it okay
im sorry faye but ive made up my mind but maybe all of you could come with me
er what
splendid idea maybe we could all get impaled on the same lance
im just saying we could do it together  fighting i mean not the lance grandfather trained all of us right not just me you already know how to use a sword and a bow so whats the problem
alm are you insane we were sparring with wooden fences and tree trunks they dont hit back
oh sod it all im not as bright as id like to think i am so uh count me in
gray not you too
me too tobi poo its better than waiting for rigel to reach ram and kill slash enslave us might as well bring the fight to them
but youre gonna— i mean once they— in frustration  ugggh
you have my thanks gray and the deliverance welcomes you in the end we need every able fighter we can get there will be much to learn but i can teach you a great deal in battle and youll be given a proper wage of course
wait you mean we get paid as in actual money
of course our soldiers work hard and sacrifice much we would be remiss not to offer compensation
ive got little brothers and sisters who could use that gold  ma and pa struggle to make ends meet but if theres a way to help  hmm 
tobin you dont have to go if you dont want to why dont you all take a little time to think about it lets split up for now and meet back here later i need to go thank my grandfather and say good bye
grandfather im home do you have a minute theres something i need to speak with you about  noticing that nobody is responding  grandfather hmm where is he grandfather  grandfather
 ah there he is alm over here
tobin does this mean youre coming with us
sure am i could tell ma and pa were worried but i think theyll understand listen everyone try not to be amazed when i show alm up on the battlefield
you know they dont pay extra for that right moneybags
theres nothing wrong with fighting for coin many people do we dont have any rule stating ones reasons must be noble now then alm were you able to say good bye to your grandfather
i tried but i couldnt find him
well that is vexing i suppose we could tarry here a bit longer if you—
its all right lets go
oh are you certain
i can write him a letter come on we cant wait forever
so be it ill defer to your judgment
alm are you sure about this
am i sure about what
not saying good bye to your grandfather my ma and pa have all my brothers and sisters to look after them i mean sure theyll miss me— or i hope they will at any rate— but family will help them get by you know but all sir mycen has for kin is you and all you have is him
i know but considering hes never let me take one step outside the village i doubt i could have talked him into letting me join an army not that it would have changed things either way—i have to go not just to prove him as a teacher but to prove myself to me
well youve always wanted to put ram behind you right this is your big chance your first adventure writ large well call it alms epoch or maybe  the tale of gray  plus that one guy
heh i dont think so although i admit there might be a little something to what youre saying its almost as if i feel someone calling out to me
 so you really have gone crazy then welp its been nice knowin ya
heh look i know how it sounds but its the truth
do you think its celica
what celica where the heck did that come from
oh please you two were inseparable while she was here you barely made any time for us
i guess thats true 
maybe it is her celica are you the one whos been calling me i know that youre out there  i just dont know where but i can feel it i hope this journey will bring us together again 
first we should make for the southern outpost desaixs men hold it for now but my fellow in the deliverance have been fighting to reclaim it the deliverance hideout lies beyond the outpost wed best prepare ourselves for a long journey
well if it isnt alm you all finished with todays training i still remember when you were only this tall and now look at you sir mycen has certainly made a strong young man out of you i say sir mycen but the story is your grandfather was once a famous general general mycen ha i always wondered why such a fellow would end up here then again the woods around ram have become dangerous as of late perhaps its for the best that we have him—and you—to keep us safe
sigh what i wouldnt give for some food its been years since weve had a proper harvest cant grow much without rain  why has mila forsaken us whats happened to the earth mother shes killing us by withholding her blessings the rigelian empire will seize our lands and well be too weak to resist  youve heard how well trained their soldiers are havent you weve never toiled or fought for a thing and were about to pay for it 
its good to know our plight has the nobility so grief stricken king lima dances at the end of chancellor desaixs puppet strings the king would rather eat grapes and frolic in a seraglio than actually rule its no wonder the kingdoms being torn apart by rebellion after rebellion i wish someone would come along and save us from ourselves already  whats that the mother mila pah like id waste my prayers on a goddess as useless as her
alm hey this fellows here to see sir mycen he was just about to tell us more
sorry pal but i still cant trust a man in full armor keep one hand on your hilt while you talk to this guy yeah
a knight—can you believe it whats he doing in our village youd have to practically ride off the edge of the map to find this place
hes sure come a long way just to find a whole lot of nothing  whatever hes here for i hope he hasnt brought any trouble with him
alm how was sword practice everything go okay sir mycen is far too hard on you  i hope you dont have any new bruises
take all the time you need alm you should pay your respects to sir mycen
i heard what the knight said but it sounds like a load of horse plop to me everyone knows its zofias fault that rigel invaded in the first place king lima refused to help the rigelian empire during their famine remember and we all know the emperor didnt take too kindly to that little slight such a shame the kingdom and the empire had been getting along so well the king may be dead but his choices live on aint that always the way of it
my word can you believe it the king—murdered what do you suppose happens now he has no heirs you know not anymore i mean they say chancellor desaix himself murdered all of em in cold blood anyway hope this deliverance knows who theyll be delivering to that throne
alm is it true youre leaving the village youll be sorely missed just be careful hear the woods outside ram are dangerous enough  but once youre through them youll hit fleecers forest the place is crawling with brigands no one gets through that wood alive 
ram village used to be known across the kingdom for its magnificent wine but alas its been ages since anyone made a new batch valentias fanciest nobles would send orders for ram wine from far and wide if there are any bottles left theyre like to be aged to perfection by now a wine that mature would taste absolutely incredible id give anything for one more glass before mother mila calls me home 
what i wouldnt give for a bottle— no even just a glass of ram wine
this aroma berry  leather  straw this is ram wine for true thank you youve made an old man very happy this day so you have  here i was saving this to go with the wine but i want you to have it
oh the callow rudeness of youth you whippersnappers have no manners
as a little thank you let me share some news i heard if you follow the left hand wall in the thieves shrine youll find a tunnel hidden back there is a treasure chest— but also check the jars around it one of them contains a secret bauble i hid there when i was young if its still there and you can find it its all yours
thank you again for bringing me that ram wine
i was accosted on the way back from the capital the other day i ran from those brigands until my sides were ready to split so undignified and while im happy to be alive those thugs stole everything i bought oh i never should have gone at all you must go teach those ruffians some manners ill make it worth your while they should really feel it so make sure to give 20 of them a sound thrashing that will teach them to mess with the likes of me hmph theyre holed up in the awful thieves shrine as if theyd be anywhere else
get going already those 20 brigands arent going to thrash themselves
ooo you look like someone who has just made 20 brigands lives miserable i feel so much better already who knew revenge was so great well i told you i would make it worth your while so here you go
i hope i can call on you again if more brigands decide to mug me
you know i guess i dont mind going along the deliverance is fighting all across zofia right well ive always wanted to see the world and nows my chance  all i have to do is not get killed easy right
fine have it your way not like i was itching to leave anyway
huh now you want me to come with you after all make up your mind
im coming too im staying with you no matter what end of discussion
you  dont want me oh i  i see then i guess ill stay here and just be  sad  forever  but youd better come back safe you hear me
oh yes does this mean i can come with you pleeeeeease
oy travelers fraid im gonna have to ask ya to stop right there these here woods belong to me and my boys see so if ya wanna be passin through yer gonna have to pay the toll ha ha
well that didnt take long
gasps brigands already but its only been minutes—were still within sight of the gates
worse surprises than this await us alm is everyone ready
yes come on lets clear this rabble out
follow me ill clear us a path
alm if i may you mustnt rush headlong into battles on your own without experience your friends will never grow into accomplished fighters trust them give them something to do  at least let them deal the final blow
right thats good advice ill give it a try
yes we won
that was some fine swordsmanship alm i can see you have more than a bit of your grandfather in you
you think so
hm hold everyone
what is it lukas
hrrm 
more brigands it seems the rumors were no exaggeration
based on their numbers i surmise they must have a hideout nearby but we can ill afford to pick fights with every cutpurse and rogue we encounter lets sit back and lay low until they depart
didja get a look at the wench we nabbed this morning hoo ee
shell certainly add some color to that run down old shrine gar har har
gar har har shes prettiern the boss thats for sure
what theyve taken a prisoner
lukas alm lets just be calm and  alm alm wait dont—
hold it you lecherous pigs
huh who the hell are you
release the woman youre holding at once or else
bwa ha ha or else what
ya must really want a knife in the belly if yer slingin taunts at the likes of us
so much for laying low  to arms everyone
look over there they have an archer he can strike from a distance so we must plan our approach carefully whoever goes after him needs to finish him quickly or be ready for a reprisal if youre not strong enough to take an arrow or two stay well away
sigh well i suppose that counts as our good deed for the day
sorry lukas my legs were moving before i had the chance to even think
valor is nothing to be sorry for now come lets find this prisoner they spoke of they mentioned a shrine yes it must be nearby
whats that shrine
oh yeah guess you wouldnt know since youve been stuck in the village shrines like this were built by folks so they had a place to worship mila but famine and other problems kinda put a damper on most zofians piety now theyre mostly just home to brigands and the like
then the woman who was taken captive must be inside 
eek stay away from me im only the stupid watchman i just watch things eeeek
the enemy could be anywhere we need to proceed carefully
the dank smell of mold permeates the shrine
huh what do you scrawny little rats want you got nerve bargin in here just as i was gettin to the main event kill em boys  and be creative about it
urgh who do you think you are saving one wench wont make this world any less of a pit
argh damn you 
miss are you all right say something
nnngh  wh who are you how did i get here
youre in a shrine some brigands kidnapped you and took you here dont worry theyre gone we dealt with them before they could do you any harm
i see thank you sir after those ruffians seized me i passed out  ugh  i dont want to think about it
whats your name
i am silque i hail from a priory far to the east on the island of novis
so uh silque  what brings a woman of the cloth like you so far from home
gasp my mission i nearly forgot i must find a man named sir mycen are we far from ram village
are you serious rams our home sir mycen is my grandfather
what youre sir mycens grandson    may i see that mark on your left hand
what this sure pretty strange for a birthmark huh and thats not even the weirdest part a long time ago a girl in my village had the same mark on her hand
so youre the one sh—
huh what is it silque
sir alm i have something for you here please take this
all right but what is it
its called milas turnwheel its a relic that contains some of the earth mothers power i believe it will be of great use to you
are you sure you were supposed to give this to my grandfather right
no this is definitely for you now that you have left your village and embarked upon an auspicious journey the turnwheel will become a vital tool during the trials ahead
okay  well thank you i promise to take good care of it by the way how do you use it
you dont use it it uses you when the time is right the turnwheel will give you a sign
o kay im not sure i understand but ill take your wor—
ah it appears that mother mila already wishes to show you something
the turnwheel  its glowing  whats happening
where am i  thats zofia castle this is our kingdom what happened here is the deliverance too late
aaaaah
sir alm what did you see
it was  it was so clear silque it was horrible
be calm what you saw in the vision is not the present the mother is either telling you what could be or what once was her power is sight
so the vision is something thats going to happen
something that could happen if the vision was ill boding perhaps it was a sign—a sign that the mother wishes for you to take action in order to prevent it
   distressed breathing
ah sir alm in my travels i have witnessed the sorry state of our kingdom with no goddess to bless them and no king to rule most zofians are at a loss and i for one refuse to stand by and watch them suffer i would ask for permission to accompany you on your quest
very well that was not the answer i was hoping for but i shall respect your decision
yes do you require my assistance
welcome child of fate i am a servant of mila present to me those who are worthy by my masters will shall i bestow upon them new power
hmm alm look up there
huh that uniform 
  
that looks like a zofian soldier is he one of desaixs men
yes well see more of them now that were nearing the southern outpost it seems desaixs men have hired brigands to hold the valley for them this will be a tricky fight
 im ready
take a closer look at that soldier hes armed with a leather shield itll be difficult to land blows on him we could take the shield for ourselves  if we manage to defeat him
the valleys clear  still that wasnt easy
you have my thanks well soon reach the southern outpost which is under deliverance control once weve rejoined our comrades the fights ahead will become easier
comrades huh i wonder what theyre like im excited to meet them
ngh  s sir lukas its good to see you made it back safely
i recognize you you were stationed at the outpost has something happened why are you here
forgive us sir lukas but  the tides turned after you left and we were forced to abandon the outpost im afraid lady clair was taken captive desaixs men hold her there even now
what clair gods how could this happen
lukas 
this is my fault lady clair is new to military command i should have left her in more experienced hands
dont blame yourself lukas sir clive sent you to ram village right you didnt have a choice if blame lies with anyone its him
  
regardless standing here accomplishes nothing we need a plan i assume this clair person is still alive right in that case we just have to take back the southern outpost and save her
oh hey thats a great id— wait what no how are we supposed to reclaim a fortress from trained royal soldiers
i dont know but we have to find a way otherwise our journey is already over here and now we make our decision will we live our lives as simple villagers  or will we fight on as soldiers of the deliverance
but alm 
okay good speech hear hear  whatve we got to lose lets do it
gray
tobin  listen just stop and think about this i know its hard but try clair is a girl and if we save a girl  eh you follow
i cant believe youre the same man who mocks the fact that i fight for gold
yes because its gold this is girls dont you like girls
i mean i admit theyre not bad
you see we speak the same language so youre in right
i dont know what to say  except thank you youre very brave to do this the deliverance is lucky to have you
same goes for you lukas
one thing alm  you may be right that some of the blame lies with sir clive  but please tread soft with him regardless lady clair is his younger sister im sure no ones head is hanging lower than his own right now
oh lukas i  im sorry youre right
who goes there  more rebels ha havent you dogs learned your lesson yet
were not rebels  were the deliverance everyone with me
watch out that archer is carrying a powerful bow we should only send in capable—and cautious—units to deal with him
we did it the outpost is ours
thank you my brave friends thank you for everything i know that my fallen comrades would say the same
oh lukas im so sorry but well have time to mourn later right now we must find lady clair she must be somewhere inside the outpost
clair
lukas you came to rescue me why how simply gallant of you  now extricate me from this filthy and unseemly cage at once
you simply must remove me from this rat infested hellhole at once
that should do it
you there the boy will offer a lady his hand
who me  oh uh sorry
very good i say it does feel good to move about again i thought i might never emerge from that disgusting pigsty you have my thanks er 
this is alm he recently joined us in the deliverance
oh well how simply lovely welcome i am clair they young man may address me as lady clair or milady
um  its a pleasure to meet you milady
so from where do you hail alm
uh i hail from a little place called ram village
a village you dont say thats one of those places with all the cows and the barns and the fields yes
um yeah something like that
my word i hardly ever speak with villagers what is it like to chase cows every day i wager they bite the nasty creatures hmm  and yet you arent smothered in manure this is not what i pictured
right um 
clair perhaps you should consider alms feelings in regards to his home
his  huh oh dear have i done it again its as clive constantly reminds me the deliverance is not like the knights of zofia not every soldier in our ranks is noble but we must treat them all as equals the peasant must forgive his lady for this gauche breach of etiquette
its all right the peasant—whose name is alm—will get over it
oh alm i can see you are truly kind might i ask you more about your village later im ever so curious
of course
splendid ive always wanted to know more about cows and pigs and such
yes theyre theyre amazing creatures 
woof shes going to be a handful
yeah i uh  cough thats what im hoping
hmm 
hey what are you schemin
wh what nothing
uh huh 
thank you for freeing us i thought my time had come youre new to the deliverance right then youll want to hear this they say mother mila has disappeared from her temple thats why rigel was able to break the divine accord which was supposed to prevent them from ever invading zofia i dont know how much of its true but its disturbing nonetheless
clair youre safe
oh good day fernand and what brings you here
need you even ask when i heard you had been taken prisoner i mounted my finest destrier and sped here at once sir clive couldnt leave the hideout without its commander of course but i see i am a step behind regardless who is this rabble
um are you talking about us
they are not rabble fernand this boy is alm he is the grandson of sir mycen himself
mycens grandson lukas i demand to know the meaning of this you were ordered to find the general himself not some mewling child
sadly sir mycen was not so easily convinced however alm and his friends have joined our cause in his stead
is this some manner of folly to you lukas am i to be amused such baseborn curs cannot possibly aid our cause the deliverance has no place for brats with pitchforks
fernand you must listen to reason these curs you so easily disparage fought valiantly for us in fact without alm we might not have retaken the southern outpost i can vouch for their strength
hah as if the word of a backwater noble carries weight with me your entire house should be kissing the knights of zofias feet
ngh 
i think thats enough you can say whatever nasty things about me you like ill get over it but lukas deserves your respect
i beg your pardon do i look like a man who listens to the opinions of peasants
then you can listen to me because i happen to agree with him fernand my brother already explained this to you did he not
sir clive what exactly did he explain
a soldiers worth is not determined by the station of his birth if we do not all fight together as one then we will never defeat desaix those are wise words unforgettable words desaixs forces already have us at hell yet you would splinter us further
rrr  you there boy
 thats me i take it
out of respect for sir clive i will permit you to join the deliverance but you will learn your place now clair seeing as you are safe you have no need for these people come let us return we must report this matter to sir clive at once
i will do no such thing im going with alm
 very well do as you please
 wow what a jerk ive never met someone so rude
i guess weve been spoiled by lukas hed nearly convinced me that swinish knights are the exception not the rule but that was a swine all right snort pig noises
you poor dears must be so upset i apologize for the way he treated you
dont be silly you dont have to lower yourself for a miserable human being like that
oh my 
oh great here we go 
what i have no idea what youre talkin about
well regardless please dont think ill of fernand he wasnt always like this the world changed him
did something happen to him
  
we live in trying times and some things that transpire are  difficult to put into words in any case we should be on our way
well fought everyone the deliverances hideout is just a stones throw away now ill send a messenger ahead to inform sir clive of our arrival let us make haste im sure hell be quite eager to meet you
alm where are you going my brother will be most eager to meet you at the hideout i insist we go
not so fast where do ya think yer goin dont yknow whose halls these is
huh but i thought this was the  
thats enough python theres no call to play at trickery with our new recruits
ha ha ha heh lukas you ginger stud you still draw breath i was worried desaixs dogs might have punched your ticket to the boneyard so this sack of guts here must be sir grandson
yes hes the one is sir clive about
yup better shake your tail feathers   hes been waiting for you
oh hey kid i almost forgot
hm what is it
terrors roam these halls youd best tread carefully
terrors what are monsters like those doing in your hideout
well to be fair they technically got here first were just sort of borrowing their catacombs plus terrors spawn in greater numbers the closer you get to milas power cutting em down only makes room for new ones so we just let em be why the long face stud dont think you can handle a few creepie crawlies cause if not i dunno how youre planning to fight for the deliverance aw im just japin ya get going yeah oh and hold your nose  terrors stink
great  their hideout is guarded by an army of the dead 
go on sir clives in the chamber waaay in the back
these sprawling catacombs were built as a resting place for zofias most distinguished families but now their halls are clogged with the stench of the dead  rotten corpses who have risen again as terrors
clair
brother
it gladdens me to see you safe i couldnt bear to lose you on top of everything else we have sacrificed
you look so pale clive forgive me you must have been worried sick but im all right alm and the others arrived before true ill could befall me
and you must be alm ive been looking forward to this meeting
y yes sir
ha ha ha please be at ease such formalities are not required here you saved the life of my dear sister this makes you a friend my name is clive and as you must already know i lead the deliverance its good to meet you alm
l likewise clive
i cant believe it thats the clive in the flesh and everything
what is he famous or something
tobin i am sorely disappointed in you sir clive captains the knights of zofia hes the finest knight in all the realm seriously man read a book
okay okay hes clearly a big deal but then why is the finest knight in all the realm losing the war
well hes obviously  i mean he  shut up tobin
how have we been faring clive
not well i fear we lost many good men when the outpost fell  too many the morale of our troops has taken an ill turn in kind i was hoping to present sir mycen to them to re ignite their courage but 
please dont judge my grandfather i know he had his reasons even if i dont know what they are but i promise you that ill fight every bit as hard as he would have  or harder i just dont want you to think that  i mean hes not  
peace alm i understand  none here would dare think your grandfather craven that being said i would beg a boon of you the same one i was hoping to ask of sir mycen in fact
please go on if its within my power ill do it
then i shall state it plain i would like you to become the new leader of the deliverance
whaaat i mean um what im not a leader
clive have you taken leave of your senses
this needs to happen fernand you know it as well as i its true the deliverance began as a group of like minded zofian knights but its grown into an army where most of our volunteers are of common birth we share a cause but little else i know not how to speak to their hearts sir mycen began as a common soldier before rising to a knight and a count his story resonates with these people do you not agree that his grandson is just the banner they would rally to
what fool would agree with that if some ungrateful peasant wont heed your command you sweep him aside
think fernand are we so flush with soldiers that we can afford to drive able men away
ngh 
i for one think its a fine idea
you too 
knights dont have a monopoly on skill and alm is as able a fighter as any clive has done all he can to hold the deliverance together thus far but if our ship is astray then we must chart a new course alm is that course
ill rip that traitorous tongue from your throat
then youll finally have the truth in your grasp i lost friends at the southern outpost veteran men yet dead all the same we must adapt so we might end this war as quickly as possible
please just hold on a second i know i said i would do anything in my power but i cant  
i understand what you can and cannot do alm my lieutenants and i would continue to handle day to day affairs we only need you to do one thing lead you would be inspiring the troops and revitalizing the army you are sir mycens grandson i know you to be capable of such
im not so sure 
please alm for me for all of us my brother tries to hide it but i know the anxiety takes its toll on him you can relieve him of at least a portion of that burden
i want to but     all right if you think me worthy then i wont let you down
are you certain then thank you alm thank you
just please keep your expectations low
ha as you wish
this could change everything  the boy will make a splendid leader simply splendid
without a doubt
ive heard enough of this idiocy
fernand what  
i only joined this army because you were leading it and now you want me to take orders from some wretched farmchild
this is no mere farmchild fernand he has sir mycens blood
mycen pah damn him and his blood they may sing of him as a hero but no one even knows what wench the man sprang from his entire story is a disgrace to the zofian nobility you need to invoke the name of that old man to control your men pathetic
enough
i lost my taste for this long ago we were supposed to be a band of noble knights united in purpose upholding a tradition restoring the old order to zofia now the deliverance is full of baseborn serfs trying to lord over us like your lieutenant forsyth or that python  true to his name he is
both of them have proven themselves on the battlefield time and again are you suggesting i deny my men fair reward for their achievements what incentive would they have then the damned army wouldnt function hear me fernand hear me well i know you have your reasons for closing your heart to the common folk but please for the sake of our ideals you must think beyond them
no clive i will not i would rather die than kneel to some whelp who was birthed in the hay today we part ways for good and all i am finished with you and your deliverance farewell
fernand wait  
clive shouldnt you go after him
 no i knew this was coming  weve had no shortage of clashes lately i cannot force him to see things as i do so  well perhaps its better this way
clive  i know its not much in the way of comfort but ill do my best
thank you alm we shall march on zofia castle just as soon as you feel we are prepared i suppose you must still have many questions about the deliverance feel free to ask around to any of the soldiers here
weve received word that emperor rudolfs nephew is visiting zofia castle not only is the lad a general but hes also first in line for the rigelian throne thats due to the emperor not having children of his own you see anyway hes said to be tough as nails i sure hope i dont have to face him
sir clives lover lady mathilda used to fight by his side in the knights of zofia she was every inch as strong as him and clever as an old cat to boot but desaix took her captive and now keeps her locked up in his fortress hes made many attempts to use her as leverage to force our surrender but still sir clive refuses to submit one desaix will tire of these games and then shell be in peril most dire  knowing this sir clive grows less bold as the days pass who can blame him
fernands hatred for commoners is understandable the peasants living on his lands were starving cause of the drought they blamed fernand for not providing for them and stormed his manor his family died during the attack  truly a terrible thing
greetings friends the deliverance welcomes you i am forsyth sir clives lieutenant and advisor together let us take back the castle and return zofia to her people
sorry did you say no ah i i see well then s so be it i shall stay here and stand watch over the hideout with honor and um 
yes have you reconsidered it would gladden me to join you
heading off are we well take care dont let the terrors bite  eh am i coming with you well i could but i dont have to  howzabout i just let you decide
hey its your deal pal good luck cause youll need it
what whaaaaaat if you want me to come just say so youre making this so awkward
onward to zofia castle we must wrest the castle from the chancellors grasp lead us well alm
ill do my best
ah hah hah i wonder who built this throne it is marvelously comfortable why did i let it be wasted on that incompetent fool lima for so long soon the rigelian empire will finish its conquest of valentia and then i will rule from this throne as king of zofia but first i must crush those worms in the rebel army and worms they are  you squash the blasted things into the muck yet still more take their place and now they dare march on the castle they will pay for this insult in blood i must know what—or who—gave them this second wind 
forgive me chancellor desaix weve captured a rebel in the forest its lor  its fernand sir
what but fernand is clives right hand man why would he be wandering the woods without a detachment
march prisoner
unhand me i have cleansed myself of those rebel scum
whats this am i to believe you have left your precious “deliverance”
deliverance  pah
yes well it seems you have a story to tell my ears are yours sir fernand
 what mycens grandson
indeed clive has thrown all of our ideals at the feet of the unworthy hes made the boy a figurehead just to leverage some decrepit heros name well i say damn them all there you have my story now kill me and be done with it
but this doesnt make sense mycen didnt have any  ah  now i see this for what it is rudolf you villainous dastard 
huh
silence when i address you youll know it  i have decided your fate fernand killing you would be wasteful come with me i will introduce you to your new master a master more befitting of your ideals
new master wait—explain yourself
zofia castle  were finally here
thanks to you alm you should hold your head high as you command us on this great day
it will be a great day wont it fellow soldiers fight with me today zofias people reclaim her castle and her pride
so this is the so called deliverance what a disheveled herd of clodhoppers
i couldnt agree more find a comfortable seat lord berkut the empires finest general need not trouble himself with such rabble you may watch from on high as my finest troops cut them down like wheat
i may just take you up on that offer shall we rinea
i have no desire to see such bloodshed war is horrible and i will make no spectacle of it
heh heh i jest my dear
forgive me i must take my leave
yes of course i trust the dracoshield i lent will add to your already considerable strength
it is a fine gift my lord you honor me
sigh you knight fernand was it
yes my lord
you said the name of the deliverances new leader is “alm” correct and that he is of common birth there is no mistake in this
none my lord clive and the other fools believe he is mycens grandson 
hmph what nonsense one is born either noble or common this destiny cannot be changed has a sheep any hope of leading wolves no
gasp yes yes exactly truer words were never spoken lord berkut
still i am surprised at sir clive tales of his exploits have spread as far as rigel  how could so celebrated a leader make so amateur a mistake the deliverance has no future now all of zofia will soon belong to the empire  rinea
yes lord berkut
i have a promise to make you my dear i will succeed his majesty rudolf and become the next emperor i shall rule over the valentian continent as i was meant to and you shall be my empress does this please you
i do not have words 
 it has begun i pray this alm fellow makes the battle at least halfway entertaining
hear me worms of the rebel army you have done well to make it this far  but you have no hope of defeating me  now slayde take the cavalry and run down every last one of those wretches
whats this slayde has been defeated damned rebels will rue this day i must withdraw the rest of you are ordered to hold the castle at all costs
rebel scum  you cant hope to touch me so long as i have the dracoshield lord berkut gave me i am invincible
urgh n no  w wait  you have the wrong 
i recognize you  youre those bumpkin brats from the village in ram woods
huh  this is the knight who tried to kidnap celica
you whelps deprived me of a prize i most desperately needed hear me well runts my name is slayde  and today i in turn shall deprive you of your lives
i  impossible this is neither the time nor place for me to die 
d dont think you can gloat yet  you thought you defeated desaix ha that was just a double the true chancellor has retreated to his fortress and now its my turn ive no intention of dying here with you maggots
pathetic the chancellor is all talk
what shall we do now my lord
we cannot hold the castle with my detachment alone we must retreat fernand you stay with me well join up with our main force in the forest
yes my lord
 you have made an impression alm yes you have
desaixs forces are retreating 
you mean we won
yes alm we won zofia castle can finally return to the hands of her own people
we really did it  we did it we freed zofia
hee hee the boy from ram shall kiss my hand and thank me for securing this victory ha ha ha a jest only i assure you you were wonderful alm this victory proves you have what it takes to lead us
this victory wasnt mine alone i share this glory with all of you
sure but hold on a second before we start throwing roses around desaix and slayde both got away remember
tobin you sure know how to take a squat on someones big moment forget who got away theres still plenty of reason to celebrate
gray is correct true it is deeply regrettable those two snakes managed to elude us but regardless we have retaken the castle—the symbol of her kingdom was this not the deliverances primary goal
indeed it was i know this war will continue as long as the empire desires zofia  but this victory is a sweet chalice and right now we should drink deep
clive couldnt have said it better we fought for this we earned it now lets take a moment to enjoy it
so then shall we go inside our friends in the castle will be most eager to meet their deliverer
deliverer come on you make me sound like some kind of hero or someth— hey wait
huzzah for the deliverance thanks to you the castle is finally rid of those imperial dastards oh what a joy to watch them run  were finally free you have my heartfelt thanks truly
the chancellor retreated to his fortress west of the northern forest hell be beggin rigel for help now so he will what a piece of filth leavin his men behind to die in his stead 
they say all of king limas children are dead now so they do oh but ive heard tale that one of em still lives  her name was anthiese princess anthiese juicy bita gossip that eh story goes the villa she lived in was set to blaze some ten or so years back folks thought she burned to cinders but you know how tongues like to wag could be some brave soul up and saved her wonder where she ended up if so
princess anthiese had a brother from a different mum but they were still close after that fire at the villa however neither body was found i often dream that at least the princess managed to escape somehow 
that mongrel desaix stole the royal sword when he turned tail and ran the rigelian imperial household gave us that sword as a sign of friendship i dont know what use desaix has for it oh its a powerful sword and no lie  but only in the hands of the right wielder and that wielder isnt him
the ridersbane here in the vault makes short work of mounted soldiers but as its a lance only knights and similar classes can wield it
general mycen was a magificent man but king lima never did like him of course he never liked much of anything besides his wine and women i wager desaix looked upon the general as an obstacle of sorts too because after he murdered the kings children he pinned it on sir mycen youd have been daft to believe such a thing of course  which is precisely what the king did or perhaps he just saw it as an excuse regardless mycen was found guilty and banished hes lucky he wasnt hanged
friends may i have your attention its true we have made great strides by recapturing the castle  but chancellor desaix—the man who started all this—remains at large and the rigelian army yet lingers inside our kingdoms borders to free zofia we must find desaix slay him and drive rigel back for good alm 
yes
you are our commander now we would hear your opinion on this
oh right my opinion um  well what are our options
we could be defensive—garrison the castle and wait for rigel to come to us or we could take the fight to them the choice is yours
i see    you know until recently id never set foot outside of ram village this war has been my first glimpse of the kingdom i live in unfortunately ive also seen what its been reduced to needless to say its far worse than id heard people are suffering even dying but this war no matter how terrible has also taught me something it taught me that when we stand up and fight we help those people i dont want to stop helping them now i want to press on and make as much of a difference as i can i know this probably sounds empty maybe even mad but i think we should keep fighting until weve taken back all of zofia so then will you stand with me will you stand and fight
heh 
what kind of question is that of course we will silly boy
then it seems the matter is settled the deliverance shall march we will put desaix down and scatter the rigelian army to the four winds
wow  that gave me goosebumps not bad alm not bad
were you even listening to a thing he said your goosebump giver just declared war on the whole damned empire
i know but i think it was a nice spee— wait he did what no no come on this isnt war gray hes just going to kick them out
riiiight and then emperor rudolf will just send a fruit basket to apologize cmon tobin you cant be so thick that you dont see whats coming
hmm 
what stop staring at me its creepy
you knew it would come to this didnt you when you agreed to join the deliverance i mean
oh come now
youre the one who said all those years ago that alm was different from us you knew he was going to do something like this one day
ha im not a prophet tobin all i meant was that hes different
well you were on to something no matter what you meant because now were starting to see that hes much bigger than we are im proud of him but im also going to miss him
oh brother you poor kid tobin
well if it isnt the good men and women of the deliverance i was hoping id run into you please allow me to welcome you to the castle i served zofias king for many years you know if you need anything just ask
thank you thats very kind this is my first time here so ill admit to feeling a bit lost my grandfather sir mycen spoke of it on occasion but—
sir mycen the zofian general
er yes thats the one im his grandson alm he lived in this castle long ago didnt he
well yes but how very odd i knew the general quite well and he had neither wife nor child
huh
i beg your pardon good sir but that simply cannot be the case alm is most certainly related to—
no i assure you general mycen told me himself “i have no family” he said clear as day it was
but wait  if im not 
pay him no mind alm the old mans probably just confused is all it was a long time ago
y yes  that must be it 
  
commander alm youre just in time please proceed up these steps a visitor is waiting for you up on the balcony
a visitor who is it
im afraid i cannot say go on and see for yourself
all right then 
please proceed up these steps a visitor is waiting for you up on the balcony
its good to see you boy
grandfather what are you doing here
heh i have my reasons look how far youve come alm youre a man grown now youve been through quite a bit since leaving the village havent you
i suppose but grandfather  im sorry i never said good bye or thanked you for all you did for me i still feel guilty about that but i think i made the right choice im the commander of the deliverance now and together weve already liberated the southern outpost and this castle so you see—
i didnt come here to pick apart your actions alm i came here to ask you a single question are you ready
am i ready
indeed for once you march on rigel you place yourself in the hands of destiny you wont be able to stop the events that unfold no one will wish you well many will even try to stop you unexpected tragedy is sure to follow that is the price of what you are about to undertake
  
so i ask again are you ready to take the lives of others into your hands are you ready to shoulder all of their burdens their desires and are you ready to fight and bleed until zofia and all of valentia is saved
i am i know i may be in over my head and i still have much to learn but when i say i will fight for my kingdom i will fight for my kingdom no one will stop me nothing will break me ill see it through to the very end
 very well ive seen that look before must run in the blood 
huh what do you mean
youll understand in time boy
say that reminds me  this old man downstairs was saying some strange things he told me—
huh whats that noise
well well  the people have gathered to get a look at their new hero you should go greet them
whoa 
burn this memory into your heart boy these are the people whose burdens you will carry the rest of the way remember what lies upon your shoulders
and so it was that zofia castle was liberated from desaixs clutches causing the zofian people to greet their new hero with raucous cheers however what alm did not and could not know was that his victory here was but the prelude to a longer—and far more bitter—conflict
i bear ill tidings emperor the rebel army has taken back zofia castle
   and what of berkut
sire lord berkut withdrew and rejoined with the main force
pathetic  pathetic a rigelian knight the emperors sworn defender scurrying away like a rat my arcanists would never have painted so sorry a picture 
hold your tongue master jedah
why should i i merely speak the truth
you said the leader of this “deliverance” is named alm correct
yes emperor he assumed command after sir clive of the knights of zofia stepped down
did he now 
/***EOF***/
rudolf dieee
alm
you took everything  everything that i ever loved you took zofia you took my friends and now celica too
please stop whats going on cant you see me stop this im begging you please
nooooooooo
alm 
hey why are they clanging that infernal bell
apparently the kings passed away  thats what nomah said at least
the king but isnt that  he was celicas 
oh dear i hope shes dealing with this okay 
youre certain i cant dissuade you from going little one
i must nomah its been years since crops last grew on zofian soil our barren fields have fallen victim to terrors the rigelians have invaded  i fear some ill must have befallen the earth mother mila i cant help but feel this is all related i know it
hmm  perhaps it is at that ill not deny that the kingdom of zofia faces her darkest hour in some time more sick and hungry come to the priorys door each day seeking aid 
the key to everything lies with mila i shall travel to her temple and learn whats become of her
yes but little one  you know well the reason mycen placed you in my care with the kings passing you are the last living member of the zofian royal line there are many who would seek to use you or even end you that threat is greater now than ever yet you would still leave knowing that
i must even if my decision betrays the care you and mycen have shown me youve done so much to keep me safe and it breaks my heart to pain you but what calls me to do this goes beyond my heart i can only ask your forgiveness nomah
keep your cries of forgiveness little one ill not give what isnt required if this is your mind i wont object follow the path before you trust in it as i in you
thank you nomah
heh of course but you must take care—the blight in zofia is worse even than you know youve uncommon talent as a warrior priestess but carelessness is fatal ah and you mustnt forget milas turnwheel
i wear it always you know that
see that you do im certain it will prove helpful on your journey
thank you nomah for everything well then i think ill be on my way
mm youre leaving this very instant surely you can stay until the bells last peal it rings to mourn your fathers passing as you know
ill never think of that man as my father now if youll excuse me 
little one 
lately novis sees boat after boat filled stern to bow with hungry refugees but alas for them this islands no better off than anywhere else were even poorer than most what with pirates seizing inbound supply ships  well soon have naught to eat but what fish the waves see fit to provide these are dark times we face 
when rigel broke the divine accord this plague of terrors fell upon us but surely their own lands must be suffering the same fate what could have driven them to invade zofia at such a price i would dearly love to know whats going through emperor rudolfs mind 
may you walk always in the light of milas blessing little one
celica i heard the news youre going to the temple of mila right if so then im going too you cant say no
heh thanks mae to be honest id welcome the help
good because im coming too im not letting the two of you off on your own
letting us heh you say that like you think you can keep us safe
i do and i can ill be more help than you at least
uh rude and wrong i can conjure lightning boey big hurty lightning whatve you got fire maybe ill call you if i want to roast marshmallows
lets just say youd both be a great help and leave it at that shall we i know ill be counting on you both this isnt going to be an easy journey still im glad ill have such good company
celica can i go with you
what no awww  i was really hoping i could help you out 
did you need something wait can i go with you now
er pardon me  excuse me might i trouble you to show me milas turnwheel for a moment
ah of course it is just as i thought ancient as it is its little wonder some of the cogs are missing while it appears to still function it has lost some of its true capability i suspect the counterpart to your turnwheel is in the same condition i cant imagine its bearer is more gentle with it than you celica if you were able to find the missing cogs i could attempt a repair a restored turnwheel would be able to turn back even more time youre curious where the cogs might be yes yes of course sadly i couldnt say thats the trouble with ancient artifacts theyre always scattering their bits at various locations around the world
ah of course forgive me for presuming
milas turnwheel is incomplete in its current state its power diminished if you could recover all of the missing cogs it could be restored surely the ability to turn back more time in battle would be most welcome
my word my stars and garters it seems all the cogs have been restored to milas turnwheel you should now be able to use it to its fullest most potential y potential whats more i can rest easy knowing that the artifact is now whole thank you for repairing this treasure allow me to give you this in recognition of your fine efforts
thank you for restoring milas turnwheel to its former glory
such poor damnable souls   me why i speak of the revenants that haunt novis cemetery of course they were once good people of the island all buried with love and care but now the worlds rotting and theyve risen as terrors to prey on the living if youve a beating heart inside you give them the rest they deserve last i looked at least twenty of the poor souls stalked the area
please grant peace to the revenants theyve suffered enough if you could free just twenty from their curse it would be a mercy
ah i can see youve laid twenty revenants to rest it is a kindness you have my thanks and youve set my own mind to peace as well ive not much but you deserve a reward for your service
ships leaving the port will get us to the mainland we should head there now though that does mean well have to pass through the cemetery on our way rumor has it there have been terrors appearing there as of late lets be ready for anything
milady this graveyard were passing through  er why are we again
because its the only way to port
yes but theres been talk of terrors around here as of late 
so there has best keep our wits about us then hmm
but milady i  ill face down thieves or rogues any day but terrors terrors are different
oh boey how can you be so scared of spooks and spirits at your age
shove off would you a man cant help what gives him fright
ha ha
oh not you too milady you wound me 
im sorry boey i was just remembering my brother
brother i didnt realize you had one
yes though by different mothers he was a sweet thing but meek frightened to death of ghosts then he became one alas and much too young  were he alive you two would have been quite alike im sure
milady i 
way to go boey your whinings gone and dredged up a bunch of sad memories for celica
what why is this my fault
uhh because its always your fault now suck it up and get ready to fry some foes—terrors or otherwise
terrain bears no influence on magic i remember sir mycen saying so listen close friends do not be shy about when and where you attack even if our foes cower in the woods our spells will find their mark
um excuse me but—
ah lady priestess welcome something i can help you with today
i need to book passage to zofia harbor
hrm  im afraid thats a difficult wish to grant even for you priestess this patch of sea is teeming with pirates of late its just too dangerous
oh thats no good 
that being said if milady were to do something about those pirates  well thatd be a different matter altogether now wouldnt it
you want me to fight pirates
theyve grown bolder by the day so they have and yet his highness hasnt seen fit to send so much as a single man  this seas our love and livelihood we cant live cut off from her ah whats happened to zofia
hmm 
forgive me milady but i cant get you across the sea so long as pirates sail it i know i ask much of you priestess but if you would lend us your strength 
hmm  what are we supposed to do now
i cant believe that old timer tossed his pirate problem right at our feet do we look like the type to fight pirates were delicate little blossoms
speak for yourself
regardless the man is right well not get anywhere until ships are free to sail again
what do you propose milady
lets gather what help we can find the sea is only the start zofia is at war and ravaged by terrors besides well not make it very far traveling alone we need allies strong ones
yes and mad enough to set sail into pirate infested waters with us  im sure theyll just be lining up to take the job
no ships can sail so long as pirates stalk these waters if you feel the dangers too great alone perhaps you might court additional aid
you lost little lass this aint a place for children
youre saber yes
yep whore you girl
my name is celica the people here speak quite highly of your skill with a blade id like to enlist your services as a protector 
guard duty eh you headed somewhere or is this a local deal
we seek the temple of mila
thats awfully far  and i suppose youve already heard about our little pirate problem
its the reason i seek your aid in fact unless you think a few mere pirates are too much for you to handle
oh thats real cute believe me lass i aint worried about a couple sea rats all im worried about is if you can pay i dont work charity cases especially when im risking my own neck
im afraid i havent much money but i do have this
a dagger whistle well aint you fancy
will this be sufficient for your services
you mean will i risk life and limb for a single dagger ordinarily no but since i like your moxie im gonna go ahead and give you a break you got a deal ill get you to your temple
wonderful you have my thanks saber mae boey did you hear that hes going to come with us
heh this jobs got easy money written all over it what kind of fool hands over treasure like this without batting an eye she really must be daddys spoiled little lass 
ah lady priestess youve returned
i have and this gentleman saber has agreed to aid us now may we ask you to set sail
well then id be honored to do my part milady come aboard well depart as soon as youre ready
good day milady are you thinking of leaving for zofia perchance if so i fear you may be in for some disappointment ships arent sailing or so im told too many pirates about still probably best you went to the docks and asked the captain yourself
he may smell like a tavern floor but that sabers a skilled sellsword if you ever find yourself in need of steel you could do far worse than him though if that steel needs a history fit for retelling in polite company well  hes strong though ill give him that and i suppose passably handsome
theres a shrine on a small island up ahead you know its vault holds an otherworldly sword or so the stories go many have died for such stories though so consider this fair warning see turns out that islet is home to a terrible necrodragon eat you in a single bite it will what if the fear dont kill you first augh just the thought of it is enough to turn my hair to white
heading out to sea milady be careful out there amongst the waves a vile man named barth has named himself pirate king of these waters he sits in his island hold to the east and commits what barbary he pleases just the other day a man whod had his whole family slain set out for revenge like as not hell meet the same fate at least hell be reunited with his kin 
chancellor desaix has taken up the throne at zofia castle the villain thinks slaying a king makes you next in line  hes a right tyrant sir clive of the order of zofian knights has gathered an army to run him off but from what we hear in these parts fightings been hard and progress slow
for a while there i was obsessed with making my own tinctures id take any herbs and botanicals i could find and mash em up of all my creations the best was something i called “medicinal syrup” if you had three mana herbs on you i could whip up a batch right now
ah i see youre well stocked ill have your syrup ready to go in no time flat
well ill be here if the craving strikes you just let me know
hey cmon you dont even have three mana herbs track down three of those bad boys and then come talk to me
if you had three mana herbs i could whip you up some medicinal syrup
  
whats wrong celica feelin blue
oh its nothing its just that the last time i was on a ship was when i came to the island
hey thats right boey and i used to take little trips every now and again but never with you shame we never got to travel as a group woulda been way more fun
are you completely daft mae celica came here in hiding remember she cant just announce herself by hopping aboard a pleasure cruise
uh i know that much boey of course i do im just saying im happy were getting the chance now isnt that right celica
please stop talking before you dig a grave so deep we all go tumbling in 
ha ha its fine boey really and im happy to be travelling with you as well mae though im also anxious  what could have happened to mila will we even make it to the temple to find out and 
aaaaand
im sorry best i keep this one to myself
whaaat oh thats just mean
alm  where are you right now and what are you doing are you still living in that village with grandpapa  no i can tell youve left your home behind havent you i want to see you so badly theres so much i need to ask perhaps mila will cause our paths to cross on this journey 
are you in pain my lord duma the sight tears at my heart  but you neednt endure it much longer ive had report that the girl has left the island i will deliver her to you without fail she of the fated children  bearer of the brand 
yar not a step further ye scurvy dogs
eagh p p pirates
these waters belong to barth the pirate king as yer surely aware that means ye needs pay a toll  all yer goods and womenll do nicely
an interesting offer but i fear we must nevertheless decline the sea belongs to no one man—shes a gift to every citizen of zofia
yar who be the mouthy wench
enough with the chit chat reason and logic are wasted on sea dogs like him lets just get to business already thats what you hired me for aint it
fair enough lets go everyone
look there do you see that small island to the east thats where barths keep stands hes the pirate king of these waters unfortunately this current means well have to sail right past it itll be trouble if were seen so lets unfurl the sails and be quick about it
hold a moment if we were to deal with this barth would this stretch of ocean be safer
well yes undoubtedly—but no sane person picks a fight with a pirate king
whoa there lass i signed up for a nice easy escort job not to storm some pirate hold
mmm  i see  very well then i shall lead the charge myself you need only worry about keeping me safe
now just a—
the people of that island are suffering under the tyranny of those pirates i cant stand by knowing starving innocents are being routinely plundered
oh for the love of  look i aint sure why i have to remind you of this but youre on a mission and you cant finish it if you keep pokin your nose where it dont belong
i have no intention of wasting time on idle philanthropy saber but there are no guarantees ill ever return from this journey i would at least like to ensure peace to those who have been so kind to me is that so unreasonable
hrm  fine its your neck—go ahead and risk it on whatever fool thing ya like
thank you saber
by the mighty parrot of shanty pete what be that racket yar har ho looks like more little mice be squeakin into me keep
are you the one they call barth i order you to halt your piracy and leave these waters at once
gar har har ill do no such thing ye shrill woman no one enters the lair of the pirate king and starts squawkin orders but me
you see lass whatd i tell you about trying to reason with sea dogs
yar bold words from a fool man well ill put yer steel to the test have at em boys take the mans guts for garters but leave the wench alive ill not have a single scratch on her  ruins the sale price it do yar har ho
see what i mean
redemption is a lost cause for a man like you barth your reign as pirate king ends here
hmm  whats with the sudden shift in position
well ill be looks like another band has joined the fray
heh must be our lucky day splitting their forces in two should make barth that much easier to defeat
you know why i like you valbar because youre such an optimist from where im standing our odds look somewhere between grim and dire
what you mean because were horribly outnumbered
you two better stop gabbing like hens and start fighting like you want to live now if we can take barth out of the picture his goons should scatter  so you know what to do right boys ignore the runts and take aim for barth
i heard talk in port about a man seeking revenge on barth for killing his family  perhaps this is his crew lets advance with caution and try to aid their cause
yar ive keelhauled bigger micen you in me spit
yar yaaaaaar  i was supposed to be  the king o the seas 
whew  it looks like those men are all okay
oh ho look who the cat dragged in im valbar by the way you really saved my bacon back there and since that dastard barth is dead my family can finally rest  sniffle  er right sorry got a little emotional there for a second so hey is there anything i can do to thank you ill be honest—im not good at much besides crackin skulls but if you need skulls cracked im your man what do you say
well thats no fun but hey come see me if you change your mind
hey youre back decide you have room for me after all find a skull or three that needs bustin
im sorry what did you need  ah yes apologies but im not going anywhere without my dear valbar go talk to him if youre looking for recruits
youre going off with them old friend well theyd better make room because i go where you go no complaints about that right everybody on the same page  great
ugh now youre just being petty your beauty is going to make you a tyrant someday if you arent careful honestly i dont even have the words
oh its you again decided you need me after all
sorry but ive got a contract with valbar if you want to negotiate with me you need to go through him first
you joining up with this lot valbar interesting  well its your call—i dont have a preference either way oh but let me ask you one question do you have seraphim magic if not then youd best stay clear of the seabound shrine necrodragons are the one thing i absolutely refuse to tangle with
yeah all right i guess we part ways here then good luck
hmm what is it now you want me to come with you
sob valbar  how could you go and leave me all alone like this how do i go on without you this is on your heads all of you and im coming with you to make sure he didnt die in vain
selfish dastards try thinking of someone else for once enough just go  go already
i cant believe that damn fool valbar is dead what happens now not to be crass but we had a contract and now theres no way to collect  say any chance you lot want to hire me on
yeah i figured it was a stretch i guess this is goodbye then best of luck
wait you two are comin
well obviously i go where you go—thats the deal and i dont care who doesnt like it
and i just go wherever the money flows like wine
you jokers are a couple of real class acts you ever stop to think that maybe youre being rude to the priestess shes on a holy mission to  er a mission of  its important okay
its all right valbar—theyre welcome to come along if they like its an honor and a pleasure to have such capable company theyve both proven their skill and can be rather amusing to boot so i thank you one and all for brightening our journey
aw shucks milady  we should be the ones thanking you
my my that was some praise  i thought id give at least 50 percent  but now you get all of it
you know me ill give you as much as you pay me for
did you jokers hear anything i just said
hee hee
were sailors from rigel we is we owes you our freedom zofian pirate scum ride the sea like they owns it but whats our emperor do not a damn thing guess his precious wars all he cares about just what kinda mans he become anyway
as a boy rigels emperor rudolf was as fine a crown prince as you could desire but since ascending to the throne  well something has certainly changed still i continue to place my faith in him as must we all
youre going to the seabound shrine eh priestess oh ive heard tale of a wondrous treasure that sleeps there  but while i like a bit of coin as much as the next id urge you to reconsider for a necrodragon filled with deadly purpose is said to haunt that place steel wont even tickle its hide they say it scoffs at all but seraphim magic
theres only one of them whats going on here
laugh so youre the girl eh serving you up on a platter will earn me a swift promotion within the faith now that ive washed this place clean of pirate vermin you will come with me
are you out of your mind old man were in a hurry here and youre in our way so would you kindly get out of it
impudent child  such a glib tongue will earn you nothing but pain
heh do you honestly plan to take us on all by yourself
wait a second—is he oh no  watch out everyone hes a cantor he means to summon terrors to fight for him
he means to summon  wait what
sigh its over  thank the mother milady what was that all about that creep was talking about serving you up or some such 
i dont know boey but he was different from the others who have come after me and i fear he wont be the last so wed best be extra careful moving forward
really here we have to come here milady have you not heard of the unspeakable beast that haunts this place
we may find something of use here boey besides the whole of novis was terrified we cant very well do nothing
oh im pretty sure we can ive told you before lass—you need to stop dumping extra work on my—  hmm
nuuuoooooaaaaaaaaaaagh its here
whoa whoa whoa—hey priestess did you forget our little chat about staying clear of the seabound shrine because this is not staying clear this is the exact opposite of staying clear
im sorry did we discuss that i mustve been preoccupied  what if theres something of use here surely you would want to— ooooh i remember now youre scared of necrodragons arent you kamui how careless of me it completely slipped my mind
slipped your mind  thats it im waiting on the boat
er actually 
gyaaaeeeeeeeeeeeeeek its here
goodness what a horrifying creature but i have the seraphim spell in my quiver now may its light guide your lost soul on to slumber eternal
the damp chilly air of the cave bears the scent of the ocean theres no sign of anyone coming through here scared off by the necrodragon i imagine
i is that  yes you there please f food  anything  i beg of ya
 ahhhh many thanks now im finally startin to feel human again im a fisherman all of zofia harbor knows of me so they do but ten days ago i ran into a fearsome storm that washed me ashore here “thank mila im saved” i thought  then the necrodragon showed up i ran in here and hid but mfood stores ran out and  well you see  eh the necrodragon is dead and by yer hand well thats marvelous news i can go home now here lemme see if  this is all i have but please take it
 what really ive real questions  about yer moral compass friend 
sorry but i was thinkin something  a bit more  ya know  meaty a bit meatier more meat like  look ya gots any meat
oh didja know about this place they say this shrines also the tomb of a priestess what protected this region tales say she was given a grand burial along with her trusty blade cant say i saw anything like that here though and i walked around a fair bit did feel a breeze coming through by the well in the back though if you were thinkin to explore id tell ya to start there well im off to patch mboat and sail her back to zofia safe travels onen all
huh what you lot selling something maybe pottage spoons or holy relics well sorry to say but we aint buying nobodys home see well nobody ‘cept for one hardworking guard  handsome too might i add
 what is it if youve no business here shove off a fellow cant nap when hes crowded
greetings travellers we dont tend to get many visitors out this way know that you stand in the sacred halls of the deliverance er however it seems everyone has taken leave of the sacred halls for the moment as such it falls upon i to hold down the fort  er or the halls as it were
if its our leader you seek you should make your way to zofia castle
wait a second  silque is that you
ah sister celica fate is indeed strange that it would have us meet in this place
we havent heard from you since you left the priory on novis we were all worried sick
that was never my intent forgive me but i aim to play my part here no matter the cost and i see im not the only sister to have flown the nest set a course by your own star celica and never stray from it may you walk always in the light of milas blessing
may you walk always in the light of milas blessing
ram village  how ive missed this place i wonder how everyones doing
mycen grandpapa its me  hmm not here i wonder where hes gone
celica is that you dear well isnt this a delight what a lovely woman youve become last i recall you were just a sprout
ho celica how long has it been the village may look the same but its a different place these days the young ones have all up and left what with the war i just pray they all return to us 
celica celica is that you how long has it been i cant believe you came back to the village alm and the others are gone im afraid its a long story oh and sir mycen vanished around the same time sigh ram village was never all that exciting but now its unbearably dull so where are you off to mmm somewhere grand no doubt say why dont you let me come along i bet we could both use the company
fine whatever i wasnt that interested anyway ill just stay here and uh till the land
huh now you want me to come with you after all make up your mind
 huh oh celica youre back gosh how long has it been ive missed you so much alm left ram did you know that just up and left im so desperately lonely  anyway i thought about going after him just to teach him a lesson but i didnt id probably get killed by some foul beast out there on my own you know hey wait  are you on a journey or a quest or whatever then maybe i could go with you
r  really oh i suppose it was foolish of me to ask something like that but listen if you see alm tell him  well just tell him he has a home here and always will
did you change your mind can i come with you
three huzzahs for zofias liberators and three huzzahs for alm truly he is the hero zofia has been waiting for and hes every bit the champion general mycen was make no mistake the rigelian empires as fearsome a foe as they come but with alm leading our forces we neednt fear any man
everyones laughing and cheering but my guts one big knot only a foold think the rigelian empire would back down without a fight emperor rudolfs order of knights are scary enough  but what about that duma priest jedah and his horde of arcanists how are normal folk sposed to fight against men who conjure terrors
are you headed for the temple of mila lady priestess oh i do wish youd reconsider that whole areas crawling with thieves working in the employ of grieth the very ground itself is rotten hunks of cliffside slough off near every day you might easily find yourself with no way back so be careful okay
sure desaix and those rigelian thugs turned tail and ran but our crops still arent growing and weve no shortage of terrors   what do you suppose couldve happened to mila some men have gone to the temple to investigate but none have returned i say weve bigger problems than fighting a war but no one asks me 
 grandpapa what are you doing here
its been so very long celica
oh grandpapa id half resigned myself to never seeing you again
as had i and yet here you are grown into a beautiful young woman though i fear we lack the time for a leisurely reunion surely you left the island with some purpose in mind yes
i did im going to the temple of mila all thats transpiring in zofia now is tied to the earth mother— i can feel it in my very marrow theres more to be done than simply fighting the foes laid before us i must learn milas will in all of this i also intend to pray that she intercedes on behalf of her people that she might save us all
i see just as alm has chosen his path it would seem you have chosen yours
alm id suspected as much but your being here confirms it  hes leading the deliverance isnt he
why dont you go upstairs and see for yourself i expect thats where youll find what youve been searching for
its really you
wha—
wait a sec  celica is that really you celica
alm  im so glad to see you  i have dreamt about this day for seven years— at last  ive finally found you
you have ive missed you too  so much
 wow thats quite the story im trying to picture you swashbuckling pirates and  yeah just wow
i didnt mean to swashbuckle anyone it just sort of happened but forget all that for the moment alm you arent really planning to fight the rigelian empire are you
listen its not  its not something i chose they were the ones who attacked us
but there must be a way to resolve things other than bloodshed no
thats a pretty thought celica but  im not sure its true if it were no one would be risking life and limb on the battlefield
is it really so naive zofians and rigelians are both people of valentia are we not i know we can reach some kind of accord if we just try besides that i  i just cant imagine emperor rudolf is the monster some claim him to be
it doesnt matter what sort of man he is the rigelian empire chose to cross zofias border—thats a fact we aim to drive back the invaders nothing more
but why do you have to lead this rebellion mycens grandson or no youre neither knight nor noble so why make yourself a target like this
nrgh  if i didnt know any better id swear i was speaking to a blue blood my station doesnt matter celica im here because i was called i have a duty to perform and ill perform it no more and no less
oh alm 
do you think i wanted this fight this all started because lima iv went and angered the empire if you wish to point fingers point them at the ruler who failed his people its his fault were in this mess
thats not  well so what if it is maybe you should go become king if its such a damnably easy job
what celica thats not—
youre awfully free with accusations for a boy with no idea what royalty entails and now that youre a “hero” i imagine the throne is next on the list is that it
no its not like that at all celica i just want to keep zofia safe besides theres an heir a princess of the royal family may have survived if she turned up and fixed all this id happily return to ram you could come with me you know itd be like old times
come on theres no secret princess the zofian royal family is dead
but how can you be—
enough just enough go fight your war if it makes you happy im going to the temple of mila  good bye alm you  you stubborn jerk
celica  youre one to talk about stubbornness geez  ah damn it all i didnt even get the chance to ask her about the village  about why she had to leave oh celica  i had so much i wanted to say to you how did it end up like this
alm and celicas heartfelt reunion was dashed by heated words and once again the two were parted one chose the battlefield  the other the mothers succor and while they both sought to attain peace in their own way their chances of finding it together seemed to grow increasingly slim
/***EOF***/
good youre all here lets be on our way
uhm  are you sure about this alm
am i sure about what
oh please about celica you finally see her after gods know how long and you end up in a spat hey dont give me that look—we all know she took off in a right huff you two used to be inseparable what happened
 that was a long time ago tobin a lots happened—to both of us
hmm  well im no expert but i think a normal person would just apologize im sure she hasnt gotten too far yet what with those skinny legs and all 
seriously tobin y youre passing out relationship advice now give it a rest—its not like every fight has a right side and a wrong side
get over it gray im well aware of that its just  well this could be the last time alm and celica see each other youd think theyd wanna part on a less sour note
its all right tobin i appreciate what youre saying but this is something for me and celica to work out on our own besides im the leader of the deliverance now it wouldnt be right to keep everyone waiting on my own private business
alm 
sigh
celica hey celica
 hmm im sorry mae i was lost in thought did you need something
me naw im fine like always but what about you that guy leading the deliverance is a friend of yours right i know were in a rush but surely we had time for you to say good bye
its fine that isnt necessary
but celi—
mae i need to reach the temple of mila as soon as possible i know the mother will reveal a path to save zofia that doesnt involve violence
i dunno about this boey  celicas acting all weird i wonder what happened
well can you blame her im sure shes more than a little conflicted if the deliverance defeats desaix and drives the empire back what next zofia will need a ruler and who better than a boy who cast off tyrannys yoke
what but celicas the rightful heir
yeah but she cant exactly just go and announce that to everyone if she did shed be made to lead the deliverance effort herself believe me thats the last thing celica wants right now
i hate it when you make sense boey but that just means we have to haul tail to the temple of mila the earth mother will know what to do shell take care of everything
i pray its truly so simple
once we cross this mountain well finally reach the coast its a hard climb but i know well make it
hold
hmm whos there
  
youre the one from before im glad our paths have crossed again id hoped for a chance to properly thank you for helping us
ive no use for thanks i come bearing a warning proceed no further here
what i must know a reason for this warning
the terrain ahead is loose and prone to failure additionally there are still forces in play who would see you harmed if you must attain the temple of mila strike west through the mountains
west but thats where alm 
you have been warned
wait please
and hes gone  again i seriously wanna know who this creepy mask guy is and why hes following us
as do i mae but regardless this makes twice hes aided us
and with that dire warning ringing in our ears what is your plan milady do we follow mr masks advice and take the western route that would be quite a detour 
do we have any cause to trust this masked fellow in the first place sure he helped us out before but thats no guarantee of pure motive
and what was that bit about imitating the masked knight “forces in play who would see you harmed normal voice is he saying more people are going to turn up and try to kidnap celica
hmm  no we continue on as planned im not dismissing what he said but our purpose cannot brook delay if we are attacked i have faith we can prevail besides even the cleverest trap will betray some sign to a watchful eye so as long as we continue to be vigilant well be all right
hmph and here she is at last do not mistake me for the base fools who came before my power was bestowed upon me by jedah himself now go crush the girl and the pitiful insects accompanying her
waugh earthquake
gah i c cant even stand
look out the cliff is crumbling
oh you have to be joking as if anything else could have gone wrong on this blasted adventure
everyone be careful
celica no dont come any closer
milady
celica are you all right
hurt grunt  huh
  
why did i suspect id see you again
are you unhurt
it appears i am thanks to you i owe you an apology you warned me this would happen and yet i—
do not apologize but stop allowing petty emotion to cloud your judgment your choices steer the fates of more than just yourself
 youre right i can offer no rebuttal
still theres little sense in turning back when youre almost through the zofian coast is just ahead the road beyond should offer safe passage
how can you be certain
my prey were kind enough to use magic potent enough to reveal their location
gone again as sudden as ever i wish he would at least offer his name
yeah talk about your shady characters still i spose he seems like a decent  enough guy
yeah well mr mask seems to enjoy our company i wager well see him again and youre sure youve got no guess as to who he might be
none ive no allies left in this world save the ones i travel with now
oof  didnt mean to sour the mood forget i asked
its all right  but back to the matter at hand the road is well and truly blocked now i dont think well be heading back that way any time soon
then its a lucky thing weve no need to head that direction
now we couldnt go to aid alm even if we wanted to 
milady
its nothing weve spent enough time here lets press on
whoa whats that sound
the ground is unstable around here there must have been another rock slide some distance off from the sound of it weve no worry of harm to our men
thats good but   
a report sir a cliff has given way along the eastern ridge the route to the zofian coast is blocked
the eastern ridge thats the direction celica was heading oh celica please be all right
scuse me sir youre alm yes im a traveling peddler of sorts bito this and a scrapa that occasionally i even do deliveries  here this is from a lady of the cloth “milas turnwheel” she called it looks mighty fancy so it does thats all i know so youll have to figure out the rest on your lonesome and with that another job well done safe travels now eh
