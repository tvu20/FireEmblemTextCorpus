Palla: How are you holding up, Catria?
Catria: All's well here, Palla.
Palla: Oh good! That means I don't have to worry about you. Now, Est on the other hand...
Catria: Indeed. Though I imagine we should be used to worrying about her by now. Still, I find it hard to believe that we're all the way in Valentia. The quiet life never lasts for long, does it?
Palla: No, it doesn't. Even Archanea isn't what one would call stable these days. How long do you think we'll have to continue all this fighting?
Catria: I wish I knew.

Catria: Palla?
Palla: Hmm? Do you need soemthing?
Catria: I just had a thought. I know it's only happenstance that brought us here, but... Well, Celica and the others are all such good people. And Valentian culture is quite interesting in its own right. Perhaps I should allow myself to enjoy being here a bit more.
Palla: That's...not what I expected you to say. In fact, you're the last of us I'd suppose to be having such thoughts.
Catria: Is it really so out of character?
Palla: Heh. Maybe notâ€”especially as I think your words were directed at me. And perhaps you're right. I have been rather dour lately, after all. I suppose it IS important to find joy wherever life happens to take you.
Catria: I couldn't agree more. And I find the most joy in the smiles of my sisters.
Palla: Well, that's very sweet.

Catria: ......
Palla: Is something wrong, Catria? You seem down.
Catria: Oh, it's nothing. Just musing on Archanea a bit.
Palla: Ah. I see. I, too, worry about our home. I hope Minerva is all right. And...
Catria: And what?
Palla: Well, I'm curious who it is that YOU were thinking of.
Catria: What? Th-there's no "who!" I was just... You can be so cruel sometimes.
Palla: Heh. Perhaps we'll both just leave it at that then, mmm? Now let's get to work. The sooner we win, the sooner we can return home.
Catria: Agreed.

Est: Catria! Hey, Catria, wait up! I have a present for you!
Catria: ...Oh?
Est: It's something we stocked in the shop, but I thought you might want it.
Catria: What is this? Some kind of charm?
Est: Yup! Made from a stone that a dragon held while it slept for three millennia. It'll make any wish come true! ...Er, supposedly.
Catria: Three thousand years? You didn't stop to question that number? And even if that claim were true, it would still just be a stone, no?
Est: Oh, yeah, I guess so. But... DRAGONS!
Catria: Oh, Est...

Est: Catria! Hey, Catria! I've got another present for you!
Catria: What is it this time?
Est: Oh, relax! Why are you such a sourpuss all the time? Anyway, it's tea made from an herb that only grows on a fire dragon's grave.
Catria: Gods, it smells like the bad end of an angry wyvern... But all right. I'll bite. What's it supposed to do?
Est: It's chock-full of miraculous properties! ...That I forgot. But the quickest way to know is to drink it, right?
Catria: That's not happening.
Est: Whaaa?!
Catria: How in the world is that a surprise to you?

Est: Um, Catria?
Catria: And what do you have for me today, little miss merchant?
Est: Oh, hush. I don't have anything.
Catria: Well, that's a shame. I was almost looking forward to it.
Est: You know, I haven't just been fooling around with all these presents. I was really hoping they would make you happy. Anyway, that's it. I just wanted you to know that.
Catria: Oh, you silly girl. Est, you don't need to worry yourself about that. Just having you around guarantees things will never be boring here. Please don't ever change, all right?
Est: Aw, Catria... Hmm? Wait... Hmmmmm... That was a compliment, right? I mean, it made me happy. Should I feel happy?
Catria: Ha ha, I wonder...
