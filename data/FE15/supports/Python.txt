Forsyth: Python! Ho, Python!
Python: Crivens, here he comes again... What is it now, Forsyth?
Forsyth: Don't give me that innocent mummery act! Do you think I'm not watching you? Sir Alm and the others are fighting five times as hard as you are! You're barely even pretending to try! Have you no honor or shame?
Python: Shame? ...Nope, sorry. Not feeling it. But good on that lot for keeping at it!
Forsyth: You know, it's high past time I told you a number ofâ€”
Python: Whoops, here comes the enemy! Gotta skedaddle now. Ta-ta!
Forsyth: Python! Come back here at once!
Forsyth: He simply does not get it...

Forsyth: Python.
Python: Oy, gods! It's after me again! Won't someone save poor Python?
Forsyth: I am not an "it," you daft fool! Why can't you take things seriously?
Python: Er...because I'm more effective when I don't?
Forsyth: Oh, you needn't tell me twice. I'm well aware of how you function in this world. No goals. No passion. Just flitting around while doing the bare minimum. Your life must be so horribly empty.
Python: It's pretty grand, actually. So maybe you should stop painting me as the picture of misery and woe. The carefree life is surprisingly fun. You should give it a whirl.
Forsyth: Well, I HAVE thought I might benefit from being a bit more...capricious.
Python: Heh! What, you? Oh, gods no. You'd be terrible at it.
Forsyth: YOU JUST SAID I SHOULD DO IT!
Python: Ha ha!

Forsyth: ......
Python: Forsyth? You all right there, pal? You haven't yelled at me yet. In fact, you NEVER snap at me anymore. Don't tell me you've given up.
Forsyth: No, I wouldn't call it "giving up." But the excuses you come up with for not trying are beyond comprehension.
Python: That's because you're not TRYING to comprehend them. Look, I'm not like other folks. I don't like chasing wildly after some dream. Dream's don't fill the belly, and they sure don't pay for life's other comforts. So you know what? I'm happier without 'em.
Forsyth: Truly? *sigh* Well, that sounds utterly depressing, but if you're happy, I'll let it be. But we ARE fighting a battle here, so perhaps a modicum of help is in order?
Python: Aye aye, cap'n! I'll give you my all!
Forsyth: Oh, somehow I doubt that...
