Mae: Celica, I think I’m broken! Look, I know you set out on this journey with a solemn purpose and junk. And WHILE I know that… I can’t help but feel super crazy excited about it! I mean, I’ve barely even been off the ISLAND before! But I feel terrible for feeling this way. It seems so disrespectful, you know? …Huh? You don’t mind? You sure about that? Then I guess I’ll take that as permission to be super excited! You should try to have some fun with this too. It’ll do you good! Oh, but the whole “solemn purpose” thing is still top priority, obviously. But we’ll be seeing new things, meeting new people… It’s important to enjoy it!

Boey: …… Didn’t think I’d be storming a pirate fort today when I got up this morning. When you decide to do something, Milady, you really go for it. Times like that, it really hits home how we were born into different stations. Me, I just go through life focused on whatever’s right in front of me. I hope this journey will teach me to see things with a broader perspective.

Genny: Mae and Boey seem excited to have left the Priory to travel, but to be honest, I’m more than a little afraid. I’ve always been the type to stay home and read rather than go on adventures. Guess I’d rather write a story about an epic quest than be on one myself. Though I imagine being left out would feel even worse… Promise me you won’t leave me behind, Celica, okay? Double promise!

Kamui: Hey there, Priestess. Good on you for keeping at it. Me, I can’t imagine giving my all for a gig that doesn’t pay. No one asked you to solve this mess— let alone paid you—yet here you are. Seems like your job is a tougher one than I’m willing to take on. Makes me wonder if the gods are really worth all that trouble.

Leon: …Blerg. I don’t like sea travel, and it sure doesn’t like me. I’m nauseous, I’m sunburned, and I’m wind-beaten. I look like death’s damp leftovers. But YOU look fresh as a daisy, Priestess! What’s your secret? …What? Nothing? NOTHING?! But you look like a dew-dappled angel! Augh, that’s so annoying… Well, youth is great and all, but don’t expect it to last.

Valbar: Hey there, Priestess. How you holding up? If there’s anything I can do to help, just say the word. I’m serious! No need to hold back. I owe you my life, after all. Gives me chills to think how I could have died before getting revenge. My family owes you as well, so it’s up to me to pay you back on their behalf.

Saber: Phew. For a proper-looking little lady, you sure pull some crazy stunts, lass. I didn’t think I’d be bum-rushing a pirate fort as soon as I took this job. Doesn’t exactly bode well for the future, if I’m honest. Eh? You promise no more detours? Ha! That and some gold can buy me a pint.
