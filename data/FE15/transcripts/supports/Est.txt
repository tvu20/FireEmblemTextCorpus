Palla: How are you feeling, Est?
Est: Never better, Sis!
Palla: Glad to hear it. Just don't do anything too risky, all right? Unlike Catria and myself, it's been a while since you were in a fight.
Est: Oh, posh! I'm fine. You always were a mother hen.
Palla: Was I now?
Est: I am fiiiiine! Trust me!
Palla: Wait just a... Est! Honestly, that child. She thinks this is all just fun and games...

Est: Hey, Palla.
Palla: What's wrong, Est? You sound drained.
Est: Yeah. I think I was a little too fired up there. Kinda tired myself out.
Palla: What did I tell you? You need to stop being so eager to show off what you can do.
Est: Hey! That's not how I am at all! ...Okay, maybe it's a LITTLE how I am.
Palla: You see?
Est: Ugh... It's embarrassing when you know me better than I do. But hey, that's my sister for you.
Palla: Hee hee.

Est: Hey, Sis? Can I ask you something?
Palla: This must be bad if you need to ask permission first.
Est: N-no, it's just... Look, maybe I'm wrong and just imagining it, but I'm curious.
Palla: ...About?
Est: ...Is there a boy you like?
Palla: Ngk...
Est: Y-you know, here in this army?
Palla: What?
Est: I mean, it's such a wonderful group, and full of really nice men! So if any of them caught your eye, I thought maybe I could... set you up?
Palla: Wow. I don't even know where to begin. We're not here to mingle and find a date, Est. There's no room for that now. I know you mean well, but be serious.
Est: Eh heh heh. Sorry.
Palla: Listen to me, Est. What makes me the most happy is being with you and Catria. You don't need to worry about anything except staying safe. Understood?
Est: ...Understood.

%Catria 
Est: Catria! Hey, Catria, wait up! I have a present for you!
Catria: ...Oh?
Est: It's something we stocked in the shop, but I thought you might want it.
Catria: What is this? Some kind of charm?
Est: Yup! Made from a stone that a dragon held while it slept for three millennia. It'll make any wish come true! ...Er, supposedly.
Catria: Three thousand years? You didn't stop to question that number? And even if that claim were true, it would still just be a stone, no?
Est: Oh, yeah, I guess so. But... DRAGONS!
Catria: Oh, Est...

Est: Catria! Hey, Catria! I've got another present for you!
Catria: What is it this time?
Est: Oh, relax! Why are you such a sourpuss all the time? Anyway, it's tea made from an herb that only grows on a fire dragon's grave.
Catria: Gods, it smells like the bad end of an angry wyvern... But all right. I'll bite. What's it supposed to do?
Est: It's chock-full of miraculous properties! ...That I forgot. But the quickest way to know is to drink it, right?
Catria: That's not happening.
Est: Whaaa?!
Catria: How in the world is that a surprise to you?

Est: Um, Catria?
Catria: And what do you have for me today, little miss merchant?
Est: Oh, hush. I don't have anything.
Catria: Well, that's a shame. I was almost looking forward to it.
Est: You know, I haven't just been fooling around with all these presents. I was really hoping they would make you happy. Anyway, that's it. I just wanted you to know that.
Catria: Oh, you silly girl. Est, you don't need to worry yourself about that. Just having you around guarantees things will never be boring here. Please don't ever change, all right?
Est: Aw, Catria... Hmm? Wait... Hmmmmm... That was a compliment, right? I mean, it made me happy. Should I feel happy?
Catria: Ha ha, I wonder...
