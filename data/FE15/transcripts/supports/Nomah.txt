Celica: How are you feeling, Nomah?
Nomah: I'm getting by well enough, little one.
Celica: That's good. But please promise me that you won't overexert yourself.
Nomah: Bah! Stop treating me like a frail old man with one foot in the grave! ...Though I admit all this fighting DOES take a toll on my poor back.
Celica: I'm very sorry to hear it. Let me rub it for you.
Nomah: Oh... Yes, that feels wonderful... Thank you, little one.
Celica: Happy to help! Hee hee.

Celica: How's your back today, Nomah?
Nomah: Lithe as a willow branch, thanks to you. But now my shoulder is giving me trouble. Old jousting injury, you see...
Celica: Oh, you poor thing. Here, let me give you another massage.
Nomah: Oh! Oh... Ahh... You're too kind. Ahh... I can feel the pain receding already.
Celica: I'm very glad to hear it.

Celica: Hello, Nomah.
Nomah: Greetings, little one. Oh! Yes. Er, so today, it seems I have a new pain in my... um... hair? Yes, that'sâ€”
Celica: *sigh* Stop, Nomah. You don't need to keep pretending. In truth, I don't think you've been in pain this whole time.
Nomah: Heh heh. Caught on to me, have you?
Celica: You've always enjoyed your little jokes and japes. At this rate, you're well enough to keep fighting for me for a long while yet. Uh oh. Here comes the enemy now. Let's go!
Nomah: Ah! Yes. More... fighting. All right, Nomah, time to suck it up!
