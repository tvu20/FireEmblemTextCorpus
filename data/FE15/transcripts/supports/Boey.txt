Mae: Well, look who the wyvern dragged in.
Boey: Hey, Mae. How you holding up?
Mae: Meh! You know me. Can't complain. It's all just so WEIRD, ya know? I mean, we studied magic and all, but... Well, I guess I never really expected to be zappin' folks for real, is all.
Boey: Sure, but we always knew it was a possibility. The whole reason we trained was in case anyone learned the truth about Celica.
Mae: Yeah, I know, but still. There's a difference between feeling prepared for something and DOING it.
Boey: Is there? I seem to be doing all right. Sounds like this is a personal problem.
Mae: C'mon, seriously? This isn't a shock to your system at all?
Boey: I told you before, I knew what I was getting into. I've been ready.
Mae: Wow. You almost sounded like an adult just now, Boey.
Boey: Ha ha. Age has nothing to do with it.

Boey: Um, Mae?
Mae: Huh? Oh, hey, Boey. What's shakin'?
Boey: Do you... not want to fight? If this is too painful for you, you can just say so. It's all right. Really.
Mae: Nah, this is great! Fighting lets me practice everything I've learnedâ€”plus it's fun to help Celica!
Boey: I.. see. Wait, no I don't. If that's how you feel, what was all that talk about before?
Mae: Duh-doy! I just said what I was thinking. It's a surprise to be fighting actual, real-life people. That's all.
Boey: Oh. Well, now I feel like an idiot for worrying.

Mae: Say, Boey?
Boey: What is it?
Mae: Traveling around the world like this is pretty fun and all, but I still think I prefer a quiet life of watching the sea back on the island. How about you?
Boey: Well, this isn't a conversation I thought about having today. But of course I want to go home soon. My family's waiting there, after all.
Mae: Heh. Yeah. I guess.
Boey: You guess? What's that mean?
Mae: Well, we could also stick with Celica and live in a big, fancy castle, yeah? I just wasn't sure which one you'd prefer.
Boey: ...Er, you're headed back to the island, right?
Mae: ...Yeah.
Boey: Then that's where I'm going as well.
Mae: Huh? Wait, what's that mean?
Boey: Are you really such a dope that you can't figure it out?
Mae: WHAAAAAT?
