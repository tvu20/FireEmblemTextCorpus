Kamui: Well, if it isn't Leon.
Leon: Mmm. If it isn't Kamui.
Kamui: I normally don't give a tinker's damn what folks think of me, but ouch. I mean, I'm hardly chopped liver here.
Leon: So... what then? Are you trying to get me to hit on you or something?
Kamui: What? No! That's not what I'm—
Leon: Because you're really not my type. And you're only a percent of a percent of the man Valbar is.
Kamui: I think you may be overstating things just a tad there...

Kamui: Tell me something, Leon.
Leon: Something.
Kamui: Oh, you're a laugh riot. But anyway, what do you think makes a good man?
Leon: Hmm. That's not easily summed up in a few words, but... for starters, he should be kind, strong and mature... while maintaining a boyish innocence. He also needs to listen, but be ready to tell the hard truths when necessary.
Kamui: Oh, come on. No one's that perfect.
Leon: Someone is. And his name is Valbar.
Kamui: You are definitely kidding yourself...

Kamui: Say, Leon?
Leon: What is it this time, Kamui?
Kamui: It's about what you said before. So what would you do if Valbar ended up being the opposite of your ideal?
Leon: Well, that's an absurd question. But in the interest of humoring you and passing the time... Well, I suppose I'd set off looking for a man who met my perfect ideal. A journey like that might actually be kind of... fun.
Kamui: I think that's the first time you and I have agreed on anything.
Leon: Listen, Kamui, I'm sorry. Really I am. This is all very flattering, but I just don't see you like that.
Kamui: I told you before, that's not what I'm— Oh, never mind!
