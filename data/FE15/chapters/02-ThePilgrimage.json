I\u2019ve finally found you!"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "You have. I've missed you too... so much."}], "dialogue": [{"speaker": "Alm", "line": "...Wow, that\u2019s quite the story. I\u2019m trying to picture you swashbuckling pirates, and... Yeah, just...wow."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I didn\u2019t mean to swashbuckle anyone. It just sort of...happened. But forget all that for the moment. Alm, you aren\u2019t REALLY planning to fight the Rigelian Empire, are you?"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "Listen, it\u2019s not... it\u2019s not something I chose. They were the ones who attacked us."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "But there must be a way to resolve things other than bloodshed, no?"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "That\u2019s a pretty thought, Celica, but... I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true. If it were, no one would be risking life and limb on the battlefield."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Is it really so naive? Zofians and Rigelians are both people of Valentia, are we not? I know we can reach some kind of accord if we just try. Besides that, I... I just can\u2019t imagine Emperor Rudolf is the monster some claim him to be."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "It doesn\u2019t matter what sort of man he is. The Rigelian Empire chose to cross Zofia\u2019s border\u2014that\u2019s a fact. We aim to drive back the invaders. Nothing more."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "But why do YOU have to lead this rebellion? Mycen\u2019s grandson or no, you\u2019re neither knight nor noble. So why make yourself a target like this?"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "Nrgh... If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d swear I was speaking to a blue blood. My station doesn\u2019t matter, Celica. I\u2019m here because I was called. I have a duty to perform, and I\u2019ll perform it. No more, and no less."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Oh, Alm..."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "Do you think I WANTED this fight? This all started because Lima IV went and angered the empire. If you wish to point fingers, point them at the ruler who failed his people. It\u2019s his fault we\u2019re in this mess."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "That\u2019s not... Well, so what if it is? Maybe you should go become king if it\u2019s such a damnably easy job!"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "What?

I just want to keep Zofia SAFE! Besides, there\u2019s an heir; a princess of the royal family may have survived. If she turned up and fixed all this, I\u2019d happily return to Ram. You could...come with me, you know? It\u2019d be like old times."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Come on! There\u2019s no secret princess! The Zofian royal family is dead!"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "But how can you be\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Enough! Just...enough. Go fight your war if it makes you happy! I\u2019m going to the Temple of Mila. ...Good-bye, Alm. You... you stubborn JERK!"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "Celica... You\u2019re one to talk about stubbornness, geez... Ah, damn it all. I didn\u2019t even get the chance to ask her about the village... About why she had to leave. Oh, Celica... I had so much I wanted to say to you. How did it end up like this?"}], "conversation": [{"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Three huzzahs for Zofia\u2019s liberators, and three huzzahs for Alm! Truly, he is the hero Zofia has been waiting for. And he\u2019s every bit the champion General Mycen was! Make no mistake, the Rigelian Empire\u2019s as fearsome a foe as they come, but with Alm leading our forces, we needn\u2019t fear any man!"}, {"speaker": "Mercenary", "line": "Everyone\u2019s laughing and cheering, but my gut\u2019s one big knot. Only a fool\u2019d think the Rigelian Empire would back down without a fight. Emperor Rudolf\u2019s order of knights are scary enough... but what about that Duma priest Jedah and his horde of arcanists? How are normal folk s\u2019posed to fight against men who conjure Terrors?"}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "Are you headed for the Temple of Mila, lady priestess? Oh, I do wish you\u2019d reconsider. That whole area\u2019s crawling with thieves working in the employ of Grieth. The very ground itself is rotten! Hunks of cliffside slough off near every day. You might easily find yourself with no way back...so be careful, okay?"}, {"speaker": "Young Woman", "line": "Sure, Desaix and those Rigelian thugs turned tail and ran, but our crops still aren\u2019t growing and we\u2019ve no shortage of Terrors ... What do you suppose could\u2019ve happened to Mila? Some men have gone to the temple to investigate, but none have returned. I say we\u2019ve bigger problems than fighting a war, but no one asks me..."}], "recruit-conversation": [{"speaker": "Kliff", "line": "Celica? Celica, is that you? How long has it been?! I can\u2019t believe you came back to the village! Alm and the others are gone, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s...a long story. Oh, and Sir Mycen vanished around the same time. *sigh* Ram Village was never all that exciting, but now it\u2019s unbearably dull. So where are you off to, mmm? Somewhere grand, no doubt. Say, why don\u2019t you let me come along? I bet we could both use the company."}, {"speaker": "Kliff", "line": "Fine, whatever. I wasn\u2019t that interested anyway. I\u2019ll just stay here and...uh...till the land."}, {"speaker": "Kliff", "line": "Huh? Now you want me to come with you after all? Make up your mind!"}, {"speaker": "Faye", "line": "...Huh? Oh, Celica! You\u2019re back! Gosh, how long has it been? I\u2019ve missed you so much! Alm left Ram. Did you know that? Just up and LEFT! I\u2019m so desperately lonely... Anyway, I thought about going after him just to teach him a lesson, but I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d probably get killed by some foul beast out there on my own, you know? Hey, wait... Are you on a journey or a quest or whatever? Then maybe I could go with you!"}, {"speaker": "Faye", "line": "R- really? Oh. I suppose it was foolish of me to ask something like that.

Can I come with you?"}], "intro": [{"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Really? Here? We have to come HERE, milady?

We can\u2019t very well do nothing."}, {"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Oh, I\u2019m pretty sure we can.

It\u2019s HERE!"}, {"speaker": "Kamui", "line": "Whoa, whoa, whoa\u2014hey, Priestess! Did you forget our little chat about staying clear of the Seabound Shrine? Because this is not staying clear! This is the exact OPPOSITE of staying clear!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I\u2019m sorry, did we discuss that? I must\u2019ve been preoccupied... What if there\u2019s something of use here? Surely you would want to\u2014 Ooooh, I remember now. You\u2019re scared of necrodragons, aren\u2019t you, Kamui? How careless of me. It completely slipped my mind!"}, {"speaker": "Kamui", "line": "Slipped your mind... That\u2019s it.

That creep was talking about...serving you up or some such...?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I don\u2019t know, Boey. But he was different from the others who have come after me.

One chose the battlefield... the other, the Mother\u2019s succor. And while they both sought to attain peace in their own way, their chances of finding it together seemed to grow increasingly slim."]}
