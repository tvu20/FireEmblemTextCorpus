You\u2019re all here. Let\u2019s be on our way."}, {"speaker": "Tobin", "line": "Uhm... Are you sure about this, Alm?"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "Am I sure about what?"}, {"speaker": "Tobin", "line": "Oh, please. About Celica! You finally see her after gods-know how long, and you end up in a spat? Hey, don\u2019t give me that look\u2014we all know she took off in a right huff. You two used to be inseparable. What happened?"}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "...That was a long time ago, Tobin. A lot\u2019s happened\u2014to both of us."}, {"speaker": "Tobin", "line": "Hmm... Well, I\u2019m no expert, but I think a normal person would just apologize. I\u2019m sure she hasn\u2019t gotten too far yet, what with those skinny legs and all..."}, {"speaker": "Gray", "line": "Seriously, Tobin? Y-you\u2019re passing out relationship advice now? Give it a rest\u2014it\u2019s not like every fight has a right side and a wrong side."}, {"speaker": "Tobin", "line": "Get over it, Gray. I\u2019m well aware of that! It\u2019s just... Well, this could be the last time Alm and Celica see each other. You\u2019d think they\u2019d wanna part on a...less-sour note."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "It\u2019s all right, Tobin. I appreciate what you\u2019re saying. But this is something for me and Celica to work out on our own. Besides, I\u2019m the leader of the Deliverance now. It wouldn\u2019t be right to keep everyone waiting on my own private business."}, {"speaker": "Tobin", "line": "Alm..."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "*sigh*"}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "Celica! Hey, Celica!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "...Hmm? I\u2019m sorry, Mae. I was lost in thought. Did you need something?"}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "Me? Naw, I\u2019m fine like always. But what about YOU?! That guy leading the Deliverance is a friend of yours, right? I know we\u2019re in a rush, but surely we had time for you to say good-bye!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "It\u2019s fine. That isn\u2019t necessary."}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "But Celi\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Mae, I need to reach the Temple of Mila as soon as possible. I know the Mother will reveal a path to save Zofia that doesn\u2019t involve violence."}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "I dunno about this, Boey... Celica\u2019s acting all weird. I wonder what happened?"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Well, can you blame her? I\u2019m sure she\u2019s more than a little conflicted. If the Deliverance defeats Desaix and drives the empire back, what next? Zofia will need a ruler, and who better than a boy who cast off tyranny\u2019s yoke?"}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "What?! But Celica\u2019s the rightful heir!"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Yeah, but she can\u2019t exactly just go and announce that to everyone. If she did, she\u2019d be made to lead the Deliverance effort herself. Believe me, that\u2019s the last thing Celica wants right now."}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "I hate it when you make sense. Boey. But that just means we have to haul tail to the Temple of Mila! The Earth Mother will know what to do. She\u2019ll take care of everything!"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "I pray it\u2019s truly so simple."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Once we cross this mountain, we\u2019ll finally reach the coast. It\u2019s a hard climb, but I know we\u2019ll make it."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Hold."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Hmm? Who\u2019s there?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "You\u2019re the one from before! I\u2019m glad our paths have crossed again. I\u2019d hoped for a chance to properly thank you for helping us."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "I\u2019ve no use for thanks. I come bearing a warning: proceed no further here."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "What? I must know a reason for this warning."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "The terrain ahead is loose and prone to failure. Additionally, there are still forces in play who would see you harmed. If you must attain the Temple of Mila, strike west through the mountains."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "West? But that\u2019s where Alm..."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "You have been warned."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Wait, please!"}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "And he\u2019s gone... AGAIN. I seriously wanna know who this creepy mask guy is and why he\u2019s following us!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "As do I, Mae. But regardless, this makes twice he\u2019s aided us."}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "And with that dire warning ringing in our ears, what is your plan, milady? Do we follow Mr. Mask\u2019s advice and take the western route? That would be quite a detour..."}, {"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Do we have any cause to trust this masked fellow in the first place? Sure, he helped us out before, but that\u2019s no guarantee of pure motive."}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "And what was that bit about, [imitating the Masked Knight] \u201cforces in play who would see you harmed\"? [normal voice] Is he saying MORE people are going to turn up and try to kidnap Celica?!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Hmm... No. We continue on as planned. I'm not dismissing what he said, but our purpose cannot brook delay. If we are attacked, I have faith we can prevail. Besides, even the cleverest trap will betray some sign to a watchful eye, so as long as we continue to be vigilant, we\u2019ll be all right."}, {"speaker": "Arcanist", "line": "Hmph. And here she is at last. Do not mistake me for the base fools who came before. My power was bestowed upon me by Jedah himself. Now go, crush the girl and the pitiful insects accompanying her!"}, {"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Waugh! Earthquake?!"}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "Gah! I c-can\u2019t even stand!"}, {"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Look out! The cliff is crumbling!"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Oh, you have to be joking! As if anything else could have gone wrong on this blasted adventure!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Everyone, be careful!"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Celica?! No! Don\u2019t come any closer!"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "MILADY!!!"}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "Celica, are you all right?!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "(hurt grunt) ...Huh?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Why did I suspect I\u2019d see you again?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Are you unhurt?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "It appears I am...thanks to you. I owe you an apology. You warned me this would happen, and yet I\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Do not apologize, but stop allowing petty emotion to cloud your judgment. Your choices steer the fates of more than just yourself."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "...You\u2019re right. I can offer no rebuttal."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Still, there\u2019s little sense in turning back when you\u2019re almost through. The Zofian coast is just ahead. The road beyond should offer safe passage."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "How can you be certain?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "My prey were kind enough to use magic potent enough to reveal their location."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Gone again, as sudden as ever. I wish he would at least offer his name."}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "Yeah, talk about your shady characters! Still, I s\u2019pose he seems like a decent- enough guy."}, {"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Yeah, well, Mr. Mask seems to enjoy our company. I wager we\u2019ll see him again. And you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve got no guess as to who he might be?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "None. I\u2019ve no allies left in this world, save the ones I travel with now."}, {"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Oof... Didn\u2019t mean to sour the mood. Forget I asked."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "It\u2019s all right... But back to the matter at hand, the road is well and truly blocked now. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be heading back that way any time soon."}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Then it\u2019s a lucky thing we\u2019ve no need to head that direction."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Now we couldn\u2019t go to aid Alm even if we wanted to..."}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Milady?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "It\u2019s nothing. We\u2019ve spent enough time here. Let\u2019s press on."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "Whoa, what\u2019s that sound?"}, {"speaker": "Clive", "line": "The ground is unstable around here. There must have been another rock slide. Some distance off, from the sound of it. We\u2019ve no worry of harm to our men."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "That\u2019s good, but---"}, {"speaker": "Mercenary", "line": "A report, sir. A cliff has given way along the eastern ridge. The route to the Zofian coast is blocked."}, {"speaker": "Alm", "line": "The eastern ridge? That\u2019s the direction Celica was heading. Oh, Celica, please be all right."}, {"speaker": "Peddler", "line": "S\u2019cuse me, sir! You\u2019re Alm, yes? I\u2019m a traveling peddler of sorts. Bit\u2019o this and a scrap\u2019a that. Occasionally, I even do deliveries! ...Here. This is from a lady of the cloth. \u201cMila's Turnwheel,\u201d she called it. Looks mighty fancy, so it does! That\u2019s all I know, so you\u2019ll have to figure out the rest on your lonesome. And with that...another job well done! Safe travels now, eh?"}]}
