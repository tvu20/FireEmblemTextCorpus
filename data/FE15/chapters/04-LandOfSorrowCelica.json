If you wish to speak with him, you\u2019ll find him at his home."}, {"speaker": "Young Woman", "line": "Halcyon was once a priest of the Duma Faithful. There he struggled against Jedah, who sought to rule by force and terror. But in the end, he was driven out... This place has been his hermitage ever since."}, {"speaker": "Young Man", "line": "This whole area has been tainted. The legacy of Dolth and Garcia\u2019s wicked experiments. I had always thought Emperor Rudolf a wise man, but only a fool would suffer the abuses of the Duma Faithful to grow so bold. If I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m cheering for Zofia\u2019s Deliverance in all this."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "Do you all really mean to fight Jedah? I urge you to reconsider.

J-Jedah\u2019s...curse...!"}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "Conrad\u2019s mother was of Rigelian noble birth. She was forced to wed the king of Zofia in order to procure food for Rigel... Can you imagine such a fate? My blood boils to even think of it!"}, {"speaker": "Hermit", "line": "I\u2019ve spent my life here brewing nectar, drink of the gods. Duma and Mila both have partaken of my humble creations. Know you how nectar is made? ...No? Then let me enlighten you! Steep one gargoyle ear in medicinal syrup to form the base. Pour in bonewalker oil and mix well, then allow it to ferment while agitating. Season the result with Duma moss, and the work is done. Voila! Nectar! A libation fit to make the grandest gods salivate! You\u2019re drooling over the prospect as well, no doubt. Bring me the ingredients, and I might be convinced to make you a batch. That\u2019s medicinal syrup, Duma moss, a gargoyle ear, and bonewalker oil!"}, {"speaker": "Hermit", "line": "Medicinal syrup, Duma moss, a gargoyle ear, and bonewalker oil... Excellent! You\u2019ve all the ingredients required to make nectar! However, the fermentation process takes three days. Return to me then. But do return, for a taste of heaven itself awaits you!"}, {"speaker": "Hermit", "line": "You don\u2019t desire a taste of nectar? ...How odd. Are you sure you are well?"}, {"speaker": "Hermit", "line": "You haven\u2019t the ingredients. I need medicinal syrup, bonewalker oil, a gargoyle ear, and Duma moss. If you wish to taste nectar, you must procure those items."}, {"speaker": "Hermit", "line": "I need medicinal syrup, bonewalker oil, a gargoyle ear, and Duma moss. If you wish to taste nectar, you must procure those items."}, {"speaker": "Hermit", "line": "Ah, there you are. I\u2019ve been waiting. You\u2019re dying from anticipation, no doubt. But here! Your nectar awaits!"}, {"speaker": "Hermit", "line": "If you ever desire another taste, return once more with the ingredients."}, {"speaker": "Scholarly Man", "line": "I\u2019ve been poring over these resources in my studies to create new medicines. One book tells of a foreign land\u2019s theory of food as medicine. It prescribes liver for those with ailing livers, brains for headaches, and so on. I found the idea most fascinating. Consider the gargoyle\u2014it hears the faintest sound of its prey, then strikes! Imagine what a medicine brewed from its ears could do for a person. Which brings me to a request... Could I impose upon you to procure three gargoyle ears? Please! My research needs you!"}, {"speaker": "Scholarly Man", "line": "Have you managed to find three gargoyle ears?"}, {"speaker": "Scholarly Man", "line": "What splendid specimens! Please, take this for your time."}, {"speaker": "Scholarly Man", "line": "I\u2019ll begin work on formulating that new medicine immediately.

Well, I\u2019m glad to see you in good spirits nonetheless."}, {"speaker": "Nomah", "line": "perhaps we\u2019d both enjoy more peace of mind if we stayed together.

Is that...Falchion?"}, {"speaker": "Jedah", "line": "You have a keen eye, boy. It is indeed the divine blade. You will likely doubt me when I say this, but that was Mila's doing. The moment Emperor Rudolf sealed her power, Mila sealed away Falchion. Do not ask me her motive in this, for I understand it not. But no force in this world now remains which can harm Lord Duma.

No!"}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Jedah", "line": "Keh heh heh. I\u2019m so pleased you\u2019ve come, Anthiese."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Enough talk, Jedah!

The rest will die for trespassing upon this holy place."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "What? But my life is the only one you need!"}, {"speaker": "Jedah", "line": "This is true.
