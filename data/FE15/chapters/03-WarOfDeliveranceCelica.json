With His Highness Lima IV deceased, who is left to take his place? What\u2019s more, I hear the western gate has been occupied by Rigelian forces. At this rate, Zofia is at risk of a flood the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen."}, {"speaker": "Saint", "line": "You wish to know what happened here? Beg pardon, but I fear I cannot be the one to tell you. Irma, one of our longest-serving sisters, was taken prisoner. Even now, that black dog Grieth holds her in his citadel. Alas, there are things I can speak of only with her leave."}, {"speaker": "Saint", "line": "Rudolf used the Divine Falchion to seal Mila\u2019s powers before taking her. A treasure given him by the wicked god Duma, no doubt. Aye, finding Mila may just be a matter of reaching Duma Tower. But Duma himself can only be slain by Falchion\u2019s edge."}, {"speaker": "Priestess", "line": "Someone at the castle said that when Lady Liprica first held you in her arms, she swore she would never let you stand before Mila. What do you suppose she might have meant by that?"}, {"speaker": "Old Timer", "line": "Eh? Who are you s\u2019posed to be? ...Me? I\u2019m the one what guards this here sluice gate. ...How\u2019s that? You want me to open it? Bah! I won\u2019t do nothin\u2019 of the sort! The gate opens for Zofian royal blood, not some random whippersnappers! Go on\u2014shout orders at an old man. Won\u2019t change my mind none!"}, {"speaker": "Old Timer", "line": "By the Mother! That circlet! Symbol of the Zofian throne, it is! Then you must be the missing Princess Anthiese! I thought I\u2019d never have the pleasure, Your Highness. You must have come to inquire about this here sluice gate, eh? ...Well, of COURSE I can open it! All is as Your Highness desires."}, {"speaker": "Old Timer", "line": "Er, one small issue, Your Highness. Openin\u2019 this here gate isn\u2019t enough what to let water flow freely. You also have to open the western gate."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "The western sluice gate, you say? That won\u2019t be a problem."}, {"speaker": "Old Timer", "line": "Oh? Then you\u2019ve news from the west?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Not exactly\u2014but I can\u2019t imagine Alm would let this situation continue. He\u2019ll see the gate opened.

And you are...?"}, {"speaker": "Deen", "line": "Deen. I worked under Grieth. The northern desert was my watch."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Ah, so you\u2019re Deen. We owe you thanks. Had you pursued us, we couldn\u2019t have defeated Grieth. Your restraint was much appreciated."}, {"speaker": "Deen", "line": "Heh. Quite the gamble. Fortunately, it paid off. ...You\u2019ve got stones, little one. I like leaders with stones. What say I throw in my lot with you?"}, {"speaker": "Deen", "line": "Figures. Well, I won\u2019t force you."}, {"speaker": "Deen", "line": "You here to ask for a hand?"}, {"speaker": "Sonya", "line": "My goodness. You really are but a child."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I\u2019m sorry, who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Sonya", "line": "Sonya. I assume you\u2019ve at least heard the name?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Ah, so that\u2019s you. We owe you thanks. Had you pursued us, we couldn\u2019t have defeated Grieth. Your restraint was much appreciated."}, {"speaker": "Sonya", "line": "I get the feeling you knew all along that\u2019s how I would react. Quite the clever one, aren\u2019t you? ...It\u2019s a bit infuriating. Still, I\u2019ll wager your friends are seldom bored. Maybe I\u2019ll just have to join up and see. If there\u2019s room for one more, that is? I\u2019m certain you won\u2019t regret it."}, {"speaker": "Sonya", "line": "Right. All full up. Well, don\u2019t come running back to me if you regret it later."}, {"speaker": "Sonya", "line": "You came running back after all. I told you not to do that. Hmm... I wonder if this is really such a great idea."}], "dialogue": [{"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Now, hold on just a tick. We get to the temple and everything's taken care of. That was the deal."}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Unfortunately, none of us expected the Mother to have stepped out. Nothing like this has ever happened before."}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "Well, I guess now we know why the soil\u2019s gone barren. It\u2019s been cut off from Mila\u2019s bounty."}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "...... What do we do now, milady?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "The only thing we can. We find the Mother and bring her back."}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Uh, please take this as kindly as possible, milady, but...are you MAD?! How exactly do we \"bring her back\"? And from where?!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I don\"t know. But if the Rigelian Army took her, she\u2019ll be somewhere in the empire. And since we\u2019ve already come to the border... Well, we might as well continue into Rigel."}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Hold on just a moment. You're saying we INVADE Rigel? This isn't a motley band of pirates or thieves\u2014it's an entire empire of them! We should all take a step back and consider our opti\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "No amount of thinking will change the situation. Come, Boey. This isn't the first time we've faced hopeless odds. And when people told us to give up, did we run? We need to trust in our abilities. We've come this far for a reason. And that reason is restoring Mila to her rightful place. She's still the only one who can save the world from this...chaos."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Nay, she isn't."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Hmm?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Well? Go on. Please don't leave us in suspense."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Mila cannot save this world. But you can...Princess Anthiese."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Ah! How did you\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "I bear you a gift."}, {"speaker": "Irma", "line": "Lady Liprica's circlet!"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "What? How is it that you possess this?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "A question for another time. Are you prepared to accept it, Princess?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "How do you mean?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "This is no mere memento of your mother. It is a crown\u2014and accepting it is a kind of coronation. As Princess of Zofia, are you prepared to wear this and ascend the throne?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I... I'm afraid I know little of kingdoms or the scope of rule. But I have people I wish to protect. Both here and elsewhere. I wish for this by my will alone. For my own happiness. Is that resolve enough?"}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "It is indeed."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Princess Anthiese, this crown is now yours to bear."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I accept it willingly."}, {"speaker": "Mae", "line": "Wow, Celica... You look so beautiful!"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "It\u2019s not Celica anymore, dummy. [To Celica] Isn\u2019t that right, Princess Anthiese? Er, Your Highness?! ...Uh, ma'am?"}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Hee hee. Celica is just fine, you two. [To everyone] Though from this day on, I will no longer conceal my identity. I expect that will bring even more hardship than we've faced till now. But I hope I can still count on you all."}, {"speaker": "Saber", "line": "Yeah, all right. Guess I'll go along and swear fealty. It suits you, lass. Or should I say \"Princess Anthiese.\" Anyway, our loyalty belongs to you, for now and always."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Thank you all. Truly."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "Mila was taken by Jedah, priest of the Duma Faithful. They\u2019re keeping her in Duma Tower, the seat of their foul cult."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "Then that\u2019s where we must go."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "If you\u2019re headed into Rigel, seek a man called Halcyon in Sage's Hamlet. He is an able soul, and will mostlike assist you however he can."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "I will seek him out. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Masked Knight", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Boey", "line": "Surprisingly enough, I think I'm starting to get used to him."}, {"speaker": "Celica", "line": "He's not a bad sort\u2014and he clearly cares about my well-being. I can't really ask for more in such times. And yet, he's not without his mystery...
