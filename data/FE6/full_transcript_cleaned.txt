after surviving many hardships roy set foot on berns soil at last
guinevere guided roy toward the temple of seals but in their path stood berns main forces the strongest army on the continent led by murdock the leader of the three dragon lords
etruria and bern the two leading forces on the continent clashing in all out war the longest and bloodiest day yet to be seen by elibe was about to begin 
all troops are at their posts and ready for battle lord murdock
good
galle so it begins
yes my lord we are prepared
your squad will be the key to winning this battle understood
of course my lord i will not let you down
yes we shall show them the power of berns main forces still that general from the lycia alliance army made it this far
general roy
yes him i wish to see how he fights by going up against him in person
ah general roy i have found you at last
bishop yoder what brings you all the way from etruria is something wrong
i did some research after receiving your letter i have come to the conclusion that bern has indeed resurrected the dark dragon
is that true  but hartmut defeated the dark dragon in the war how could bern have brought it back to life
apparently hartmut did defeat the dark dragon but he did not finish it off
what
instead of killing it he sealed it away in the mountains of bern and the sword he used to seal it was 
the binding blade
oh did you know
yes i have done a little studying myself 
even if the dark dragon has been released if we can obtain the binding blade then we may be able to seal it again or even kill it once and for all that is the churchs conclusion and they sent me to ask for your assistance
do you know where the dark dragon is
yes that is my next point as the the fire breathing dragons can change into human form is highly possible that the dark dragon can as well in fact we have a suspect there is a shaman called the dark priestess whom king zephiel keeps at his side at all times
the dark priestess 
we have no solid evidence but it is true that she appeared at around the same time that the other fire breathing dragons started to be seen
  
apparently the dragons sealed away their power in gems called dragon stones to change into human form so that they could adapt to this environment in that case it would not be surprising if the dark dragon was in the form of a human woman as well
in any case we have to go see her to confirm the truth
yes i shall accompany you
you would fight alongside us that would be most helpful
also take these these are the divine weapons that the church found on its own i have instructions to give them to you
divine weapons too
if the dark dragon has really been released this would be the greatest danger mankind has faced since the scouring
yes we will face it with all our strength
all right lets go crush them all leave none alive show the enemy the wrath of the dragon masters of bern
ah bishop yoder
saul it is good to see you are well and thank you the church has been saved countless times because you and dorothy fought alongside roy
 if one such as i was to be of any help at all then i am truly proud
oh it seems i have never seen you so serious
bishop yoder even i am a priest i have as much concern for the common good as anybody
i see i am sorry then let us fight together shall we
dorothy have you been well
yes it is good to see you again bishop yoder
you are always so bright and full of energy im sure god loves that part of you
do you think so 
everyone who comes in contact with your pure heart has his own heart cleansed like me for example even saul you should be proud of that
yes bishop yoder
sir galle 
zeiss you seem well
sir galle  must we fight
yes we must
i  i dont want to fight you youre the last person 
zeiss dont be a child
huh 
did you have only so much resolve when you left bern is that all the resolve you had when you decided to fight against bern
no my mind is set  even now it hurts to point my blade toward bern my homeland  but i believed with my heart that the path i chose wasnt a mistake 
then cast away your hesitation focus on crushing those who block the path that you have chosen  no matter who it is
sir galle 
zeiss  were you not a knight of bern
 of course i am
good when we meet next time neither of us will speak we will fight
galle 
melady 
galle  i 
dont speak  you and i are both loyal knights we both fight for whom we have pledged our loyalty to thats all
  
melady  this is probably the end so let me say this melady i am truly grateful that i was able to meet you we trained our skills together and we fought alongside each other melady  the days i spent with you  those were the happiest days of my life
me  mine too 
 goodbye melady  i always wish we had met in a more peaceful time
galle 
wait  galle dont go gaaaaaaaaaale
i have no regrets  zeiss  take care of melady 
hm you made it this far i congratulate you but can you defeat me
gah  you are strong  zephiel  my king  i cannot protect you any further  forgive me 
so you are general roy i have always been looking forward to matching blades with you
melady  i dont want to fight you but you stand here before me it seems we have no choice come
you were one of narshens troops  i heard the story from galle i do feel sorry for you but you are currently an enemy come we fight
master roy  there is a path leading underground
does that mean that the binding blade is in there
i dont know  but i heard from a captive that two things are hidden inside the temple
 does that mean that theres another divine weapon
possibly  perhaps we should ask those from our army who are natives of bern
all right ill check with them
master roy this sword stuck in the altar 
this must be the binding blade
lets see   i cant seem to draw it from the stone
its sealed you have to use the fire emblem
use it how
princess guinevere said that you just have to stick it into the opening in the handle 
whoa what the 
the blade is glowing
now i should be able to draw it   
 what is this  this is the binding blades  no hartmuts  memories 
who was that whats this feeling  its very 
master roy are you all right
yeah  im fine so this is hartmuts sword the binding blade  am i allowed to use it 
it has been said for centuries that the best swords choose their owners the sword is in your hands now you were chosen by it
but its only coincidence that im holding it 
what we may think of as being coincidental  even that might be part of our fate
  
anyway now that we have the binding blade all we need to do is head for the castle we must hurry
 right we have to defeat zephiel
/***EOF***/
after defeating berns remaining troops roy entered the dragon temple
he searched for the dark priestess to prevent the same tragedy as the scouring from happening again
in the temple roy was to learn the truth behind the legends that he had always heard what roy was about to hear was completely different that what he had always believed to be true 
this is the dragon temple  the air is strange did the eight heroes fight under such pressure as well
you would stand before us again humans
what  who are you when did you 
i am jahn i am the last remaining dragon of the dragon temple
the last dragon you seem different from the other dragons  are you the dark dragon
the dragons which you have been fighting are war dragons who know nothing but battle and the dark dragon is something completely different from me i am a pure full blooded dragon that fought you humans in the faraway past
different wasnt the dark dragon supposed to be the leader of the dragons
the dark dragon is an ‘object meant to bring hope to us dragons again it is no leader
what then what is the dark dragon
it seems you have much to learn
tell us what is the dark dragon we i have to fully understand my enemy before i fight
well  i have no reason to tell you and yet i have no reason not to tell you what should i do
  
 very well i shall test you to see if you are worthy of hearing the truth i am deep inside the temple fend off our attacks and come to me then i shall explain everything
but youre right here
what you are seeing is just an illusion if you wish to know the truth then come to me if you prove yourself worthy of my time then you shall hear it all 
you  are you real this time or 
this is but the entrace you have a long way yet to reach me still you seem to be strong enough not to die immediately
of course weve gone through many hardships
so i see very well i shall tell you a little about the dark dragon the dark dragon is not the leader of the dragons as you thought the dark dragon was created by us to bring us victory
created  so it wasnt the dark dragon that was making more dragons 
the dragons you speak of are correctly referred to as war dragons as i said before they are different from pure dragons such as i indeed the war dragons are created by the dark dragon and the dark dragon was created out of the divine dragon the most powerful of our kind
created out of the divine dragon then the dark dragon is actually  the divine dragon agreed to become the dark dragon
agreed no we destroyed its soul so that it would follow our leaders every command
what 
we desperately needed the power of the divine dragon our entire species was at stake
you needed the power of the divine dragon  but why did you have to destroy its soul
why you ask if you want that answer then seek me out again i shall witness more of your power 
not bad not bad at all i wonder how far you will come
i want you to go on with your story
 no matter how much we fought you humans just seemed to multiply endlessly eventually we began to lose because of the humans sheer numbers therefore we created the dark dragon that would create war dragons
war dragons  dragons meant only for battle
that is correct however the divine dragons did not agree with us they said that that would be defying the laws of nature as we were discussing how we could persuade the divine dragons to help us they suddenly disappeared
why
most likely they left us to prevent us from taking advantage of them we were never able to find the divine dragons but fortunately we were able to capture one
and that became the dark dragon
yes that divine dragon idunn became the dark dragon apparently she had hestitation in escaping with the rest of the divine dragons because she feared that we would go into conflict with each other hesitation such nonsense is only for humans we dragons have no need for it
then that hesitation worked against her 
when the divine dragons disappeared she refused to go with them that was when we were fortunate enough to find her idunn was still young but she had no problems in fulfulling our purposes except for one  her heart was not with us she would not follow our commands
so you destroyed her heart 
exactly we destroyed her soul to make her follow our every command
thats terrible
that is enough for now if you want to know more then show me more of your power
you have taken another step forward but the way is still long
we shall reach you
you have a stout heart what do you wish to hear next
you succeeded in creating the dark dragon the dark dragon produced war dragons then why did you lose to the humans
indeed the dark dragon continued to produce war dragons to use in the battlefield we were able to turn the tables on the humans
  
however the humans soon found out about the dark dragon they concluded that their numbers alone would not be enough to defeat us therefore they put their efforts into constructing powerful weapons that would pierce our scales they are what you call the divine weapons
that part is the same as our legends 
the most powerful and potent were chosen out of the humans to wield their newly crafted weapons they came and charged this temple however when the immense power of the weapons and our power clashed near bern something unexpected happened
what happened
the laws of nature started to collapse snow began to fall in mid summer stars shone in the middle of day 
is that the ending winter i heard that that happened because you dragons unleashed too much power into the world 
is that how your legends go
the power in the divine weapons was then used to restore order to the world thats what our legends say
so all the bad things that happened are our fault i would have expected you humans to think like that however the truth is what i said
then  the divine weapons were sealed away so as to not let such a disaster happen again then all those traps that protected them were to warn us 
you sealed them away that was a good decision but they seem to be in your hands right now
  
do not worry the weapons do not seem to have as much power as they did in the past they are unable to bring about such a disaster again
  
the great disaster hurt us dragons greatly
how
the disaster was originally the reason that we lost to the humans i shall continue when you advance a little further
you have come again you are doing better than i expected
 please continue the story
when the order of nature collapsed we dragons took a fatal blow the forces of nature weakened and it became difficult for us to retain our original dragon form therefore we decided to seal our powers in gemstones and take human form instead
those must be the dragon stones 
yes we were rendered utterly powerless against the humans we were just as weak no even weaker than the humans in their pathetic form the humans took advantage of our handicap and started attacking the dragons that had taken human form
why did you choose the human form
in the new order of nature the human was the form that required the least amount of energy to transform into the eight heroes mercilessly crushed us helpless in our human form i too suffered a deep wound
do you have hate for the humans who wounded you
hate only humans have such ridiculous emotions we battled to maintain our species and we lost that is all
  
this time however you humans might lose some human named zephiel brought the dark dragon to life again
 then zephiel did break the dark dragons seal
that is correct if you want to hear more then show me your more of your worthiness
jahn i know youre there
hm  it seems that you did indeed defeat zephiel  you might make it far enough to be able to fight me
what relation did the dark dragon have to zephiel
you know that the founder of bern is hartmut the leader of the eight heroes do you not
i know that
then do you know that hartmut didnt kill the dark dragon but only sealed it away
i know but i still dont know why he did that
hm i see the eight heroes eventually defeated our leader and they made their way deep into the temple to find the dark dragon however when they arrived at the dark dragons chamber all they saw was a human girl looking off into space it was idunn
they didnt fight
the dark dragon had its soul destroyed to follow our leaders commands since our leader had been killed there were no further commands to follow
then what happened to the dark dragon
the eight heroes naturally hesitated they had expected to see the most powerful dragon but all they saw was a girl who wouldnt respond even if spoken to
  
but the dark dragon still had to be defeated so the eight heroes prepared for battle idunn then must have reacted to their attacks she changed into the dark dragon and fought back just like the war dragons who have no heart hartmut then used a blade even stronger than the divine weapons and slashed at the dark dragons scales
the binding blade
i dont know what you humans call it but that must be it anyway when that sword cut through the dark dragons flesh it suddenly fell unconscious
it didnt die
yes apparently the sword reacted to its wielders feelings and changed its power accordingly
so hartmut didnt want to kill it so the binding blade reacted to his emotions and only knocked the dark dragon unconscious
i understand that hartmut did know a little bit about the dark dragon then after seeing it as the little girl idunn he must have felt pity it is another emotion that we dragons cannot comprehend
pity 
and thus at the bottom of his heart he didnt want to kill her in my opinion i would never leave something that would be a danger to me alive
so hartmuts feelings changed the swords strength 
hartmut persuaded his comrades and decided to seal the dark dragon he built a temple deep in the forests of bern and sealed idunn away using the sword and a gemstone they are what you call the binding blade and the fire emblem he then created a nation near the temple that would watch over and protect the seal from being broken that is bern
 how do you know all this were you watching
no i had been deeply wounded so i was leading a hidden life healing myself i heard the story about the seal from zephiel although he said that he had read about it in the ancient scrolls kept in the castle library
how did you meet zephiel
how did i meet him hm  if you reach me i will tell you it is not far now
you have come far i am in the chamber right in front of you it has been long since i last met humans in my true form i have not left this place ever since the war
you  you were always here
one thousand years  having survived the scouring i waited healing my wounds in the process i waited for the resurrection of the dark dragon that would bring hope to us dragons again and that time finally came the dark dragons seal was broken and i felt power flowing in my veins again
how does the dark dragons seal being broken make your strength recover
the dragon temples power depends on the dark dragons and thus the divine dragons life force if the dark dragon were to be sealed then there is no way i could have recovered to full strength by using the temples power
i see 
after my strength fully recovered i set out to look for the person who had broken the seal i used my illusion to search him out and ask his intentions i did not wish to go outside in my true form knowing that you humans now ran the world
wait  i thought that dragons in their human form lost most of their powers then how are you creating this illusion
this temple is for the dragons it is the only place that dragons can use a little of their power even in human form i am a fairly powerful dragon even in human form as long as i stay in here creating an illusion is easy still i am not able to create actual things like the dark dragon can
so you found zephiel
yes i found zephiel and asked him ‘why did you break the dark dragons seal zephiel was an odd man he didnt seem to be the least bit surprised he looked me right back in the eye and asked who i was after i told him that i was a dragon he started to smile mysteriously he then said ‘my intentions are to give the world to your kind
  
i cannot say that i fully trusted him but he was still the dark dragons new master so i decided to work with him zephiel then ordered the dark dragon to lead the world in the place of foolish humans
but zephiel is dead what is the dark dragon doing now
although he is gone the idunn resides in the chamber behind me she is waiting for the chance to free the world
but her master is now gone are you her new master
i did not need to become her master she was commanded to carry out zephiels orders even if he were to die idunn has absolute obedience to her master she will make sure that you humans are banished from this land
what her soul was destroyed and now shes bound to orders given by a person long dead
do you feel pity like hartmut did  you humans are truly difficult to understand but let me tell you this no matter how hard you try humans and dragons will never be able to live in harmony the gap between our species is impossible to fill
thats not true i know a place where dragons and humans live together dragons and humans both were brought into the same world they can and will understand each other
dragons and humans living together in harmony rubbish  i have no intention of listening to such nonsense now enter my domain let us see who has more power
one thousand years  my strength has long recovered i can feel it 
so i have lost  humans are truly unpredictable 
in the next chamber lies the dark dragon 
 roy 
 whats wrong fa you look like youre about to burst into tears
is is fa also an enemy 
huh
when  when fa gets big will fa become a bad dragon too
 wait fa tell me what you want to say slowly
that man said so  dragons and people cant live together 
but you were living in nabata with people werent you
but the dark dragon is a divine dragon like fa and youre going to fight the dark dragon right what about fa if fa grows up and becomes like the dark dragon then 
you dont have to worry about that even if you grow up youll always be fa youll always be together with humans and with us
 really
sure and also i actually want to help the dark dragon
help
the dark dragon is not acting on her own will she had her soul destroyed i  i dont want to kill her if i can avoid it
 fa doesnt get it
youll understand when youre little older
hartmut posed a question and ill give an answer to it
/***EOF***/
lord erik marquess of laus had been working with bern against his allies of lycia this gave roy further shock lycia where roy had grown up in was no longer a safe place to be either heading for ostia roy decided to move through the mountains where people seldom want to avoid unnecessary trouble
boss our boys just got back from scouting the village
then lets go get our tribute
but boss somethings different today theres an army stationed real close to us they say it looks like the lycian army
lycia then theres nothing to worry about they were almost wiped out by bern we can handle a few battered soldiers
youre right boss
theyve probably got some valuables on them too still dont get careless ready then lets mop up these losers boys
a villager is here to see you lord roy hey you wait just a second 
are you lord roy of house pherae
yes how may i help you
milord i beg you please rid us of the bandits terrorizing our village
bandits
theres a group of bandits that made their base in the castle near the cliffs
where are the castle guards
they fled once they heard that the lycian army was defeated by bern  we villagers were left on our own our days are spent in fear of bandit attacks
 
we have no one else we can ask please help us
lord roy we must keep our pace towards ostia 
yes i know but we cant simply ignore people in need of help
youre joking
you will help us thank you please use the gate to the west itll take you right to the castle
thank you
ill arrange for the gate to be opened when you give the signal
merlinus were going to the castle to drive off the bandits
sigh  youthful energy where does it come from
thank you dorothy please tell brother saul as well
i will father yoder
but where did saul run off to now how am i supposed to guard him if he keeps disappearing
er  brother saul i appreciate the offer but not tonight 
come now dont be like that we can sit by the fire in the dark of night as i soothe you with my calming sermons 
there you are saul
wonderful dorothy 
ill take my leave now
no dont go oh my  look what youve done now dorothy that expression on your face scared her away
this is my normal look saul you cant try to woo every girl you meet
you make it sound like a bad thing i simply offer my helping hand to any poor souls in need
then why do you always offer to give your sermons at night
 well putting that aside  did you have some good reason for interrupting my good work
oh right the lycian army is apparently somewhere around here
truly is princess guinivere still with them
yes if the reports from the st elimine church are accurate
then we must make haste let us join them
 
whats the matter dorothy
you only want to join them because princess guinivere is said to be so beautiful
dont be ridiculous  come now hurry along
yes lets go
hold on before you go take this lance with you it was once wielded by a knight called sir gant the stories say he bested many a foe with this lance
if you can try to occupy forts thatll stop enemy reinforcements from showing up
i was there when araphen was taken  the wyvern riders of bern were terrifying enough  but then a dragon engulfed the lycian army in flame  oh elimine please tell me it was a dream 
this whole area is really perfect for bandits its no wonder they appeared they can cross mountains and a bandit on a peak is a force to be reckoned with dreadful just dreadful 
no ones ever survived a blow from my axe hey you wanna see why
gah  no i dont wanna die 
lord roy a priest from the st elimine church wants an audience with you and princess guinivere
he knew that princess guinivere was with us
yes i cant imagine how
me neither  ill see him alone
roy i will be fine i wish to meet this priest
princess
tensions between my brother and the church have worsened as of late i do not believe they would attempt anything underhanded
i see merlinus allow this priest in
lord roy it is a pleasure to meet you at last i am saul an acolyte of the st elimine church
pleased to meet you
oh  and you must be princess guinivere you are as beautiful as the rumors say
pardon me 
ahem  forgive me your highness i wish to know the location of the fire emblem you have it with you do you not
how did you know that
berns head church tells us the fire emblem disappeared from the shrine of seals and you also went missing at exactly the same time
 
i was sent by the church to confirm the truth why did you take the fire emblem
 i wished to stop my brother
your brother  zephiel the king of bern
yes
do you know what the fire emblem is used for
 its the key that awakens a sword that was used to slay the dragons long ago that was what my father told me anyway i am unsure how exactly the fire emblem or the sword work my brother seemed to worry abut the fire emblem falling into enemy hands  extraordinarily so
so you took the fire emblem to make the king believe it fell into enemy hands all in an attempt to stop his conquest
yes but the war continued anyway
and what will you do now
 must i reveal my plan at this moment
ah so your highness has a plan
yes i have not given up hope of settling this war without further bloodshed
i see in that case i will accompany you on your journey
if roy allows it
i have no objections
thank you roy
of course princess

roy headed towards the ruins in sacae after the divine weapon
however the remaining forces of the djute clan were waiting for roy in the
ruins 
the etrurian army is here
they wont stop until they make everything theirs  we will not let that happen tell our brothers that we will defend this land to the death we will avenge our dead comrades
yes
the divine weapon lies here  sin do you know about this place
all i know is that the divine warrior hanons bow the miurgre or the bow of the winds is kept here
hanon  she and saint elimine were the only two women among the eight heroes
so it seems  watch your back the djute will give us everything theyve got to avenge their clansmen
all right we have to be careful lets go
its here the bow is hidden in the altar
this is the miurgre  it looks like an ordinary bow but it must have incredible power
master roy berns troops are retreating
oh all right
all right we must give chase
no dont theyre fleeing they dont have any more will to fight
but 
they have families as well theres no need to fight more than necessary
merlinus i need you to send this letter to bishop yoder in etruria
a letter may i ask what it says
its the story we heard from niime about the dragons
oh what did you discuss with her about the dragons
itll be long if i tell you i havent sealed the letter yet so you can look through it if you want
all right let me see 
 roy
princess is something wrong
 we enter bern now
yes we will attack bern very soon so may i ask the rest of the story now 
 yes that is why i came to you
king zephiel was an outstanding pupil is his studies he was skilled in warcraft  he grew to be the perfect heir for the king
that is correct
but still the former king did not look kindly at him
in fact  our father began to hate zephiel because he grew to become such a brilliant and worthy youth
what is that supposed to mean 
our father was a man of ordinary skill and intellect therefore zephiels outstanding skill made our father cold towards him
jealousy 
and then one day our father told zephiel that ‘the next heir to bern would be guineveres husband
what thats awful
but zephiel was very patient he said that he did not mind even if he could not gain the throne but the people around us who were looking forward to zephiels ability to be a good king would not allow anyone else to be the heir pressured by the public our father lost his patience at last and 
decided to kill king zephiel 
at a banquet our father gave zephiel a poisoned drink from his own hands and that was the first and last cup that zephiel took from our father after returning to his room zephiel started to get sick for ten days and nights zephiel lingered between life and death but murdock zephiels teacher and loyal general saved his life
 the former king never did anything after that
no  but i have heard that he had plans to get rid of murdock and zephiels mother as traitors he was scheming to murder them all along with zephiel after hearing that zephiel made believe that he was dead our father then checked the coffin to confirm zephiels death at that moment zephiel rose up from the coffin and with his sword 
  
i was but a child then so naturally i could not have understood what was going on all i knew is that after our father died zephiel never smiled again until then he was strict at times but he was always a kind and loving brother to me so 
princess 
so i  at the bottom of my heart i trust that zephiel can change that he can become that loving brother again i had to take action
i see 
 but now my brother is in a place where my words cannot reach him roy please  please stop him please stop him from inflicting pain and suffering to the people of bern and the rest of elibe
even if it may resolve to the blade
 i have made my resolve when i entrusted this task to you
i see you have my word and loyalty princess guinevere i swear to the fire emblem that i will stop king zephiel

after defeating arcard roy crossed the border and entered the land of sacae
after bern invaded the djute clan the most powerful clan in sacae became
its servant  most of those clans who stood up against the two joint forces
had already been decimated  although the silver wolf dayan the leader of
the kutolah clan has been retaliating with guerilla tactics the situation
was dire  sacae had basically become a territory of bern
now as roy set foot on the plains of sacae the warriors of the djute clan
stood in his path
the etrurian army has appeared from the west
good lure them into our territory as planned we shall show them our strength have the other clans been notified
yes although there are many clans who are expressing their discontent toward our alliance with bern further invasion by etrurian forces seems to require more attention
i see  the etrurian army should be easier to deal with than the silver wolf since the etrurian army is a invasion force
the clans will unite to fight against invaders 
right that is the law of sacae when we were up against the silver wolf no one aided us because they saw it as conflict between clans
but now that we have bern behind us we dont need their help
exactly of course there are many who dont like the idea that it is bern who has actual control of sacaes politics
yes i hear that there are many clans who agree with the silver wolf and joined forces with him
he is too stubborn his clan was defeated so he should join us it is not as if he doesnt know what happens to those who try and fight a head on battle with bern
even large cities like bulgar have been attacked and taken over by bern since they resisted
from now on those who are strong enough to manipulate the situation around them will survive like us and right now we must take advantage of the law of sacae to do so
princess guinevere  we are getting closer to bern
 yes
since we are getting closer we are clasing with soldiers from bern more and more often it will not be long before we engage in full combat with bern
  
i wish to ask you something before we do
what is that
i have been hearing rumors that king zephiel rose to the throne because he murdered the former king

i couldnt believe it you tried to stop him even by casting away your nationality if king zephiel is such a mad individual as the rumors say then why did you try so hard to find a peaceful way to end the war
  
princess guinevere i accepted the fire emblem not to use it in battle but to try and find a use for it to end this war peacefully
roy 
therefore please tell me the truth about the rumors 
i im sorry please give me some time
yes  thats right closer closer  right into our trap
argh  how could you defeat us  my calculations were flawless 
you are the silver wolfs granddaughter 
 a survivor of the kutolah clan
monke feel the kutolahs wrath
that was no easy feat
but now we have given a telling blow to our strongest enemy in sacae although im sure that there are remaining forces somewhere 
they must be meeting to plan a retaliation
can we find out where they are meeting
well i sent out a spy earlier so he should be returning soon i shall go check
  
is something wrong princess guinevere
 i have come to speak about my brother
  are you sure
yes  i want you to know before we enter bern about the tragedies that have occurred you asked earlier if my brother murdered the former king
yes 
in short it is true
 then king zephiel indeed killed his own father to seize the throne 
no
no he didnt kill his father to get the throne
no  our father was the one who tried to kill zephiel first
what then king zephiel 
he couldnt bear the abuse he was taking from our father and so he 
what  why did 
master roy we have found where the enemy is meeting   what is the matter
no it is nothing perhaps later 
 did i appear at a bad time
no its okay where is the meeting place
it is in a city called bulgar
bulgar ive heard of it
it is the largest city in sacae of course it is now under berns control
i see  all right well be heading there soon
 why did the former king try to murder his own son 
/***EOF***/
after taking back castle edessa roy turned his troops towards the ancient ruins located on the outskirts of the land there was a high chance that a divine weapon was hidden there
lord teck the enemy is advancing
there is no need to panic these ruins are surrounded by thick walls they wont be able to come in so easily
but the enemy has defeated the ilian troops and our troops one after another we do not have a high chance of winning 
we do not have to win lord murdock said that all we must do is defend this place we must hold out until the enemy gives up and leaves
the divine weapon lies in here  elffin have you heard about this place
yes i believe that the malte the frozen spear in hidden in these ruins
frozen spear 
barigan the faithful used it during the scouring
barigan all knights know about him i used to hear a lot about him during my studies he is the finest example of knighthood  this building seems to have walls everywhere is there a path leading inside
probably the remaining forces of bern buried the pathways to defend themselves
then they must not have had much time to do it  maybe the walls are weak in certain places
that is possible
all right lets do what we can
no  i must be dreaming how did you come through those walls
pass strong ones  and know berns true power 
its here the spear is here
  this is barigans spear malte  its beautiful as if its made of crystal and ice
master roy berns troops are escaping
oh all right
all right we must give chase
no dont theyre fleeing they dont have any more will to fight
but 
they have families as well theres no need to fight more than necessary
princess guinevere we will attack bern now so may i ask 
 the rest of the story
king zephiel was an outstanding pupil is his studies he was skilled in warcraft  he grew to be the perfect heir for the king
that is correct
but still the former king did not look kindly at him
in fact  our father began to hate zephiel because he grew to become such a brilliant and worthy youth
what is that supposed to mean 
our father was a man of ordinary skill and intellect therefore zephiels outstanding skill made our father cold towards him
jealousy 
and then one day our father told zephiel that ‘the next heir to bern would be guineveres husband
what thats awful
but zephiel was very patient he said that he did not mind even if he could not gain the throne but the people around us who were looking forward to zephiels ability to be a good king would not allow anyone else to be the heir pressured by the public our father lost his patience at last and 
decided to kill king zephiel 
at a banquet our father gave zephiel a poisoned drink from his own hands and that was the first and last cup that zephiel took from our father after returning to his room zephiel started to get sick for ten days and nights zephiel lingered between life and death but murdock zephiels teacher and loyal general saved his life
 the former king never did anything after that
no  but i have heard that he had plans to get rid of murdock and zephiels mother as traitors he was scheming to murder them all along with zephiel after hearing that zephiel made believe that he was dead our father then checked the coffin to confirm zephiels death at that moment zephiel rose up from the coffin and with his sword 
  
i was but a child then so naturally i could not have understood what was going on all i knew is that after our father died zephiel never smiled again until then he was strict at times but he was always a kind and loving brother to me so 
princess 
so i  at the bottom of my heart i trust that zephiel can change that he can become that loving brother again i had to take action
i see 
 but now my brother is in a place where my words cannot reach him roy please  please stop him please stop him from inflicting pain and suffering to the people of bern and the rest of elibe
even if it may resolve to the blade
 i have made my resolve when i entrusted this task to you
i see you have my word and loyalty princess guinevere i swear to the fire emblem that i will stop king zephiel
/***EOF***/
after obtaining the binding blade roy led the etrurian army to castle bern where king zephiel was waiting
zephiel the man responsible for starting this war 
inside the castle zephiel awaited with his personal guards by his side
roy prepared to charge the castle to end this war and to bring peace to elibe again 
so  murdock was defeated 
 i am sorry
 how is the etrurian army behaving
they have captured the temple of seals they are currently headed this way
i see  then we shall face them inside this castle
yes i will protect you to the death your majesty
no brunnya i have a very important task for you
what 
idunn where is idunn
 here your majesty
i will stay here and defend the castle from the etrurian army idunn you must escape and hide until this battle is over
if his majesty wishes
brunnya i want you to escape as well protect idunn
what please let me fight by your side
no  this will be a harsh battle i cannot afford to lose idunn now if idunn were lost this whole war would be meaningless
but i i 
enough brunnya this is an order are you telling me that you cannot follow your kings commands
no  im not saying that 
idunn even if i fall  i trust you understand
yes  i will free the world as you commanded
right i will not give up my dream now
yes
the etrurian army has come  i will not let you invade the throne room
i shall protect this device with my life
this is the kings castle 
master roy zephiel is residing in the throne room at the center of the castle however there seem to be some special devices that protect the throne room when invaders appear
what kind of devices
one of the captives said that at the west end of the castle there are switches that need to pulled before one can access the throne room
itll be a long detour 
there is more after hitting the switches you must hold the ‘gem in front of the throne room door to make it open
gem is it the fire emblem
most likely
i have that with me so i should head to the throne room while leaving the switches to the others 
that would be the shortest way
 but would the captives leak that kind of information so easily perhaps its a trap 
i doubt it master roy the captive also said ‘the switches and the door are all defended by berns most powerful warriors you wouldnt be able to get to the throne room even if you knew how
we need to try even if were going up against powerful enemies weve gotten strong as well we wont lose
so you have come hmph how ironic a child stepping in my path
zephiel king of bern  i will ask you this why did you start this war
 i wish to end the age of men
 what
humans  humans are filthy they flock to those with power and would not think twice about betraying trusted allies to obtain more power you must have witnessed numerous traitors in your travels am i right
  
jealousy hate greed friends even family members are driven to kill by such ludicrous emotions such emotions create fathers who try to kill their own sons to save their own flesh as long as humans control as long as humans dictate as long as humans exist this madness will never end
but look at what you are doing you are one of those humans who control others
 you know how the scouring ended
the dark dragon was defeated by hartmut 
that was the mistake
mistake
mankind should not have won just because the humans came out victorious this world came under their control and transformed into a world of madness and evil driven by accursed emotions
  
mistakes must be fixed with haste i will give the world back to the dragons i will free the world from the evil grasp of men history must be redone from the beginning to save this world from everlasting evil
then it is true that you resurrected the dark dragon
you may see that for yourself
you said you would give the world to the dragons then rule by humans would just be replaced by similar rule by dragons
the dragons you see now are weapons for battle they have no ‘self they have no cruel emotions to be driven by unlike foolish humans the world under the dragons control would be fair and peaceful
i cannot agree that such a world would be for the better good it is true that humans have many evil emotions and do terrible things but it has always been us humans who have corrected such wrongdoings
hmph you are indeed naive
i have faith in mankind i will not lose to a man who has lost faith in his people and even in himself
you shall not bar my path
 so you have defeated me  but remember  my dream shall never die  as long as humans retain control madness will persist 
zephiel 
 princess guinevere
im sorry  please leave me alone for a while 
princess 
master roy  we should let her be
 allow me
elffin
yes
 thank you i knew you had your own problems with your own nation  but you helped us i must thank you 
 i dont quite understand what you mean but if i have been helpful then you are most welcome
yes
 control over humans by humans 
zephiels words perhaps he was right in a way
 has the dark priestess been found
no  apparently she disappeared before the battle
i see  do you think shes really the dark dragon
i wouldnt know unless i actually saw her its going to be difficult to find her because she is said to clad in a black robe and no one has ever seen her up close
oh  but the battle is now over
what are you saying master roy the hard part has yet to come we must help the land recover from the war there are people out there who need our assistance
right we have work to do the real battle may be just beginning
yes we are alive so we must think about the future
no matter what hardships are to come i will never give up we have to show that even humans can construct a beautiful and peaceful world
master roy you will have me at your side always now let us leave the castle for now we must spread the word of victory
the king of bern is finished 
weve done it master roy
 perhaps it is a bit early to rejoice
what
what do you mean
we still havent found the dark priestess yet
hm perchance she escaped
  
wh what is happening
zephiels sword just flashed what was its name 
exaccus  a sword that can only be used by the heirs to berns throne 
w wait one of the legends of the scouring said  when all of the divine weapons meet in one place thus appears the dragon temple 
dragon temple 
it was the dragons headquarters during the scouring i believe
yes that is what the legends say
then the exaccus was the last divine weapon i thought hartmuts sword was the binding blade
 the binding blade may be different perhaps it is even more powerful than the divine weapons 
more powerful  what kind of power does this blade possess 
master roy the sword is glowing again look a beam of light is pointing to the south
does this mean that the dragon temple is located where this light is pointing
if the legends are true then i would assume that as well
 if the dark priestess is indeed the dark dragon  there is a high chance that she is there
all right lets go to the dragon temple
and thus the battle known later as the great movement of bern was resolved
with zephiels death bern surrendered to etruria etruria dismantled its government but after careful consideration avoided directly administering its reconstruction
with roys help guinevere took the throne and the new kingdom of bern was established many of the nobles of bern expressed their discontent at guinevere handing over the fire emblem to the former enemy but with her efforts and hard work she cut open a new path of recovery for bern
while the dark priestess was never found peace was restored and elibe was set for a new age of prosperity led by etruria
elibe regained its former peace and balance centuries after roys time the nations in elibe were united under a single flag but that is another story for another time 
/***EOF***/
to liberate the people of the western isles once and for all roy headed for jutes the isles largest city the etrurian capital was located there lord arcard the supervisor of the mining operation on the isles resided in jutes according to elffin arcard was of high birth but he held no importance in the etrurian court roy was still worried about etrurias response to his attacking the capital but he had no choice if he was going to rescue the people
s s  sir flaer
lord arcard why do you fret so
its the lycian army they come for my blood
yes they have been a thorn in berns side for some time  we knew it would be difficult if they became too friendly with etruria thats why we had you send them here it seems however they fight even better than expected
you dont understand the gravity of this situation do you realize how much ive lost thanks to their meddling all the riches ive gotten from these islands are gone  and on top of that now they want my life once they arrive my legacy is finished my hands are shaking i dont know what to do 
my how you worry i suggest you flee to etruria
you will allow it
warfare is berns strong suit we also have our secret weapon ready to brandish with it we shall erase the lycian army once and for all
but 
lord arcard once bern and etruria join forces we will have nobody to fear am i wrong
no  no youre right i leave them to you
hmph cowardly etrurian nobles if we defeat the lycian army here the isles shall be ours 
this is the capital  once we take it we can finally go home
i have already sent someone in to unlock the gate  oh there she is
the one over there dressed like a dancer
yes thats her
your majesty over here
your majesty
 i know not of what she speaks
your majesty youre late
larum why do you call me your majesty
huh  oh ah  er  well you know you look like royalty so its your nickname
  
  
my apologies lord roy this is larum a member of the resistance
youre roy everyone on the isles has heard of you they all call you the savior from the east nice to meet you im larum
whoa please leave a little distance
roy your face is all red how cute
 larum 
oh r right  theres something i should tell you ive been hearing strange rumors the people here say that an unhuman resides in this castle
an unhuman 
oh yes they say he changes form into something that looks like a dragon
a human that can change into a dragon
i dont know  but thats what i hear
we must proceed with caution
ah there you are ain
you called 
i will make a report about the lycian army to general narcian i want you to defend the castle while i am away
 understood
hm whos there    just the wind  ahem i will take my leave now i leave them to your discretion
 understood
ha ha  the lycian army will hardly be able to stand against this dragon normal weapons wont even scratch its skin these manaketes  they certainly are terrifying beasts
so thats what the unhuman is bern really has brought dragons into this world  what to do now  i guess ill pose as a soldier and observe the dragons power
la la la la la la la la la la  all the way out here in the isles west folks work to death for nobles in their nest this castles sure to be brimming with treasure all this loot was stolen anyway might as well take it off these nobles hands
the reinforcements from the south will arrive shortly
 
 th thats all sir
that guy gives me the chills 
did you handle the cave on the outskirts of town
yes sir the bandits have blocked off all entrance to it no one will be able to get to the legendary weapon now
excellent now all we have to do is clean up the lycian army
that was not an easy battle  the dragons power is truly  horrific
an unhuman  now i understand
how many of these dragons does bern have  how can we be expected to be victorious against monsters like these
lord roy keep a level head
ah 
 i understand your worries but if you panic that feeling will spread to the army you must remember that
 im sorry
it is a perfectly understandable reaction after a fight like that but  we also gained knowledge that we did not have before
what knowledge is that
dont you remember i told you arcard was rumored to be working with bern
oh thats right if berns dragons are in an etrurian castle 
arcard has indeed made a deal with bern
 that means lycia is in danger  we must return to the mainland we have to contact general cecilia and conceive a plan 
lord roy before returning to the mainland there is a matter to take care of
more bandits
no thankfully a legendary weapon is hidden in a cave not far from here if we obtain it we can fight the dragons more effectively
a legendary weapon  youre right if we can get all eight of them we might have a chance of defeating bern
yes  we must find as many as we can
then lets go to the cave and get it
r report i have a message from etruria  a revolution has broken out in aquleia the capital of etruria
what
the ones leading the revolution are high chancellor roartz and lord arcard they have captured king mordred they also say they plan to divided dominion of the continent between bern and etruria
the two strongest nations in elibe joining forces 
is general cecilia all right and what of princess guinivere 
we dont have any current information  but the three etrurian generals have parted ways and are working separately mage general cecilia has fled aquleia for the missur peninsula in the southwest
and the other generals
theyre with the revolutionaries against their will because the king was taken hostage
lord roy 
we need to contact general cecilia  princess guinivere  please be safe 
oh you
hm  you again you always come and mess up my plans do you have it out for me or something
no i just  wanted to apologize
 excuse me
the last time we met i was pretty callous i said you shouldnt steal but i didnt even realize what youd been through 
oh that whatever i dont care
but i still think what you do is wrong
youve got some nerve you know that
just give me a chance
a chance
once this war is over i promise to help rebuild your village ill be sure the taxes are put to good use too just please stop looting
   how long will that be
whenever this war ends i cant say when 
and you expect me to wait patiently until then
no all i want is your faith
 why are you so kind to me im just a thief
without you we wouldnt have escaped wagners trap maybe you didnt care about helping us but the fact is that you did you saved our lives youre more than just a thief
if things keep going like they have  i guess youll get in my way no matter where i go
as long as you appear in our path
fine you win ill stop looting battlefields
you will thank you
but im coming with you
what why
actions speak louder than words prove to me that youll be true to your promise
i wont disappoint you
raigh raigh its so good to see you
lugh  what are you doing here
im glad youre ok we were all worried about you i know you wanted to train your magic skills but you left so suddenly
i couldnt have learned magic if id stayed at that orphanage it was a miracle i picked up as much as i did
raigh  the orphanage is gone
what what happened
bern came  and burned it down
 what happened to everybody
poppa was killed trying to protect us  the young children are under the care of the st elimine church now
 i see its for the best  theyll be happier at the church than at that dilapidated orphanage
you dont have to be so callous about it
  
raigh come with us well defeat bern and then we can go back to the children
sorry not interested
but  
then again  the lycian army might be good company theyre sure to come across more dragons at some point all right you got me i suppose ill go with you
raigh 
i just want you to know one thing im not joining to avenge poppa or the orphanage
i know raigh
then stop looking at me like that
raigh what are you doing here
my thoughts exactly chad what happened to the orphanage
 i knew youd be concerned you ran off but i knew youd never forget us
i was never concerned i was just curious
 the orphanage is gone
what do you mean
berns troops burned it to the ground when they invaded lycia poppa  he couldnt 
what they killed poppa 
im going to avenge him were stuck on these isles now but i know well go back and fight bern full force some day 
  
i suppose theres no point in telling you though is there
 ill go with you
what are you serious
bern has a deep connection with the dragons i want to learn more
 so thats it fine just dont get in my way
 burn
 what

after driving off general narcian from ostia roy and company braced themselves for further attacks from bern however berns belligerent movement towards lycia suddenly stopped altogether as if to mock roy and his caution bern was also maintaining a neutral position regarding the truce offer from etruria berns sudden silence and lack of activity could only be described as eerie
with hector gone eliwood was now the only lasting power in lycia eliwood summoned the various marquesses to pherae to discuss their further actions it was decided that eliwood was to become the next leader of the lycia alliance and that a new lycia alliance army would be established the new armys purpose was not to take the offense against bern but rather take a defensive stance for lycia for his victory against bern in ostia roy was chosen to be the leader of the new lycia alliance army slowly but surely the people of lycia were starting to brighten up business was improving and peoples attitudes started to get more optimistic
around that time etruria called for lycias assistance in ridding the western isles of the outlaws and bandits making their base there lycias citizens expressed their discontent by saying that they saw no reason in sending troops all the way to the western isles but because lycia needed etrurias protection against bern they had no choice but to oblige thus roy and the lycia alliance army passed through etruria and made their way towards the western isles
the western isles are the various islands off the western coast of elibe currently they are colonies of etruria the western isles are rich in minerals and natural resources so mining is a major industry however these minerals are worth a fortune so various rogue groups have traveled there hoping to loot the mines and sell the minerals for themselves thus the people living on the western isles spend their days in constant fear of bandit attacks and roy has been sent to defeat those bandits
boss those guys from lycia theyre here
you sure
yep we just saw em arrive on the small island to the east
just as that other group said  all right theyre probably floundering around in the fog unable to see anything just sneak up on them from behind and kill em off
sure thing boss
roy im sorry that i couldnt be of help
please dont worry about it it isnt your responsibility lady cecilia
yes but even within etruria there are a lot of people voicing their discontent on how the adviser is treating lycia like servants
adviser i thought the king had made the decision to send lycia to clear out the bandits
no adviser roartz had been working with lord arcard whos in charge of the mining operation in the western isles and they decided to do it on their own without consulting the king
how can they do that
  do you remember last years tragedy in etruria
of course etrurias next heir prince mildain suddenly passed away last year
right
i never had the honor to meet him i understand that he was a very bright individual
yes  if the prince were alive etruria wouldnt be like this king mordred couldnt bear the fact that his son had died the shock was so great that he never completely recovered from it and today it seems like hes always in a different world and he doesnt really pay attention to anything going on around him or in his country roartz took advantage of this now hes basically in charge of what goes in the palace ever since then he has kept the three etrurian generals lord douglas percival and me away from the king unless theres a great emergency
but what about the time when you came to aid us in ostia
that event was an exception because percival worked with me but now 
please dont worry yourself we can return to lycia when we complete this mission anyway but may i ask you to take care of lycia while we are away
of course you can leave the lycia alliance and also princess guinevere to me
roy  i may not go with you
the battles on these islands are likely to become slugfests you can never know what will happen i think you should hide in etruria with protection from general cecilia
your highness please trust me i understand your intentions of suggesting a truce and i also promised roy that i would protect you trust me i will defend you at all costs
  i understand i apologize for being selfish roy i pray for your safety
thank you my lady i will pray for yours as well
sir scott
oh its fir sorry i had to call you in
what is all this noise about
well you see some brigands are attacking this island the people living here are in danger
what
i sent some guys over to try and stop them but the invaders are pretty tough the situation doesnt look good
i cant believe 
if only i could go out there  but i cant leave the castle so fir im sorry but 
yes i shall go and drive them off
thanks
leave it to me attacking innocent villagers  thats not forgivable
i asked another guy too so you can work with him
someone else
yeah a nomad named sin he looks frail but hes got a decent shot with his bow
are you  sin
thats me i heard the story from scott lets go
 
 
um 
what
um did you also join the fight to protect the people living here
no  i have no such interest in such things
then why
im paid to fight thats all
 
 
  i gotta keep the conversation going
um  youre from sacae right
right
what took you all the way out here
its nothing new you look like youre from sacae and youre also here
well im traveling around elibe to train myself and  oh you werent asking about me were you 
 
  whew
  im looking for somebody
who
  my clan lost to bern when they invaded sacae
  
our clan leader let me escape and he told me to find and protect his granddaughter so i left the battlefield to fulfill his request
i see  well i hope you find her
  yes
boss you sure i mean letting a girl like that fight out there 
yeah i know what im doing once shes killed we can get that sword shes carrying
sword that weird one she has
thats no ordinary sword thats the wo dao a famous katana if we can get it from her and sell it itll be worth a fortune hehe 
i see thats why you were so generous to her at first
i couldnt make a move up until now but nows a chance listen i want you to follow her when you see the chance grab the sword from her
sure thing boss
merlinus it looked like the enemy was trying to ambush us 
they must have known we were coming
something must be going on behind the scenes 
yes clearing out the bandits might be harder than we had expected ever since bern started this invasion something is different with elibe
i wonder whats going to happen from now  dragons reappearing berns sudden invasion the collapse of the lycia alliance  all of these strange things happening at once still we have to take things one at a time however tedious it may seem
now  where do we go from here
how about moving north along the coast
north  towards the mines
right ive heard that the people living on the islands are being forced into labor over there
so we must rescue them first
yes then we might be able to find out whos behind all this
well we must start somewhere
all right then lets head north
lets head west
west
ive heard theres a rebel group based there theyre fighting the bandits to protect the villagers
i see so we can visit them and gather some information on whats going on these islands
right if we just go searching blindly we wont get anywhere
i have no objections master roy
all right then lets head west
lady sue
sin  what are you doing here
i was looking for you
for me
yes that was the clan leaders orders
  what happened to our clan after i left
im sorry we didnt stand a chance against bern
  we lost
  
what has happened to my grandfather
hes continuing the struggle against bern 
i see 
i was told by the clan leader to leave and look for you
then will you fight alongside us
with you
we will be helping grandfather because this army is fighting against bern also this army saved my life earlier
understood my lady if that is your plan then i am at your disposal
thank you
fir it is you
sir noah what are you doing here
yes i joined this army a while back  whoa
what are you thinking put away your sword
sir noah i thought you were nobler than this
what
just because youre a mercenary knight  lending your services to pirates you should be ashamed
  huh
dont play dumb youre working with a band of pirates to attack the people living in this island and you call yourself a knight
um can i have a sec i think theres a really big misunderstanding 
misunderstanding you still insist 
were trying to help the villagers were supposed to go defeat the head of a pirate group i think his name was scott or something
what scott is the head of a pirate band
if you think im lying why dont you ask the pirate over here hes right behind you hiding in the bushes
pirate what pirate 
damn i better go tell the boss
hey wait
  you didnt suspect at all
no scott was really kind to me 
really rumors say that hes a very cruel man 
well my mother used to say that you shouldnt judge people by their looks 
well thats true but 
  i was lending my services to pirates  what can i do now
then you want to come along with us
what would it be okay
were always looking for more people to strengthen our army ill talk to roy about it
thank you
so the fog didnt stop you after all  but you gotta be pretty beat up by now ill finish you off
who the hell  are you youre no ordinary army
eh  the only people here are the women and children everyone else the workers have gone north to the mines they arent even allowed to sleep there they just work until they die  my brother who escaped is as thin as an old man that day he drew his last breath now that ive told you this  can you do  er sorry  ive said too much please forget all of this were leaving this island now
you saved us are you with the resistance no then youre just normal good people just as youve seen this island is swarmed with pirates and bandits but  what are we going to do rumors around here say theres a severe battle going on the west go ahead and tell them that were leaving the island 
this area basically belongs to the pirates they just steal from us all the time resistance thats useless they can do whatever they want because they have lots of support we cant fight against them like the resistance forces
the resistance is doing quite well in the north and in the west   they are always in the thick of battle which way will you go
the nearby villages  everyone in them are leaving the islands its very sad really if you want to visit youd better do it quickly you dont have time to go to both so youll have to decide
geez theres so much mist here  in these conditions you have no idea if anyone is lurking around the torch staff is useful even for those hard eyed thieves
/***EOF***/
bern surrendered with king zephiels death the great war that shook the lands of elibe was over
however roys battle was not
roy continued to search for the dark priestess suspecting that she was the dark dragon following the beam of light emitted by the divine weapons roy headed for the dragon temple
however waiting for roy in front of the temple was general brunnya the one remaining dragon lord of bern she had rounded up berns remaining troops and was waiting to attack roy their pride was at stake
a battle with the now dead kingdom of bern  roy had a heavy heart at having to battle these “ghosts”
lord jahn here is idunn please take care of her
what will you do human
we will stay here and face the etrurian army one last time
do you have enough troops
the dragon knights scattered around the continent have all returned under our cause
do you have a chance of victory
 our chances of winning are slim still we are the bern army the strongest standing force on the continent we shall at the very least show them our unbending will
will  you humans take actions incomprehensible to us at times would your will raise your chances of winning  very well i suppose we all have our methods of battle
 have you spread my message
yes those who leave the army now will not be tried for deserting whether to fight or to leave is up to each his own that was your message general brunnya
how many still remain with us
nearly all of the troops are saying that they wish to fight by your side
all our chances of victory are slim im sure many of the troops have families waiting for them they must not feel pressured to stay
we are knights of bern my lady we have no intention of bowing our heads to etruria
 i want you to expel those who are injured and those who have young children or aged parents they must not stay here
but general brunnya 
this is an order understood
master roy our troops are ready
 did the messenger return
yes  as we suspected the enemy has no intention of surrendering
did you make it clear that their safety would be guaranteed if they surrender
yes but they said ‘we appreciate your offer but we will not surrender
why bern already officially surrendered 
this person might understand 
  
princess guinevere do you understand why
yes  bern recognizes itself as being the strongest force in elibe their pride would not allow them accept defeat without fighting
  
master roy the enemy is advancing
  we have no choice we must fight merlinus send princess guinevere to the back lines 
no i will stay here i must hear their calls that is all that a traitor like myself can do 
m master karel this will become a battlefield soon 
so i see this place is not known to outsiders i thought i could be free of warfare if i stayed here 
what should we do
please do not worry i will protect the village
thank you we have nothing to fear with the sword saint on our side
i am just an ordinary swordsman rumors expand out of proportion with time so they must not easily be trusted  but this battle seems to be bigger than i thought is my sister all right 
i never knew you had a sister
i havent seen her in years but i heard a while ago that she had fallen ill i can only hope that she is leading a peaceful life with her husband and daughter 
uncle
that voice  is it fir what are you doing here
i never expected to find you here either uncle
after traveling around the continent i decided to settle here i thought i could train my sword skills peacefully in a quiet place like this 
uncle  i must tell you something mother she 
 died
yes 
  so she didnt survive the illness  im sorry i wasnt there when she needed me the most 
no its all right
but why are you here you dont seem like you have been searching for me just to say that
yes im fighting against bern now
you joined the war
i know that you dont like getting caught up in conflicts like this but i couldnt help but try and do something for those people who are suffering because of the war uncle was i wrong did i make a mistake is this not good for training my sword 
no you have not made any mistakes the path you choose on your own is never wrong in fact i shall assist you from now on
really
yes  you are right you have grown the last time i saw you you were still a toddler
uncle 
karel
bartre what are you doing here
i am currently enlisted in the etrurian army i didnt expect to see you here 
after traveling around the continent i decided to settle here i thought i could train my sword skills peacefully in a quiet place like this 
 i must apologize 
 is it about my sister
yes  i tried my hardest but 
she didnt survive 
i am truly sorry my weakness couldnt save her 
it is not your fault i must apologize i couldnt be at her side when she needed me the most 
 i must ask you for something
what is that
i want this battle to end i know you dislike warfare  but would you help us 
 i see yes i will try my hardest
thank you we have nothing to fear with such a skilled swordsman on our side
this village has none who would wish to fight please leave us in peace
are you roy
who are you
i am karel i hereby have decided to assist your army
youre the sword saint  i have heard of your skills you are most welcome in our ranks
bern will not lose even if i fall bern will rise back up and fight again
your majesty  finally i can go to your side 
melady  so you have chosen the path with princess guinevere that is one way  but i have chosen my own path as you yours i must fight to defend it
you are a knight of bern so you have chosen the path with princess guinevere that is one way  but i have chosen my own path as you yours i must fight to defend it
this is the dragon temple  the dark priestess is in here
we can count on that but something is bothering me 
what
in one of the legends of the scouring it is said that the dragon temple holds the power of the dragons
what does that mean
it is also said that the temples power protects the dragon itself
what  i dont understand
this is just my estimate but perhaps it means that the dragons inside the temple have much greater power than those on the outside
so  our tactics against the dragons until now might not work
perhaps  however if those worthy of using the divine weapons use them to their fullest potential then we may have a chance
 we have no other good ideas all right then well choose those who have the best skill to enter the temple
be careful who you choose we might not be able to leave once were inside

after defeating martel and finding their way out of the forest the etrurian army faced the blizzards common of ilias winters
ilias harsh climate was a natural defense in itself against invaders sigune flightleader of the pegasus knights that had turned to bern was preparing to attack roy coupled with ilias greatest natural weapon
captain the enemy has arrived they are on the other side of the mountain
so theyve arrived  the battle will start soon
captain are you sure
about what
the etrurian army is saying that will liberate us from bern in that case we could gain independence 
do you really believe what they say what idiot would fight a war for the sake of others once they defeat bern theyll just establish themselves as the next dictator
well 
then its better to be with bern theyre better at warfare
  
come now we have more immediate problems weve got to get rid of the enemy thats right in front of us first are the ballistas ready
yes the archers are all at their stations
good shoot at them from a distance  theyll be floundering around in the dark in this powerful blizzard observe natures wrath 
such strong wind and hail  i cant see three meters in front of me
ilias winters are always like this this is expected if youre fighting a battle at this time of the year
we must attack now so that bern doesnt have the time to recover
thats true it would be a disaster if the dark dragon really was brought back into this world
i was thinking  maybe the dark dragon is in human form as well
perhaps maybe all the dragons are in human form now ive also heard stories of dragons in human form living with people
arcadia 
hm did you say something
no nothing
i dont know anything specific but ive read in an ancient scroll that dragons started taking human form only after the ending winter
the ending winter 
youve heard about it right
yes only in legend ‘at the winder of ends the laws of nature were turned upside down day became night and summer became winter
thats it these scrolls are so old and damaged so i couldnt decipher all of them but one thing is clear the ending winter was a disaster powerful enough to bend and twist the planet
what caused it
who knows  popular belief says that the laws of nature were twisted when the dragons unleashed vast amounts of magical power but i have no idea about what really happened but it does seem certain that dragons started taking human form after the ending winter it must be more than coincidence
yes i agree
well either way the truth lies in bern
captain other pegasus knight squads are headed this way to assist us
really that would help too bad for the enemy  theyll be in a panic if they suddenly get attacked from all directions when they cant see in this snowstorm 
so you made it through this blizzard and cold congratulations but its over you shall end right here right now
 well well  so im the one to die  but maybe i had already died a long time ago 
you  youre junos youngest sister you would fight me
  
by the honor of an ilian knight  i wont go easy on you all right
yes 
thea what are you doing here oh youve joined the etrurian side
captain sigune 
you know the ilian knightly code i wont go easy on you
merlinus i need you to send this letter to bishop yoder in etruria
a letter may i ask what it says
its the story we heard from niime about the dragons
oh what did you discuss with her about the dragons
itll be long if i tell you i havent sealed the letter yet so you can look through it if you want
all right let me see 
  
is something wrong princess guinevere
 i have come to speak about my brother
  are you sure
yes  i want you to know before we enter bern about the tragedies that have occurred you asked earlier if my brother murdered the former king
yes 
in short it is true
 then king zephiel indeed killed his own father to seize the throne 
no
no he didnt kill his father to get the throne
no  our father was the one who tried to kill zephiel first
what then king zephiel 
he couldnt bear the abuse he was taking from our father and so he 
what  why did 
the dragons are indeed are mysterious species  hm what is the matter
no it is nothing perhaps later 
 did i appear at a bad time
no its okay did you send the letter
yes i read through it then sealed it and had it sent
oh  all right thanks
 why did the former king try to murder his own son

the coup detat at aquleia quickly spread out to the rest of etruria calling themselves the revolutionaries the coup detat forces sought to ally with bern and divide rulership of elibe
cecilia escaped from aquleia with guinevere forming an anti coup detat militia called the loyalists she traveled around etruria fighting the revolutionaries
however the revolutionaries had bern on their side with king mordred taken hostage great general douglas and knight general percival were also forced to join the revolutionaries with these powerful allies the revolutionaries slowly began to push the loyalists out of etruria eventually the loyalists were driven into an old castle on misul peninsula
after locating cecilia roy headed for misul meanwhile the loyalists were under joint attack by the revolutionaries and berns troops it would only be a matter of time before the loyalists were defeated 
flaer hasnt the castle gone down yet
general narcian the loyalists led by general cecilia are fighting harder than we had anticipated 
cecilia  that bitch again always interfering with my plans 
i see you are having trouble narcian
  
y your majesty when did you arrive
just now the general from etruria fights well i see
y yes  but fear not i shall force her into submission 
no let me i will fight her myself
your majesty there is no reason for you to fight 
no matter i need the exercise narcian show me to her
whats the story
the castle hasnt fallen yet master roy
good but we still have to hurry
so  you are cecilia the sorcery general
  king zephiel 
for your prowess in battle you have the honor to fight me one on one
  
too powerful 
down already i would have expected more
your majesty invincible as always
i suppose this is all one can expect from an etrurian general
your majesty  if you would allow it may i have her
hm
i have some certain bad memories with this woman i want to punish her for them
hmph very well do with her as you wish
thank you very much your majesty you there make one of the prison cells ready
yes general narcian
what bern is attacking the castle
yes general percival
 this isnt what they promised they said that they would leave etrurian matters to us etrurians
what should we do
was it general narcian who commanded the attack
no sir it was king zephiel himself
 the king himself  so bern had no intention of entrusting anything to us in the first place  we arent going to move right now tell everyone to remain at their posts
yes sir
the castle fell
yes  we were too late
is general cecilia all right
there is no report that she was killed but probably 
well if theres still a possibility that shes alive then i wont give up we have to hurry
your majesty we have found princess guinevere
bring her to me
zephiel 
guinevere so good to see you
zephiel why why did you start this war  why are you killing innocent people
innocent you say hmph jealousy vanity greed  people have been fighting over such rubbish in any nation and you call them innocent
well 
the world must liberated from such pointless things that men fight over that is the purpose of this war
but people are being brutally killed in the process
no radical change can come about without sacrifice
zephiel 
guinevere you are my only sister therefore i will forgive you this time but not the next do you understand
  
narcian wasnt the leader of guineveres guards here
yes her name is melady
very well tell her to escort guinevere back to bern also tell her to make sure that the fire emblem is returned to the temple of seals
yes your majesty
zephiel 
melady 
princess guinevere i am glad to see you safe now let us return to bern on my mount   princess
melady
wh what are you doing please put down that sword before you are hurt
melady please let me go
  should i oblige what would you do next
 i understand that roy of the lycia alliance army is near here 
 you would join the enemy
if we dont do something elibe will be overrun by berns forces  no matter what kind of reasoning my brother gives what he is doing is obvious he is forcing others into submission through power i cannot agree that that will lead to anything good 
  
melady  please let me go
 there is one thing 

there is one thing that i cannot forgive you for princess when you left bern earlier why did you not come to consult me 
well  i thought that your reputation would be damaged so 
 did you think that i would prioritize my reputation above you i am your loyal knight more than i am a knight of bern that has not changed ever since i was knighted
melady 
if you told me to let you go then i would follow your order with pleasure
melady  thank you
please halt your attacks i am not an enemy
what everyone lower your weapons
master roy she may be lying 
she may be a messenger killing a messenger goes against the knights code
  
are you general roy
 yes and you are
roy
princess guinevere you were safe
yes  i escaped with her assistance
my name is melady
roy general cecilia is alive
r really
yes she is alive although she is severely wounded she is being held captive in the castle
thank you we have to rescue her
are they ready
yes the dragons are prepared to fight at your command
narcian i will give you some dragons to fortify your militia i want you to send some of your forces to nabata
nabata the desert lands located at the center of this peninsula
right i hear that there is a hidden village in which dragons have been staying ever since the scouring
i see  then there is a high chance that a divine weapon is hidden there
exactly it must not fall into the hands of the enemy i already sent some troops to start the attack but they are outnumbered
understood your majesty i shall send some mercenaries and dragons there at once
good you can also take the girl we captured in nabata shes a shaman from the hidden village you can pry more information out of her if you need to
yes your majesty i shall have the village taken in no time
 i shall remember those words
of course
 oh  where am i   
youre still not well  you shouldnt move 
did you treat my wounds
 yes  but im not used to treating wounds  perhaps i didnt do a good job 
yes you did thank you we must find a way out of here   ow 
you shouldnt move  the wound will open again 
but i must do something 
it will be all right  i can see a light that will soon be here to help us 
light
yes  that light will aid us both  we must wait for it 
who are you 
i am sophia  a priestess of arcadia 
arcadia
i shall tell you more about it later  for now please trust me 
yes what is it general percival
were leaving
what are you sure
berns behavior is clearly an act of insult to etruria i cannot aid bern any further we will return to aquleia and inform lord douglas of this matter retreat at once
yes sir
general narcian its them the lycia alliance army
what flaer i thought you had taken care of them at djuto
i did well i left a dragon to deal with them so  i never thought that they had survived
what you fool then my reputation as your officer is also in jeopardy if i let the lycia alliance army live here people will start to suspect my ability  i must do something   but they defeated a dragon they seem to be tougher than i expected
general narcian  what should we do 
i have no choice  flaer i will return to aquleia and plan an attack on the alliance army you stay here
 m me  stay here
you dont have to defeat them i just want you to hit them as hard as you can and decrease their numbers
general narcian you would use me as a cannon fodder
flaer  to tell you the truth you would have been executed a long time ago when you failed to defend djuto im giving you a chance to prove your worth again you should be grateful hehehe 
but
or do you want me to carry out your execution right here
   yes sir  understood
good then ill leave the rest to you
percival it is good to see you again
 you 
have you forgotten my face
no it cannot be the prince is dead
 i understand your confusion after all a man who was pronounced dead is now standing before your very eyes
prince mildain you were alive 
i have troubled you for a long time now  it has been over a year since i was assassinated
assassinated your majesty did you not fall off your horse in an accident
no i was shot with a poisoned arrow first to my horse and then to me
no 
douglas noticed first and made it public that i had been killed a different corpse was placed in the coffin and everything was set up as if the assassination had been successful douglas then entrusted me to his adopted daughter and let me escape to the western isles
lord douglas did that 
even after i escaped to the west i suffered from a high fever caused by the poison for many months i was hovering between life and death so long that douglas daughter gave up hope countless times
  
the rebel forces helped me by giving me medicine ironic isnt it the very rebels who were fighting against the etrurian court had saved the life the prince himself
  
i recovered slowly and then i saw the horrors being committed by the etrurian nobles on the isles i was ashamed that i had not noticed when i was still residing on the throne
your majesty 
while aiding the rebels i was looking for a chance to return to the mainland then general roy came along and i saw my chance and that is how i ended up here
prince  i am truly thankful that you returned alive
i am with the lycia alliance army right now but i still must hide my true identity and if i still have the loyalty that you pledged to me in the past 
i am at your service your majesty my master is only one and he is you prince mildain
general percival it is you isnt it i was looking for you i am 
wait wait stop your horse listen to me
who are you
dont you know i thought wed met before
 i sort of recall seeing you at lord douglas manor 
yes thats me you do know me then
but the girl i saw there was a little more ordinary
whats that supposed to mean ah no matter anyway my name is larum im here under the command of prince mildain
prince mildain  dont be daft the prince was killed in an accident the year before
well  look at this
 that emblem  it belongs to the prince 
now do i have your attention then take a look at this letter too the prince told me to give it to you
   this is the princes handwriting  so he is alive then i hesitate no more if the prince has joined the lycia alliance army then i must do the same
wha  that was quick  i was hoping things to get more dramatic  like ‘if youre still going to stand against us then youre going to cut me down first or something like that 
damn  but i am a knight of bern i shall never surrender
remember this  there are plenty of warriors greater than i  berns army shall annihilate you for sure 
general cecilia
roy  i have made a fool out of myself in front of you
no of course not i am relieved that you are alive  but what of your wounds are you all right
yes this girl treated them for me
and you are
i am sophia  a priestess of arcadia 
she prophesized that you would be coming now you said you would tell us more once we were safe 
yes  arcadia our home lies to the east in the nabata desert  we tried to stay hidden but bern found us  and 
they attacked you
yes  i was too slow so i was captured 
i see  but why would bern be interested in a little hidden village like yours
i do not know  perhaps they found out about the dragons that live in arcadia 
dragons
yes  arcadia was built a long time ago by dragons and people who wished to live together 
such a place existed 
master roy  please save our village 
but the story does seem a bit unbelievable 
  
 in any case its probably true that her village is under attack by bern we should help them we owe sophia anyway because she helped general cecilia
 thank you 
then can you tell us more about your village and the dragons
yes  i will gladly tell you what i know 
general percival until further instructions are given we will station ourselves in this castle and prepare for further attacks from the revolutionaries
good
here we found this in the castle please take it general percival please take care of etruria
i know leave it to me
yes

following elffins lead roy headed for the cave near jutes to find the divine weapon hidden there little did they know that they werent the only ones who knew about the cave 
this is the end of the caaave treasuuure  where are yooouu  answer meee 
boss  are you sure about this the men from bern just told us to block the entrance if they catch us now theyll surely have us back in chains
you foooool well do as were told in tiiime  theyll never know that we took the treasuuure  if we block the entrance without taking the treasure its all the same anywaaay  do you really want that poor treasure trapped in here for all eternityyy
well when you put it that way  i guess youre right
boss theres an army stationed outside the cave
whaaat they want to take our treasure do theeey have the boys near the entrance take them ooouut  and grab all the treasure cheeests  we rightfully stole them fiiirst
a legendary weapon lies in this cave  its so dark in here
according to the scholar in jutes i spoke to the legendary weapon in this cave is most likely the tunder axe armads
armads  an axe this time
armads was wielded by durban the berserker who was said to be a colossus of a man a single blow from his axe surely made short work of any opponent
elffin you seem to know a lot about the eight legends and their weapons
im a bard it is my job to know myths and legends
id like to hear some of them when we have the time
of course  lord roy it seems we are not alone in this cave
we arent
there are also noxious fumes coming from the cave walls we must tread lightly
where is the legendary weapon
hmm  i hear wind blowing from behind the throne
what i cant hear it  a niche  between the floor and the wall oh it opened  so this is the legendary weapon this axe is enormous
armads  the very axe wielded by durban the berserker it certainly appears fit for a warrior of his stature
r report i have a message from etruria  a revolution has broken out in aquleia the capital of etruria
what
the ones leading the revolution are high chancellor roartz and lord arcard they have captured king mordred they also say they plan to divided dominion of the continent between bern and etruria
the two strongest nations in elibe joining forces 
is general cecilia all right and what of princess guinivere 
we dont have any current information  but the three etrurian generals have parted ways and are working separately mage general cecilia has fled aquleia for the missur peninsula in the southwest
and the other generals
theyre with the revolutionaries against their will because the king was taken hostage
lord roy 
we need to contact general cecilia  princess guinivere  please be safe

fibernia caldonia and dia all of these islands are rich in minerals and mining is the economic backbone the largest mine located in eburacum in north of fibernia roy leads his forces toward eburacum hoping to learn more about the bandits to get to eburacum one must pass a castle located nearby roy sends a messenger to sir nord lord of the castle to resuqest permission to pass through his lands because roy and company are in isles on etrurias request they dont anticipate trouble in gaining nords support but not everything is as simple as it appears 
what can you tell me about that spy from the resistance
you mean the dancer called larum we threw her in the dungeon sire
has she told you anything
no she keeps insisting that shes not affiliated with the resistance
a liar is she perhaps i could interrogate her myself 
sir nord
what is it
there is a messenger here from the lycian army
ah the army that was sent to clean up tthe bandits on the isles
it seems that they want permission to pass through to eburacum
 lord arcard told us to get rid of the lycian army in their time here heh heh heh  if we impress lord arcard he may see fit to reward us desploy the troops and finish them here
yes sire  and the messenger
kill him
understood sire
be sure to deploy the ballista use it to defeat the lycian army before they even reach you
yes sire
just make sure the enemy doesnt get hold of it
lord roy soldiers are flowing out from the castle
are there bandits around here
no they seem to be heading towards us actually
 what about the messenger
he hasnt returned  which may mean the worst 
he hasnt returned why is sir nord attack us
the enemy draws near  lord roy what are your orders
 i guess we have no choice but to fight we might learn something if we can reach the castle
yes milord youre right
all right storm the castle but have mercy some of their soldiers may be willing to listen
geese  youre really leaving
the lord of that castle killed my mates i wont let their deaths be unavenged
you mean that crew that was always with you 
yeah  they were taken to the mines and told that they would be given work but they were all worked like slaves until they  died
  
maybe they werent the brightest bunch but they were good people  and they were killed  just like that 
do you intend to avenge them on your own
is there something wrong with that
no  but i thought you were going to go back to your merchant business
yeah well ive got bigger problems now  once my mates get their revenge and once the war subsides maybe i will
 we wont forget you geese you and your crew risked your lives to get us food and supplies if you ever need anything well be here
maybe ill take you up on that if im still alive  thanks
yeah what you got something to say to me
i want to ask you why youre fighting against the soldiers
who wants to know
roy leader of the lycian army were here on behalf of etruria 
youre with etruria then youre the enemy get ready to die
slow down were fighting the castles troops too
and yet etruria sent you i dont understand
i dont either we were sent by etruria to get rid of bandits here but somethings strange
 you say youre fighting the castles troops im for hire if youll take me
what
im a seafaring man so i know both the land and sea around the isles you look a bit lost so i could be a good guide for you
that would help but why
i want to help with your mission to be honest im a pirate so im probably the type you were sent to get rid of but i only go after the rich they have more than their fair share anyway
well then if youll join us were pleased to have you we dont know this area at all so its been difficult thus far
sounds like we have a deal leave it to me
 this is it lads can you taste it youll have your vengeance and after you do i might just tag along with this roy fellow for a while 
gonzalez gonzalez where are you
here  i here 
theres a village to the north right along the mountain do you understand
understand
it may be a resistance base i want you to go and burn it to the ground village and all
village and all 
good you understand this is the only use i have for a lump such as you now get goung you halfwit before you forget your orders
i i 
forget how to speak are you trying to say something
n no 
such a monsterous face and yet such a needlessly compassionate heart he will learn the value of destroying a village firsthand
excuse me
w what you doing i am enemy
i know  but theres such a look of sorrow in your eyes
 there is a village near mountain you know
yes i know it
tell people escape i have order destroy village i 
what dont the villagers are innocent 
no it order i must
it sounds to me like you should leave the person who gave you that order
leave
yes you can fight with us were protecting the villagers
no  i monster  people mean to me  people throw stones  people say go away  you a monster  not human 
thats horrible of course youre human youre a very kind hearted man i can tell please come with us dont be afraid
me afraid i never afraid everyone afraid of me i not afraid
no you are afraid youre afraid that people will throw stones and call you a monster
  
but you dont have to be afraid of us everyone in our army is nice they wont do that to you be brave  take that first step and youll never have to be afraid again
you made it all the way here but i shall take your pathetic lives 
death i feel my life draining away 
im worried about larum i hope shes all right she smuggled us weapons so we could defend ourselves even when we begged her to hide she refused and kept helping us heres an axe that she brought us its a strange one  its strong against swords but weak against lances id gladly trade it for her safety though so please take it 
brigands and pirates  they were all just as innocent as anyone when they were young maybe if you spoke to some of them you could make them understand
lord roy  we couldnt find any evidence explaining sir nords aggression
but now we know for certain that somebody wants our heads
i think we should contact etruria about this
yes ill send a message to general cecilia
excuse me lord roy we found a girl imprisoned in the dungeon she wishes to speak with you
to me let her pass
yes milord
youre roy the one whos here to clear out the bandits
yes thats me
i beg you roy please rescue my friends
whoa easy there
hey get off of him
c calm down and tell me everything you say your friends are in danger
my name is larum im part of the resistance force on the isles
the force thats fighting against the bandits
yes  actually no
no
thats part of it but the real enemy is etruria they work with the bandits to squeeze every bit they can out of the people here
what is that true
the lords living here take people into the mines and work them to death theyre allowed no rest even if theyre sick or injured
 thats terrible 
were fighting etruria to stop the abuse our next plan was to attack the mine at eburacum and rescue the people there but but 
calm down you can tell me
a villager here leaked the details of the plan he was probably tortured  i have to go to the mines before the resistance is ambushed
then theres no time to spare well backup the resistance force and rescue the people being forced into labor
truly you will thank you roy
whoa l larum
hey i said get off of him
here roy use this sword
what is it
its called a wyrmslayer its effective against wyvern riders and its said it was used against dragons too who can say though it might come in handy it belongs to echidna the leader of the resistance youre helping us though so you can have it for now

hearing of the rebellion roy hurried his pace towards ostia according to the information he had gathered on the way general leygance one of lord hectors advisors had started a rebellion with liutenant devias to sell ostia to bern lilina had been captured and taken hostage by leygance she was then imprisoned inside castle ostia because leygance thought that he could use her for something later on
hearing that report roy and company entered ostia in an effort to rescure lilina ostia the largest and most active city in lycia was to become a battlefield stained with blood 
devias how is the city doing
theyve been quiet so far sir but the mercenary knights from ilia that hector hired are showing no submission
hmph whats wrong with them were telling them well pay more
well ilias mercenary knights are known never to betray their masters
you fool i know that general narcian is going to arrive soon if we dont have ostia under our control by then hell laugh at us
o of course sir
we may have to use lilina to bargain with the mercenary knights  if we use her as a hostage they should surrender to us but that must be a last resort we will fight them ourselves with the help of dragon knights sent from bern to crush ilias forces devias i want you to clear out the town and guard the castle gate i will defend the inside of our castle
yes sir
merlinus around how many of ostias troops have joined the rebellion
quite a few im afraid they have forgotten their loyalty towards lord hector and are simply flocking towards the one with more power which is bern how disgraceful
i see 
but there is good news too master roy there is a band of mercenary knights from ilia that are willing to join forces with us and attack the rebels
mercenary knights from ilia
yes they said that they signed a contract with lord hector that they would fight bern alongside ostias troops
thats fortunate but when the mercenary knights hear the news that lord hector has passed away that contract would probably be broken do you think its possible for us to officially hire them into our service
i would have thought so too master roy however they already knew of lord hectors death they offered to fight alongside us anyway
why do they go that far when they are mercenaries
ilia is a snowy area with a harsh temperature so the land isnt very arable therefore sending out mercenaries to fight for pay is one of ilias main sources of economic input ive also heard that mercenaries from ilia put trust over anything else and that they never betray their employers the rumors are true i see
then they should be powerful allies
yes fortune is still with us master roy but  i heard from the mercenary knights that one of the three dragon lords is coming here with a legion of dragon knights if they should join the rebels then our chances of defeating them would become extremely slim
roy what are you going to do
  the kingdom of etruria might join us
etruria would that be possible
general cecilia the sorcery general of etruria was my teacher in battle arts while i was studying in ostia i have a feeling she would be willing to join forces with us
i would object master roy if we depend on etruria to solve our own matters in lycia well be sure to be their laughing stock for decades
yes i know that  but this is truly an important matter for lycia i think that we should go for the safest and most definite option rather than worry about the consequences and do nothing which would most likely lead to the extinction of lycia
  lord roy
we have to move quickly ill write a letter to general cecilia merlinus i need you to get the letter to her as quickly as possible
  yes lord roy you are right i shall send the letter to her as soon as you are ready
thanks all right everybody lets retake ostia
it looks like the lycia alliance have started attacking the rebels all right were going too lets go and drive off the rebel forces
will do sir
wait wheres noah
ummm i think he went to the arena a while ago he said hes coaching a young girl in the sword arts
that noah a coach thats unusual  well no matter once he finds out were attacking the rebels hell catch up to us
yup
all right lets go
looks like theyve started attacking the rebels well then fir i should get going soon
thank you for coaching me sir noah
no problem but i must say you surprised me you suddenly came up to me and said i want to fight a match with you
i im sorry sir noah it was my first time in the arena 
if you asked another person you would have been killed you need to look your opponent over very carefully before choosing to fight
and you must not hesitate to surrender if it looks like youre going to lose right
exactly you can always win back your money but if you lose your life its all over
yes
what are your plans now are you going to stay here and work on your sword skills
no im planning to travel to the western isles
the western isles why
theyre building a new mine there and i heard that a lot of people are going there looking for work they must be strong people if theyre miners so i thought it would be the ideal place to find people to fight for my training and besides 
besides
the western isles is where my mother first met my father shes dead now but when she was my age she was also traveling around the world training her sword skills
i see  you surprise me again

all you were saying at first was i want to become strong i want to become strong right so i thought swordplay was all you had interest in but you were training because you wanted to be like your mother im so happy that you do have a cute side
what   sir noah please dont tease me
hahahaha
the reinforcements should be arriving from the south soon hehe  that lycia armyll be shocked when they get hit from behind
okay the city should be under control by now now we have to recapture castle ostia and rescue lilina
master roy we are currently breaking down the gate to enter the castle i understand that you want to get in quickly but we are working as fast as we can so please be patient
  lilina
speaking of lady lilina  what do you think of lord hectors story master roy
you mean about the dragons they werent myth they were real  lord hector is one of the greatest battle tacticians in lycia and his army was decimated in such a short time 
well berns army is among the strongest in elibe i say those dragon knights are indeed very formidable opponents
of course the dragon knights must have been tough enemies but the real dragons  i cant even imagine how powerful they must be the weapons that are effective against dragons  i wonder where they are
i presume they must be the divine weapons
so if we use those weapons we can fight the dragons effectively but i wonder what a divine weapon is doing in ostia
perhaps lady lilina knows that hmm i do wish to know as well oh master roy our men have finished knocking down the gate we can enter now
all right charge we will rescue lilina no matter what
excuse me sir are you sir zelots of the ilia mercenary knights
and you are
my name is roy im the leader of the army thats fighting the rebels
you impressive  i was expecting somebody a little older
i am here respecting the will of lord hector
lord hector  weve lost a valuable person he was a true warrior
yes and i want to retake ostia for lord hectors sake and lilinas sake 
all right then well help you as much as we can
thank you for your assistance
you can thank me after weve retaken the castle come we must concentrate on the enemy right now
yes
youre one of the ilian mercenaries right
hmmm yeah so what
my name is roy i lead the lycia alliance army 
ah then im going to be under your leadership from now
what is that okay
hm
you dont have to check with your commander first
ah dont worry about that he said we were to join with the lycia alliance
but did he really mean 
really mean what were in the middle of a battle if you take the time to check every little thing with your commander youll be dead im not going against his orders though
 all right
youre one of the ilian mercenaries right
yeah and what do you want
my name is roy im the leader of the lycian alliance army
oh i heard about you  from now on is it all right if i join with you
are you sure thats all right
what
dont you have to ask your commander if its okay
he told us to join with the lycia alliance army thats enough for me
but did he mean like this
this is a battlefield if you take your time to check everything with your commander then you wont be able to act quickly in trouble its not good to disobey orders but outside of that you can play it by ear
i see  thanks for telling me
trec we are going into the lycia armys service
okay sir
hm not the most enthusiastic response you dont like the idea
eh no i have no problem with it
oh all right just thought id ask
lycia  nah we shouldnt have much trouble
noah
sir zelots im sorry that im late
i heard you were coaching a young girl in the sword arts
yes  she was a little naive so i couldnt help it
is she not with you
she said she was headed for the western isles
i see pity i thought she might have been of some help if she were still here but you who ordinarily wouldnt start nosing around into other peoples matters a coach now that is unusual
do you think so sir
yes trec and i were joking around saying that you may have fancied the girl but it is in the arena so that probably wasnt the case
general zelots
trec what is it
i just met with the lycia alliance leader
ah did you why didnt you tell me then
oh not like that i just met with him now
thats fine then its time for us to submit to his leadership trec i leave the negotiations with the lycian alliance to you
yes sir
general zelots
ah its noah you were at the arena werent you
yes sorry im late
doesnt really matter  weve just started fighting i havent talked to the lycia alliance army yet
oh dont worry i just got done talking to their leader
really then its time for us to submit to his leadership noah i leave the negotiations with the lycia alliance to you
yes sir
you  you beat berns dragon knights ergh  ill not let you pass here
general leygance  please be careful  these people are  strong 
bors you returned
causing a rebellion during lord hectors absence that is unforgivable
this  this is the torch staff it creates light in the foggiest places if youre in a fog you cant attack or see anything it helps to have this when it works against you
a while back some unknown person was dying in the street when i helped him he gave me this sword really strange person but nice  hm heres the sword you can have it just take good care of it
hey you look at this great thing i made it fires arrows much further than a normal bow its very useful right right just like i thought ill give it to you guys i want it with someone that knows how to use it
are you going to help lady lilina heres something that can cure injuries from a distance if lady lilinas hurt please help her 
be careful general leygance is allied with bern now he went and slaughtered all those who resisted him  but i saved my own hide please take this its proof for heroes give this to them and keep fighting to protect ostia 
this town used to belong to lycia but now look at it  you guys are out to restore ostias former glory right then take this gem  if you sell it it will catch a high price please help ostia
social knights paladins nomads  all those guys riding on horses  this spear the knight killer is effective against them theres a lot of horsemen in the rebel army so use this against them
medicine medicine this cures anything no matter what kind of wounds you have this will restore you completely the contents are a secret though  cant tell you or ill get in trouble hmm you dont want the medicine aww ill give you some for free if you buy it next time

bern has a trio of elite generals called the three dragon lords two of these three general brunnya and general narcian have attacked castle araphen and nearly decimated the lycia alliance army
although the morale of the pherae army went down severely roy led his group towards castle araphen to find survivors and check the damage
your majesty we have captured the enemy leader
good bring him before me
you  zephiel the king of bern damn you 
ah lord hector i must praise your ability of putting up such a good fight against two of our dragon lords i suppose they do not call you the leader of the lycia alliance for nothing however you were not good enough pray while you can for you end here
why 
hm
bern and lycia  we were always on good terms with each other even when you took the throne we have always paid our respects towards bern 
respect dont be ridiculous lycia  no this entire continent must go under my rule that is the only way to liberate this world i lack the time to be worrying about such trivial matters as respect
to liberate  this world what do you mean 
it is of no importance to you you are going to die anyway someone take him away throw lord hector into the dungeon
yes sir
your majesty i will now return to the sacae plains
yes you may be on your way
  one thing before i leave your majesty i beg your pardon but i do not think that it is such a good idea to put too much trust into sinister people 
do you mean idunn
yes our soldiers call her the dark priestess and do not approve of her presence i understand she is a shaman of great powers however 
brunnya do you not have faith in me
  yes of course i do your majesty i just thought that 
then all you do is follow my orders understood
  yes i will do whatever his majesty wishes
do you not have faith in me dear dear the things i say sometimes 
so lord hector is still alive
yeah thats for sure i saw some of berns soldiers take him into the castle
chad was it do you know the inside of castle araphen well
i guess  wait are you guys planning on going in to save lord hector i wouldnt try that if i were you the bulk of berns forces are gone but there are still a decent number of soldiers in the castle you know it would be suicide to try and charge them with your army
perhaps but we cant afford to lose lord hector and you said that their main forces are gone right then there is a chance we could win
i see  then i guess ill go along too i can show you around the castle
what no no dont feel pressured if you could just explain what the interior of the castle looks like 
i also want revenge against bern cmon let me go with you
all right then ill be counting on you
of course leave locked chests and doors to me
  master roy  i beg your forgiveness of my brothers doings  i didnt think he would invade lycia so soon 
my lady theres no point in dwelling over the past please do not blame yourself besides lycia is still intact if we could get our leader lord hector out of harms way we can unite lycia once again and fight we must recapture castle araphen for all of our sakes  and for lilinas sake 
  
lets go

narcian what is causing all that noise

your highness should we use the dragons
no i do not wish to put the dark priestess through any trouble do not worry we can handle them by ourselves 
  
not this time idunn send the dragons back to bern as we planned
yes if his highness wishes it to be so
  
i will be off to bern soon as well narcian im going to leave lycia up to you
  what shall i do with the remaining forces of the lycia army
kill all those that stand against us
  does that include women and children

leave that to me sire hehehe 
hmph i wonder what his majesty sees in that idunn girl well i think ill be going as well slater im trusting this castle with you
are you leaving
yes one of the marquesses who turned against lycia has a special gift for me he says its a girl from etrurian nobility or something  hehehe 
from etruria she must be very beautiful then
yes the marquess tells me shes still young but very beautiful
i would be looking forward to it if i were you sir please be careful on your way there
you be careful too slater dont you dare get defeated by these remainders of lycias army if you do i will personally tear you apart
  have mercy sir 
hahahaha 
excuse me youre from the lycian army right please let me fight with you i dont have any useful information but i can use a bit of magic please let me help you
chad youre okay
lugh what are you doing here

oh  wheres everybody else are they all right
yeah the elimine church is going to take care of them for a while
what about you

  the same reason as you
 lugh youre not thinking of 
i can use some magic you know when i borrowed the fire spell from fathers room
lugh dont force yourself you cant hurt people can you
but 
im going to avenge father lugh you should stay with the others
im not going to hide anymore everyone everyone just disappears when im not looking father you even lleu  i want to fight to protect the people that i care for i want to protect and not be just protected
lugh  all right then lets crush bern as soon as possible and go meet everyone else
yeah
youre the remnants of the lycian army right here take this and go quickly there are a bunch of bern soldiers here bern may govern this whole area but were friends of lycia
i i wont lose if i dont win    oh  no 
sir narcian  please  have mercy 
master roy we have found lord hector in the dungeon level
really is he all right
hes severely wounded 
roy 
lord hector what an awful wound  we must treat it here lean on my shoulder
its all right  i wont last much longer 
lord hector 
i was taken by surprise  i never would have guessed that bern had resurrected the dragons 
dragons
yes  the dragons that we humans fought in the past 
the scouring i have heard of it a long time ago two races that each had half of elibe the humans and the dragons fought over total control of the continent 
right  the eight heroes  defeated the dragons and led us humans  to  victory 
how did bern use the dragons 
i  have no idea  but  the dragons had control of what is now bern in the past  and hartmut one of the eight heroes  is the founder of bern  perhaps  the reason  lies there 
lord hector
roy  go to ostia    you must  lead what is left of the lycia alliance army  instead of me 
me  but 
dont worry  in ostia  are weapons that  are effective against dragons 
weapons
i have already told this to lilina  please take care of her too  she  may seem strong  but she is still a child  please  give  her support 
  yes i will
  lilina  just  one  more   time 
lord hector

after roy captured aquleia other etrurian powers slowly began to change their
views and express their anti coup detat opinions  driven away from their
palace roartz and arcard fled to sacae which was still under berns control
sacae is the vast plain covered land in the center of the continent  before
bern invaded the various tribes there led nomadic lives
the etrurian army joined the lycia alliance army to form a joint etruria lycia
union army  the decision was to head for sacae to get rid of the remaining
coup detat forces and also attack bern who was behind them
thinking that some etrurian knight groups would not approve of being seen as
under the lycia alliance army roy officially named the new union the etrurian
army and became its commander
roy led the division responsible for entering sacae  the sacae people are wary
of outsiders in the first place but even worse brunnya another of the three
dragon lords had gotten the largest tribe in sacae the djute clan under
submission  the warriors of the djute tribe and brunnyas elite bern troops
stood in front of roy as he set foot on sacaes soil
so  narshen fell at aquleia
yes general brunnya it has been confirmed
i see 
l lady brunnya  what will become of us
please do not worry lord roartz you have assisted us so we will not abandon you i shall assure that
thank you 
then lord arcard you will be assigned the defense of this land talas lord roartz your post will be the city of bulgar
talas w wait this is too close to aquleia the enemy will be here in no time
then all must do is defeat them this is an ideal post to set up a defense since it is so close to aquleia the enemy will be sure to attack we can be most prepared here
well thats true 
bulgar that is deep in the foreign lands of sacae i hear that there is much rebellion among the nomads 
then force them into submission is that not your specialty
well 
rumors say that the enemy commander roy is still a boy still he has prevailed through many scandals and conspiracies to rebuild the lycia alliance army and strengthen it further than ever compared to his hardships yours are close to nothing am i wrong
  
then i must be off i will be praying for your success
  
 are you sure my lady
those two are disgraceful cowards who cast away their homeland to save their own skins we must not assist them any more than necessary they should be thankful that they are getting the land and troops that they are
  
we are soon approaching the etrurian border
bishop yoder thank you for everything thanks to the church we were able to proceed thus far with ease
please if you had not captured aquleia we would be suffering from persecution under bern this is nothing in comparison to what you did for us
i am glad that i could be of use to you
now  may i ask you a very important favor
yes anything that i am capable of
if you find out anything else about the dragons 
i understand if i discover anything new i will report to you immediately
thank you  ah yes i must tell you something else the lands around here  they are surrounded by high mountains and valleys and now that night has fallen 
the perfect setting for an ambush 
exactly castle talas up ahead is under berns control
all right i will be careful
yes please then may saint elimine bless the etrurian army
w why why is this happening to me
i am an etrurian noble i must not die here  guh
klein you would betray me
you are the one who betrayed etruria lord arcard
d douglas you had turned to the enemy 
lord arcard  what a pathetic ending for one who became so powerful
well last year i didnt think we would be fighting in sacae either fate can turn out in the most unlikely ways  and that might be true for bern as well
  master roy what is it that you are holding in your hand
oh this this is the fire emblem
oh  so this tiny gem is 
princess guinevere wanted me to keep it it seemed difficult for her to give it to me  she must have been truly hoping to end the war peacefully until now where this is no hope left 
hmm  trust between siblings it didnt seem likely on the outside
why not
the enemy is zephiel king of bern it is said that he murdered his own father so i didnt think that he would be moved by mere family relations 
what he killed his own father
didnt you know master roy zephiel took the throne because the former king had died but because the former kings death was so sudden there are many rumors going around
and one of them is 
 that king zephiel assassinated him
 does princess guinevere know about this
she must know something about it if not all
/***EOF***/
at the request of king mordred roy headed for the tower of the saint on the
outskirts of aquleia
the tower of the saint was a place of worship for saint elimine one of the
eight heroes and in the tower lay various holy objects relating to her
however this sacred tower was now under the control of bishop windham who had
rebelled against the elimine church by roartzs orders
lord roartz fled then what will happen to me who turned against the church
sir lord roartzs message is that he ‘doesnt want to waste time dealing with useless bishops who cannot even tame the elimine church
this is all because that damned yoder got in my way 
well yes  but even if you tell me about it 
 all right fine  this is our last mission if we are to die then the lycia alliance army will be going down with us prepare the heavenly arrows
b but bishop windham if we use those they may hit our allies as well
quiet i do the ordering around here  i shall show them hahaha 
this is the tower of the saint saint elimines weapon the aerial spell book lies here
lord douglas thank you for helping us when we were your enemies just a while earlier
you do not have to thank me the king ordered me to help you do not worry about it
  
besides you are the saviors of etruria it is an honor to be able to fight along your side
lord douglas 
die all of you everything shall be destroyed
hahaha haha ha 
master roy i think we have found the spell book
lord douglas is this 
yes this is it this is the pinnacle of light the aerial spell book saint elimines weapon
may we use it
the king told you to use anything in the tower that you might find useful and the elimine church is on our side as well if we still have trouble then i can negotiate with them
all right thank you lord douglas
princess guinevere i must speak with you
 is it that we must attack bern as well after etruria
 did someone inform you
no  but i knew that it would happen eventually
 we cannot leave bern running around freely any longer i know that it will be hard to see your nation invaded but 
 roy i will give this to you
what is this
it is berns greatest treasure the fire emblem
what
in the south of bern lies a temple called the temple of seals in it lies the sword that our founder hartmut used
is it one of the divine weapons
i believe so it was a sword made to slay the dark dragon the leader of the dragons during the scouring however it held power so immense that it was sealed away after the war the fire emblem is the key to break its seal
the key 
my brother is trying to force the world into submission through power that is not forgivable no matter what the reason
  
to stop him all we can do is defeat the dragon at his side
princess guinevere 
 my name shall be stained in history as the woman who betrayed her nation
no 
i shall be hated all my life as a traitor roy promise me one thing when we invade bern promise me that you will not harm the civilians 
i promise please trust me
 thank you

roy vowed to protect lilina forever however with bern coming full force at them roys army wouldnt stand a chance therefore they decided to try and take the divine weapons before bern got their hands on them
lilina showed them to a cave in the outskirts of ostia where the first divine weapon was hidden the cave located at the foot of a volcano was going to be a major ordeal for roy
b boss an armys invading our cave
what how many of them are there
dunno boss i hope there arent too many of them 
thats strange  the lycia marquesses should be having bigger problems than dealing with bandits like us
well what do we do
they probably dont know much about this cave anyway just lure them into stepping on the floor tiles where hot lava spurts and get rid of em
roy over here the divine weapon is located on the other side of this lava pit
lilina are you all right have you calmed down
well  maybe im not fully all right but now isnt the time to be sad i need to protect ostia like my father before me
all right  good for you lilina
im okay because youre with me roy 
what did you just say something
no nothing anyway ill tell you what i know about this divine weapon the one here is the sword that was used by roland one of the eight heroes
that roland  is that king roland the first king of ostia
right hes our ancestor this sword is called the blazing sword or the durandal
the durandal  the name has a strange echo to it so roland used the durandal to fight the dragons during the scouring
thats how the legend goes they also say that after the war ended roland returned to his hometown of ostia he raised the durandal high above his head and the land that had become barren after the war suddenly became lush with vegetation and life again
wow  that must be some sword
well its a weapon that can defeat dragons it must have some special powers in it
yes  oh yeah i heard that a group of bandits has made its base here is it going to be all right
 is what going to be all right
i mean theres always the chance that they might have taken the durandal
no dont worry only those who are rolands successors know how to remove the durandal from its sheath
oh okay then everything is fine all we have to do is to get rid of the bandits and obtain the durandal
sigh what are you guys doing in a place like this oh well but since youre already here  i cant let you guys go can i
crap  i knew this would happen 
roy here it is
so this is the durandal  its a very large sword i dont think many of us are going to be able to swing it
but history has it that roland was a small man i think its the persons skill that determines whether he can use it or not
then if i become better with my sword i can use it as well
well  maybe
maybe come on  at least say probably
hee hee
master roy berns dragon knights have appeared at castle ostia
what theyre here already
hehehe  are you roy i must thank you for getting rid of that idiot leygance for me now you will leave ostia to me
dont be ridiculous who would give ostia to the likes of you
oh then do you wish to fight us with that sad little group of yours i shall annihilate you as i did with hector
damn
thats enough
general narcian a legion has arrived from etruria
i can see that you fool why 
i am percival knight general of etruria yesterday mage general cecilia informed me that ostia had requested etrurias protection
what 
you seem discontent we are prepared for battle but can those dragon knights of yours stand a chance against all of us
you 
i am cecilia mage general of etruria ostia is now under our protection
argh  you  you 
general narcian please control your temper general percival is one of the strongest warriors in etruria and with general cecilia here as well well be slaughtered
i know were leaving cecilia is it watch your back from now on
are you general roy of the lycia alliance army
y yes i am in charge of the alliance army in the place of lord hector
i see lycia is in a time of hardship our king also sends his words of regret for lord hectors death
thank you for your consideration if etruria hadnt helped us  ostia would be under berns control now thank you very much
im not the one to thank i simply followed my kings orders you should thank cecilia who went against the king to help you
she  disobeyed the kings orders
yes now isnt that something well i must be off two of the three etrurian generals shouldnt be leaving the country for so long cecilia can you take care of the rest
yes thank you percival you can leave the rest to me
whew  general percival  now hes someone
nervous were you
general cecilia it is good to see you again
how are you doing roy you look a little tired but you seem okay
yes thanks to etruria we were able to avoid disaster
im glad we made it here in time
im sorry i put you through a lot of trouble
no its going to be beneficial for etruria for ostia to go under our protection
beneficial
yes berns been acting aggressively these days as you know we also want to do something about it but since we havent been directly invaded we have no reason to go to war with them but if bern gets any stronger the balance of powers would be shattered
so when ostia requested protection you saw it as a good reason to declare war on bern
right we just did what would be best for us you dont need to feel that youre in our debt
yes
so you shouldnt thank us
understood i wont well anyway come in and meet the rest of our army
  hes gotten so bold in the short time that i havent seen him well he is a boy after all

in the hidden village arcadia stands an ancient temple  one of the divine
weapons is said to be hidden in it
roy and company were quick to follow berns troops who had already found their
way into the temple 
havent you found the divine weapon yet
we think it is inside this altar but it wont open 
break it open then we dont have much time
but we must also deal with the enemies that have entered the temple we dont have enough manpower to use force on the altar
very well defeat the enemy first then we shall examine the altar with leisure
this is the underground of the desert theres so much water
this is close to a large source of groundwater  that is why plants and animals can live near here 
i see so thats why you were able to build a village here still how did you find such a convenient place like this
athos  archsage athos is the one who led us here 
what do you mean athos of the eight heroes
yes  after the scouring athos traveled around elibe  at the end of his journey he arrived at our village in which men and dragons were living in harmony  but he said that it would only be a matter of time before we were found 
so he led you here 
yes  and he hid his divine weapon inside this temple 
can we use his divine weapon
yes  athos told us to use his weapon to protect arcadia  and your fight against bern will lead to our safety 
all right thanks
some of the temples passages may suddenly sink into the water  please be careful 
i wasnt expecting you to fight so well against all of us
where did you learn to fight like this 
the divine weapon is here inside this altar 
  it wont open
this altar is made so that only those of the village may open it  please allow me 
okay
   here  this is the divine weapon 
athos divine weapon then 
yes  the infernal element foreblaze 
who are you how did you enter here
my name is roy i came with sophia to protect this village
with sophia  then it was you who drove off berns soldiers oh  please forgive my impudence i am the elder of arcadia
elder  then are you the dragon
dragon  they once called me that but that is a story of a time long since past
  
let me see  the only real dragon we have is fa right here
hi 
this little girl is a dragon
yes although she is far from her mature form
elder do you know anything about the dragons in bern
what there are dragons in bern
yes we have seen them
why  dragons do not exist anywhere except here
elder if i may
what is it igrene
sophia said that she could detect evil energy coming from berns troops that may have something to do with the dragons master roy says he saw in berns army
perhaps  but i am too old to detect such energy now
energy what is that
sophia is half dragon half human that gives her the ability to detect the pulses emitted from other dragons but because she cant detect them clearly she only said that she felt a force twisted and unnatural
i think that we should look into it elder if you would allow it i would like to join master roy and look at berns dragons myself
i really do not want to deal with matters of the outside  but this is a time of emergency well then roy will you take her
certainly
i am igrene the guardian of nabata i have confidence in my skills with the bow i believe i may be of some help in battle
thank you
fas going too
what are you saying of course you may not there is no telling what could happen if your existence were exposed to the world
  
well then lets go
yes
 fine  fa will just follow them anyway

roy ventured deep inside the temple of seals apparently there was something else hidden there other than the binding blade
however pereth one of murdocks best lieutenants was already inside the temple and waiting to ambush roy
so the battle above the ground was lost 
yes
i would have liked to be at lord murdocks side when he fell
 we share your feelings
however we have an important mission from lord murdock we must defend this divine weapon the silencing darkness apocalypse must not fall into the enemys hands
theres a divine weapon under here
yes i believe so i have only heard rumors within the army but apparently there is a spell book here that was placed to protect the temple of seals from intruders
this place is guarded by berns troops as well it is highly probable that the spell book that she speaks of is a divine weapon
yes were going up against zephiel soon  i want to have as many weapons as possible ready before we enter the castle we have to get that book
i have also heard rumors that there are traps all over the underground level
traps
yes apparently they are crafted so well that we have no chance of finding them before they go off perhaps thieves would be better at spotting the traps  anyway please be careful
all right lets be wary
princess guinevere is this where the divine weapon is
probably  i have only heard rumors that there is a spell book here that was placed to protect the temple of seals from intruders
this place is guarded by berns troops as well it is highly probable that the spell book that she speaks of is a divine weapon
yes were going up against zephiel soon  i want to have as many weapons as possible ready before we enter the castle we have to get that book
i also understand that there are numerous traps placed in the underground level
traps
yes they are designed so well that it would be impossible for us to find them perhaps thieves would be better at finding them  please be careful
yes princess we will be careful
darkness from an age long forgotten  i will show you its power
dark  it is getting so dark 
elffin do you know what this spell book is
 it is probably the apocalypse spell book
apocalypse
yes it is also known as the silencing darkness brammimond  the most mysterious of the eight heroes used it
brammimond  i only know his name
we dont even know if brammimond was male or female old or young none of the ancient scrolls say anything specific about brammimond
i see 
  
roy is something wrong
no i was just thinking
about what
i was wondering why theres always some kind of trap where a divine weapon lies
 perhaps it is to warn people that their power is too great to be dealt with lightly
but still  the traps are so carefully set there must be other reasons
  
 i wondered about the same thing perhaps i shall look into it
yes  please
/***EOF***/
roy couldnt believe larums story  he quickly penned off a letter to cecilia
letting her know of the horrors happening on the western isles  he also let
her know of the actions that he planned to take from now
after sending the letter roy and company moved towards the mine in mt ebrakhm
to try and rescue the people suffering from forced labor
etruria had assigned bishop oro of the elimine church to supervise the mine
already a large amount of minerals had been taken but it seemed that they
ever wanted more and more 
ebrakhm known now as the mine of death  the wails of the people forced into
labor there echoed through the mines like the howling of ghosts 
i see  so princess guinivere is nowhere on the western isles
we searched all over these islands and we sent spies in to lycian league but we could not find the princess anywhere im sorry
i understand i suppose i will search elsewhere bishop oro i thank you for your cooperation with bern
i will pray that you will be able to meet princess guinivere soon
thank you
bishop oro who was that
a dragon knight from bern her name is melady she was looking for princess guinivere who is her mistress
did you tell her where the princess is
of course not princess guinivere is a valuable hostage when advisor roartz heard the news that cecilia was hiding with guinivere in aquleia he was as excited as the time when he reported the assassination of prince myrddin had been successful
bishop oro you mustnt say he was assassinated 
oh i must watch my tongue anyway guinivere has much value
i see 
and now why did you come before me did you not have something to say
yes my lord it is about the village where the resistance leader is hiding we are now prepared to launch an attack on the village so i came to report
all right well done then start your attack immediately before we have any unwanted interruptions 
so the resistance hideout is in one of these villages here
yes but its possible the landlords troops have attacked it already
i must say that oro is a despicable man a bishop should be preaching the words of god to help the people but in fact he is torturing his people that is far from forgivable
we should probably wait for general cecilias reply but 
master roy troops from the castle are attacking the villages
what master roy should we attack
i guess we cant wait for her reply then  but i want to help the people here even if it means that well be on bad terms with etruria
roy
lets fight so we can be proud of our actions when we return to lycia
melady did you find out anything about princess guinevere
no  it looks like she left the lycia alliance army just when i thought i had found her 
well then its no use looking here i suppose
galle im sorry my squad was the only one assigned to look for the princess because king zephiel wanted to keep it in secrecy im sorry that i got you into this mess 
you have enough to worry about already  dont fret over things like that
but youre one of the captains working directly under general murdock 
dont worry about that general murdock has agreed to my helping you anyway princess guinevere must still be on the mainland i guess we can ask general narshen for help
 youre going to bow down to narshen
 of course hes one of the three dragon lords and hes leading the divisions in lycia and etruria
galle arent you mad
about what
i mean  youre the one who should be a dragon lord  but narshen accused you of not being a native of bern and he snatched the position away and youre going to bow down to him and ask him for help
well what he said was true i wasnt born in bern
but 
melady dont worry im happy with the position i have now king zephiel and general murdock put trust in me even though im not a native of bern what more could i ask
galle 
hahaha  ive got an idea  someone
yes bishop oro
tell the bandits that the villagers in chaos i want them to ransack the villages and collect the valuables
yes but  are you sure if this becomes public 
you forget that i speak for god himself if anyone tries to accuse me he would be accusing god there is no one on this island who can prosecute me now hurry it will be a chance wasted if the crisis in the villages settles down
yes
so thats the lycia alliance army 
theyre supposed to be fighting against the bandits 
i know but lord arcard says that they are working with the bandits to attack innocent villagers why are they doing the opposite of what they were told 
  
thea can you take your troops and attack from the north ill start attacking from here
yes general klein
thea wait
yes
i heard that you have some siblings
yes i have two sisters one older one younger
are they both pegasus knights like you
yes why do you ask
well you see i have a younger sister myself 
you have a sister she must be very beautiful
thank you yes she is pretty but i heard that she got tangled up in some mess and i dont know where she is now 
what oh my 
ive sent out some people to look for her but they havent had any luck if i werent on this mission i would go search for her myself 
  
thea take care of yourself for your familys sake
yes thank you
all right lets go
sir are you sure
about what
lord arcard said to leave the fighting to ilias pegasus knights so that we etrurians suffer the least casualties
dont be ridiculous they are our companions and trustworthy comrades we will fight full force to support them understood
yes general klein
 still lord arcards story is strange  the alliance army just got here would they get tied in with the bandits so quickly 
so youre sure we can raid the villages as much as we want
yes but in return 
yeah yeah were supposed to take half of the loot to the castle right thats one hell of a bishop you guys got yourselves over there
thank you for your cooperation
all right boys loot the villages grab all the treasure
master roy bandits are appearing from the mountains in the east
theyre thinking of attacking the villages during the confusion  we have to stop them
are you ready were moving southward
captain  are you sure well be all right
why
perhaps the etrurian army means to use us up front as pawns 
who says that
one of our group heard rumors like that in the etrurian army
if you take rumors seriously all the time you wont be able to do anything in battle
but 
besides even if that were true general klein wouldnt approve of it
do you think so
general kleins not like that i trust him
 all right then well trust him as well for we trust you captain
thanks all right lets go
echidna we have surrounded this entire area we know youre hiding in there drop your weapons come out at once
  
are you echidna the leader of the rebel forces
miss echidna im sorry they took my family hostage to make me talk 
dont worry i understand leave this to me hurry home to your family now
im sorry really
if you surrender peacefully perhaps bishop oro will have mercy on you
sorry but im sorta the stubborn type
do you resist then we have no choice kill her
what is taking so long are the rebel forces that much of a problem
its the lycia alliance army theyre helping the rebels
what the lycia alliance would turn against etruria
we have just received a message from the capital at djuto it says  ‘the lycia alliance army is responsible for the murder of duke nord and is suspected of treachery against etruria they may be allied with the bandits capture them
so they killed nord  it looks like theyve come up with a good excuse to get rid of the alliance army hahaha  allied with the bandits eh how ironic 
lord arcard has also provided us with some reinforcements to help us defeat the lycia alliance army they should be arriving shortly
how generous he said to capture them but he probably plans on killing them anyway let us do the job for him kill them all
yes bishop oro
klein
clarine you were safe thank goodness 
im sorry i left without telling you  but i wanted to see you so badly
the things you would do  well youre safe and thats what matters and what brings you out here did you find someone trustworthy to hire
no i joined the lycia alliance army and have been fighting alongside them
the lycia alliance army
yes my healing staves have been very useful
i see i thought your eyes looked sharper
im now a lady i am
 let me ask you this what kind of an individual is general roy
hmm  he lacks a little finesse for a noble  i especially think that he has to take care of his hair a little better 
 let me rephrase the question is general roy working with the bandits and attacking the people living on these islands
no of course not we are here to defeat the bandits
i see 
the etrurians here are all malicious and evil people it is so embarrassing klein are you working for them
no at least not any after i heard your story
what
i was sent here to protect the villagers to fulfill my mission i will hereby join the lycia alliance army
klein
then lets go shall we will you introduce me to general roy
of course i love you klein
thea
general klein what is the matter
ive made up my mind were going to fight alongside general roy in the lycia alliance army
understood sir then we will as well
arent you going to ask why
we are mercenaries we follow our employers every order besides 
besides 
i trust your judgment general klein
thank you thea
echidna
larum you were all right good  if something happened to you i wouldnt know what to say to elffin
im sorry  if i hadnt been caught i could have told you about this earlier 
its okay dont worry
but 
dont cry over spilled milk thats not like you and besides im all in one piece so everythings fine right
 yeah
so anyway whos the army attacking the castle right now
roy and the lycia alliance army they came here to defeat the bandits
lycia eh theyve sure come a long ways to get here  and does it look like theyll help us out
yeah they helped me too
all right then i guess ill join too thats okay isnt it
really that would be great im sure roy would be glad too
challenging me is the equivalent of challenging god himself take your punishment from my hands
you you heathen  i represent god  gah 
you are a priest are you not
what of it anything can go unpunished if done in the name of god convenient is it not
 thats unforgivable
well we certainly have an evil bishop here now dont we
i am simply living life the way i see fit anything can go unpunished if done in the name of god convenient is it not
you disgrace god  you shall pay for that
master roy there is a young man here to see you he says he is a member of the rebels 
ill see him let him pass
are you master roy pleased to meet you my name is elffin i am a member of the rebel forces here
i am roy of the lycia alliance army
you have my thanks for saving our village here
no we simply did what we felt was right
but now you have rebelled against etruria certainly you had thought of that before you took action
of course as i said we did what we felt was right although what we did is a sign of rebellion against etruria if the truth about these islands is made public they will understand i have sent a letter to a trustworthy member of the etrurian court if she takes the appropriate measures i think we can tip the tables in our favor
i would not be so sure of that 
what do you mean
did you ever think it odd that etruria sent you in particular to get rid of the bandits
yes  of course we did
this is merely a theory  but i believe that the ones who requested your help are advisor roartz and lord arcard
 how do you know that
why did they have to get your army off the mainland could there be some some sort of problem if you stayed in lycia
oh  i never thought of it that way 
there are rumors that roartz and arcard are actually tied in with bern
what then lycia would be in danger
m master roy
your country could be peril are you sure you want to be wasting your time on a little island like this
hes right if bern wanted to get us away from lycia so they could invade then we must return at once 
 im not going back
what why
  
right now its very difficult to judge what information is true and what is false the worst thing to do is is to simply jump to information presented in front of you sure im worried about lycia but my father is there and general cecilia also promised to take care of our land but our army is the only one stationed on these islands
thats true but 
if we just leave without fully clearing out the bandits then what we did so far would all be a lie 
 i see you are blessed with a wise leader
what
master roy i am sorry that i tried you so
tried us so what you said was a lie
i have not lied but i did present the rumor in such a way that you would easily jump to it but master roy kept his head i feel that i would like to serve an individual like you master roy please count me among your ranks
 i dont like the idea that you were testing us but if youre willing to help then we will welcome you
then 
yes please fight alongside us well then back to business what can we do to help the people on these isles
we must go to djuto the etrurian capital is there we must crush it to fully liberate the people
all right were going to djuto we will fight for the people living here and to defeat our true enemy
ah are you general roy
yes
you saved our village please take this as a token of our gratitude
general klein we will stay here and restructure the area as you directed us
good
we wish we could fight alongside you oh and here here is the arrow that you had us keep i will give it back to you farewell and good luck general klein
thank you
captain we will return to ilia to make our report
thanks
oh and this  your sister gave it to me before we left please be careful 
thank you you be careful too
/***EOF***/
in order to speak to the resistance force about the bandits on the western isles roy and company move west along the coastline along the way they come across a small village caught in conflict the local lord oppresses the resistance and does anything he can to get rid of them 
have you not found that resistance bard yet
we have a good lead milord
out with it then where is he
hes apparently in hiding in the nearby village
removing elffin the bard will sever the brain behind the resistance force find him burn the village to the ground if you have to
yes milord
i apologize for the wait madam melady
you seem to have a full plate
oh worry not our obligations to bern take priority over all if you need anything please dont hesitate to ask
then lets get to the matter we discussed earlier 
ah the whereabouts of princess guinivere
have you found anything lord zinc
i regret to say that i have not have you been to djuto
i have
then i suggest you pay a visit to father oro he resides in the castle at mt ebrakhm to the north he knows the region better than any of us so he may have some idea however if even he does not know where princess guinivere might be then she is most likely not in the isles
thank you i will speak with father oro then farewell
the resistance is supposedly very active in this area
yes thats what our sources say but i also hear that etrurias military is hunting down members of the resistance their numbers have apparently dwindled
 etruria does nothing about bandits but oppresses the resistance something is very wrong with this picture 
indeed it is
can we do anything to help the resistance
our hands are tied  to do so would directly oppose etrurias nobility we are here under etrurias orders remember
ill send a letter to general cecilia and see what she has to say lets not do anything too rash just yet
lord roy etrurian troops are attacking the village to find a member of the resistance force theyre under orders from lord zinc the noble who controls this area
oh no  but should we intervene
we havent the time to await general cecilias reply  but i want to help the people  even if it means opposing an etrurian noble
lord roy 
we fight our purpose is just make lycia proud
were you able to ascertain princess guiniveres whereabouts
unfortunately no but a bishop named orlo in charge of the mines in the north may know
very well then we head north
galle  im sorry king zephiel wanted to keep the matter of princess guinivere a secret so only i was assigned to search for her im sorry to get you mixed up in this 
dont worry yourself
but you work directly under general murdock surely you have other duties
general murdock agreed to allow me to assist you he thinks its vital we find the princess and the fire emblem
 do you think princess guinivere has the fire emblem
thats what his majesty the king thinks and i think hes correct all things considered
  
come now dont be like that im sure princess guinivere went with good intentions lets hurry now
youre right 
 where am i 
are you awake
 what happened 
we found you lying at the entrance to the village covered in wounds we took you home and have been taking care of you
thank you  but you are 
my name is mary i live in this village
 you live here  oh no my very presence endangers this village   it may even be too late 
im sorry
i am elffin  one of the resistance force the lord here is sure to send troops in to capture me
the resistance force 
lady mary you should leave here the village is in danger
 no i will stay
 why
i have a younger brother but he left with his friend next door to find work im taking care of his friends sister i cant abandon her
i understand  the most i can do to protect this village is leave i thank you again for tending to my wounds please take care
yes you too
what is going on out there why is it taking so long to find a single member of the resistance
its the lycian army theyve joined the battle on behalf of the villagers 
the lycian army they would betray etruria
also milord we have received a missive from djuto they lycian army is suspected of working with the bandits the missive says to take them dead or alive
oh really they have ties with bandits the irony those fools only want to save face 
excuse me milord
this is not the mainland the isles are ruled by might
im not quite sure i understand 
pay it no mind was that all the message from djuto said
theres more lord arcard has provided us with reinforcements
what
they should arrive soon
confound it we wont get credit for defeating lycia if were aided by reinforcements we must wrap this up before they can join the fight  ah ive an idea get me scollan
yes milord
you called lord zinc
burn down the village kill any who resist
 can we take the loot
do as you wish just do it quickly
you can count on us lord zinc heh heh heh 
gonzalez where are you gonzalez
here  i here 
theres a village to the south with me so far
with you so far
good it might be a base for the resistance zinc says to burn it to the ground village and all
village and all 
good you understand now get goin dont screw this one up you dimwit
i  i 
you got a problem does your head hurt from thinking too much
n no 
heh hes ugly as sin but hes got a heart of gold theres nothing wrong with tearin down a few houses are we clear wretches no questions
we got it boss
thats the lycian army 
they were assigned to fight against the bandits 
i know but lord arcard says theyre allied with the bandits now why theyre doing exactly the opposite of their assignment is beyond me 
 
thea take your soldiers and attack from the north ill commence the attack from here
yes sir
thea hold on
yes sir
i hear that you have siblings
yes sir i have two sisters one older one younger
are they pegasus knights like you
they are actually why do you ask
i have a younger sister myself 
any sister of yours must be enchanting
yes she is a sight i heard however she got tangled up in some mess and now shes missing
what oh my 
i have some people looking into it but theyve yet to find anything if i didnt have this mission i would search for her myself
 
thea be careful out there for your familys sake
yes sir thank you
ready then lets move
sir are you sure
of what
lord arcard said ilias pegasus knights are expendable they should be fighting on the front line not us surely the lives of us eturian soldiers are more valuable
dont be ridiculous they are reliable companions we will attack at the same time or before them if need be understood
yes sir
 lord arcards story is curious though  the army from lycia only arrived very recently how could they create ties with the bandits so quickly 
lord zinque the reinforcements from jutes should arrive shortly
blast we have enough problems as it is 
are you ready we move southward
captain  are you sure well be all right
is something wrong
the etrurian army may consider us disposable and send us to the front 
where did you hear that
one of the other riders heard a rumor from the etrurian army
pay no mind to mere rumors
but 
im certain commander klein would never approve of that
do you really think so
commander kleins not like that i trust him with my life
 very well then well trust him as well for we trust you captain
good lets go
excuse me
w what you doing i am enemy
i know  but theres such a look of sorrow in your eyes
 there is a village near mountain you know
yes i know it
tell people escape i have order destroy village i 
what dont the villagers are innocent 
no it order i must
it sounds to me like you should leave the person who gave you that order
leave
yes you can fight with us were protecting the villagers
no  i monster  people mean to me  people throw stones  people say go away  you a monster  not human 
thats horrible of course youre human youre a very kind hearted man i can tell please come with us dont be afraid
me afraid i never afraid everyone afraid of me i not afraid
no you are afraid youre afraid that people will throw stones and call you a monster
  
but you dont have to be afraid of us everyone in our army is nice they wont do that to you be brave  take that first step and youll never have to be afraid again
wait arent you an etrurian commander why are you attacking us
i have specific orders from lord arcard to take you down
cant you see whats happening here the people are suffering from the lords abusive treatment and youre helping them you should be ashamed
 wait are you saying that youre helping the villagers
yes the lord here is ransacking the village in search of the resistance were fighting to stop him and youre apparently on his side
i had no such intention my orders stated that you were the ones working with the bandits
what why would we be working with bandits we just want to clean things up here and get home to lycia
 such nerve
what
lord arcard has made a fool of me i have been so blind enough not to see through his thin veil of deceit
 do you see what we see now
i am klein of house reglay of etruria forgive me for my misguided attack against you
i am general roy of the lycian army
general roy i would advise you to be cautious with you against lord arcard i expect him to use every pawn at his disposal to have you dealt with
thank you for the advice 
if you would allow it i will join you
you will
yes i wish to monitor you as an etrurian commander i should prove useful as both a fighter and a diplomat
thank you
klein
clarine you are safe
im sorry i left like i did but i wanted so badly to see you
oh the trouble you get into  well youre safe and thats what matters  what brings you out here did you find a trustworthy mercenary for hire
no i joined the lycian army
the lycian army
yes my healing staves have been most useful
 i see i thought your eyes looked sharper
im a lady now i am
 let me ask you this what kind of individual is general roy
hmm  hes a tad rough around the edges for a noble  his hair especially is an absolute mess 
 let me rephrase that is general roy working with the bandits
no of course not weve been sent here to vanquish the bandits
so i heard 
the eturians here are malicious people  it is so embarrassing klein  are you working for them
no not anymore
what
i was sent here to protect the villages i hereby join the lycian army to fulfill my mission
thank you klein
shall we then will you introduce me to general roy
naturally i love you klein
t thea sister
shanna 
what are you doing here
 i have a contract with commander klein of etruria shanna  are you with the lycian army

no commander klein said he would join us we dont have to fight
what really
yes
 thats a relief i will join you as well
thanks sister
thea
commander klein what is the matter
theres been a change of plans we are going to fight under general roy of the lycian army
understood sir we shall follow you without question
i dont mind a question here or there to be frank
we are ilian mercenaries sir we follow our employers every order and besides 
yes
i trust you to make proper judgments

t thea sister
shanna 
what are you doing here
 i have a contract with commander klein of etruria shanna  are you with the lycian army

 shanna you know the code of the ilian mercenaries
 never betray your employer 
precisely and we must follow that code even if it means we must fight our own kin
but one of us could be killed
i know that but we must fight failing to do so would damage the reputation of the ilian mercenaries our nation cant afford to lose its mercenary contracts
thea 
now draw your lance shanna why  why does it have to be like this 
i wonder how marys doing  her brother and his friend are both traveling trying to make money its too dangerous to go outside now  can you go check on her here ill give you this for your trouble 
a few months ago my granddaughter went missing we all searched in the mountains and found her she was with a hulking monster of a man so we threw stones at him to drive him off  afterwards my granddaughter told me that he was the one who led her to the village  if you ever find that man would you give him this its a special axe thats effective against swords and tell him im sorry
i hate the resistance we civilians have to deal with the consequences of their actions you know we stand no chance if we try to stand up to our lord we just want to lead a normal life oh  im sorry im just frustrated i have no useful skills so i cant help you  but take this 
 the resistance suffered a crippling defeat here here take this im going to look for other survivors there is still hope if we can find our leader
ah our heroes i thank you on behalf of the village this is made from the scale of a dragon its said it will protect the one who uses it from harm please take it

thank you i appreciate it well then  i must be off
be careful 
the people are suffering  what concern is that to me they live to serve me their wails are meaningless
this is my land  mine alone  none shall 
lord roy there is a young man claiming to be with the resistance here
ill see him let him pass
i am pleased to meet you my name is elffin i am a member of the resistance force
i am roy of the lycian army
you have my thanks for saving the village here
we simply did what we believe is right
but now you stand against etruria
even so i have no regrets we may have opposed etrurias immediate interests but once the truth about the isles is out im certain they will understand i sent a letter to a trustworthy etrurian noble if she takes appropriate measures they will send us aid
i would not be so sure 
why is that
dont you find it unusual that etruria sent you here in the first place
actually yes i do
this is merely conjecture  but was it high chancellor roartz and lord arcard who requested your help
 it was
why were they so eager to get your army off the mainland i wonder perhaps your presence in lycia was undesirable to them
i never even considered that 
there are rumors that roartz and arcard are working with bern
what then lycia is in danger
l lord roy
your country may be in peril are you free to waste your time on the isles as you are
hes right bern wanted us out of lycia so they could launch an invasion we must head back at once
 we stay here
what why
  
its difficult to judge what may be hearsay and what may be truth we cant simply jump on this information and run back to lycia i am certainly concerned but my father and general cecilia are there the people on the isles have only us to rely on
that may be but 
if we leave without finishing our mission then all weve done here was for naught
 your army is blessed with a wise leader
what
lord roy i am sorry for testing you so
testing us so that was a lie
it was the truth however i presented the rumor in a way that you might take rash action your leader is an admirable individual i would join you if you will allow it
 i dont like that you tested us but if you can help i welcome you now then back to the topic at hand what can we do to help the people of the isles
you should head south towards caldonia
why
castle edina is located there it is where workers are kept before they are sent to eburacum
then we must save the people there
lord roy please take this sword
what is this
it is called a wyrmslayer it was created during the scouring to use against dragons it is effective against wyverns as well
wyrmslayer is this a legendary weapon
no legendary weapons can only be used by those whose skill rivals the eight legends this weapon however can be wielded by anyone with experience in swordplay
are you the leader of this army
yes i am
i wish to thank you for protecting our village
there is no thanks necessary  we did what we believe is right
regardless i want you to have this as a token of our gratitude
commander klein we will stay and help with reconstruction as directed
good these people need you
would that we could fight at your side here is the bolt we were holding for you you may need it more than we do farewell and good luck commander klein

man and dragon once coexisted in harmony however man shattered that harmony with a sudden onslaught a great war now known as the scouring was fought for dominion of the land losses were tremendous for both sides and in this war the very laws of nature itself were twisted and distorted bringing chaos and unease 
defeated and humbled the dragons disappeared from the realm mankind then began to rebuild and repopulate their newly won land
a millennium has passed since then 
after defeating the dragons the humans of elibe quickly spread their culture and civilization to the farthest reaches of the continent
in the west lies the kingdom of etruria which is widely considered to possess the most refined culture in all of elibe the kingdom of bern with its powerful military and logical pragmatic people is located on the other side of the continent in the east
these are the two most powerful nations in elibe with the weaker nations situated between them
these smaller lands are the lycian league whose numerous territories are independently ruled by a number of marquesses that are bound by a vow of allegiance ilia where the people arduously till the frozen soil and many become mercenaries to earn money to survive and sacae where various clans ride through the plains on horseback
although there were occasional clashes between these nations the majority of the people of elibe lived in peace that peace however was not to last 
king zephiel of bern has commanded his forces to conquer the entirety of elibe berns armies first attacked sacae and ilia ruthlessly massacring all who opposed them now bern is mounting a merciless invasion into lycia
pherae is a territory of lycia known for its beauty and honorable lords pheraes lord roy was in ostia lycias largest territory when the invasion began he had been sent to study to become the next marquess of the pherae territory however the sitting marquess and roys father eliwood who has been ill has sent for roy to return to lead pheraes soldiers in defending against bern
marquess hector of ostia leads the council of lords in lycia at the same time eliwood sent for roy marquess ostias daughter lilina was in pherae visiting eliwood who is marquess ostias long time friend and confidant
upon receiving his fathers message roy hurries home taking with him his vassals and bors a knight from ostia who is responsible for lilinas safety the story begins when roy reaches the outskirts of pherae 
boss theyve all hidden themselves inside the castle
heh even eliwood the greatest knight in lycia is no match for an illness it seems
hee hee hee  you were right when you said there wouldnt be many soldiers theyre all getting ready to defend against bern
of course i was right im always right you fool but reinforcements could be here any minute all right you curs listen up kill everyone in the castle while we still got time then we can waltz outta here with all the loot
heh heh castles aint the only places with loot lets go ransack the village and take everything theyve got
lord eliwood were under attack by bandits from mount bolm
i understand thank you merlinus  blast it were i not in this pitiful state i would take care of them all myself 
lord eliwood 
lilina you must hide yourself this castle is going to become a war zone
no my lord i can fight too
dont be absurd i couldnt face hector if something happened to you in my own castle
my father but 
its going to be all right roy should be here any moment so we just need to hold our own until then hell drive off these dastards merlinus send a messenger to roy to let him know the current situation we need his help
y yes milord
oh its lance whats the matter why are you in such a hurry
lord roy bandits have appeared and are attacking the castle as we speak
no is the marquess unharmed
hes inside defending against the bandits attack but i dont know how long he can last with his illness 
excuse me lance is it is lady lilina safe
you must be a knight of ostia lady lilina is in the castle she should be all right shes with lord eliwood after all but he cant last forever
no  i shouldnt have let lilina go to the castle before me
lord roy regret wont solve anything we must retake the castle
wolt is right we must make haste
yes youre right this is no time to despair very well to arms then our target is the castle we must rescue everyone
dammit reinforcements already but they aint gettin to the castle so easy
hey arent you knights going to the castle i know this isnt much  but please accept this money on behalf of all of us use it well
money is important if you dont have any you wont be able to replace your broken weapons and you cant fight without weapons
listen if you wanna do well in battle youd better use terrain wisely for example if youre in a forest the trees will cover you thatll teach your enemies who theyre dealing with
were all doomed  soldiers from bern have crossed the border  they laid an awful attack and even if the allied lords strike back lord eliwood  he cant even stand anymore 
you bumbling idiots you cant take on a few pathetic knights
wh what the  s so strong 
father lilina
roy is that you
roy
father lilina   thank goodness youre all right
roy thanks for coming this far
of course father how is your health
im fine im still alive see but roy you do know why i called you back here
i am to take over your role of leading pheraes military and join the lycia alliance army
yes as you know bern has started to conquer lycia we must follow the ancient rule and send out our military to protect the land of lycia
yes
i really didnt want to send you out because you were still studying but im not well  i would only be a hindrance to everyone else
father 
mister eliwood i will accompany roy my father is in charge of lycias main army and i could use my magic to be of some help to roy 
no lilina you must return to ostia
  why
with hectors absence there is no one currently sitting on the throne of ostia the people must be feeling uptight as well you being the daughter of the marquess must take the throne until hector returns and ease the tension of the people am i wrong
  no sir
roy first you must go to the bern border and meet with the mercenary group that i have arranged a contract with ill send merlinus along with you  hell be very helpful with his knowledge
thank you for everything father
youll be fine you can do it go and fight and show them who you are the next marquess of pherae
yes
bors i have something to ask of you
i know my lady i will accompany roy in his travels and swear to protect him with my life
thank you bors roy be careful
i know you too lilina
/***EOF***/
ostias military primarily consists of soldiers in heavy defense gear such as armor knights and generals with them castle ostias defenses have always been incredibly strong for a long time now the castle has been rumored to be unconquerable
however that rumor was about to be proven wrong by roy who ironically wanted to protect the castle
what the enemy has broken into the castle what the hell was devias doing out there were those knights from ilia so strong   or was the lycia army larger than i expected  in any case they have gotten into the unconquerable castle ostia
we must drive them out or bern will look down upon us  you over there
yes sir
set up the troops all over the castle especially around the throne room prepare your defenses we must not let the lycia army get any further into the castle
understood sir
one more thing i want you to discreetly kill lilina during the battle
what   sir werent we supposed to keep her alive
i was planning on using her as a hostage but there are still many rebels that put faith in her if we openly use her as a hostage those soldiers might turn against us
but in that case sir they would surely turn on us if we kill her
so i said to do it discreetly didnt i kill her quietly and pretend that she was hit by a stray arrow then we can make the enemy responsible for it now go
yes sir 
  general roy of the lycia alliance army i presume
 who are you an enemy
no im on your side greetings my name is astore i used to work here in the service of lord hector
excuse me but what kind of work were you doing you certainly dont look like one of ostias servants 
my my arent we a little rude old man see im a spy i go on secret missions to gather information steal things check on people  that kind of thing
hmm i see
if people can tell that im working for a noble just by looking at me then im not much of a spy am i anyway for a month now ive been running around lycia to gather the latest news when i heard about lord hectors death in araphen i returned here as quickly as i could then i see that those idiots leygance and devias have caused a rebellion i didnt make it in time to save lord hector but i dont want to be too late for lady lilina
then youll join us good lets work together to rescue her do you know where lilina is
of course investigating into matters like that is my job lady lilina is locked into a small room in the center of the castle and that dastard leygance is sitting on the throne like he owns the place
we have to hurry then we must defeat the rebels and rescue lilina before narcian arrives from bern
whats all that noise is there a battle going on i wonder whats happening outside 
sir barth this is a dead end
dont worry this wall has cracks in it we can break through it if we hit it a little with our weapons
i wonder where lady lilina is
i have a pretty good idea where she is weve known this castle for a long time hmm i do wonder whats causing all the noise though
the alliance army then my brother must be with them 
  we dont know if hes still alive you shouldnt have such high expectations
oh  yes
sir barth you dont have to be so cold hes wendys only brother right
you must never look away from reality
but 
its all right ogier sir barth is right
as an armor knight of ostia you must never panic no matter what the situation understood wendy
  yes
yes just as i thought theyre at each other again i mean how stupid can these nobles get i can never understand what the fun is in fighting all the time oh well guess ill swipe what i can
we have finally recaptured the castle lilina
thank you roy im glad that my father didnt have to go through the trouble

roy is my father still in araphen i heard it was a tough battle there but does it look like its going to take much longer
lilina  havent you heard anything
what
lord hector  has passed away
what 
im sorry  when we arrived at castle araphen  it was already under berns control
its not your fault  dont apologize
lord hector was already severely wounded when we arrived if only we had gotten there faster maybe i could have helped him 
no  its okay i  was prepared for this  im a warriors daughter ive been taught not to panic in times like this
lilina
so everyone should have told me  theyre too considerate  im strong too you know 
lilina you dont have to hold back in front of me
roy  i 
its okay  ill be with you
master roy berns dragon knights have appeared at castle ostia
what theyre here already
hehehe  are you roy i must thank you for getting rid of that idiot leygance for me now you will leave ostia to me
dont be ridiculous who would give ostia to the likes of you
oh then do you wish to fight us with that sad little group of yours i shall annihilate you as i did with hector
damn
thats enough
general narcian a legion has arrived from etruria
i can see that you fool why 
i am percival knight general of etruria yesterday sorcery general cecilia informed me that ostia had requested etrurias protection
what 
you seem discontent we are prepared for battle but can those dragon knights of yours stand a chance against all of us
you 
i am cecilia sorcery general of etruria ostia is now under our protection
argh  you  you 
general narcian please control your temper general percival is one of the strongest warriors in etruria and with general cecilia here as well well be slaughtered
i know were leaving cecilia is it watch your back from now on
are you general roy of the lycia alliance army
y yes i am in charge of the alliance army in the place of lord hector
i see lycia is in a time of hardship our king also sends his words of regret for lord hectors death
thank you for your consideration if etruria hadnt helped us  ostia would be under berns control now thank you very much
im not the one to thank i simply followed my kings orders you should thank cecilia who went against the king to help you
she  disobeyed the kings orders
yes now isnt that something well i must be off two of the three etrurian generals shouldnt be leaving the country for so long cecilia can you take care of the rest
yes thank you percival you can leave the rest to me
whew  general percival  now hes someone
nervous were you
general cecilia it is good to see you again
how are you doing roy you look a little tired but you seem okay
yes thanks to etruria we were able to avoid disaster
im glad we made it here in time
im sorry i put you through a lot of trouble
no its going to be beneficial for etruria for ostia to go under our protection
beneficial
yes berns been acting aggressively these days as you know we also want to do something about it but since we havent been directly invaded we have no reason to go to war with them but if bern gets any stronger the balance of powers would be shattered
so when ostia requested protection you saw it as a good reason to declare war on bern
right we just did what would be best for us you dont need to feel that youre in our debt
yes
so you shouldnt thank us
understood i wont well anyway come in and meet the rest of our army
  hes gotten so bold in the short time that i havent seen him well he is a boy after all
bors youre all right
why is it wendy im glad to see youre okay too   what the  what are you wearing did you apply to become an ostian armor knight or something
ah  actually i did i was knighted just yesterday
what are you doing  i thought i told you to leave the fighting to us and live your life as you wished you didnt need to become an armor knight 
yes well i thought about it and what i truly want is to become a knight
but 
i dont want to just wait for you to return from battle i want to become a knight as great as you
  
  bors
well you were always stubborn werent you wendy
bors 
you should live your life as you wish if mother and father were alive they would say that as well but the way of the knight is no easy feat
yes im prepared i shall never give up
lilina
  roy is it really you
yes
you came thank you
thank goodness youre all right here take this spell book use it to defend yourself for the time being
thanks
lady lilina you are safe
bors i am sorry that i worried you
not at all my lady you were alive  that in itself 
thank you bors and you kept your promise that you would protect roy for me i knew i was doing the right thing when i asked you
thank you my lady
barth
lady lilina i am happy to see you are safe
barth you were right leygance was planning a rebellion
  
im sorry  if i had believed you in the first place this wouldnt have happened 
no  lady lilina you do not have anything to apologize about the one to be prosecuted is leygance who insulted your kind and trusting heart toward him it is your kindness that we respect the most my lady
barth 
its you
crap  er what a coincidence hahaha 
  if youre in the battlefield just to steal you shouldnt be its not right
dont worry i only take from the rich who have plenty of money no ones going to starve or anything
thats not the point
oh really then let me ask you this you nobles take food and money from the people living in what you call your territory who said that was your land anyway and you say youre collecting taxes but what youre doing is the same looting
what but we protect the people in return 
but youre not youre killing your own people causing a war like this
well  bern started to invade so we had to fight to defend our people 
so you can just do anything you want as long as you say youre protecting us you can burn down villages and ruin our crops
burned we never  wait a minute was your  
  my village was burned to the ground by our marquess he said that he had no choice because he needed to prepare for berns attacks
well  thats 
we always had just enough to eat and survive and then we just lost everything  our homes  our crops  and then you say not to take from other people ha you shouldnt be talking you dastards from the nobility take from us so you can live in luxury while we suffer
i  dont know what to say
sigh were getting all gloomy now i really dont like talking about im worse off so you should pity me arguments but youre the one who started it
i 
ah to heck with this its not fun stealing after a talk like that well i guess i better bail out then see ya
 
you vermin of the alliance army  come i shall cut down all of you
why you are only  to be trampled upon by bern  how can you fight so hard 
bors so you were still alive
of course taking ostia while we werent around 
is that a problem then try and take it back with your own strength and skill
lady lilina damn you were supposed to be dead by now 
leygance  why
times are changing my lady im just making sure i dont get left behind im not like lord hector who was too foolish to realize the change
quiet you will not insult my father any further
general leygance you shall rest here
ah bors sister is it its nice to be brave and all but can you really defeat me
leygance you fool are you not ashamed that you betrayed lord hector
barth  shut up lord hector stupidly caused his death i do not plan on falling with him
why you 
/***EOF***/
there is a small village on the border of pherae and bern this is where roy is to meet the mercenary band that eliwood hired
just east of the village is a small castle occupied by berns forces at the time roy reaches the village the castle is in an outright panic roy has yet to realize that this confusion going on in the castle will spread engulfing the entire continent of elibe in chaos 
all i want to know is what happened to princess guinevere
y yes captain melady  im certain she was in her room this morning but she simply vanished 
you told me that already you buffoon i dont want excuses are you so incompetent you cant understand that
well  i  er 
our forces are mobilizing to begin a full scale war with lycia how are we to focus on the battle if the princess is missing naturally you will take full responsibility for her disappearance
  
i never should have let her highness come to the border to begin with i will return to bern and inform the king of this matter ill try not to cause a panic but i cant promise your life if the princess isnt found i trust youll take every measure to locate her as soon as possible
yes captain
is princess guinivere secure
yes commander shes under constant surveillance in the cellar
good dont let her escape
but commander  are you sure this is a good idea
of course im sure the younger sister of king zephiel  were sure to get a hefty sum turning her over to one of berns enemies
 
loyalty to ones king bah what a worthless notion the world is ruled by neither king nor queen its ruled by gold
yes indubitably commander  but there has been a snag shall we say
hm what do you mean
i just received a report  it seems that princess guiniveres lady in waiting has escaped 
what you lout why didnt you say so earlier find her this instant dont let her get away
lord roy this is the location
this is where were supposed to meet the mercenaries
yes though it seems they arent here yet wait whos that somebodys coming this way 
be careful there
oh forgive me im in such a hurry 
no need for apologies are you hurt
no im fine thank you good sir
farewell then
 are you from lycia by chance
i am i am the son of marquess pherae
oh saint elimine thank you for guiding me to this boy
pardon
please i need your help to rescue my mistress
what happened
my name is elen i am a cleric of saint elimine my mistress and i came from bern to seek an audience with the lords of lycia however commander rude of the castle east of here trapped us we were captured imprisoned by our own countrymen
lord roy we must avoid unnecessary entanglements with bern
but we cant neglect a noble of bern who wants to speak with the lords of lycia  then again we cant simply charge into enemy territory either  wait whos there
theres the wench over here boys get the girl our orders say dead or alive
oh dear 
well merlinus they provoked hostilities i dont think we have any choice now
you wouldnt listen even if we did im sure but no matter let me witness all youve learned about tactics in ostia
all right everyone were going to charge the castle sister elen you should find a place to hide 
no i will come with you i cannot fight but i can heal wounded allies
but 
im the one that got you tangled up in this mess please let me do what i can to help
ok but just stay behind us so you arent hurt
certainly thank you for the concern
they should be around here somewhere  shanna check around and try to find the soldiers from pherae will you
sure
so big man whos our client this time
house pherae one of the noble families of lycia the marquesss son is going to join the other armies of the lycian league
were going up against bern then
looks that way
finally a foe worthy of my axe lets show em what were made of
bern eh this wont be easy i can tell you that we had best tread lightly
i think ive found them but it looks like theyre already caught up in a skirmish
what the fightings started already lets get a move on then time to earn our pay
are you lord roy of house pherae
who is it thats asking
names dieck you shouldve heard about me from an older man named merlinus
so youre the leader of the mercenary band
just a small company really sorry were late didnt think the fighting would start so soon
well  there was a complication 
dont take it the wrong way we dont blame you actually quite the contrary my boys are excited for a chance to show off their skills
brilliant it sounds like youre just the caliber of fighters we need
enough chitchat then lets wrap things up
armored knights have nearly impenetrable defenses but some weapons like this sword can pierce their armor im sure you can get better use out of it than us please take it
pegasi are useful for flying to hard to reach places but woe to any rider who finds herself against an archer an arrow can take a pegasus down in a single hit
forts are the key to a good defense if youre in a fort you can defend and even dodge more easily on top of that your wounds will heal slowly over time
the weapon triangle  swords axes and lances remember swords best axes axes best lances and lances best swords keep this in mind and things will be much easier for you
curse it all just when i thought things had finally turned my way 
oof  greed can only bring you an ill fate 
lord roy there was a woman locked in the cellar
that must be elens mistress bring her here
yes milord
your highness
elen im so relieved youre well you put yourself in such danger running off like you did  i worried myself sick about you
i am sorry your highness but i couldnt leave you in that dank cellar 
dont worry yourself elen its thanks to you i am safe now i am in your debt may i ask your name 
i am roy son of eliwood marquess pherae
its a pleasure  as for myself 
your highness  are you certain you should
yes elen it is fine my name is guinivere
guinivere thats the name of the princess of bern
yes that is i
what this was a trap wasnt it
merlinus hold
i beg your pardon lord roy but 
i wish to hear her out give her a chance will you
tsk as you will 
are you truly princess guinivere from bern
yes truly i cannot blame you for doubting me however
maybe you are the princess of bern and maybe you arent i can see from your actions and dress that you are at least of high status if you are indeed princess guinivere however theres one thing i dont understand elen told me you intended to meet the lords of the lycian league
yes that is correct
why if you are the sister of the king of bern
i want to find a peaceful way to end the war if i can speak to the lycian council im certain we can come to a solution
your brother instigated this war is it in your power to stop it
at the very least i wish to do everything i can no i must do everything i can
 i see for the time being come with us to meet the lycian league armies i want to see what lord hector thinks of this affair
you will allow me to accompany you
yes if there is any possibility to avoid further bloodshed we must try it matters not how small the chance
thank you i truly am in your debt
/***EOF***/
after defeating arcard roy moved east deep into the frozen lands of ilia
soon they entered the thick forests that characterize ilias central land however a general of bern bishop martel was waiting for them with an ancient spell that was said to have been lost centuries ago 
bishop martel we have brought lady niime as you asked
good let her pass
what do you need from me
are you niime the hermit on the mountain
so some have begun calling me that have they then i must be that niime
i hear that you are capable of using the ancient spell book that we found in this castle
i should be able to ive been studying the dark arts and ancient magic for decades now
i understand that this spell can change the weather around the caster 
it wouldnt be entirely improbable
then i order you use the spell book and create rainfall make it rain so that the rivers will overflow and push back the advancing etrurian army
well i can try but i frankly cant guarantee that it will work also powerful spells like these can only be cast once are you sure
silence all you must do is follow my commands you were the one who came to us and said you wished to join our forces then make yourself useful
  
princess guinevere  we are getting closer to bern
 yes
since we are getting closer we are clashing with soldiers from bern more and more often it will not be long before we engage in full combat with bern
  
i wish to ask you something before we do
what is that
i have been hearing rumors that king zephiel rose to the throne because he murdered the former king

i couldnt believe it you tried to stop him even by casting away your nationality if king zephiel is such a mad individual as the rumors say then why did you try so hard to find a peaceful way to end the war
  
princess guinevere i accepted the fire emblem not to use it in battle but to try and find a use for it to end this war peacefully
roy 
therefore please tell me the truth about the rumors 
i im sorry please give me some time
princess
 what is the matter princess guinevere was running off 
 no its nothing did you need something
yes i have gathered some more information we may have some trouble with this battle a powerful dark magician by the name of niime resides in the enemy ranks
dark magician  a druid probably
she is apparently extremely learned in ancient sorcery she has much more knowledge than any scholar could dream of
but we cant pull back now
no but we can always be careful
i know we must be wary
is the spell ready niime
 im warning you for the last time i really have no idea what will happen 
just shut up and cast the spell
sigh  all right 
wh what is going on 
an enemy spellcaster everyone watch out
what  what is this the rivers  the rivers have frozen over
my my  now isnt this a surprise 
 you you did this on purpose
what are you talking about  i warned you that i couldnt predict what would happen
quiet someone throw her into the dungeon
yes sir
sigh 
what happened
master roy we have a report the rivers have apparently frozen over
what
the ice is think enough for knights on horseback to cross them safely
oh  well good we can advance more quickly now charge toward the castle gate
blast how could you have traversed through this snow  curse that useless hag
no  i one of the most intelligent of the generals can die 
ah finally ive been released from the clutches of bern
you are
my name is niime i live in the mountains and study arcane magic
you say you were released did you not join bern out of your own will
well i did but it was only a guise berns army had something that i wanted to study
what is that
the dragons

well well that got you interested didnt it
the dragons you speak of  they are not the wyverns that berns dragon knights ride but the strange troops that are mixed in with berns soldiers 
exactly those are the dragons that were supposedly defeated in the scouring
why do you know this 
i thought that this war was just another skirmish at first but then i began to see strange evil things among berns troops so i decided to investigate
were you able to find out anything
the dragons are indeed shrouded in mystery i looked through many ancient books and scrolls but i could only decipher so many of them but 
 but
i have come to believe that bern has resurrected the dark dragon
dark dragon  that is the leader of the dragons that hartmut defeated
right dragons are a much more advanced species then us humans they have much greater vitality and intellect than us however there was one thing that the dragons lagged far behind the humans in the dragons reproductive system was much less efficient than that of the humans but even then the dark dragon it had the power to create more dragons that is what i learned from my research
it can make more dragons 
the dark dragon can create more of its kind that would explain where bern has been getting all of its dragons
that is possible
now that being said  i want to learn more about the dragons let me accompany your travels i wield dark magic im sure i can be of some assistance
of course we want to learn about the dragons as well it may be dangerous but it thats okay with you youre welcome to join us

the lycia alliance army took in elffin as a tactician following his advice roy led his forces south toward the isle of caldonia caldonia was one of the three largest islands of the western isles the other two were fibernia and dia located on caldonia was castle edina here men from all over the isles were rounded up and locked in prison cells to be sent to mt eburacum the mines of death when roy arrived at castle edina the situation was already looking grim 
hurry this way
a are you sure about this if we get caught were  
dont be stupid if we stay well be worked to death youre just going to lie down and take that dont you have a family or something back home
yeah 
there are people coming to help us from the northeast we just have to make it there in one piece
more people escaped where were the gaurds
they were unconscious someone drugged their food 
 then there must be a traitor amongst us morgan pursue and eliminate the escaped workers
yes lord arcard
i will return to jutes dont let them escape send more hands to the mines as well i cant afford to lose more workers
elffin is that castle to the southwest our target
yes that is castle edina the people kidnapped on the isles are first sent there they are then sent to eburacum and forced to work in the mines as it happens today is the weekly shipment of captives to the mines it will be difficult to rescue them once theyve been sent off
then youre saying we have to rescue them now
yes i already had some spies infiltrate the castle and help the people escape
what will the captives do once theyre out
i told them to send the captives to the northeast in other words our present location
then we must rescue those people before sieging the castle
geese  youre really leaving
the lord of that castle killed my mates i wont let their deaths be unavenged
you mean that crew that was always with you 
yeah  they were taken to the mines and told that they would be given work but they were all worked like slaves until they  died
  
maybe they werent the brightest bunch but they were good people  and they were killed  just like that 
do you intend to avenge them on your own
is there something wrong with that
no  but i thought you were going to go back to your merchant business
yeah well ive got bigger problems now  once my mates get their revenge and once the war subsides maybe i will
 we wont forget you geese you and your crew risked your lives to get us food and supplies if you ever need anything well be here
maybe ill take you up on that if im still alive  thanks
theyre imprisoned in that castle you say
thats right
then weve no time to lose lets begin this daring prison break shall we
 im sorry to ask for your help like this i know youre looking for your daughter
dont be absurd consider it payment for your hospitality i wont let some blood sucking lord take advantage of his people im bartre the brave and ill smash these puny insects
sir morgan the reinforcements are ready
good deploy them immediately spread them around the castle to defend us on all sides
even though weve saved the people at castle edina there are others still suffering in the mines
that is correct to liberate the western isles we must take the capital
then our next destination is jutes  elffin may i ask you something
of course lord roy
pardon me if i am mistaken but are you of high etrurian nobility

after defeating the djute tribe roy moved toward bulgar the largest city in
sacae
as a center of commerce between etruria bern and ilia bulgar has had a
history of being free city without a ruler  however with berns invasion
advisor roartz now had control of the city under berns protection
roy approached bulgar to liberate it and to gain some useful information on
invading bern
theyre here  and so quickly  could they not have given me the time to at least set up a defense
we will try to stop the enemy from progressing any further you can retreat to the palace and fortify your defenses there
 can you hold them back
we must at least try
if you do not know whether you can win or not 
then what would you do flee tell me just where do you think you can hide
  
general brunnya has given me orders to protect you i will do so with my life but you must not be afraid to fight either
  a all right  then i shall fortify the inside and leave the outside to you
 that is the highest advisor of the etrurian court why should we fight for a coward like him
dont say that general brunnya didnt willingly tell us to protect him she had no choice because etruria joined forces with bern  therefore we must fulfill our duties as warriors
  
i have also gotten hold of information that the allies of the silver wolf are lurking around here keep your guard
yes sir
princess guinevere
 we fight again today
yes  i am sorry that i cannot find the time to talk with you at leisure
please do not worry  my brother started this in the first place
princess 
 yes
may i ask the reason why berns former king tried to murder king zephiel
 zephiel and i were born from different mothers i am actually only his half sister
i heard that zephiels mother was the queen of etruria
yes it was an arranged marriage to strengthen the tie between bern and etruria however our father already had a woman he loved at that time that was my mother
  
the marriage between our father and zephiels mother was forced therefore our father didnt love zephiels mother and always thought badly of zephiel
then is that why the former king and king zephiel had a bad relationship
no  even then zephiel was always trying his best to gain our fathers affection he excelled in his studies and military training and he was always trying hard he grew to become a proud heir to berns throne
then why did the king try to 
master roy we are ready for the attack
all right ill be there in a minute princess guinevere im sorry but 
no it is all right please be careful
well well  so it has begun
so it seems
just when we thought bern had finished invading now we have to deal with etruria sigh 
  
small wonder this is a large trading city any army would want control of it well then 
h hey wait where are you going
im going to watch the fight lets see how worthy that roy is
what now but 
dont you worry about me everything will be fine
what hey wait youre leaving too
the reinforcements should be arriving soon  i want you to open the front gate to let the reinforcements in when they arrive
yes sir
all right they should be here soon  open the gate
tell the troops to start attacking the guerilla forces hiding in the houses
yes sir
i am kel behold my blade as i swing it for the last time
as a swordsman this is inevitable
hm youre not too bad are you
wh who are you
what the hey i said you couldnt come in master roy is very busy
whats the matter
well master roy she kept pestering me that she wanted to see you but you were busy so i was trying to drive her away
listen to me first then you can decide whether you want to get rid of me or not i think i have information that you might be interested in
 what is that
its about the humans who change form into beasts
 i want to speak with her in private can you leave the room
yes sir
well well that got you interested didnt it
those beasts you speak of 
right dragons
dragons  they are not the wyverns that berns dragon knights ride but the strange troops that are mixed in with berns soldiers 
exactly those are the dragons that were supposedly defeated in the scouring
 who are you
i am niime a scholar of ancient dark magic some call me the hermit on the mountain this war at first i thought it was just another skirmish so i didnt pay heed of it but now i can feel evil among berns troops so im investigating
were you able to find out anything
the dragons are indeed shrouded in mystery i looked through many ancient books and scrolls but i could only decipher so many of them but 
 but
i have come to believe that bern has resurrected the dark dragon
dark dragon  that is the leader of the dragons that hartmut defeated
right dragons are a much more advanced species then us humans they have much greater vitality and intellect than us however there was one thing that the dragons lagged far behind the humans in the dragons reproductive system was much less efficient than that of the humans but even then the dark dragon it had the power to create more dragons that is what i learned from my research
it can make more dragons 
the dark dragon can create more of its kind that would explain where bern has been getting all of its dragons
that is possible
now that being said  i want to learn more about the dragons let me accompany your travels i wield dark magic im sure i can be of some assistance
of course we want to learn about the dragons as well it may be dangerous but it thats okay with you youre welcome to join us
/***EOF***/
youre the dark priestess  no the dark dragon

what 
i have been commanded to lead this world i shall make the world a better place why do you stand in my way

you  no we  we have no reason to fight
 a long time ago  i have a feeling that i heard those same words soft words like a warm breeze  but that was long ago  i have been asleep for too long in the darkness i was dreaming  an empty dream white colorless  but now i am awake his majesty willed me so

i have woken i am no longer who i used to be i now clearly understand what i must do
  
i must lead this world  no matter how many days or nights pass i must i must

the time has come 
this is the dark dragon 
finally the battle between dragons and men will end at last 
so lets see the power of the dragon
i wont give up i have the sword of hartmut who pitied you and did not kill you everyone leave the final blow to me
i i  gah  i alone  dark  alone  in  darkness 
whats happening  the temple is starting to collapse everyone hurry outside
master roy are you all right
yes  but the temple is gone
it is over a thousand years old and a lot of energy was released in the battles that we just fought probably the building couldnt withstand it
i see 
well master roy this is the end
no its not over yet this is just the beginning we have to help the land and the people recover from the war we have much work to do the real battle is just starting
ah
whats happening  the temple is starting to collapse everyone hurry outside
roy 
i know leave the rest to me now go
master roy are you all right
yes  but the temple is gone
it is over a thousand years old and a lot of energy was released in the battles that we just fought probably the building couldnt withstand it

after rescuing guinevere and cecilia roy headed towards the nabata desert following sophias lead according to her the village of arcadia was located in an oasis hidden in the desert
however arcadia was already under attack by bern roy suspected their aim to be the dragons that were said to inhabit the village
although the lycia alliance army moved as quickly as they could towards arcadia a vicious sandstorm stood in their way
hurry fa theres a place to hide if you follow this path can you make it there
but fas tired
dont be stubborn now go or else berns soldiers might find us
what about sophia
i dont know  maybe she was caught by berns troops
if we get caught by bern then can we see the outside world
fa no the elders said that we mustnt communicate with the outside
aww  please
no  but i wonder how bern found out about our village  perhaps it has something to do with the ominous energy that sophia detected from the soldiers 
whats wrong
 i shouldnt be thinking about such matters now fa over here hurry
 fa wants to see the outside world too
zeiss hasnt general narshen arrived yet
a band of mercenaries and some dragons have arrived as reinforcements but general narshens group hasnt arrived yet
what is he thinking he must know that its impossible to conquer the village with a small army like this 
  
anyway we must inform the king about the dragons living here zeiss i want you to go to aquleia and report to king zephiel
what shall i say
dragons do indeed inhabit this village according to a captive there are also signs of ‘divine dragons the most powerful even among dragons
yes sir
make it quick
wow  this is some sandstorm
yes  this sandstorm has always protected our village from intruders 
its going to be a pain trying to look for a village in this mess i cant see three meters ahead  so in which direction should we be moving
yes  head to the northeast  but 
but
there may be things hidden in the sand blown around by the sandstorm  please be careful where you step 
maggie my dear did we not see someone head towards the middle of the desert
yes rose you are most correct
then maggie it must be true that there is a hidden village around here
bless my soul rose i believe you are correct
but my dear maggie we dont want to get lost in the sandstorm do we
of course not rose then we wouldnt be able to find our way home
well then maggie do you think that we should pass up the hidden village
my dear rose you forget that there are rumors of vast treasures hidden in that village
well we certainly dont want to miss that do we maggie
of course not rose we can make a lot more money through that than by mugging travelers
but we dont want to get lost either do we maggie
my dear rose i have an idea we may follow the people whom we saw heading into the desert earlier
thats a wonderful idea maggie and once we reach the village we can thank them by mashing their heads in
of course my dear rose
well then maggie shall we be off
why certainly my dear rose
the sandstorm it stopped
this is our chance master roy we can see the village clearly now
but so can the enemy we have to hurry
something is glittering in the sand  oh  a beautiful ring 
bless my soul maggie  it hurts does it not 
hmm  my dear rose maybe we were wrong 
my sword is invincible now choose your death by the blade or by its light
i am glad that i could meet one as strong as you before my death
that was tough but we won sophia where are the inhabitants of the village  whats wrong
 the entrance to the temple 
this door  it looks like it was forced open what lies inside this temple
a spell book  we call it the divine weapon 
divine weapon there was one here too  then that must be what bern was after in that case we might be too late 
 the divine weapon is still here 
really how can you tell
it is there  i can feel it 
all right lets go we may still be able to stop bern
who are you how did you enter
my name is roy i came with sophia to protect this village
with sophia  then it was you who drove off berns soldiers oh  please forgive my impudence i am the elder of arcadia
elder  then are you the dragon
dragon  they once called me that but that is a story of a time long since past
  
let me see  the only real dragon we have is fa right here
hi 
this little girl is a dragon
yes although she is far from her mature form
elder do you know anything about the dragons in bern
what there are dragons in bern
yes we have seen them
why  dragons do not exist anywhere except here
elder if i may
what is it igrene
sophia said that she could detect evil energy coming from berns troops that may have something to do with the dragons master roy says he saw in berns army
perhaps  but i am too old to detect such energy now
energy what is that
sophia is half dragon half human that gives her the ability to detect the pulses emitted from other dragons but because she cant detect them clearly she only said that she felt a force twisted and unnatural
i think that we should look into it elder if you would allow it i would like to join master roy and look at berns dragons myself
i really do not want to deal with matters of the outside  but this is a time of emergency well then roy will you take her
certainly
i am igrene the guardian of nabata i have confidence in my skills with the bow i believe i may be of some help in battle
thank you
fas going too
what are you saying of course you may not there is no telling what could happen if your existence were exposed to the world
  
well then lets go
yes
 fine  fa will just follow them anyway

after roy captured aquleia other etrurian powers gradually began to change their views and express their discontent for the revolutionaries driven away from their palace roartz and arcard fled to ilia which was still under berns control
ilia also known as the frozen highlands was a harsh land with short summers and long winters with little arable land the nations main source of income was to send out mercenary knights to fight for pay
etruria joined force with the lycia alliance army to form a joint force under the name of the etrurian army with roy as its commander their first mission was to enter ilia and finish off the remaining revlutionaries once that was done they would proceed to launch direct attacks on bern with the powerful backing of the elimine church roy had the populace on his side
however roy had to face the freezing cold of ilia as well as berns elite troops under general murdock the leader of the three dragon lords in addition many of the powerful ilian mercenary knights had submitted to berns side
as a start roy headed for castle raemy located on the ilian border
so narshen has fallen
yes lord murdock did we really not have to aid him
those were the kings orders besides the bern army has no use for a man who cannot clean up his own messes
lord murdock  what will become of us
lord arcard i will entrust this land of raemy to you lord roartz i will have you take the land of edessa you must make preparations to retaliate
what raemy is right on the border the enemy will arrive in no time
true but this position also allows us to easily launch attacks on etruria make sure this castle does not fall
edessa  it is deep in the wastelands of ilia 
that would give you plenty of time to prepare your forces would it not
could you not take back etruria for us
we could however when we do etruria will go under berns rule
no that wont do
then i suggest that you find a way to deal with the situation yourselves excuse us
  
my lord were we supposed to dispose of those two like that
dont worry berns code says that every individual must be able to deal with the consequences of his own actions  the enemy leader was his name roy
yes
i must admit he has done a superb job of rebuilding the alliance army after we crushed it so  if i have the chance i would like to have the honor of fighting him one on one
we are soon approaching the etrurian border
bishop yoder thank you for everything thanks to the church we were able to proceed thus far with ease
please if you had not captured aquleia we would be suffering from persecution under bern this is nothing in comparison to what you did for us
i am glad that i could be of use to you
now  may i ask you a very important favor
yes anything that i am capable of
if you find out anything else about the dragons 
i understand if i discover anything new i will report to you immediately
thank you  ah yes i must tell you something else this land of raemy  at a certain time of the day the sea level drops exposing a sand bar that can be crossed
a sand bar
yes it will take long to traverse all the way around the bay to attack the castle however should you be able to cross the sand bar you may be able to save some time
i see
still please be careful rushing is not always the best tactic to win a battle
yes thank you for your advice
of course then may saint elimine bless the etrurian army
lord arcard a path has appeared in the sea
what
well  according to the locals the tide pulls at this time of day 
what you didnt know about this
but sir we are not from these parts we are not familiar with the geography of this land
damn charge prevent the enemy from crossing that path
master roy we have a report
did the path in the sea appear
yes bishop yoder was right
did the enemy know about this
actually they seem to be a panicked state
all right then lets not miss this chance charge
wh why why is this happening to me
i am an etrurian noble i must not die here  guh
klein you would betray me
you are the one who betrayed etruria lord arcard
d douglas you had turned to the enemy 
lord arcard  what a pathetic ending for one who became so powerful
well last year i didnt think we would be fighting in sacae either fate can turn out in the most unlikely ways  and that might be true for bern as well
  master roy what is it that you are holding in your hand
oh this this is the fire emblem
oh  so this tiny gem is 
princess guinevere wanted me to keep it it seemed difficult for her to give it to me  she must have been truly hoping to end the war peacefully until now where this is no hope left 
hmm  trust between siblings it didnt seem likely on the outside
why not
the enemy is zephiel king of bern it is said that he murdered his own father so i didnt think that he would be moved by mere family relations 
what he killed his own father
didnt you know master roy zephiel took the throne because the former king had died but because the former kings death was so sudden there are many rumors going around
and one of them is 
 that king zephiel assassinated him
 does princess guinevere know about this
she must know something about it if not all

respecting hectors dying request roy made his way west intent on reaching lilina roy keeps a steady pace toward ostia on his way there roy passes through the territory of laus governed by lord erik at a glance laus is a peaceful territory with vast meadows and clear streams beneath this beauty however lies treachery and great skullduggery 
ah welcome genral narcian
lord erik i dont think ive yet praised your wisdom in joining bern
thank you sire ancient vows and traditions are nothing more than a burden anyway
you my friend are wise beyond your years now where is that gift you promised me she does not seem to be here
ah yes she is in her quarters she is exceedingly naive you see when i told her she could meet her brother she cooperated without question you there bring her here
what is this hall klein where are you brother
welcome lady clarine
who might you be
i am narcian one of berns three wyvern generals my lovely little lass i think you will enjoy my company more than your brothers  hm hm hm 
heh  ha ha ha
what why do you laugh
you compare yourself to my brother you think too highly of yourself your garb your hair   even your speech  all a painfully obvious guise to hide your true lowborn face
lowborn me you would compare me to a peasant
oh heavens no i would sooner compare you to a filthy disease ridden mutt
y you vermin ill see you suffer
general narcian we just received word that castle araphen was retaken by the enemy
what impossible what of slater
err  his whereabouts are unknown sire the enemy is reported to be roy son of marquess pherae
  
accursed interruptions lord erik lock the girl in a cell i will give her the pleasure of my company when i return you blockade the highroad from ostia this roy might just pass by i want his head
yes sire
they will pay dearly for this treatment 
 hey
whos there
im a mercenary hired by lord erik he wants to see you
i will not i refuse to meet with such churlish people
  just get over here
let go you will regret this do you have any idea who i am
 
let go i say
let go let go i say
keep it down you wont be able to make a clean escape making all that noise
escape then youre 
i prepared a horse for you out back under a tree take it and go while everyones distracted
  why are you helping me
i despise bern with all my soul
with all your soul
 never mind forget it
saying that only piques my curiosity further
time is short hurry
 
ive never met such a boorish man this is a battlefield a proper gentleman would escort a lady to her mansion well its hardly of concern now sigh i only came here to see my brother and now look at the mess im in  what am i to do now
heh  foolish nobility always involved in some petty dispute course youll hear no complaints from us turmoils how we make a living heh heh heh 
ah there you are
what do you want
we need some backup take some troops and prepare for battle
  
are you deaf go and fight
i heard you ill leave when im ready
tsk not the amiable sort is he if his sword arm is as skilled as the rumors say though then its no matter
pardon me you there
me
do you see anyone else you are the leader of this little group are you not
i am
most convenient very well then you will protect me
excuse me
hard of hearing i said that you are going to protect me from harm
mind your mouth young lady
away with you peasant i was not addressing you
what who do you think 
calm yourself merlinus  it looks like shes being pursued by the castles soldiers thats why she wants us to guard her right
um yes that is correct 
im impudent child we cant simply accept any useless girl into our army
you may call me lady clarine peasant and i am not useless i can use staves to heal wounded allies
so youll help us fight
 if thats what it takes i suppose i cant simply demand protection without any kind of payment
thanks we appreciate it our enemy is bern so we need everyone we can get im roy pleased to meet you lady clarine
the pleasure is all  ahem lets focus on the issue at hand
oh its you 
what youre still here
still here you abandoned me in the middle of a battlefield how can you have the nerve to say that i could have been killed
i guess youre lucky youre still alive then did you want something or can i go now
just a moment i shant allow you to abandon me twice a gentleman must take responsibility for his actions
responsibility for what i saved you from that twisted sadist
if a gentleman rescues a lady he must also escort her to her mansion in what fairy tale does some barf of a man abandon his princess
 what in the world are you on about
besides you said you despise bern with all your soul if you ask me youd be better of joining us well be fighting bern you know
what wait is that true is that army youre in really going to challenge bern
yes  our leader floyd or whatever his name is told me himself
  fine
yes
ill join your army satisfied
ah  i suppose
wait my protection is more important than fighting bern come back
if you dont have a thief you wont be able to open chests and doors only a thief can use lockpicks but i have a key called the door key which can open any door if anyone uses it you should thank me
everyone here is your ally were not about to abandon the land in which we were born in and change sides please take this treasured sword it was given to us generations ago a gift from the king
i cant believe this war is happening  under berns leadership we will definitely wither here is something that will help you stand longer think carefully before using it
the mountain bandits and pirates attack towns once they destroy a town there wont be anything left save the towns
in the laus army there are mounted soldiers who use bows this is the nomad tribe everyone wants their military might nowadays 
do you know the main point of combat there are weapons known as buster weapons which defy the weapon triangle
you fools are bound down by moldy old tradition allow me to teach you the way of the world
ha ha ha  fools  there is no future for those who oppose absolute power 
lord roy the remaining soldiers from laus are retreating
thank you tell everyone to get some rest
yes milord
roy  are you all right
i never would have thought lord erik would turn on lycia i thought the lycian leagues bond was stronger than this cowardly bern underhanded tactics
 i apologize
oh  im sorry i wasnt even thinking about you
no  you are right
well now proceed west towards ostia but now we know that even the other marquesses cant be trusted with lord hector gone i fear there may be no peaceful end for this war princess do you plan on returning to bern if you need anything 
no please allow me to stay if it would not be a burden
you a burden never but why do you wish to stay
my brother is wrong he is pulling the dragons into a human war if he thinks this is how he can free the world i must stop him
free the world
yes he has always been obsessed with liberating the world he said thats the purpose of this war
what does that mean
i do not know  my brother is not so power hungry that he would attempt to conquer the world im sure he believes strongly in what hes done to elibe regardless that doesnt excuse the violence he has caused

after meeting niime the hermit on the mountain the mysteries of berns
dragons were slowly beginning to unfold
with more unknowns still needing verification roy directed his troops toward a
large manor on the outskirts of bulgar
there advisor roartz of etruria was preparing his defenses against roy 
they let the enemy inside damn if i am to go to hell then that roy shall be going down with me
lord roartz the remnants of the djute clan are saying that they will come to our aid once they have securely hidden the miurgre
miurgre ah one of the divine weapons good then we must hold our own until then
this is roartzs manor 
i understand that this mansion holds methods of attacking through little cracks in the framework you must not think you that are safe just because your back is to the wall
do you know much about this place
well i am at least slightly known to know more than most people the rumor about this manor is something i picked up back in the city
 do you know what the dark dragon looks like
well i cant say im absolutely sure about that but i would love to see it with my own eyes
i was thinking  maybe the dark dragon is in human form as well
perhaps maybe all the dragons are in human form now ive also heard stories of dragons in human form living with people
arcadia 
hm did you say something
no nothing
i dont know anything specific but ive read in an ancient scroll that dragons started taking human form only after the ending winter
the ending winter 
youve heard about it right
yes only in legend ‘at the winder of ends the laws of nature were turned upside down day became night and summer became winter
thats it these scrolls are so old and damaged so i couldnt decipher all of them but one thing is clear the ending winter was a disaster powerful enough to bend and twist the planet
what caused it
who knows  popular belief says that the laws of nature were twisted when the dragons unleashed vast amounts of magical power but i have no idea about what really happened but it does seem certain that dragons started taking human form after the ending winter it must be more than coincidence
yes i agree
well either way the truth lies in bern
good the mansion is in chaos i shall fight those bern troops alone to the death
those pigs from etruria  i shall avenge my djute brothers right here right now
are you the etrurian general leading this group
yes and you are
i am dayan
dayan  ive heard that name somewhere 
i must first thank you my clan was always fighting against bern and the clans that submitted to them we were forced to reside to guerilla warfare instead of going up against them honorably face to face however now that you have attacked bern the tables are beginning to tip in our favor
i see i am glad that i could help
but i want to ask you one thing once this battle is over do you intend to withdraw your troops right away
after this battle
yes sacae belongs to us sacaeans if authoritarian rule by bern is only to be replaced by etrurian rule then we would have to fight you next
right after this battle  that would not be possible we must have sacae as a base to launch direct attacks on bern
what  directly into berns lands
even if we could drive off bern now it would only be a matter of time until they strike back at us we must destroy their roots right
yes you are right i see in that case i shall aid you
that would help us tremendously
but once bern is defeated you must withdraw your troops from sacae is that all right with you
of course you have my word
s someone come and defend me it is all over if i am hurt
w wait  be my servant it is still not too late  i shall forgive your crime of turning your blade toward me  guh 
douglas  hmph after all that you said you too are following those with power
perhaps it may seem that way from the outside but there is no hesitation in my heart now
silence i have just about had enough of you die here
next is bern 
master roy we have reports that the remainders of the djute clan are hiding in some ruins near here
ruins
yes and we also have a captive who says that a bow used during the scouring is hidden there
what then 
its highly possible that it is a divine weapon
we must get to those ruins lets go
merlinus i need you to send this letter to bishop yoder in etruria
a letter may i ask what it says
its the story we heard from niime about the dragons
oh what did you discuss with her about the dragons
itll be long if i tell you i havent sealed the letter yet so you can look through it if you want
all right let me see 
 roy
princess is something wrong
 we enter bern now
yes we will attack bern very soon so may i ask the rest of the story now 
 yes that is why i came to you
king zephiel was an outstanding pupil is his studies he was skilled in warcraft  he grew to be the perfect heir for the king
that is correct
but still the former king did not look kindly at him
in fact  our father began to hate zephiel because he grew to become such a brilliant and worthy youth
what is that supposed to mean 
our father was a man of ordinary skill and intellect therefore zephiels outstanding skill made our father cold towards him
jealousy 
and then one day our father told zephiel that ‘the next heir to bern would be guineveres husband
what thats awful
but zephiel was very patient he said that he did not mind even if he could not gain the throne but the people around us who were looking forward to zephiels ability to be a good king would not allow anyone else to be the heir pressured by the public our father lost his patience at last and 
decided to kill king zephiel 
at a banquet our father gave zephiel a poisoned drink from his own hands and that was the first and last cup that zephiel took from our father after returning to his room zephiel started to get sick for ten days and nights zephiel lingered between life and death but murdock zephiels teacher and loyal general saved his life
 the former king never did anything after that
no  but i have heard that he had plans to get rid of murdock and zephiels mother as traitors he was scheming to murder them all along with zephiel after hearing that zephiel made believe that he was dead our father then checked the coffin to confirm zephiels death at that moment zephiel rose up from the coffin and with his sword 
  
i was but a child then so naturally i could not have understood what was going on all i knew is that after our father died zephiel never smiled again until then he was strict at times but he was always a kind and loving brother to me so 
princess 
so i  at the bottom of my heart i trust that zephiel can change that he can become that loving brother again i had to take action
i see 
 but now my brother is in a place where my words cannot reach him roy please  please stop him please stop him from inflicting pain and suffering to the people of bern and the rest of elibe
even if it may resolve to the blade
 i have made my resolve when i entrusted this task to you
i see you have my word and loyalty princess guinevere i swear to the fire emblem that i will stop king zephiel

after defeating sigune roy headed for edessa located in the southeast of ilia castle edessa owned by zelot leader of the ilian mercenary knights once served as the headquarters of the pegasus knight squads as well however with zelot gone bern saw its chance and attacked the castle seizing it and forcing the mercenaries and pegasus knights into submission
castle edessa was murdocks headquarters but since murdock had returned to bern roartz was put in charge alarmed by the etrurian armys speed in advancing on to edessa roartz hurriedly contacted the various ilian knight groups asking them for aid however their replies were not promising
well have we got enough troops
well  we are requesting aid from ilias knights but all of them except those that have been given direct orders from lord murdock are hesitant to help us
damn how could this happen   ah we had captured zelots wife and his family how about zelots group have they responded
no  they have been traveling all over the continent as mercenary knights so we do not even know their exact location
damn 
ever since sigunes group was defeated all of ilias militia have been reluctant to fight the etrurian army
blast everyone everyone is such a coward they would have me top advisor to the etrurian court die in a place like this
cough cough 
are you all right here take my shawl
n no then you would be cold 
its all right im used to the cold its far better than flying through the blizzards on a pegasus
 thank you cough cough 
lady juno  whats going to happen to us
 i dont know but we must have hope perhaps the enemy might leave or perhaps zelot might return we must not give up hope
 where is lord zelot now
in his last letter he said that he was joining the lycia alliance army but after that  well he could be closer that we think he is
i hope youre right
 we fight again today
yes when we take this castle we can use it as a base to launch attacks on bern
 yes
princess  may i ask the reason why berns former king tried to murder king zephiel
 zephiel and i were born from different mothers i am actually only his half sister
i heard that zephiels mother was the queen of etruria
yes it was an arranged marriage to strengthen the tie between bern and etruria however our father already had a woman he loved at that time she is my mother
 
the marriage between our father and zephiels mother was forced therefore our father didnt love zephiels mother and always thought badly of zephiel
then is that why the former king and king zephiel had a bad relationship
no  even then zephiel was always trying his best to gain our fathers affection he excelled in his studies and military training and he was always trying hard he grew to become a proud heir to berns throne
then why did the king try to 
master roy we are ready for the attack
all right ill be there in a minute princess guinevere im sorry but 
no it is all right please be careful
the blizzard is picking up  this might take longer than we expected we should head for bern as soon as we take the castle
juno
zelot
are you all right youre not hurt they didnt do anything terrible to you
oh zelot i am no child i am the ex flightleader of the pegasus knight fleet you know
thats true but 
im all right im not hurt or anything
good 
why are you in the etrurian army i thought you were with the lycia alliance
well its a long story  anyway this is the etrurian army only by name it is actually made up of troops from the lycia alliance army
oh  i see
im sorry i couldnt be at the castle when i was needed the most 
theres no point in dwelling on the past
but you had to go out and fight 
oh dont you like my flightleader outfit
of course i do but 
then theres no problem youll be seeing a lot of it from now on
what do you mean 
yes i will fight alongside you as well
no no no no you retired long ago so just leave the fighting to us 
even after i retired i had to fight anyway zelot there is no safe place in the world any more
well 
so i will fight so i can help bring a time of peace all the more quickly
juno
thea  what are you doing here
its a long story  but anyway im with the etrurian army now i heard edessa had fallen to bern and i was worried but  im glad to see youre all right
 i thought you were originally fighting for the people who were fighting against the etrurian army you didnt 
no i didnt go against the ilian mercenary code i fulfilled my duties as a mercenary and then joined the etrurian army
of course  youre a good and diligent girl you wouldnt do something like that im sorry
no its all right  and um  what are you wearing
this why this is my military outfit as you very well know well what do you think dont you think i can still go on as flightleader
but  i thought you retired
i cant be saying that in this time of emergency on my own all i could do was rescue the people in the castle but if i joined you i could fight against bern as well
so youre going to fight alongside us
yes
yes i never thought i could fight alongside you again
dont get cocky now i havent gotten too rusty yet either
big sister juno
shanna why are you here
ive been in the etrurian army i was surprised when i heard that edessa got taken by bern but i knew youd be okay
oh why do you say that
you were captain of the fleet theres no way bern could defeat you
thank you well youll be sorry to hear that i was captured
well thats 
but i wont stay defeated by bern for long on my own all i could do was rescue the people in the castle but if i joined you i could fight against bern as well
then are you going to fight with us
yes
really yes
does that make you so excited
yes i became a pegasus knight because i wanted to be like you fighting alongside you is like a dream
my my  well you always did tend to go overboard with things 
next is bern 
master roy part of berns army is hiding in the ruins on the outskirts of edessa
ruins
yes apparently in them lies a spear that was used during the scouring
what that spear 
it is most probably a divine weapon
we must hurry to the ruins
princess guinevere we will attack bern now so may i ask 
 the rest of the story

after rescuing fa roy headed for aquleia
the capitol of etruria aquleia is also the largest most prosperous city on
the continent
preparing for the lycia alliance armys attack the coup detat army
concentrated their forces in aquleia
originally they had planned on using the garrison of the city for defense but
since the elimine church had turned to roys side the coup detat army had no
choice but to retreat to the castle and take post there instead for fear that
the church may have encouraged the city denizens to protest
the elimine church was started by saint elimine one of the eight heroes
this religious organization had many followers primarily in bern and etruria
roy had gained the churchs support in attacking aquleia  however narcian and
his elite troops were waiting for roy inside the castle
damn  the lycia alliance army still stands how could they come this far 
g general narcian  the leader of the three dragon lords lord murdock is here
what h hurry send someone out to escort him here make sure he gets the utmost attention 
he already is here 
enough step aside
l lord murdock  what a pleasant surprise what brings you all the way from ilia
narcian i believe you owe me an explanation
i im sorry my lord im not sure i understand 
princess guinevere has escaped again flaer your lieutenant has failed at western isles also you have neglected your mission of capturing the hidden village in nabata as given by the king himself narcian i want explanations now
y yes  well you see my lord there have been many complications and 
 enough i have orders from the king you are to be demoted from dragon lord status
what
his majesty wants galle to take your place
m my lord please wait one more chance please just give me one more chance
 the lycia alliance army is approaching this palace stop them to show me your worth if you succeed i shall negotiate with the king
lord murdock 
narcian  dont fail the king or me again
rubbish me demoted and my replacement is that galle  never i will never allow that to happen b but what can i do  no  my honor my status  its all collapsing
general narcian the enemy is approaching 
shut up i know that  wait the brother of that traitor melady was here wasnt he  ah i can say that we failed because he was working with his sister to leak information to the enemy and kill him off later hehehe 
general narcian  what are you thinking
hm oh do you know meladys younger brother
do you mean sir zeiss
right zeiss anyway hes suspected of leaking information to the lycia alliance army capture him and bring him here
what but sir zeiss would never do something like that 
shut up all you must do is follow my orders now bring him here
t the enemy is right at our doorstep
oh what must we do if we get caught we shall be prosecuted as the initiators of the coup detat 
  
 arcard this is all your fault if you had done your duty and gotten rid of the lycia alliance army at djuto 
b but lord roartz   no this is not the time to be arguing my lord we must escape
but escape to where 
 let us turn to bern this was originally their plan 
y yes of course we have done what they asked of us they would be sure to help us
 may i ask what you intend to do with the king
er  w well im sure they wouldnt harm the king after all king zephiels mother was an etrurian anyway douglas you must escape as well 
i refuse i was originally fighting alongside you because king mordreds safety was at stake i had no intention of going along with your plans
hmph stubborn as always i see suit yourself arcard let us escape
lord roartz please wait 
 dirty traitors fleeing at the last minute  it must have been easy for bern to seduce them i suppose i can leave those two to the lycia alliance army  if prince mildain returns etruria will pull itself together again and until then  i shall fight and prove my loyalty as the great general of etruria
master roy this is the palace of aquleia according to the information we have gathered the revolutionaries have holed up inside
bishop yoder i thank you for your help thanks to the elimine church we were able to avoid fighting in the city and killing innocent people
no i must thank you our order was being persecuted by the revolutionaies so if you hadnt come along to fight we would have been driven out of the land a long time ago
persecuted why
most likely because we were investigating into berns dragons saint elimine our founder said this before she ascended to heaven ‘never allow the dragons to be brought back to the world  it would spell death for many a people therefore we are making our best efforts to find a way to send the dragons back to the world in which they belong
if the revolutionaries had joined bern then they would naturally want to stop you 
thats right also we found out this the resurrection of the dragons is somehow tied to the fire emblem berns greatest treasure that was where i sent saul and dorothy to investigate
i see
master roy you must stop the revolutionaries and if you would allow me to give you further advice i would suggest that you do not do any unnecessary killing i am sure there are troops that had no choice but to join the revolutionaries due to inside reasons
yes
may saint elimine bless you master roy
zeiss where are you
im here sir galle is something wrong why did you summon me here 
there is no time to be explaining the details zeiss you must hide
 what do you mean the enemy is right in front of us
zeiss listen to me just now general narcian gave an order to the entire army to capture you
what does he think that i am betraying bern
he is trying to put the responsibility for all of his past failures on your shoulders he is saying that you worked with melady to leak information to the enemy
with my sister we dont even know where she is
melady has apparently joined the lycia alliance army with the princess
 melady turned to the enemy i dont believe it 
then get the story from her yourself i want to go with you as well but i have been told by lord murdock to observe the battle and report back to him zeiss i want you escape when you see the chance and speak with melady
sir galle i 
i do not intend on doing anything until we hear meladys story
  
what the the etrurian nobles ran off wait a minute then what happens to my payment i havent been paid for this mission yet
the treasures are calling me so this is the palace of the richest family in elibe  the treasure must be something indeed well they took it all from us in the first place so i guess ill only be taking it back
hey you youre the leader of the army thats attacking the castle right do you have a shortage in magicians
 well i guess we could always use more 
really great you see theres a mage willing to fight for you you think you would want to hire him
where is he
right in front of you
  
hey dont look at me like that im pretty decent with my magic you can hire me for 10000 gold
10000 thats expensive 
come on i need money for my grandma 
what is your grandmother sick or something
er  r right something to that nature  anyway i need some cash come on pal
well 
all right if your grandmothers sick then i suppose you need money for medicine 
you got that right shes really sick you know shes always getting these really bad headaches around her back 
huh headaches around her back
um y you know what i mean i was just giving an example of the pain   okay got the money ill do my job well you can count on me
im sorry but i cant pay 10000 gold for just one person
what  w well i could compensate with 8000 
 
come on please
well 
im sorry but 
s still no good um well i guess 6000 gold would still do 
er

well 
   all right all right im really getting desperate now  5000 hows that
come on im begging you please hire me
well 
 im sorry
no   please i swear ill be really useful 
the money we have belongs to all of us i have no right to use it on my own judgment
argh i give up fine have it your way just when i thought you were somebody  ha youve got some pretty nice beliefs havent you kid
douglas
prince mildain youve returned you seem so well now thank goodness
it is all thanks to you i am sorry i put you through this
you returned safely  that is more than enough praise
douglas i am currently working with the lycia alliance army
ah then everything will go smoothly as long as we can drive off berns troops from the palace
what are you going to do
the king is still in the enemys hands if i turn against bern now the king would be in danger 
  
but now that you have returned i have no more regrets even if i were to be defeated by the lycia alliance army
douglas i apologize you are doing this all for my father 
my prince if my life were to be used for the true benefit of etruria then that would be my last wish
  
i am glad that i could see you alive before my death
you risked your life to protect me and let me escape to the western isles i shall never forget that  never
 i still have false hope i still think of trying to take you to see the king 
 douglas i will not give up hope roy he just might be able to 
father
larum what are you doing here
i joined the lycia alliance army with prince mildain 
 so the prince has returned now etruria has hope 
father 
larum  im sorry i put you through this i had to send you off along to protect the prince
no that was what i wanted to do
 but just when i thought i had saved you from a hard life i had to send you out to be a dancer again
 you saved me from that terrible life with no food no money  and you even raised me as your own daughter  from that time i made up my mind that i would one day return the gift that i would be of some use to you
larum 
so im really glad now im finally being useful to you 
larum thank you  please take care of the prince from now on as well
what about you youre not coming with us
king mordred is still in the hands of the enemy if i turn to lycia alliance army now then the kings life would be in danger
 but still 
now that the prince has returned safely i have no regrets even i am to be taken down by the lycia alliance army
  
now go if you are seen with me you would be suspected of treachery no matter where you are you will always be my true daughter always
father 
may your life be blessed with happiness 
cecilia
lord douglas  why is someone of your stature fighting for the revolutionaries 
i am prioritizing the kings safety that is all
but if this continues etruria will become a puppet state for bern there must be a nation for there to be a king if the nation falls so will its power and in the end all will be forgotten
if this nation is doomed to collapse then so be it but i will assure the kings safety
what  we must fight for our people for our nation the etrurian army is for the people they are not the kings private soldiers
 it is a matter of opinion cecilia you must follow your beliefs as i must follow mine
lord douglas
percival  i see no more hesitation in your eyes now
lord douglas it is thanks to you because you saved prince mildain i was able to return to being an honorable knight again
good
what are you going to do lord douglas
the king is still in the hands of the enemy if i turn to lycia alliance army now then the kings life would be in danger
  
now that the prince has returned i have no regrets even if i am to be taken down by the lycia alliance army
i knew you would say that my lord
well you have walked the same path as i please take care of the prince and of etruria
yes i shall dedicate my life to them
melady
zeiss what are you doing here
 im being accused of betraying bern
oh  is it my fault 
sir galle said that you had joined the enemy but i couldnt believe it until now when i can see it with my own eyes why why did you betray bern
i never betrayed bern i just wanted to help princess guinevere
so you threw away everything your homeland your family even your lover for the princess for that stubborn princess who betrayed her own brother
enough zeiss i will not tolerate you insulting princess guinevere
  
its the princess not the king who is truly working for the good of bern granted i was angry when the princess left without consulting me at all but now that im by her side i understand more than ever that she had not made a mistake
 sir galle was right

he said that he didnt intend on doing anything until he heard your story
galle said that 
i dont fully agree with you yet but  i know i can trust you
zeiss then 
if the lycia alliance armys leader would allow it i want to go with you i want to see the princess beliefs that moved you so
i am strong i am wise i am handsome and i am right always more than anybody
no no  i will not be defeated  not by you worthless  gaaaaaaahhhhh
you  youre that girl that was 
 excuse me have we met before
what you have forgotten me of all people that must not be
youre princess guineveres  ha so you betray your nation and turn to the enemy disgraceful
you 
general narcian  no narcian i heard everything from sir galle do you not have any honor left in you at all
galle  dammit is he ever an eyesore well it shall be fine  once i get rid of you everything will be shrouded in mystery 
youre  so being defeated once wasnt enough
zephiel was the one who defeated me not you
then i shall show you my strength now
well if it isnt general percival the traitor
joining you was the biggest mistake of my life and now i shall repent for it by defeating you
so it is you who rescued us
my name is roy leader of the lycia alliance army
hm 
  
 i must ask you of something the soldiers who have been working with bern have taken over the tower of the saint
the tower of the saint  that is where saint elimines altar lies
yes  that is a national symbol of etruria please i ask you to recapture the tower
i will do what i can
i am sorry you may use anything in the tower that you find useful
the king  he still mourns the princes death
he must have been an easy target for bern
i want to help him but how
father i am sorry when the time comes i will return i promise
princess guinevere i must speak with you
 is it that we must attack bern as well after etruria
 did someone inform you
no  but i knew that it would happen eventually
 we cannot leave bern running around freely any longer i know that it will be hard to see your nation invaded but 
 roy i will give this to you
what is this
it is berns greatest treasure the fire emblem
what
in the south of bern lies a temple called the temple of seals in it lies the sword that our founder hartmut used
is it one of the divine weapons
i believe so it was a sword made to slay the dark dragon the leader of the dragons during the scouring however it held power so immense that it was sealed away after the war the fire emblem is the key to break its seal
the key 
my brother is trying to force the world into submission through power that is not forgivable no matter what the reason
  
to stop him all we can do is defeat the dragon at his side
princess guinevere 
 my name shall be stained in history as the woman who betrayed her nation
no 
i shall be hated all my life as a traitor roy promise me one thing when we invade bern promise me that you will not harm the civilians 
i promise please trust me
 thank you

after saving the hidden village of arcadia roys army found their way out of
the desert following igrenes lead
now they turned toward etruria to confront the coup detat forces  at this
point a disturbing message came from the elder of arcadia
apparently fa the little dragon girl had left arcadia following roy  if
she were to fall into the hands of the coup detat forces or of bern who stood
behind them it would be a disaster
bent on finding fa roy moved his forces toward a small fort near the etrurian
border
general raeth about the girl we captured earlier 
girl that one that was scurrying around the outskirts of the castle are you still worrying yourself over that thing just throw her out
but sir she was carrying this
 is this a dragon stone
 that is also what i thought so i decided to report
have you ever seen a dragon stone before
yes when we invaded lycia the dragons were carrying them when they were in their human form
 but it looks different from the ones that they have either way it has to do with the dragons we should inform king zephiel and follow his instructions make sure the girl doesnt get away
percival dont strain yourself here
lord douglas please do not worry about me you must return to king mordreds side
hmph defeating the lycia alliance army is not a task that requires the knight generals assistance  roartz that snake
he is wary of my turning against him he must be thinking that i would try and murder him in his sleep if i were stationed at aquleia
that man worrying about traitors ha he shouldnt be the one to talk why he was first to betray his loyalty to the king the bastard
well lord douglas it just goes to show that not many have such loyalty as you
rubbish look at yourself
 i had no hesitations when prince mildain was alive i never doubted my loyalty to him or to the wellbeing of etruria this mission is to protect the kings life  that should be enough reason to fight 
do you hesitate now
yes slightly but it matters not nothing will change even if i do
i see  percival my speech from this point forth is merely to myself do not reply to it
  
etruria will most certainly fall with the king before this war ends
 lord douglas
listen no matter what happens i will stay by the kings side but you percival you are different you are the one who will lead etrurias future i cannot say when but i firmly believe that etruria will be blessed with prosperity once more so percival you must leave etruria and wait until that time comes
lord douglas what does 
general percival we have spotted the lycia alliance army up ahead what are your orders sir
now go i shall return to aquleia
  move forth pursue the lycia alliance army
is that the castle where fa was taken
yes the locals have witnessed it
roy i apologize on behalf of my people for the inconvenience  i know we must hurry toward aquleia
no please dont worry about it if she were to fall into the hands of bern that in itself would be a disaster
she should be safe as long as she remains in her human form and doesnt show anyone her dragon stone
dragon stone
yes when dragons are in their human form they seal their powers into crystals called dragon stones it is said that it takes vast amounts of energy for dragons to maintain their actual form in this world so they typically remain in human form to minimize energy consumption
maybe the ‘human not human was in human form for the same reason
most likely it is also said that dragons only started taking human after the scouring ended
since the scouring 
yes 
master roy the spy we sent to the castle has returned
what did he find out
he said that a large number of troops have been coming out of the castle they seem to be fortifying their defenses
oh  maybe they found out that fa is a dragon
the border guards also seem to have noticed us 
we have to do this quickly
this is gonna be a battlefield too 
what do we do boss
the armys gonna loot the villages anyway i suppose we better ransack em while we can
awright boss
but make sure you dont do any unnecessary killing you got that
got it 
hes too nice  well i guess we can make it the armys fault
general raeth the reinforcements are ready
good send them out
yes sir
wait
what who are you
why why do you attack the villages
eh who do you think you are
tell me why youre attacking the villages
why  well i could say that its your fault
our fault 
yup because you idiots are causing wars like this there are more and more people like me who have to steal to get food
we are fighting to help people like that
right ive heard that enough times now look at reality kid they all say that theyre trying to help but its all words and empty promises wheres the action you got your head in the clouds and you just cant see what goes on on the ground get it now out of my way
 no
what listen i aint playing games with you if you dont get the hell out of my way 
i wont move if you want to kill me then you may do as you wish
what 
if i let you pass i would just be another one of those people who you say are all talk and no action i am telling the truth we are fighting to help the people

after taking saul a priest of stelimine and dorothy his bodyguard into their ranks roy and company enter thria southeast of ostia
thria is governed by lord orun hectors half brother oruns home castle seems a safe place to stay
i snuck in here no problem but theres nothing worth stealing hmm looks like the north hall has all the valuables but with that security   are those footsteps
i trust everything is under control
yes milord the soldiers are stationed all around the castle
once theyre inside and have their guard down ambush them just as with lord orun
yes milord
i want princess guinivere alive the rest you can do with as you wish now go
ha ha ha ha  first the silver wolfs granddaughter and now princess guinivere  with so much to offer bern is certain to allow us to join them
hmmm  now isnt that interesting
finally we can get a good nights rest lord roy
i wonder that man said he was lord oruns advisor 
wagner did something seem wrong with him
he seemed to be in control of everything as if he were the lord and lord orun is so ill he cant even meet his guests it all seems strange 
now that you mention it you have a point
excuse me lord roy there seem to be an awful lot of soldiers patrolling the castle
i think theyre spying on us
what no 
you noticed not bad 
whos there show yourself intruder
hi
and who might you be
aw im not one to talk about myself i overheard that wagner guy in the main hall though he said theyre gonna ambush you guys
lord orun would never do that
oh yeah hes dead i think wagner assassinated him or something
what
he wants to capture you all and turn you over to bern
wait lord roy we cant trust her word so easily
its up to you whether you trust me or not but dont say i didnt warn ya
roy  if what she says is true 
lets spring his trap well pretend like were leaving if wagner is after us hell try to persuade us to stay
if you wanna get out go through the north hall thatll bring you to the courtyard so youll be outta here in no time good luck
oh lord roy where are you off to i will escort you back into the castle so please follow me
my apologies sir wagner i have just received a report of grave importance please excuse us but we must take our leave now
surely you would appreciate a warm bed after being in the field for so long lord orun would be furious with me if you left without accepting our hospitality
dont worry i shall tell lord orun myself that you are not to blame i ought to at least offer him a greeting anyway please show us to his room
as i said milord lord orun is ill and cannot accept guests
if we cannot see him then we must be off
theres nothing i can offer to make you stay
 
you leave me no choice then guards attack kill them all but leave princess guinivere alive
the girl was right they were trying to ambush us
lord roy if we go this way well be leaving our rear open to attack
then well seize the whole castle everyone follow my lead
all that noise  a battle what is going on out there
hoo boy theyre at each others throats now time to pilfer what i can now that securitys busy
hey youre 
oops

i see then i will join your side
you will why
the soldiers of this castle have done me wrong
what what do you mean 
please give me a bow i will fight with you
useless guards but very well witness my magic and bow down before its power
no  my plan was flawless 
 youre the granddaughter of one of the chieftains in sacae
my grandfather is the strongest warrior in sacae people call him the silver wolf
the silver wolf  ive heard tales of him but what are you doing in lycia this is a long way from sacae
bern invaded sacae so the kutolah clan decided to take up arms grandfather had the women and children escape to lycia but 
but
there was a traitor the djute clan who turned to berns side ambushed us
 
we were all separated i found my way into this land and i was rescued by lord orun but wagner his advisor assassinated lord orun and took over the castle
and thats when you were captured 
is your army fighting bern
yes we will fight for as long as it takes
then let me join you fighting bern may lead me to grandfather lord orun deserves vengeance as well
were headed for ostia in the west sacae is in the east the opposite direction is that all right
i dont mind no matter where we are mother earth and father sky will watch over me
lord roy the spy i sent to ostia has just returned he says that ostia is in a state of anarchy
what why
theres been a rebellion among those who want to surrrender to bern
is lilina safe
the spy says that she has been taken hostage the rebels already took over castle ostia and are fighting the loyalist soldiers
we must hurry to ostia lilina  please be safe
