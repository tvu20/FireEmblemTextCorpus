Driven away from their palace, Roartz and Arcard fled to Ilia, which was still under Bern\u2019s control.", "Ilia, also known as the Frozen Highlands, was a harsh land with short summers and long winters. With little arable land, the nation\u2019s main source of income was to send out mercenary knights to fight for pay.", "Etruria joined force with the Lycia Alliance Army to form a joint force under the name of the Etrurian Army, with Roy as its commander. Their first mission was to enter Ilia and finish off the remaining Revlutionaries. Once that was done, they would proceed to launch direct attacks on Bern. With the powerful backing of the Elimine Church, Roy had the populace on his side.", "However, Roy had to face the freezing cold of Ilia, as well as Bern\u2019s elite troops under General Murdock, the leader of the Three Dragon Lords. In addition, many of the powerful Ilian mercenary knights had submitted to Bern\u2019s side.", "As a start, Roy headed for Castle Raemy, located on the Ilian border."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Murdock", "line": "So, Narshen has fallen."}, {"speaker": "Galle", "line": "Yes. Lord Murdock, did we really not have to aid him?"}, {"speaker": "Murdock", "line": "Those were the king\u2019s orders. Besides, the Bern army has no use for a man who cannot clean up his own messes."}, {"speaker": "Roartz", "line": "Lord Murdock... What will become of us?"}, {"speaker": "Murdock", "line": "Lord Arcard, I will entrust this land of Raemy to you. Lord Roartz, I will have you take the land of Edessa. You must make preparations to retaliate."}, {"speaker": "Arcard", "line": "What!? Raemy is right on the border! The enemy will arrive in no time!"}, {"speaker": "Murdock", "line": "True. But this position also allows us to easily launch attacks on Etruria. Make sure this castle does not fall."}, {"speaker": "Roartz", "line": "Edessa... It is deep in the wastelands of Ilia..."}, {"speaker": "Murdock", "line": "That would give you plenty of time to prepare your forces, would it not?"}, {"speaker": "Arcard", "line": "Could you not...take back Etruria for us?"}, {"speaker": "Murdock", "line": "We could. However, when we do, Etruria will go under Bern\u2019s rule."}, {"speaker": "Roartz", "line": "No! That won\u2019t do."}, {"speaker": "Murdock", "line": "Then I suggest that you find a way to deal with the situation yourselves.

Thanks to the Church, we were able to proceed thus far with ease."}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "Please. If you had not captured Aquleia, we would be suffering from persecution under Bern. This is nothing in comparison to what you did for us."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "I am glad that I could be of use to you."}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "Now... May I ask you a very important favor?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Yes, anything that I am capable of."}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "If you find out anything else about the Dragons..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "I understand. If I discover anything new, I will report to you immediately."}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "Thank you! ...Ah, yes, I must tell you something else. This land of Raemy... At a certain time of the day, the sea level drops, exposing a sand bar that can be crossed."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "A sand bar?"}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "Yes. It will take long to traverse all the way around the bay to attack the castle. However, should you be able to cross the sand bar, you may be able to save some time."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "I see."}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "Still, please be careful.

He killed his own father?"}, {"speaker": "Merlinus", "line": "Didn\u2019t you know, Master Roy? Zephiel took the throne because the former king had died.
