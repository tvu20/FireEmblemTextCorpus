Good, then we must hold our own until then!"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "This is Roartz\u2019s manor..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "I understand that this mansion holds methods of attacking through little cracks in the framework. You must not think you that are safe just because your back is to the wall."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Do you know much about this place?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Well, I am at least slightly known to know more than most people.

But I would love to see it with my own eyes."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "I was thinking... Maybe the Dark Dragon is in human form as well."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Perhaps. Maybe all the Dragons are in human form now. I\u2019ve also heard stories of Dragons in human form living with people."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Arcadia..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Hm? Did you say something?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "No, nothing."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "I don\u2019t know anything specific, but I\u2019ve read in an ancient scroll that Dragons started taking human form only after the Ending Winter."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "The Ending Winter..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "You\u2019ve heard about it, right?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Yes, only in legend. \u2018At the Winder of Ends, the laws of nature were turned upside down. Day became night, and summer became winter.'"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "That\u2019s it. These scrolls are so old and damaged so I couldn\u2019t decipher all of them, but one thing is clear. The Ending Winter was a disaster powerful enough to bend and twist the planet."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "What caused it?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Who knows... Popular belief says that the laws of nature were twisted when the Dragons unleashed vast amounts of magical power, but I have no idea about what really happened.

That\u2019s awful!"}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "But Zephiel was very patient. He said that he did not mind even if he could not gain the throne.

But Murdock, Zephiel\u2019s teacher and loyal general, saved his life."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "...The former king never did anything after that?"}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "No... But I have heard that he had plans to get rid of Murdock and Zephiel\u2019s mother as traitors. He was scheming to murder them all along with Zephiel.
