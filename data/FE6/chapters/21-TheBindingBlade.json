What brings you all the way from Etruria? Is something wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "I did some research after receiving your letter. I have come to the conclusion that Bern has indeed resurrected the Dark Dragon!"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Is that true!? ...But Hartmut defeated the Dark Dragon in the war.

As the the fire-breathing Dragons can change into human form, is highly possible that the Dark Dragon can as well. In fact, we have a suspect. There is a shaman called the Dark Priestess whom King Zephiel keeps at his side at all times."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "The Dark Priestess..."}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "We have no solid evidence, but it is true that she appeared at around the same time that the other fire-breathing Dragons started to be seen."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Yoder", "line": "Apparently, the Dragons sealed away their power in gems called Dragon Stones to change into human form so that they could adapt to this environment.
