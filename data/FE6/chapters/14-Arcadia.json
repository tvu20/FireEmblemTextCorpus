According to her, the village of Arcadia was located in an oasis hidden in the desert.", "However, Arcadia was already under attack by Bern.

Maybe she was caught by Bern\u2019s troops."}, {"speaker": "Fa", "line": "If we get caught by Bern, then can we see the outside world?"}, {"speaker": "Igrene", "line": "Fa, no. The elders said that we mustn\u2019t communicate with the outside."}, {"speaker": "Fa", "line": "Aww... Please?"}, {"speaker": "Igrene", "line": "No. ...But I wonder how Bern found out about our village... Perhaps it has something to do with the ominous energy that Sophia detected from the soldiers..."}, {"speaker": "Fa", "line": "What\u2019s wrong?"}, {"speaker": "Igrene", "line": "! I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about such matters now. Fa! Over here, hurry!"}, {"speaker": "Fa", "line": "...Fa wants to see the outside world, too."}, {"speaker": "Randy", "line": "Zeiss!

This sandstorm...has always protected our village from intruders..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "It\u2019s going to be a pain trying to look for a village in this mess.

Then we wouldn\u2019t be able to find our way home."}, {"speaker": "Rose", "line": "Well then, Maggie, do you think that we should pass up the hidden village?"}, {"speaker": "Maggie", "line": "My dear Rose, you forget that there are rumors of vast treasures hidden in that village."}, {"speaker": "Rose", "line": "Well, we certainly don\u2019t want to miss that, do we, Maggie?"}, {"speaker": "Maggie", "line": "Of course not, Rose. We can make a lot more money through that than by mugging travelers."}, {"speaker": "Rose", "line": "But we don\u2019t want to get lost, either, do we, Maggie?"}, {"speaker": "Maggie", "line": "My dear Rose, I have an idea.

It looks like it was forced open. What lies inside this temple?"}, {"speaker": "Sophia", "line": "A spell book... We call it...the Divine Weapon..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Divine Weapon!?

But I am too old to detect such energy now."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Energy? What is that?"}, {"speaker": "Elder", "line": "Sophia is half Dragon, half human.

But because she can\u2019t detect them clearly, she only said that she felt a force...twisted and unnatural."}, {"speaker": "Igrene", "line": "I think that we should look into it.
