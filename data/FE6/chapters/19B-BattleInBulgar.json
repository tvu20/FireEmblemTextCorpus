Then I shall fortify the inside and leave the outside to you."}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "...That is the highest advisor of the Etrurian court? Why should we fight for a coward like him?"}, {"speaker": "Kel", "line": "Don\u2019t say that. General Brunnya didn\u2019t willingly tell us to protect him.

I am actually only his half-sister."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "I heard that Zephiel\u2019s mother was the queen of Etruria."}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "Yes. It was an arranged marriage to strengthen the tie between Bern and Etruria. However, our father already had a woman he loved at that time. That was my mother."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "The marriage between our father and Zephiel\u2019s mother was forced. Therefore, our father didn\u2019t love Zephiel\u2019s mother, and always thought badly of Zephiel."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Then is that why the former king and King Zephiel had a bad relationship?"}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "No... Even then, Zephiel was always trying his best to gain our father\u2019s affection. He excelled in his studies and military training, and he was always trying hard. He grew to become a proud heir to Bern\u2019s throne."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Then why did the king try to..."}, {"speaker": "Soldier From Off-Screen", "line": "Master Roy! We are ready for the attack!"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "All right, I\u2019ll be there in a minute! Princess Guinevere, I\u2019m sorry, but..."}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "No, it is all right. Please be careful."}], "battle": [{"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Well, well...

Master Roy is very busy."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "What\u2019s the matter?"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Well, Master Roy, she kept pestering me that she wanted to see you. But you were busy, so I was trying to drive her away."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Listen to me first. Then you can decide whether you want to get rid of me or not. I think I have information that you might be interested in."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "...What is that?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "It\u2019s about the humans who change form into beasts."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "...I want to speak with her in private. Can you leave the room?"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Well, well, that got you interested, didn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Those beasts you speak of..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Right. Dragons."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Dragons... They are not the wyverns that Bern\u2019s Dragon Knights ride, but the strange troops that are mixed in with Bern\u2019s soldiers..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Exactly. Those are the Dragons that were supposedly defeated in the Scouring."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "...Who are you?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "I am Niime, a scholar of ancient Dark Magic. Some call me the Hermit on the Mountain. This war...at first, I thought it was just another skirmish, so I didn\u2019t pay heed of it. But now...I can feel evil among Bern\u2019s troops, so I\u2019m investigating."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Were you able to find out anything?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "The Dragons are indeed shrouded in mystery. I looked through many ancient books and scrolls, but I could only decipher so many of them. But..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "...But?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "I have come to believe that Bern has resurrected the Dark Dragon."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Dark Dragon... That is the leader of the Dragons that Hartmut defeated."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Right. Dragons are a much more advanced species then us humans. They have much greater vitality and intellect than us. However, there was one thing that the Dragons lagged far behind the humans in. The Dragons\u2019 reproductive system was much less efficient than that of the humans. But even then, the Dark Dragon...it had the power to create more Dragons. That is what I learned from my research."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "It can make more Dragons..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "The Dark Dragon can create more of its kind. That would explain where Bern has been getting all of its Dragons."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "That is possible."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Now, that being said... I want to learn more about the Dragons. Let me accompany your travels. I wield Dark Magic...I\u2019m sure I can be of some assistance."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Of course. We want to learn about the Dragons as well. It may be dangerous, but it that\u2019s okay with you, you\u2019re welcome to join us."}]}
