We have brought Lady Niime, as you asked."}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "Good. Let her pass."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "What do you need from me?"}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "Are you Niime, the Hermit on the Mountain?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "So, some have begun calling me that, have they? Then I must be that Niime."}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "I hear that you are capable of using the ancient spell book that we found in this castle."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "I should be able to. I\u2019ve been studying the dark arts and ancient magic for decades now."}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "I understand that this spell can change the weather around the caster..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "It wouldn\u2019t be entirely improbable."}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "Then I order you. Use the spell book and create rainfall. Make it rain so that the rivers will overflow and push back the advancing Etrurian Army."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Well, I can try, but I frankly can\u2019t guarantee that it will work. Also, powerful spells like these can only be cast once. Are you sure?"}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "Silence! All you must do is follow my commands. You were the one who came to us and said you wished to join our forces. Then make yourself useful."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Princess Guinevere... We are getting closer to Bern."}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "...Yes."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Since we are getting closer, we are clashing with soldiers from Bern more and more often.

You tried to stop him even by casting away your nationality. If King Zephiel is such a mad individual as the rumors say, then why did you try so hard to find a peaceful way to end the war?"}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "......"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Princess Guinevere, I accepted the Fire Emblem not to use it in battle, but to try and find a use for it to end this war peacefully."}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "Roy..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Therefore, please tell me the truth about the rumors..."}, {"speaker": "Guinevere", "line": "I...I\u2019m sorry.

Princess Guinevere was running off..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "...No, it\u2019s nothing. Did you need something?"}, {"speaker": "Merlinus", "line": "Yes, I have gathered some more information. We may have some trouble with this battle. A powerful dark magician by the name of Niime resides in the enemy ranks."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Dark magician... A Druid, probably."}, {"speaker": "Merlinus", "line": "She is apparently extremely learned in ancient sorcery. She has much more knowledge than any scholar could dream of."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "But we can\u2019t pull back now."}, {"speaker": "Merlinus", "line": "No, but we can always be careful."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "I know.

All right..."}, {"speaker": "Merlinus", "line": "Wh-What is going on...?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "An enemy spellcaster? Everyone, watch out!"}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "What... What is this!? The rivers... The rivers have frozen over!"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "My, my... Now isn\u2019t this a surprise..."}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "! You! You did this on purpose!"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "What are you talking about... I warned you that I couldn\u2019t predict what would happen."}, {"speaker": "Martel", "line": "Quiet! Someone! Throw her into the dungeon!"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Yes, sir."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Sigh..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "What...happened?"}, {"speaker": "Merlinus", "line": "Master Roy, we have a report.

I live in the mountains and study arcane magic."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "You say you were released. Did you not join Bern out of your own will?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Well, I did, but it was only a guise. Bern\u2019s army had something that I wanted to study."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "What is that?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "The Dragons."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "!"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Well, well, that got you interested, didn\u2019t it?"}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "The Dragons you speak of... They are not the wyverns that Bern\u2019s Dragon Knights ride, but the strange troops that are mixed in with Bern\u2019s soldiers..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Exactly. Those are the Dragons that were supposedly defeated in the Scouring."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Why do you know this...?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "I thought that this war was just another skirmish at first. But then I began to see strange...evil things among Bern\u2019s troops, so I decided to investigate."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Were you able to find out anything?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "The Dragons are indeed shrouded in mystery. I looked through many ancient books and scrolls, but I could only decipher so many of them. But..."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "...But?"}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "I have come to believe that Bern has resurrected the Dark Dragon."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Dark Dragon... That is the leader of the Dragons that Hartmut defeated."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Right. Dragons are a much more advanced species then us humans. They have much greater vitality and intellect than us. However, there was one thing that the Dragons lagged far behind the humans in. The Dragons\u2019 reproductive system was much less efficient than that of the humans. But even then, the Dark Dragon...it had the power to create more Dragons. That is what I learned from my research."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "It can make more Dragons..."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "The Dark Dragon can create more of its kind. That would explain where Bern has been getting all of its Dragons."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "That is possible."}, {"speaker": "Niime", "line": "Now, that being said... I want to learn more about the Dragons. Let me accompany your travels. I wield Dark Magic...I\u2019m sure I can be of some assistance."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Of course. We want to learn about the Dragons as well. It may be dangerous, but it that\u2019s okay with you, you\u2019re welcome to join us."}]}
