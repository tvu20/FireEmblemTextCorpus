Is this...a Dragon Stone?"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "...That is also what I thought, so I decided to report."}, {"speaker": "Raeth", "line": "Have you ever seen a Dragon Stone before?"}, {"speaker": "Soldier", "line": "Yes, when we invaded Lycia. The Dragons were carrying them when they were in their human form."}, {"speaker": "Raeth", "line": "...But it looks different from the ones that they have. Either way, it has to do with the Dragons. We should inform King Zephiel and follow his instructions.

He must be thinking that I would try and murder him in his sleep if I were stationed at Aquleia."}, {"speaker": "Douglas", "line": "That man, worrying about traitors? Ha! He shouldn\u2019t be the one to talk. Why, he was first to betray his loyalty to the king! The bastard."}, {"speaker": "Percival", "line": "Well, Lord Douglas, it just goes to show that not many have such loyalty as you."}, {"speaker": "Douglas", "line": "Rubbish. Look at yourself."}, {"speaker": "Percival", "line": "...I had no hesitations when Prince Mildain was alive. I never doubted my loyalty to him, or to the wellbeing of Etruria.

Nothing will change even if I do."}, {"speaker": "Douglas", "line": "I see... Percival, my speech from this point forth is merely to myself.

Lord Douglas!?"}, {"speaker": "Douglas", "line": "Listen! No matter what happens, I will stay by the king\u2019s side. But you, Percival, you are different.

I know we must hurry toward Aquleia."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "No, please don\u2019t worry about it.

When Dragons are in their human form, they seal their powers into crystals called Dragon Stones. It is said that it takes vast amounts of energy for Dragons to maintain their actual form in this world, so they typically remain in human form to minimize energy consumption."}, {"speaker": "Roy", "line": "Maybe the \u2018human not human\u2019 was in human form for the same reason."}, {"speaker": "Igrene", "line": "Most likely.
