Following his advice, Roy led his forces south toward the isle of Caldonia. Caldonia was one of the three largest islands of the Western Isles. The other two were Fibernia and Dia. Located on Caldonia was Castle Edina. Here, men from all over the Isles were rounded up and locked in prison cells to be sent to Mt. Eburacum, the Mines of Death.
