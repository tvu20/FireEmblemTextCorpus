The Etrurian capital was located there. Lord Arcard, the supervisor of the mining operation on the Isles, resided in Jutes. According to Elffin, Arcard was of high birth, but he held no importance in the Etrurian court. Roy was still worried about Etruria's response to his attacking the capital, but he had no choice if he was going to rescue the people."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Arcard", "line": "S-S...
