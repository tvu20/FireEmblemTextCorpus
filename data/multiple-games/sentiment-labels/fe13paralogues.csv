FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Chrom,We're on our way.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Vincent,"You! We have business, you and I, and I aim to settle the debt. Victor will be avenged today!",positive
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"Oh, dear. Have we met?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Vincent,"Playing dumb won't save you, girly. The gold you net from the slavers will build Victor the finest grave in the land!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"Careful, love. Prices aren't the only thing I can cut in half.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"Hello there, handsome! Am I being rescued?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Chrom,"Well, that was the plan, but you seem to be holding up just fine. Can you still fight?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"I could stand to open a few more rogues, sure. Or locks, for that matter.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Chrom,"A thief, is it?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"Locksmith, thank you very much! But yes. Door or chest, I'll have it smiling wide in a trice. And it looks like there bandits have quite the hoard built up.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Chrom,"...Huh. Well then, I think we're in business.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"Ugh. Well, that was careless... Sorry, friends. Looks like I've got to close up shop for the day.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Vincent,You stand no chance. I'm a conqueror by name and a conqueror by nature!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Vincent,"I... I see your face, Victor... No... No, wait... That's me...",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,Thanks for your help. The name's Anna. Some folks like to call me the Secret Seller.,positive

FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,Oh! Hee hee! You must have met one of my sisters.,positive
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Chrom,"Sisters? Gods, you look identical.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"Yes, there's a strong family resemblance. Oh, and we're all traveling merchants.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Chrom,...With the same name?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"Yes, actually. That's part of the secret!",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Chrom,Your family gatherings must be chaotic.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P04-AnnaTheMerchant,Anna,"True, but aren't everyone's? Still, I can't just send you on your way after helping TWO of us. So let me come along and aid you in return. I can be quite useful. You'll never make a loss with me in tow—I guarantee it!",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,Is this the place?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"Yeah, it's got to be. The townsfolk spoke of ruins in these parts that carry the legacy of the divine dragon. Of course, they neglected to mention that the place is crawling with Risen... I suppose we're just gonna have to earn this treasure the old-fashioned way.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Footsteps! ...Probably not friendly. And likely more down those stairs... Think, Morgan, think! How would Mom/Dad handle this?",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,You...don't look like a treasure hunter. What brings you here?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"There you are, Mother! I was beginning to think we got separated.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"...I'm sorry, what?",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Well, no harm done. At least we can head home now. ...Goodness, the air here agrees with you! You look a decade younger, at least.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,Wait. Let's go back to the Mother thing. ...Did you travel back from the future with Lucina?,negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Huh? Who's Lucina? And did you seriously just ask me if I came from the future? ...Why are you looking at me like that? Hello? It's me! Morgan! ...Your son? Love of your life and strapping young lad and all that? Wow, you're really acting strange today. Let's go home and get you to bed. Hmm, but which way is home? Is it— Ngh! M-my head!",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"Easy—don't try to force it! Just stay calm and listen to me. I know this sounds mad, but I believe that you came here from the future.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,Are you out of your mind? That's not even possible!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"Actually, it is. Think about it. You said I looked younger, but look again. Closely. Do I look like I'm of an age where I could have a child as old as you? At this point in time, in OUR time, you still haven't been born.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Y-you do look younger, but...",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"It's hard, I know. And you don't have to believe me right this minute. But you must come with me. It's dangerous alone, especially if your memory is gone. I was in the same position once, you know. If Chrom hadn't found me lying in that field, who knows what would've happened to me...",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Wait, you woke up in the middle of a field, too? Hah! Like mother, like son, huh? Oh, that's too funny!",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"...Glad to see you inherited my blithe outlook. Just try to stay close, will you?",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Yes, ma'am!",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,Mmm? Who are you?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"I would ask you the same. More importantly, why are you here? This is hardly a safe place to be wandering alone.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"I... I don't know, frankly. I woke up...sprawled in a field. I can't recall anything before that.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,That sounds familiar.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"I... I think I remember my name? ...Morgan? Yes, that's it. My name is Morgan.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"I'm Chrom. And finding amnesiacs is apparently my special talent. I met a good friend, Robin, under the same circumstances.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,Robin?! Is this friend of yours perchance a tactician?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,She is. Do you know her?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Yes, I know her! She's my mother! ...Wait a second. You found my mother lying here unconscious?",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"Well, not HERE. But yes, we found her lying in a field, memory-free. This was quite a while ago, mind you. So if you're her son, I take it you came from the future?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"...From the future? Are you kidding, sir?! People can't travel through time! If that were possible, I— Ngh! M-my head!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"Woah, easy there. Try to stay calm. Listen, why don't you just come with us for now? You can speak to Robin later and maybe clear this up.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"Th-thank you, sir... And don't worry—I can defend myself. You just lead the way.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,Mmm? Who are you?,neutral

FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,I'm Chrom. And finding amnesiacs is apparently my special talent. I met someone very dear to me in the same way. Her name is Robin.,neutral

FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,She is. Do you know her?,neutral

FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"Mother?! Then you're our... You're my... Morgan, stay calm and listen to me. Robin is my wife. Which means you're likely my son who came here from the future.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"...What?! But I... The future?! Is... Is that why I have no memory? But wait, I remember my mother. So why don't I remember you?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,I don't know. Do you recall a sister named Lucina?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"No, nothing like that.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"I suppose it's a blessing you at least remember your mother. Maybe something will come back once you've met with her and Lucina. Until then, you'd best come with me. ...And stay close. I don't want you hurt.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"All right, thank you. And don't worry—I can defend myself. You just lead the way.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,You...don't look like a treasure hunter. What brings you here?,neutral

FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Lissa,Sweet! This baby should keep us safe in the battles to come!,positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Chrom,"I hope you're right about that, Sis.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,That's... a lot to take in.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,It's everything we know about the situation at this point.,neutral

FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"One possible future is in ruins, yes. But you may hail from another path. We're fighting now to ensure that no one's future is lost. Unfortunately, if you join us, it'll mean more fighting for you, too.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"I understand... I'm sorry, but even after hearing all that, I still don't remember anything but you.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"Don't apologize. We'll pull your memory back bit by bit if we have to. Besides, if you start apologizing, I'll have to as well. My past is still full of holes, but I'm getting along. And you will too.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"As long as you're with me, the rest will work itself out. Now, come on! We've got a future that needs saving!",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,Hah! You really do take after me.,positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"You know, now that you mention it... There is one other thing I remember.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,What's that?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,"I've always strived to be a great tactician like you. And even though this war is terrible, at least now I can learn from you firsthand.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Robin,"Well, you're nothing if not optimistic... Wherever or whenever you came from, I'm glad you made it here, Morgan.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P12-DisownedByTime,Morgan,Me too!,positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Gyral,"Turn around and get lost, swine! This land belongs to the Stonewall Knights! If you need a second notice, I'll write it down on your men's corpses!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Dalen,"Ya-har! A pile of corpses could still outfight you sorry lot! This is our territory, and no one gives orders to the Riders of Dawn!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,What do you make of that?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Frederick,"Mercenaries, from the look. Rival bands squabbling over some petty matter. A common enough sight in these dark times, milord. But if it comes to bloodletting, the nearby villages will pay for it.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,Then let's make sure it doesn't.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Gyral,"Stick 'em full'a holes, boys!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Dalen,"Time to fertilize the fields, soldiers!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,"Well, diplomacy is probably out.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Frederick,Seems our best option is to end the fighting as quickly as possible. Allying ourselves with one side or the other would certainly expedite things.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,A band of riders or a band of knights... Time to make our choice.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Gyral,More sellswords? Ha! Your timing is right impeccable. I'll buy your steel and see you're well compensated for the trouble!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,"Well, Robin? Shall we back the knights?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Dalen,"Ya-har! There's a sensible lad. Come fight with us, instead! I'll pay you twice what that fool would!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,Robin?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,"...So it's neither, is it? Which means you aim to fight them both?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,"I should have known... Are you sure about this? There may be more of them in hiding, you know. ...But I'll leave the final choice to you.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,So be it. Shepherds! To arms,positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,That scent... It smells like... Ho! You there!,positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,Gyah! Wh-what do you want?!,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,You are a taguel.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,"Yeah, well so are— GODS! M-Mother?!",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,Mother?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,"Gah, you nearly gave me heart failure! I'd given up on EVER finding you! You wouldn't believe how dangerous it is here. All these swords and brigands... Anyway, I've found you. That makes the trip back in time more than worth it.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,"So you came with that man-spawn Lucina, did you? Hmm... Explain to me why my son consorts with common thugs?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,"Huh? H-hey, I didn't have a choice in the matter! You were nowhere to be found, and roaming around alone is a recipe for... extinction. I'd figure I'd be safe if I took up with some strong allies, and so I... Wait, are you angry? Because you look kind of ang—",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,"OF COURSE I AM ANGRY! No son of mine will survive by taking the path of the coward! You're coming with me, I'm going to teach you some taguel pride, starting right now!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,You there! Hold!,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,Gyah! D-don't surprise me like that! I could die of heart failure!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,"...I was standing right in front of you. Ought I have waved first, or would that have been too threatening?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,"Oh, aren't we the jester! People die from much lesser things you know. It's no laughing matter! What if you scare me and I trip and fall and cut my head open? What then?!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,"Er...right. Look, if you're so worried about death, maybe you should just surrender. I have no desire to spill unnecessary blood.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,"Wait, surrender is an option?! Wh-why didn't you say so?!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,So this is...extinction...,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Elder,"Greetings, traveler. We're backers of the Stonewall Knights. Try this lance out. It'll put those dastard riders in their place!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Villager,"Every time this lot has a go, our fields get trampled and our houses destroyed! Ain't no matter to us which side wins so long as it's over quickly. Here, then. Take this, and get those sorry lunkheads outta here!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Maiden,"Our village suffered enough with one band of sellswords strutting about, but two?! Here! I'll give ya this if you just make 'em stop fighting!",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Elder,"Welcome, friend. We're supporters of the Riders of Dawn here. Take this hammer. It'll send those pesky knights running for the hills!",positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Gyral,You'll never breach the impenetrable forces of the Stonewall Knights!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Dalen,You'll never stop the unending march of the Riders of Dawn!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Dalen,I'll send your fat men and their fat-man armor sailing through the sky!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Gyral,Horse and rider both will be red smears across our shields!,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Frederick,"The fighting is over, milord. That should spare the villages from any further damage.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,Good. Thought I still don't understand why they had to fight in the first place.,positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Frederick,"Competition, milord. A sad consequence of this war. Farm the land, and your fields are pillaged. Open a shop, and your goods are stolen. It's little wonder men take up steel and become mercenaries. ...Or worse. There's only so much gold to go around, and so they fight for dominance.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,Seems they'll continue to do so until it's safe to be a farmer or merchant again. All the more reason for us to end things as quickly as possible.,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Frederick,"Well put, milord. Shall we be on our way?",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Frederick,"By the by, our erstwhile allies send their regards and a reward to match. War's an expensive proposition, but I wager blood money spends the same as any other. I'll see it's added to our tally.",negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Chrom,"Thank you, Frederick.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,You.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,Gyah! Y-you scared me! Don't go sneaking up behind people! You'll give them whiplash...,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,What is your name?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,Yarne. Don't you remember? You're the one who gave it to me.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,...So you truly are my child?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,"Um, I'm a taguel, right? I kind of have to be.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,"I suppose blood does not lie. I am pleased to see you, my son. You represent a new hope for our race.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,No pressure there...,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,You are living proof that man and taguel can coexist.,negative
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Yarne,"Hey, I didn't do anything special. I was just born. You're the one who proved all that bridging-the-gap stuff. You're the one who married a human. Er, thanks for doing that, by the way. Even if I can't take credit for it, I'm proud of my heritage.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P13-RivalBands,Panne,It gladdens me to see my son value pride... May you keep it always.,positive
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Merchant,"Blast... It seems all hope is lost. Still, hold fast. I'll treat your wounds...",negative
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Soldier,Ngh... It's t-too late...,negative
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Chrom,What's happened here?!,neutral

FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Chrom,Just tell us what happened.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Merchant,Bandits have blocked the road ahead. They're demanding a king's ransom in illicit tolls for all who wish to pass.,negative
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Chrom,They think to profiteer on refugees? Despicable.,negative
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Merchant,Our caravan's livelihood is at stake. We'll do no business in this country now...,negative
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Frederick,"The flow of goods must be secured, milord, or the people are likely to starve.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Chrom,Then we'll secure it. You and your caravan can wait here. We'll let you know when it's safe.,positive
FE13Paralogues,P02-TheSecretSeller,Victor,"Vincent, darling?",neutral

FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Laurent,"Well put! And yet, not all is lost. Meeting you here is success enough. I was quickly reaching the limits of what one man can do alone. Might I lend my might to your cause? I assure you I will not be a burden.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Chrom,Of course. We'd love to have you.,positive

FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Elder,"Not many make it out this far. You must be near exhausted from the sands. Here, then. Take this as a reward for your efforts. ...A mirage village? Yes, my mum used to sing cradle songs of such a thing. Find the last tree north of the oasis shore... Then two steps north and one step more! Er, or something like that. It's not like the place really exists, anyway.",positive
FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Elder,"Well, well. This village does not often play host to outsiders... Few hold faith in that which cannot be seen to exist, yet I sense such faith in you. Here, then. Claim what you have come for. I hold my own faith that you will use it with wisdom.",neutral

FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Miriel,Mother?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Laurent,Indeed. I am your future progeny.,neutral

FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Miriel,...Fascinating. It does appear identical.,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Laurent,Do two instances of a unique object coexisting constitute sufficient proof?,neutral
FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Miriel,"To be sure, time travel is one viable hypothesis to explain the rings. But the possibility also exists that you pilfered the ring from said time traveler. As a means of identification, I fear it inconclusive.",neutral
FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Laurent,"...An astute criticism. I'm uncertain that any truly conclusive case can be mounted to prove my claim. But I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the matter, if necessary. A single-minded pursuit of the truth may be the best proof of my heredity.",negative

FE13Paralogues,P14-ShadowInTheSands,Miriel,"However, I have no material evidence to suggest you are not, as you claim, my son. I shall conduct an inquiry of my own.
