FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Sanaki,"You have done excellent work, Ike. Thanks to you, the wound that has scarred Begnion for many long years can finally begin to heal. As promised, Begnion now offers its support to Crimea's restoration. However, Prime Minister Sephiran has yet to return, which limits the reinforcements I can provide. Be that as it may, what troops I can spare await your command. Use them as you see fit.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"I understand. Thank you. That's good news, isn't it, Princess Elincia?",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,Yes. Yes it is.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Sanaki,"This has taught me a valuable lesson...Our land needs the laguz. I also believe that beorc and laguz need each other to survive. The previous apostle, my grandmother, was desirous of such a world, as were my own parents. Princess Elincia, your father, King Ramon of Crimea, was a true pioneer in the area of beorc-laguz relations. In the very near future, I will give the imperial senate a few...suggestions on achieving a fully integrated society. I doubt the road will be easily traveled, but I can no longer turn a blind eye to these issues. Princess Elincia, you must rebuild Crimea. If you are sucessful, we will join forces and change the world.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"Empress Sanaki, your vision surpasses even my own... My father would be so pleased to hear your words.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Looks like you're through with me. I'll wait outside until you're finished talking.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Sanaki,Hold! I am most definitely NOT through with you.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Huh? What did I do now?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Sanaki,"You're as impudent and impatient as ever. Heed me, Ike. If you are to help lead the Crimean Liberation Army, you must be given a more appropriate title.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"If you're talking about making me a noble, I'll decline, thanks. That's not my kind of thing.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Sanaki,"You are not in a position to refuse. Giving some nameless mercenary control of Begnion's troops would be...problematic. And more importantly, it would affect the troops. You will resign yourself to this and receive peerage from Princess Elincia.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"What? No, wait! This is absurd...Blast! Of all the foolish...",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"I'm...sorry about this. If you're absolutely opposed to it, I won't force you.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"No, I have to do what's necessary. What am I supposed to do now?  Put on a funny hat or something?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"Um, will you...lend me your sword? Thank you. Now, may I ask you...to kneel before me?",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"Th-thank you. All right... Let me begin. In the name of House Crimea, I hereby grant you the title and rank of lord and all the honors it conveys. Rise, Lord Ike.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,It is done.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,What an odd feeling.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Sanaki,Aha! Your new rank suits you.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Sigrun,I completely agree.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"Yes, it truly does...",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Hmm... I suppose. Not that it matters to me.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ashnard,"So they've left Begnion, have they?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Black Knight,"According to our spy, they march with a regiment of Begnion's army. They plan to take a land route through Daein and then into Crimea.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ashnard,"Hah! They plan to cut across Daein? With nothing more than a single regiment at whose core is a tattered band of ragtag mercenaries? Gawain's son leads this rabble, yes? How does he stand up to his father's legacy?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Black Knight,"He doesn't. He's just a boy, not yet worthy of his father's name.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ashnard,Hmph. Disappointing.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Black Knight,"Though his skill with the blade is rough, there is something...uncanny about him. People seem drawn to him. And not just Begnion's apostle, either. He's also gained the trust of the Serenes survivors...and of King Phoenicis as well.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ashnard,The herons are alive?,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Black Knight,It appears that two members of the royal family survived.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ashnard,Heh heh... Look how nicely the table's been set for us. Bring one of them to me... I care not which one. And I want the medallion as well.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Black Knight,...As you wish.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"Once we cross that great wall, we'll be in Daein. Look there, atop that building!...Daein wyvern riders on patrol. They won't be happy to see us.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,"Tell me, General Ike, have you faced wyvern riders in combat?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Only a few times. I got the impression that the Kilvas ravens were the more dangerous foe.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,"If that's your impression, then you have yet to fight true wyvern riders.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,What do you mean?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,"I have no way of judging the ones we see here, but I know another unit, one that was attached to Begnion's temple guard. They had their reasons for leaving... But the important thing to remember is that they are exceedingly powerful.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Which explains why the apostle sent you to accompany us.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,That's right. Pegasus knights fare better than most against wyvern riders. We know the skies as well as they do.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"Yeah, I prefer to keep my feet on the ground, thank you. Can I entrust the flying business to you?",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,Of course. We'll bring honor to the name of the apostle's sacred guards.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,My lord Ike. Are preparations complete?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Yes. The enemy should not yet be aware that we've come this far. We're going to launch a surprise attack and try to capture the wall on our first charge. Please wait for us at the base camp.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,Very well...,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,There's no need to look so worried. We're well prepared. And we've got you as our good luck charm.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"Thank you for that, but...Do be careful, my lord Ike.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"Hey, don't worry! This may be our first battle as an official army, but we've fought Daein many times. We're going to win. After all, I can't lose my very first battle as a snooty noble, now can I?",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"I believe in you, and I know that you will be victorious. Come back safe.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,It appears the Crimean army has arrived. It's time to put our plan into action.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Naesala,"The main body of the Kilvas army will wait atop the western summit. A small unit will remain here and cooperate with you. This is correct, is it not?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,"Mm, it is.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,What could His Majesty be thinking? Why does Daein ally herself with some backwater sub-human nation?,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,...I don't know. There's no way we can expect to understand the supreme thoughts of the king. All we can do is perform the tasks set before us by His Highness. That is everything.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,"Yes, of course!",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,The Crimean army has no idea we're aware of their every move. Bah! What vermin... What does that untrained group of vagabonds think they can do? I don't care how talented he is. Their commander is nothing more than a young mercenary with delusions of grandeur. We've nothing to fear.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,We'll show them what real war is like! And...the Kilvas ravens? How should we deal with them?,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,Those sub-human freaks! Let's use them as bait. We can sacrifice them and reduce our own human casualties.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,A fantastic idea!,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,Make sure that the men are thoroughly instructed.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,"Yes, sir!",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,You there! Halt! Mmm...you're an unfamiliar face.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,You'll know it soon enough.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,Y-you filthy piece of offal! You will bow your head to a superior officer!,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,...,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,"He's got a lot of nerve, hasn't he? Is he one of yours?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,"Yes, sir! He's a new recruit who was only assigned to me today. Please accept my apologies for his lack of any training or manners whatsoever.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,"If he's good, I can overlook almost any character flaw. Go and kill as many Crimeans as you can! Help my name be remembered with honor and glory.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Daein Soldier,"Yes, sir!",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,...Pah.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Kayachey,"Come to me, dregs of Crimea! I will teach what it means to oppose the might of Daein.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Is everyone ready? Let's move out!,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"Hold a moment, my lord Ike! In the sky...something's coming!",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Who's that?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tibarn,"Ah, Ike! Well met. It appears that you're getting ready for your first battle as Crimea's army.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"And you're escorting the heron siblings back to Phoenicis, right?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tibarn,"That was the original plan, but...Someone here insisted that we follow you. Quite unreasonably, I might add.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,"You treated us with courtesy, beorc. We must act accordingly. Isn't that so, Leanne?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Leanne,"(Yes, Yes, brother.)",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,"You said your name was Ike, correct?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Yes.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,You aided my sister and me during a time of danger. We herons hold courtesy in high esteem. We must repay our debt to you.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,That's really not necessary.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,"We are practitioners of seid magic. We cannot fight, but we can imbue our allies with strength. If you so wish it, I will travel with you. In this way I will repay you for what you have done.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,You were lucky to find your sister; shouldn't you stay by her side?,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,Leanne understands what I do.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"I see. In that case, welcome.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,Thank you. I swear on the honor of my clan to do all I can to strengthen your cause.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tibarn,It's settled then. And you'll get aid from me as well. Janaff!,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Janaff,"Right here, Your Majesty!",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tibarn,You'll go with the Crimean army and protect Reyson.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Janaff,Leave it to me!,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tibarn,"You, too, Ulki. All right?",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ulki,Of course.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,"Tibarn! It's too much, I cannot accept this. You're already watching over Leanne and my father as well.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tibarn,These past twenty years... I know what it's been like for you living in Phoenicis. I'm only sorry I can't do more.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,"Tibarn... I thank you, from the bottom of my heart.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"King Phoenicis, I will guard Reyson well. When Crimea is retaken, I will see him safely returned to you.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tibarn,"I will take you at your word. Your actions have created a bond of trust between yourselves and the hawk and heron clans. If you find yourself in a dire position, you can call on me. No matter what, I will fly to your aid.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"We gained a strong ally where we had not thought to look for one, didn't we?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Yes. Beorc and laguz...Beast tribe and bird tribe...There's no difference between us. We finally understand one another.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Elincia,"Yes, I think you're right.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"Now, let's really get started! Everyone, move out!",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ulki,They're siding with Daein? Unbelievable!,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Janaff,"Hey, hey! What are those stupid crows doing here?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Reyson,"Ravens! They betray not only me, but all laguz! Naesala, you dastard...",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rhys,Shinon!,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"...Oh, Rhys. Great. I can't believe I've run into you.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rhys,"It is great, isn't it? Oh, it's good to have you back. When you left us, I was really worried about what would happen, but--",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"Hey, Rhys? Shut up. In case you hadn't noticed...we're enemies out here.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rhys,"What? You can't... You're not serious, are you?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,You honestly never thought this could happen? You're beyond good natured. You're a fool.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rhys,"Shinon... What are you saying? You've always been gruff, but...Are you serious?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"It's not like this is the first time I've called you out. You've never considered that people may not like you, have you? Know what? We were companions once, but if I'm getting paid, I'll gladly put an arrow through your eye.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rhys,"Shinon... Is there something you can't tell us that's forcing you to do this? Are you protecting someone? Has someone you love been taken hostage? If so, we could--",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"No! There's nothing! Nothing but the right price, at least... You're overestimating me. Get going, pretty boy. Stick around any longer, and I'll start earning my pay with you!",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rolf,Shinon?,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,Rolf...,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rolf,Shinon! It is you!,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,Look at you. You've grown so much...You actually look like an archer.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rolf,Really? Ha ha!,neutral

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rolf,Ha ha ha! Um...Shinon?,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,What?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rolf,Are you...with the enemy?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,Yep.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rolf,...Sniff...sniff...,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,Stop that. I told you things like this happen. Did you forget?,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Rolf,...But...it's...not...It's not...fair... Sniff...,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,Ready your bow. It's time for the pupil to face his master.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Mist,Shi-Shinon? Ohmigosh...Why are you with the Daein army?!,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"...Tsk. None of your business, kid.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Mist,"But that's... Oh, what should I do? You used to be one of us. I can't fight you!",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"Stop whining. Didn't you ever think what it means to be a mercenary? We're enemies, kid. Get it? I'm ready to fight when you are. So what's it going to be?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Mist,...Um...,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,...Yeah?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Mist,No! I won't fight you!,negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,What?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Mist,"If you won't do that, then come work for the Crimean army! Please?",negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"Crud, I lost... This was a plum chance for me to get a leg up in this world, too.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Shinon.,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"Ha! And I can't believe that the one who defeats me is little lord Ikie. Looks like I've lost my edge. I'm ready, boy. Go on. Finish what you started.",negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,I don't think so.,negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,That's right. Still don't.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"You... You called me a weakling. Said I was nothing without the help of my father. That's what you said, right? That's why you hated me.",negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"Don't you get it? I just beat you. So your reasons don't hold water anymore, do they?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"Pah! It's enough you beat me, now you gotta talk me to death?",negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"I win, and you fall in line. Agreed?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Shinon,"Don't worry, boy. I'll make it quick.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Let's go.,negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Nasir. What's going on? We haven't seen much of you lately.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,"I've been a bit busy. In order to leave Begnion, I had to sell my ship and dismiss the crew...There was a lot to take care of.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"Is that so? Heh. It looks like you've been caught up in our struggle after all. Are you all right with that? I mean, I know you've got a lot of your own matters to handle.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,"It's not like I've abandoned my own interests to join up with the Crimean army. For me, I've judged that there's value in traveling with you. So, don't worry about it overly much.",negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,What is it?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,"Senior officials in Gallia are moving to action. Until now, they've been content to take a defensive stance and wait it out, but... It appears this neverending stalemate has exhausted their patience. Ike, this victory here today was a very important thing. It may prove to be a decisive first step in breaking Daein's power. News of it will spread like wildfire over the entire continent and give countries confidence to speak out against Daein. With Crimea as a rallying point, Gallia may well be moved to join this war. You just need to keep winning. If you can do that, the road will open before you.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,History will be made...Could Daein truly fall at our hands? Can I make that happen? Me?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,"Use what you've been given, and great things will happen. You have it in you to lead, Ike. For now, it's merely one portion of the bird tribes, but...your relationship is established. It's because you resolved to gain their trust, and then made it happen.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"It's all due to my father...If my actions prove to be the right ones, it will be due to the way my father raised me. If you treat others in good faith, they will follow you of their own volition. That's what he taught me.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,"He was a magnificent man, wasn't he?",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"When I was younger, I wanted nothing more than to be as strong as my father. And then I wanted to surpass him...Now, that is a goal I'll never achieve.",negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Naesala,What's that? The border's been breached?,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Raven Laguz,"Everyone was defeated. Not only the Daein troops, but our brigade as well. Cut down like wheat in a field.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Naesala,"Huh! Well, that was impressively done. Er, for a band of sellswords, that is. There's nothing else to do. Send a message to the Daein command and tell them the enemy is stronger than expected.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Raven Laguz,At once.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Naesala,Wait! Hold a moment.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Raven Laguz,Yes?,neutral

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Naesala,General Petrine commands the next front. She's a very...temperamental woman... But go if you like! Tell her that the Kilvas ravens have been defeated... She'll roast you like a chicken and use your bones for stock!,negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Soren,What are you planning?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,Where did that come from? I've no idea what you're talking about.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Soren,"Don't play dumb with me. We're past that. Gallia's decision to join in this war was based on some new information they received, wasn't it?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,...,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Soren,Cat got your tongue? Fine. I'll tell you what you've been doing here... You were to deliver Princess Crimea to Begnion to see if she could garner any support for her cause.

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Nasir,"If you've figured all of this out, why remain silent?",neutral

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,All right. Can you have them wait?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Begnion Soldier,Do you want them to fall out and wait in their tents? Or would you rather they form up and stand at attention?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Go ahead and have them stand down. I'll call them when I'm ready.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Begnion Soldier,"Yes, sir!",neutral

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,General Ike. What is it? Is there a problem?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,I thought you might be able to provide me with some information.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,Yes?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,What can you tell me about King Daein? I'd like to know something of him before I have to face him in battle.,neutral

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Please. Whatever you can tell me would be appreciated.,positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,"Ashnard's coronation, let me see... Yes, it was eighteen years ago. You see, a plague had struck the capital, spreading out to affect the surrounding region of Nevassa and beyond. Ashnard was crowned the year after that great tragedy finally subsided. In the entire history of Tellius, no calamity has claimed the lives of so many beorc and laguz--not since the great flood. Two years before, it struck Begnion, and the entire population of Serenes was nearly obliterated. The year after that, close to a thousand beorc--nobles and peasants alike--perished in Daein.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"Nobles, you say? So the royal family fell victim to this plague as well?",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,"Yes. The reigning king and queen and some twenty or so princes and princesses fell ill. And everyone who fell ill perished. For a time, the people despaired of losing the entire royal bloodline of Daein. It seemed that none would survive.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,And yet Ashnard survived.,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,"He did. It is quite interesting, in a sense. You see, his name was never mentioned in any talk of succession before that time. He was of such a distant bloodline that he was unlikely to be king. In another place though, his name was already well known.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,Where was that?,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,"On the battlefield. As you know, Daein is home to many brave warriors. At the time, then-prince Ashnard was said to have been a match for an entire troop of pegasus knights. Begnion and Daein both keep close watch over their borders, and their patrols fought in many skirmishes. Although there was no war to speak of, these land disputes did end with Daein claiming a small portion of Begnion soil. It would be no exaggeration to say this was soley due to the strength of one man: Ashnard.",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,Forgive me. I have spoken longer than I intended. It's about time we get back to the business of marching preparations.,negative

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tanith,Understood.,neutral

FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tormod,You keep asking that! Maybe you don't want us here.  Is that it? I don't know what to think!,negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"No, it's not that at all. To be honest, the battle ahead is going to be hard... It looks bleak. I'd rather that those without direct ties to Crimea not get involved.",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tormod,"A bleak battle? What about trying to free all the slaves in Begnion? Now THOSE were bleak battles. Bleak battles are our specialty. Right, Muarim?",negative
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Muarim,"Yes, you are. Yet...thanks to Ike's time in Begnion, things have changed completely.",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Ike,"That's right. The apostle has promised to press her investigation until there's not a single laguz slave left in the entire nation. So, there's no reason for you two to continue fighting, is there? You don't owe me anything--",neutral
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Tormod,"We're going to fight with you, Ike. We want to help!",positive
FE9,18-CrimeaMarches,Muarim,It is our right to join you in this. Just as it is your right to refuse us.,negative

FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ranulf,"Well, we're here! Welcome to Toha, Crimea's westernmost port city.",positive
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ike,What's with this place? The people are going about their business. Why aren't they worried about Daein? About the war?,negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ranulf,"It's because this area is fairly isolated. Daein's army hasn't come this far, and so life goes on as before. Daein's plan is to seize the capital, then slowly and steadily expand its sphere of influence until it controls everything.",neutral
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ike,Surely these people have some idea of what's happening.,neutral
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Soren,"Ignorance is a form of bliss, is it not? These people don't know what it's like to lose a war. They don't want to know. Crimea as a nation has always been blessed by peace. Perhaps this is due to the temperament of its rulers, but the country hasn't seen serious warfare for centuries. While minor skirmishes with the kingdom of Daein have been legion, only the eastern borderlands have taken damage.",negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ike,"And yet even I know this peace will not last. When we met Daein forces on our scouting mission, they attacked us merely for being within the Crimean border.",negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Soren,"Humans are shameless creatures that carelessly ignore any misfortune which does not befall them directly. They can--and often do--turn a blind eye to all manner of wickedness so long as it does not touch them or their kin. They will bow their heads, condemning those victims for bringing calamity upon themselves, and then they will cast their eyes toward heaven in thanks while their neighbors lay dying around them.",negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ike,"But the war is happening here. This is their home, not someone else's.",negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Soren,"When the Daein army darkens their doorsteps, perhaps they will understand. When the peace they take for granted is shattered, and their sons and daughters slaughtered in the streets...Perhaps then will they comprehend the misfortunes they so long pretended not to see.

FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ike,"He, um...he has an undeniable streak of severity in him but...but this? Something's bothering him, that's for sure.",negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Titania,It's to be expected. Even I'm a bit shocked by this place. Can they truly be as placid as they appear? Soren's a very empathetic young man. The emotions of this place may have proven to be too much for him.,negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ranulf,"Ignoring impending doom because you cannot prevent it...Fatalism is by nature a disheartening beast. Well, for all those born with nothing, there are those born with everything. Perhaps those who never notice the difference are the ones we should envy.",negative

FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ike,"What is it, Titania?",neutral
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ranulf,She's worried about me. She doesn't want to leave a solitary laguz wandering around a beorc city.,negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ike,But I thought Crimea and Gallia were allied nations. Why would a wandering laguz be cause for concern?,negative
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Ranulf,"Well, it shouldn't be, but...",neutral
FE9,11-BloodRunsRed,Titania,Do you remember what King Caineghis told you? The friendship between Crimea and Gallia exists only between the ruling classes. It hasn't taken root in the minds of the common citizenry at all.,neutral

FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Kasatai,As...as...sanctions for that nation choosing to ally itself with those evil and treacherous sub-humans.,negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Ena,"On the surface, that would seem to be so. But doesn't the action strike you as odd? To apply sanctions properly, it would be necessary to speak with Begnion first. Begnion is the suzerain state, and Crimea answers to her. We needed Begnion's leave to make a formal declaration of war. Daein's disregard for that process made us a pariah in the eyes of our neighbors, and opened us to attack from all sides. And yet, not only did the king not do this, but he chose to invade without warning. It was the worst possible strategy. Furthermore, once the king conquered Crimea through strength of arms, he seized the castle and set up residence. And now he uses it as a stepping stone for an invasion of Gallia. Which means, the king's goal was never to apply sanctions, or even to defeat Crimea. If Ashnard moves against Gallia, it's easy to envision Phoenicis, Kilvas, and Goldoa joining the conflict. And if that happens, Begnion would be forced to ally itself with Daein rather than side with the sub-humans. Look where that leads us...A continent embroiled in war. Is that not the true desire of the king?",negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Kasatai,"If... If you consider it in that way, your words do begin to make sense. Yet...to accomplish that, the citizens of Crimea would have to be sacrificed. That would be an act of madness!",negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Ena,"Let's return to the topic at hand. The king has gained himself a new castle, and I believe he considers whatever land he occupies to be his kingdom. Daein and its people are already behind him. He need not look back.",neutral
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Kasatai,"Pah! If the king wished to rule the world, he would want as much military strength as possible! To forsake even a portion of the strength he currently possesses willingly, why, it would be sheer folly...",negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Ena,"That doesn't matter. What's important is that we recognize the chance which Daein has been given. We must stop the Crimeans here. If we do not show the king our value, we are doomed. Make no mistake about it.",negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Kasatai,This is complete lunacy...,negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Ena,We will receive no reinforcements. We must hold nothing back. It is our only chance of survival.,negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Kasatai,This...I cannot... Why is this--,negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Ena,"Be strong. The king has provided us, and the capital, with one final measure. We will use it to weather this storm. However, to use it, I need you, General Kasatai. Your cooperation is imperative. If you want to win, you must trust me.",neutral

FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Elincia,What? What happened to the Crimean people? Surely only the soldiers were imprisoned or killed...,negative
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Soren,"...You truly have no idea how to rule a nation. Do you know what happens to a country that loses a war? Everything is destroyed. Homes, land, crops...everything.

FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Soren,"The people understand this, which is why they pay for protection in the form of taxes. For the royals and nobles who are charged with protecting the people, there is no greater sin than to be defeated in war. It is the ultimate betrayal of the people's trust.",negative

FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Elincia,It must be a trap.,neutral
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Soren,This is unexpected. Making us lay siege would be far and away to their advantage. I have no idea what they're playing at.,negative

FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Ena,Crimea follows a general named Ike. Perhaps he follows no procedure. Perhaps he relies solely on instinct.,neutral
FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Kasatai,I don't know if he's brave or merely reckless. It's unbelievable...,negative

FE9,21-WithoutAKing,Titania,Daein must have something which they believe gives them an insurmountable advantage. Some kind of ultimate weapon.,neutral

FE9,22-Solo,Zelgius,Thank you. Please do not hesitate to call if you have need of us. We are at your disposal.,positive
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,"Begnion reinforcements... That was unexpected, wasn't it?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,It certainly was! It seems the apostle and Sephiran did the impossible by getting them to us.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,All for our little army... It's hard to believe they would go to all this trouble.,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,"First we take Daein's capital, and now this. Things are looking up.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"You're right. Even if we don't receive help from Gallia, we still may be able to defeat Ashnard.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,That's true. It's...like a dream.,positive
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,I have to disagree.,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,"Oh, look. Soren is upset again. Who knew?! What is it this time?",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"If the Crimean army is not the crux of Daein's defeat, this war means nothing.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,What does that have to do with the arrival of these reinforcements?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"The battalion that just arrived is greater in numbers than the one we originally received. Not only that, but all of these soldiers are marching under Begnion's name.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,So?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"So... If these reinforcements are responsible for defeating King Daein, what do you think will happen? That achievement, the very victory itself, will belong to the Begnion Empire. Not to Crimea. If that happens, Crimea will be rebuilt however Begnion sees fit, and Princess Elincia will be a mere figurehead. And then, the deeds of an unknown mercenary company will be expertly covered up. We'll receive some paltry sum of money and be swept under a rug somewhere. Mark my words.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,"Soren, you're being so rude! Surely the apostle, of all people, would never do such a thing!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,And this General Zelgius seems sincere enough to me.,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,"Come, Soren. I have heard of situations like that which you describe, but whether this is such a case... We've been fortunate to receive this good will. Must we always search for such ulterior motives?",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"Yes! We must! Have you forgotten Nasir?! It's that sort of naive attitude that allowed him to remain undetected for so long! You people don't seem to get it. We are at WAR! All doubts, no matter how small, must be extinguished. If they aren't, we could well be ignoring something that will lead to our defeat. Or to our death.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Let's take Soren's comments under consideration and discuss this at length. We meet in one hour.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Zelgius,So you're going to lead a small unit out on a survey mission?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Yes, that's the plan. However...Though we've taken the castle, there are still pockets of Daein resistance. It's possible they may try to mount an attack and retake the palace. I want you to be in charge of the watch.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Zelgius,"That is, of course, not a problem. However, you're taking the princess along. Don't you think it would be safer to take more troops? Even if we split our battalion, we have enough men to handle both tasks.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,I'm just not used to moving around with such a large group. And for this mission... I'd like to keep the number of people involved as low as possible.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Zelgius,"It's not that I don't understand how you feel, but...we will compromise.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"You know, for someone from Begnion, you're pretty flexible. It speeds things up considerably.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Zelgius,"To be a soldier, one must be able to quickly adapt to circumstances around him.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,All right. We'll be back later.,positive
FE9,22-Solo,Zelgius,Take care.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,This is the place Nasir mentioned. Palmeni Temple. I hope whatever he was trying to tell me will become clear once we get inside and look around.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,"I still can't believe Nasir was on Daein's side... I just can't. And he let that dragon girl get away... Although I'm sure he had reasons for that, as well.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,"I wonder... Was it really Nasir? Although, besides my family, the only people I showed the medallion to were Titania, Princess Elincia, and Nasir... I thought I could trust him... I really did. Why? Why did he do it?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,Mist...,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Thinking about the past isn't going to help. Let's take a look at this temple.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Here we are. This is Palmeni Temple.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,What did you say? The Crimean army is here?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,They want to investigate the temple. What should I tell them?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"Crud! This ain't good. I don't know what they're after, but if they find us mercenaries who sided with Daein, they'll wipe us out!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,It is all the will of the goddess. Resign yourself to your fate... Accept it.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"Bat dung! No one's gonna roll over and die! Dying's for sissies! So tell me, how many are there?",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,"There appears to be ten or so, including the women.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,Gahar har har! That's good news!,positive
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,It is?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"If that's the lot of them, we can take care of this on our own. It'll be like stealin' a baby from the cradle! Right, then, here's the plan. Pretend like you wanna help 'em, then lead 'em inside. And listen good! You'd best not whisper a word about us being here! Or else...Kkkkccchhhhh!",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,B-but I couldn't... What you ask is beyond me--,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"KKKKCCCCHHHHH!!! Don't forget, we've got all the other priests under our control. Unless you want 'em to meet the goddess early, do as you're told!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"All right, we'd like to take a look around. Please show us each room.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,Um...very well... Th-th-this...is...Er... A v-very large room... Um...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Are you all right? Why are you shaking like that?,neutral

FE9,22-Solo,Ike,It's a trap!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,Gahar har har har! You did it!,positive
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,Please...forgive me...,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,I thought something like this might happen.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"I don't know how you got wind of us, but showing up in such a small group means you're outta luck! None of ya are gettin' outta here alive!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,We've just fought our way to the Daein capital. You're not even going to slow us down!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"Cocky, ain't ya? But who said this was gonna be a fair fight?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,Eh?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,"What, what are you doing?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,Hey! Bring out the others!,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,You fools are gonna be our shields.,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,What?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,Gahar har har! Gahar har har har! See? You ain't so useless after all!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,You filthy dogs! Those are innocent people! You can't...,negative

FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"Hey! If ya don't want them perty robes of yours to turn red, you'll attack these scum! If ya even think about betraying us, I'll kill every one of ya!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,"B-but...you can't......Crimeans, please... Forgive us...We cannot allow our brothers to die.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,This cowardice will not stand! These priests are being made to fight against their will. We've got to try and save as many of them as possible! Let's go!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,"Hey, robes! If I get so much as scratched, you better get to healing!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Schaeferr,...Gwaar... Haaaarr... Haaaaaa...Shoulda brought...more priests...Or some...babies... Dang...,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Daein Bishop,Thank you very much. I never imagined that we would be rescued by soldiers of an enemy nation.,positive

FE9,22-Solo,Daein Bishop,"Peace, my lord. We were expecting to be killed at once. Yet somehow you rescued so many of us...I'm sure that even our departed Bishop Tomenami is grateful for your aid.",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,"Father, we bear no ill will toward the kingdom of Daein itself. We wish only to reclaim the homeland which was unjustly taken from us. That is the reason we fight. We had no desire to invade this land. If nothing else, please believe that.",negative

FE9,22-Solo,Tomenami,As thanks for saving our lives.,positive

FE9,22-Solo,Mist,Ike! Ike! Where are you?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Mist? I'm over here.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,Ike! This way! Quickly! Reyson's in trouble!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,What?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Reyson? What is it?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,He's been like this from the moment he set foot in this room. He's just staring at the walls.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,What is all this?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,Every wall has the same pattern on it.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,It's not a pattern. It's an ancient language. All chants and spells in magic scrolls are written thusly.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Can you read it, Soren?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"Some, but not all. Spells are simple, whereas this is a complex narrative. I think Prince Reyson could read it.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,I bet this is the same language that Leanne was speaking.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"It is. It's the Serenes' language...Their chants are all in this language, too.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,So Reyson is reading what's written on the walls?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,It appears that way...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Shall we leave him be? There's a lot of writing here. This could take hours.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,I think that's a good idea.,positive
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,Ike!,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,What is it?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"From what I could gather, I think a person was locked in this room sometime in the past.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"...You don't know who it was, do you?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"I wasn't able to read enough of the writing, but... I found this under the bed.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Is this...?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,I think it may have belonged to whoever was imprisoned in this room.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,I apologize. I took up much of your time.,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Reyson, you don't look so good. Why don't you rest for a bit?",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"No, I'm fine. It's more important that we talk.",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,About the owner of this feather?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,...Was it in that room?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Soren found it. Whose was it?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,Lillia... My older sister. The writing on the walls is hers.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,"...You have an older sister, too?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Will you tell us about it?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"She was kidnapped twenty years ago, on the night of the Serenes Massacre. I...I thought that Lillia had been murdered along with my other brothers and sisters. I believed that until today...",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Who took her?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"The walls say only that he was a large human. She probably never knew who it was. He thrust a clan treasure at her and demanded that she use her magic to revive the thing sealed inside it. He exhorted her again and again, but to no avail. Lillia refused his request every time...because she did not possess that power.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,Someone wanted to revive the dark god...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"Shortly after she was brought here, Lillia fell ill and collapsed. I'm not surprised...it was a terrible time... She was imprisoned in that tiny room with no view of earth or sky...",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,"Oh, that's awf...sniff.........sniff...",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,Mist...,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,"I'm sorry...I just feel...so sad for Lillia...and for...for Reyson, too...",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"I beg your pardon. Let me continue. A young beorc began coming to the room to care for Lillia. She had bluish hair and blue eyes...And her heart was unusually pure for a beorc. In time, Lillia and she came to be friends, and shared a mutual trust.",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,Ah!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"Lillia decided to entrust her hopes to the woman. They shared no common language, so it took some time. But eventually, the beorc woman understood what it was Lillia wanted... Which was to take the treasure and the song...and flee this temple.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,B-Brother!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Was there anything else written about this beorc woman? A name, perhaps...",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"(Elena....) Translated into our language, it was probably Elena.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,I knew it! Mother! It was our mother!,positive
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,What?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,"Are, are you sure?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Our mother's name was Elena. Like me, her hair was blue...as were her eyes. Reyson, the object you refer to as your clan treasure was an aged, bronze medallion, wasn't it?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,How... How did you know that?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"The medallion became my mother's keepsake. The song, too... My parents both gave their lives to protect it.",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,Ike! You and Mist are Elena's children? Then Lehran's Medallion is here?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,Um...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,The medallion was stolen. Probably by Daein.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,It can't... This is...unbelievable. Can a thing like this be chance?,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"To be honest, I don't fully understand all that's happened. But...it all makes sense. It all comes together...",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,Ah!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,"Mist...That's the song that... But...the melody's a little different, isn't it?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,It's similar to the song Reyson and Leanne sang in the forest. My mother used to sing it as a lullaby.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,It is the song of release. The one Lillia entrusted to Elena.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Mist,B-but...I wore the medallion and sang that song almost every single night! And nothing ever happened.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,The magical effect of the song is awakened by the power of the singer. ...It can't be unleashed by just anyone. The true song of release can only be sung by a girl named Altina...Lillia wanted your mother to take the melody to Altina and return the medallion to its rightful place in Serenes Forest.,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"The story's becoming clearer and clearer. My father fled Daein to protect my mother, who was carrying the amulet.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,Ike? How did you know--,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Volke told me. He told me about my father's past, and the amulet, and the dark god, too.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,So you know everything...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Reyson,"King Ashnard took Lillia, didn't he?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"That would be the final piece of the puzzle. After all, the man who found my father was the king's henchman.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,Ike! Are you saying you know who killed Commander Greil? You never said anything about that! We all thought his murderer was unknown... Why didn't you say anything?,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...I don't know. I never felt like talking about it.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,"He was a Daein soldier, wasn't he? Who was it? Who was the man who killed Commander Greil?",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,IKE!! TELL ME!!,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,Can we discuss this later?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Titania,...Oh... Yes... Yes. Of course.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Soren,"Up to this point, we've all been fighting for the liberation of Crimea. Even if we now add to that stopping the dark god from being released and punishing Commander Greil's killer... Our enemy remains unchanged. King Daein and his henchman are the ones we must defeat.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Elincia,"It's mysterious, isn't it? I mean, Reyson said the same thing earlier, but... Could all of this really be mere coincidence? The fall of Crimea... Ike's parents... The death of Reyson's sister... The fact that everything leads back to Daein...",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Jorge,"Hey, Ike! Er... General Ike! Wait up! Say, if there's an enemy in my way, but I don't want to kill him, what do you think I should do?",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...Is this about that stupid game again?,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Jorge,"Well, it's all your fault! You had to go and tutor Daniel, and now I've been on this losing streak!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Tutor? You mean back when we were onboard the ship? It was just one hint!,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Jorge,"Daniel isn't like me! He's smart. I'm the one who thought up this game, but he's the one who's getting better and better. I hardly ever win anymore!",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Instead of playing that game, why don't you try some real combat?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Jorge,Stop joking around. We're happy-go-lucky traveling merchants. We don't know anything about fighting.,negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Give me a break! It's nice you're having fun and all, but please... Can you save your stupid game for someone who's not fighting for their life day in and day out?",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Jorge,"Well, what do you expect? Everything's war, war, war, and there's no place for us. All we can do is play this game. Sorry... I'll just go lose again...",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Oh, for heaven's sake...Look, if there's an opponent you don't want to kill, just shove him out of the way. Then you don't have to fight him.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Jorge,"Huh? Oh, t-thanks. ...Um...You know, we are what we are, but we'll be with you till the end. I hope we can continue to be of service. All right?",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Yeah, thanks. Sorry for being so irritable.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Jorge,That's all right. I know how much stress you've been under.,neutral

FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Something on your mind?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,"Oh, Commander Ike! Oops! I guess I'm supposed to call you General now, huh?",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,Commander's fine. So what's going on? Are you thinking about that person you were looking for?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,"That's...all settled. Actually, no... it's not really settled. It's just...I figured that worrying about it all the time wasn't doing me any good. I turned over every rock in Begnion during my search, but... It's just easier to assume that everything's going well...somewhere...",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Well, as long as you're happy, I won't say a word. So...what were you thinking about then?",positive
FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,"I...I didn't say anything before, but Daein is my homeland.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,"Is that so? Sothe Yeah. Until a few years back, I lived in the slums of Nevassa and stole for a living.",neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,"So anyway, I went back to my old stomping grounds and saw some friends. The rest of the city's empty, but they're still here. They've got no other place to go, you know?",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,And what did they have to say?,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,"Every one was mad that Crimea had won. They said if the king had been here, there's no way they would've been defeated. It's so weird. Until now, all they had ever done was complain about this place.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,I see.,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,"You know, Ashnard wasn't such a bad king. At least, as far as we could see. If you were strong enough, you could rise up and become a knight one day. You could escape the filthy slums. He was the only king who ever gave us that chance. That hope.",negative
FE9,22-Solo,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,22-Solo,Sothe,"Don't get me wrong. I don't mind fighting with all of you. But still, seeing your homeland scarred and trampled like this is tough. I'm sorry. I know Crimea is suffering in the same way, but... I can't change how I feel.",negative

FE9,17-DayBreaks,Sigrun,I'm sorry... I'm just so happy...,positive
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Tanith,Commander Ike! A priest from Duke Tanas's villa insists on speaking with you.,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,Yes? What is it?,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,Um... Master mercenary. It is my understanding that you...you pursue Duke Tanas. I hear that you're searching Serenes Forest in hopes of capturing him.,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,And if I am?,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,"Duke Tanas's property borders the forest, and he knows much about its layout. For quite some time now, he's been sending men into the forest to look for any herons who may still live there.",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,I see... So you're saying that his troops know the forest well.,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,"I, too, have been taken into the forest.",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,You? Why take a priest?,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,He thought that herons would make themselves known if a priest called to them. He's also taken dozens of chaste maidens and tried having them call to the herons as well.,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,"But he didn't find any, did he?",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,"No. And yet, this time...The joy he expressed after paying such an exorbitant price for the Serenes royal was aberrant. It was...not natural. The duke has gone mad. To think that he would dare to defy the apostle...He is damned.",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,"And here you stand. You're going to tell me what you remember about the forest, even though it means you're betraying Tanas...right?",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,"Hmm... You read me well. To begin with, the heart of the forest was divided into three large sections. Maybe more. It was nearly colorless, and difficult to see far. The muddy floor pulled at our feet, and progress was slow. Many of the soldiers around me were afraid that they didn't bring enough supplies. They said a person would need them if he got lost, because getting out again would be no easy task.",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,What can you tell me about Duke Tanas's forces?,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,"There were a lot of them...He had soldiers of every type. It was said that his mounted units and magic users were especially powerful. So at the very least, you should be prepared to deal with those two groups.",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,Thank you.,positive
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Servant,"...My parents... They both participated in the Serenes massacre. They're nearing the ends of their lives, but even now they lie awake at night and beg the goddess for forgiveness. I became a priest in order to help my parents, but then I was assigned to work at Duke Tanas's villa...I knew of his terrible deeds, but his position as an imperial senator frightened me. I have been silent for far too long. Master mercenary... You must rescue that Serenes youth. I beg of you. May the goddess guide your hand.",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,Don't worry. I have no intention of letting that villain steal him from before my very eyes.,negative

FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,...,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,We've been in Begnion for a while now. So tell me something...Why are you still here? Are you pretending to be our friend so you can lance us in the back?,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,"...You have to understand...I...I didn't know anything. I was born and raised in the Talrega region of Daein. It's a very remote area. My father was a soldier, and I grew up thinking that I, too, would one day be a soldier. A soldier to make my father proud. My life was simple... I questioned nothing. Doubted nothing.",positive
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,Do you know the first thing we're taught in Daein schools? Sub-humans are evil. Sub-humans are the enemy. Sub-humans must be eradicated. The army stages periodic sub-human hunts. We'd find refugees from Begnion hiding in our mountains and forests...,negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,You participated?,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,You don't get it! That's just how things are in Daein! No one taught me the word laguz! No one taught me that sub-humans could be... could be like this. No one cared.,negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,"When I saw the bird tribes at sea, I was convinced that the teachings were true. They were inhuman monsters. But later, I saw the dragons push your ship off of the reef, and it confused me. What if I had been raised to believe a lie? My heart pounded at the thought of it. And my doubts only grew with time.",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,"So you decided to remain aboard in order to ascertain the truth. That's your true motive, isn't it?",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,How did you know?,neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,"I've known a lot of soldiers, and none would ever accept charity from an enemy. It would wound their pride. You obviously have pride to spare, so I knew there was some other factor at play.",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,Oh...,negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,"Well, have you reached a conclusion? What will you do?",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Jill,"I...want to stay here. At first, I thought I could protect my old life, that I could prove the sub-humans were monsters. But I was wrong. And now things are different. The sub-hu-- I'm sorry, the laguz... I want to know the truth about them, and I need to base that on what I see, not what I am told by others.",negative

FE9,17-DayBreaks,Devdan,"Oh, Captain! How are you today?",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,It's commander. Not captain. Well...you seem to be enjoying yourself.,positive
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Devdan,"That's because this garden is so pretty. Devdan loves all plants and flowers. How about you, Commander?",positive
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,"They're all right, I suppose.",neutral
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Devdan,"That makes Devdan rather sad. All right is not a very strong feeling. It is boring. You should be a more emotional commander. Even things you're used to will show you something new if you look hard enough. And discoveries are exciting! That's what life is all about! At least, that's what Devdan thinks. Some disagree...and that makes Devdan upset!",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Ike,"...You may be on to something. In Crimea, when my father was still alive, I think I was more open to such things. But now...I just don't have the time. Honestly, all I can think about is defeating Daein. I've no energy left to spend on flowers.",negative
FE9,17-DayBreaks,Devdan,"...If you talk like that, you will never defeat Daein.",neutral

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,I'm...just a little seasick.,negative

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Well...All right. I'll tell you what's been bothering me. It's that incident back in Toha.,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Mist,Go on.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"When everyone discovered Ranulf was a laguz, all those people--they changed, just like that. Up until that instant, they'd seemed like such kind and decent people.

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Mist,"I have to say, at first, I was scared, too. When I saw how they could change...They can do things that we hu--I mean, we beorc can't do. They're not like us...",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"Mist, you can't honestly feel...",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Mist,"It's different now! Everyone's so very nice. But, you know, that's because of all the time we've spent together. I've seen how they are; I've gotten to know them. That's why I've changed. I'm not scared or nervous around them, but other people don't get that chance. I think that's why they're frightened.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"Maybe you're right...Maybe people like me are the odd ones, the people who accept others as they are.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Mist,"I wish more people were like that. I mean, no one really wants to fight, do they? Doesn't everyone WANT peace? I guess it's just hard to put all of those fears behind us.",negative

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Mist,"Nasir! What's the big idea, eavesdropping on us like that?",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,How do you find sailing? Have you gotten sick at all?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"We're fine. But answer a question for me, would you? Why are you here? Why do you associate with the laguz?",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"Why? Besides the obvious financial benefits, I suppose I do so because I am one.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Mist,"What? No, you're not a laguz! I don't see any tail or anything!",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"Because I've chosen to live among beorc, I've taken certain steps to make sure I'm not recognized. I've had to change my attire, my feeding habits...I've done many things.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Why would you do that?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"Laguz cannot survive in isolation, nor can beorc. If both races are to thrive, they must learn to coexist. I have spent many years searching for a way to make this happen.",negative

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"Ike, you will never truly understand a matter unless you look at it from each party's perspective. As you say, the laguz are indeed now persecuted by the beorc. But long ago, these roles were reversed.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,...Whatever happened in the past does not justify what we do to the laguz now.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"That is the thinking of an honest man. Keep things simple and pure. I like that. Still, the strength of your conviction comes from your youth and your innocence. Trust me: it will be tested. When your journey is over, how will you be changed? I pray your conviction is not lost to despair.",positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Talking to you is hard work.,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"Someday, you'll understand. For now, my role is simply to deliver you safely to Begnion. Ranulf has paid me quite handsomely with money from the king of Gallia himself,and I will not let him down.",neutral

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Soren! Do you have a plan?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Soren,I've done research in the past. All members of the bird tribes are vulnerable to wind magic. I think it's safe to assume that they are also as susceptible to arrows as any other flyer.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Wind magic and bows...All right! Everyone gather your weapons and prepare to meetthe enemy on the deck! I want a small group to remain belowdecks to protect Princess Elincia and the crew. We've never faced an enemy like this. I want everyone to stay together. Let's go!,negative

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Elincia,"No, I see what you're saying...Just as there are both good and evil beorc, there must be good and evil laguz as well. But they are so distinct in appearance...It is tempting to assume each race is, as a whole, intrinsically good or evil.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"Aye, that it is. The beast tribes of Gallia and the dragons of Goldoa seem sohonorable...and the birds of Kilvas and Phoenicis seem so cruel. It seems so easy to reduce them all to good or evil.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Elincia,I'm sure it can't be as simple as that...,neutral

FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,...That hurt! I thought you were gonna break my face...,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Well? What's your name? What are you doing here?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,"I'm...Sothe. I'm...I'm a thief, but...I didn't come onboard this ship to steal anything.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,Stop scowling at me like that! You're making me uncomfortable.,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,It's not just you. Ike always looks like that. Don't mind him; just keep talking.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,"I'm...looking for someone. I heard this ship was sailing for Begnion, so I decided to climb aboard.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,This person you're after is in Begnion?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,"I don't know. The trail went cold in Toha, and...I couldn't think of anywhere else to go from there.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Is it family?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,Huh?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,The person you're looking for.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,"Yeah. I mean, we're not related by blood or anything, but...we're definitely family.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"Nasir, my mercenary company will look after this boy. He won't be a burden to you or your crew.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"If that's what you want to do, it's fine with me.",positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,Are you sure?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,You're going to be put to work. I hope you're prepared.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,"Sure, no problem! I'll..I'll do whatever you need!",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"I wish we could help you, but we have our own troubles to deal with.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,I see your point...This is a very difficult time for all of you.,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,...,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,I see no other option. I'll take you on as a junior member of my crew.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,Really?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"It's either that or I toss you overboard, and I suspect you'd prefer I didn't.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,Thank you! I'll repay you somehow! I swear it!,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"Don't worry about the boy, Ike. We'll take care of him.",positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,It's your ship. You can do as you please.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Nasir,"Well then, it's settled. Sothe, was it? Come, and I'll introduce you to the rest of my crew.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,Sure!,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,You're a lucky boy.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Sothe,I'm just happy I don't have to hide anymore!,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,...Volke?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Right here.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Gah! Where've you been? You disappeared the moment we got on this ship!,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Volke,Don't worry about it. I'll be there when you need me.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"It's not me; it's my sister. You've never once shown up for a meal, and she thinks you're dying of hunger.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Volke,Did we ever eat together while we were on land?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"All right, listen. Land? Big. Ship? Small. It's not the same thing! I don't want Mist roaming the ship with a plate of food anymore. So please, eat one meal a day with us.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Volke,One hundred gold.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,You're going to charge me? To make you eat? And that's more than you charge to pick a lock! Why?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Volke,I don't like large groups. Bye. Call me if you decide it's worth it.,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Maybe I should just tell Mist he's dead...,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Do you have a minute?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,"Of course, Commander Ike.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"You and I haven't had very many opportunities to talk, and I--",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,You don't think you can trust me?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"No, it's not that. I'm just curious--I was surprised to see anyone in Toha who chose to fight on the side of the laguz.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,"I joined the Toha vigilantes solely for the purpose of saving laguz. I'm not from Crimea, but when I heard she had joined with Gallia, I envisioned my perfect world, one in which the laguz could live normal lives, free of oppression. However, when I came to Crimea, I found things were no different there than in any other beorc nation.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,It was the same for me. I couldn't allow myself to ignore these problems any longer.,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,"I'm happy to hear it. Of all the beorc I've ever met, you're the only one who shares my conviction.",positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"Zihark, is there...some other reason you defend the laguz?",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,I don't follow you.,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"You see, I was born in Gallia, or so I've been told. I just wondered if you had a similar reason guiding you.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,...Of course I have my reasons. Would you be upset if I didn't want to discuss them? My reasons are...extremely personal.,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"No, it's no problem. I wanted a better understanding of what kind of man you are, and I have that now.",neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,Can I ask what that is?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,You are a good man. I'm glad to have you along.,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Zihark,I'm glad to be here. I feel I'm finally able to do the kind of good I've longed to do for years.,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ilyana,Ooo...,negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,You don't look so well. Are you all right?,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ilyana,"I'm...seasick...When I was traveling with the merchants, we sometimes used...ships...Every time was the same... Urp...I'm...sorry.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Did you travel with Muston and the others for a long time?,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ilyana,"About four years, all told. I had just left home, you see...I was all alone, and I couldn't find work. In my hometown, I had so many people I could depend on...but once I left, everything changed. If Muston's group hadn't found me by the side of the road, I'd probably be dead by now.",negative
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,Hm...You seem to have led quite an adventurous life. It's a bit surprising.,positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ilyana,I get that a lot.,neutral
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"I find it hard to imagine that you couldn't find work, though. Your magic skills are amazing.",positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ilyana,"Aren't they, though? Hee hee! I'm always happy when people notice...Whew...Wow! I feel so much better now. I'm actually starting to get hungry.",positive
FE9,12-AStrangeLand,Ike,"I'm glad to hear it. Just stay above deck, and when you start to feel sick, look off at the horizon, all right?",positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Tibarn,"Ah, well met. From the looks of things, the battle ended in our favor.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"We claimed victory. Yet Daein had more troops than we expected, and it was a hard-fought battle.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Tibarn,"I don't have the best news to report, either.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,What is it?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Tibarn,"As the day ended, we withdrew as planned. But as we were leaving, reinforcements began flooding in from the capital.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,Mmm... That's a piece of ill news.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Tibarn,"The men that were originally guarding the castle were nothing special, but...There was one who appeared midbattle and crushed an entire unit by himself. He was so much stronger than the others, it was as if a wolf had appeared in a kennel of blind, newborn pups.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,What did he look like?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Tibarn,"He was covered from toe to tip in black armor. That made it difficult to judge his size, but I think he was bigger than me. If my intuition's right, he is the villian you've all been talking about.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,The Black Knight... He's in that castle!,positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,General Ike! Please come with me. We're getting ready to have a war council and discuss tomorrow's battle.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"So the Black Knight's in that castle, is he?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,There's little doubt of it.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ranulf,"That beorc's a real handful. Even when I attacked him in cat form, I barely scratched him!",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"It's his armor. It's apparently blessed by the goddess. Ordinary weapons, natural or no, can't damage it.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ranulf,"Oh, that's just swell. So how are we supposed to defeat him? Angry looks?",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,Leave that to me. I've got a sword that should be effective against him...,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Tibarn,"I don't like it, but I suppose there's no choice. We don't use weapons or shields. Those are beorc tools for beorc alone.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,"Very well, if the villain in question appears, we'll leave him to General Ike. Now then, shall we determine who among us storms the castle?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,Ike... Can I talk to you?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Not right now, Mist. We're discussing battle strategy.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,I know that. Even so... Please? It'll only take a moment.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,Mist... I promise I'll make time later. Be patient and wait quietly.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Elincia,...Ah...um...,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,"What is it, O beauteous one?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Elincia,I feel...a bit dizzy. May I rest a moment?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,"Oh, what foul deed is this that rears its head? The gods of war do charge a heavy toll. Bewitch us, and attack our very minds! The princess, she is faint and o'er tired. Forgive your humble servant this trespass.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,"Hark, my dear, and bless me with your arm. Good folk, we shall retire for a spell.",positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Geoffrey,"Of course. Princess, please rest and allow us to proceed with these preparations.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Elincia,Th-thank you. I'm sorry.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,What is it?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,...Mmm...,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Come on, Mist. You realize the princess was making time for you to talk with me, don't you?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"...Well, um... I thought I could talk to you later, but then I changed my mind and wanted to talk to you now.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"I've been hoping to talk to you, too. I haven't heard very much from you since the other day.",positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,Yeah... I'm sorry. When you told us that story...I was so shocked...That's why.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"The part about Mother's death...and about Father, right?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,Uh-huh.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"That's only natural. So, you have come to some kind of understanding with it all? Is that it?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"At first, I couldn't believe it. The stuff about the medallion and the revival of the dark god and all of that? None of it... None of it sounded real. And everything about Father...That was even more unbelievable.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,It was all I could think about. But...But I didn't want to think about it anymore. It made my head hurt. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't even sleep. I would just lie awake at night and stare at the tent walls.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Yeah, I was the same way.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"I guess my body finally reached its limit. Last night, I fell asleep. And when I woke up this morning...I don't know. It was all gone. I only had one emotion left.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,One emotion? What was it?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"It's hard to say... Sympathy, I suppose.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,For Mother?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"Uh-huh. And for Father. I think more for him than anyone else... Father and Mother were in love, weren't they? And then the medallion, it made Father go...what did you say? Berserk?",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"When he returned to himself, he found Mother...When, when Father died, it hurt so much...I thought I was going to die. Father must have felt the same. No, he must have felt even worse.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"I think you're right. And Father kept it all to himself, too. Mother, the medallion, being hunted...He never said a word to us. It was his burden alone.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,The man who killed Father was that knight we saw in Port Toha. Right? The one in the black armor?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,Yes.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"You're going to fight him, aren't you. For Father.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Yes, I am. That's one thing I won't let anyone else do in my stead.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"Trying to stop you is pointless. I know. If I were stronger, if I were a swordfighter, I'd be doing the same thing.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,Mist...,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,"But...you must keep your promise. You promised to lead the company in Father's place, and to protect me. If you go and get yourself killed, I'll never forgive you.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,I understand. That's why I'm not going to lose!,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Mist,...I know!,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,"How are you feeling, Princess?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Elincia,Um... It was a lie. I'm not feeling unwell at all. I'm sorry I fooled you.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,"Ah, I knew it all along. It was all for Ike and Mist, was it not? It would appear, my dear Princess, that you care for them greatly.",positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Elincia,"I witnessed the death of both my father and mother...Soldiers fell one after the other...And then I...I was separated from Geoffrey...It was Ike and his friends who rescued me. If not for them, I...I'm sure I would be dead now. My lord Ike and Mist, too, know the pain that I carry with me. The pain of losing one's parents in war. That may account for why the two of them, right from the beginning, were so warm and friendly. They gave me the support I needed to survive. Mist and I have continuously encouraged each other to go on. So...",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,"They rescued you and are your patrons. There are those among the soldiers who complain in jealousy of Ike's station, but...It is a trivial matter. We, the retainers of House Crimea, find this general very much to our liking.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Elincia,"...Ah, Bastian. I'm pleased to hear it.",positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Bastian,Enough plain speaking! I must ready my silver tongue anew! Shall we return to the council?,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Elincia,Yes.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Hafedd,Sir Knight. The Crimean army will renew their assault of the castle momentarily. The troops we face are not the half-breeds we fought yesterday. It is the army that bested General Bertram. They are not what one would call an easy opponent.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,Hmph. Resolve it.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Hafedd,I beg your pardon?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,"Hafedd, you are in command. The castle defenses are on your shoulders. I have business with General Ena.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Hafedd,Understood.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Is everyone ready? The castle's strength has been bolstered with reinforcements from the capital. We must strike now, before any more can arrive. If the Black Knight appears, don't try to engage him. He is mine. I will take care of him!",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Hafedd,"If not for a whim of His Majesty, I would not be facing you here. For a warrior, meeting a powerful foe is a joy above all others... And for this I give thanks to the king! Now, let us enjoy the gift we have been given.",positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Hafedd,It appears...this is the end...Gwaaa... Hurrrkkk... Aaahhhh...,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,The one I seek is behind these doors. Don't follow me. I'm going in alone.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Soren,Ike! Wait! I'm going with--,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"No, Soren. We have to let Ike go alone. The Black Knight is his. Defeating him is a crucial step that Ike must take in order to truly get over the death of his father.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Soren,Idiocy! I'll hear no more of this naive nonsense! What if something happens to him? What then?,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"I think Ike has gained the composure to keep calm and judge whether or not he can match an opponent. If, in fact, he can't...it means he's reached his full potential, and that's all there is to him. We just have to accept that. But I believe in Ike. I trust him. His life is not his alone any longer. I don't believe he's so irresponsible as to leave his companions behind by choosing to engage in a contest he cannot win. Please, Soren, you must feel the same way. Don't you?",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Soren,"...I don't like it. Sometimes, bravery and good judgment aren't enough.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,Commander Greil... Watch over your son.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"Commander, can I speak to you for a moment?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"What is it, Titania?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,I have...something important to ask of you.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"All right, what is it?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"I want you to tell me...about the night Commander Greil was killed. I understand that it's difficult for you. However, I need to know. I have to. Just tell it once... It's all I ask. If you can't, I... His death will be something I'll never be able to face.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,I feel I've done you a terrible disservice by not telling you earlier. It's just that... There was a lot I had to get clear in my own mind. I know I've kept you waiting.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,So you'll tell me?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,Yes. I think I've finally come to a point where I can face it.,positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,All right. Whenever you're ready.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"That night... I've already told you everything up to where I was on my way into the forest, right? At the head of the path, Father had told me to go back to the fort--but I had a bad feeling and followed him anyway. When I entered the clearing, he and the Black Knight were already fighting. They seemed to be evenly matched at first. Then they exchanged a few more blows, and suddenly Father was sent flying. They spoke to each other for a moment, but...I was so far away, I couldn't hear what they said. Then the Black Knight threw a sword at Father's feet. I think he wanted Father to pick it up and use it.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,...,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"But Father didn't touch the sword. He just readied his axe again and charged.......It was over in an instant. I...I couldn't believe my own eyes. They...they looked like they were embracing...Just... Standing there. Frozen. But, I saw the Black Knight's blade...It was protruding from Father's back, and shining in the moonlight.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"Oh, Greil...",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"When the knight pulled his sword out, Father sagged and fell backwards... I ran and tried to catch him, but I couldn't hold him, and we both fell to the ground. The wound Father had taken was terrible, but at that point, he was still alive.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,...,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"The Black Knight approached and said, Give it to me. I had no idea what he was talking about. I do now, though. He had been sent by King Ashnard to retrieve the medallion. Father told him he'd thrown the medallion away, but the knight didn't believe him. Then he tried to get Father to talk by threatening to kill me...and Mist. I was so angry, I leapt up and attacked him, but it was useless. I didn't give up, though. I didn't care what happened to me, and I attacked again.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,Of all the stubbornness...,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"If King Gallia hadn't been nearby, I probably would have died that night, too.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,...,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"After the Black Knight vanished, I simply...All I could think was that I didn't want Father to die. He... He was still alive.

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"...Thank you, Ike. It must have been so hard for you.",positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,Titania...,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,Commander Greil died on your back. His last moments must have been...much happier than I had imagined......Thank you... Now I can finally...move past my grief...,positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,...Titania.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,Yes?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"I, um... There's something else I haven't told you about.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,...,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,I...met him... I met the Black Knight again.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,What?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,We fought.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,You did well to keep your life.,positive
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"I'm not the same boy I was on that night. I've grown a lot. I've worked hard. Yet, even so, I wasn't able to defeat him.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,There's nothing you can do about that. Not even Commander Greil could defeat him. You're not ready to--,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,It's not that. It's not that my blade work wasn't good enough.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"Then, what do you mean?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Titania, it's his armor. It's impervious to damage.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,What? That's not possible. Even the strongest--,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,He said his armor had been blessed by the goddess. He said only weapons that were also blessed could hurt him.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,Where are we supposed to get something like that?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,I have one here.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,Ah! Ike! That sword... Where...,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"The night after Father died, I went back to that clearing by myself. I'd hoped to...I'd hoped to find some clues that might help me hunt down the knight. The sword was still there. I brought it back with me, and I've been hiding it ever since. I wasn't thinking about using it. I believed that if I just carried the sword with me, I'd meet the Black Knight again.  And it worked.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,So this sword will work against him?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"It's supposed to. It was made to contest Alondite, which is the sword wielded by the Black Knight.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,Do you think you have a chance?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,...I'll win.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"All right. I won't stop you. Use that sword to avenge Commander Greil. But listen, Ike... You must promise me one thing.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,What is it?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"When you meet him, you'll exchange blows. If, at that moment, you don't feel you stand a chance...you must flee. There are times when running away is not the same as losing.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Don't you believe in me, Titania?",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Titania,"Of course I do. One day, you will defeat the Black Knight. I'm sure of it. That's why I don't want you to lose your life on the first go-around. When the time comes, I promise not to interfere. And I won't let anyone else interfere, either. I want you to face him, one-on-one. And I want you to be calm and use your own best judgement. At times, withdrawing can be the key that unlocks a future victory. Don't forget that.",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,...Understood.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,Why did you return to Crimea? You had the perfect opportunity to escape.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ena,...I'm going to the capital.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,No. You are not. The king has ordered me to put an end to you.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ena,I thought as much... So be it. I am prepared.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,Will you not resist?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ena,I do not believe I could prevail against one of your power.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,How extremely frank.,negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ena,"My only wish was to be beside the one I love. If that is not to be, then it matters not what happens to me.",negative

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,"Hmph! Do as you will. This time, we begin in earnest!",negative
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,What an odd fate. This will be the third time I have defeated you. The first was in the forest of Gallia. The second at Delbray in Crimea.,neutral

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,Oh?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"My sword-fighting skills were given to me by my father. If I stay true to them, I cannot lose.",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Black Knight,Did you never think that using your father's techniques on the man who killed him would be futile?,negative

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Nasir,"It may be difficult for you beorc to believe, but...We of the dragon tribe live for a very, very long time. When we reach a certain maturity, we stop showing almost all signs of further aging. For example, do you remember Prince Kurthnaga whom you met in Goldoa?",neutral

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Nasir,What do you mean?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Ashnard is in the Crimean capital. If we hope to defeat him, it would help to have the cooperation of one who's been close to him. If you're not our enemy, then prove it by aiding us.",neutral

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,There's one other thing I need to hear. How much do you know about the medallion? Did you realize what it was when you gave it to Ashnard?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Nasir,"I'm fairly sure that I know more about it than you do. I can't go into details, but... Merely gaining possession of the idol does not allow King Daein to release the dark god. The reason for that is--",neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,The only one who can sing the galdr of release is a girl named Altina. Right?,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Nasir,"That's correct. I, too, investigated Palmeni Temple.",neutral

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ena,I am Ena... He... Nasir was my grandfather.,neutral
FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,You're Nasir's granddaughter?,neutral

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,A thousand years... I can't begin to imagine.,neutral

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,"Nasir helped us time and time again. No matter what, I couldn't see him as a true enemy. If there are reasons for all this, would you tell me about them? I'd like to help. In Nasir's stead.",positive

FE9,27-MomentOfFate,Ike,That's not the answer I was hoping for.,neutral

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,General Zelgius! What are you doing here?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Zelgius,"Looking at it now, and it all may seem a bit impertinent, but... I came with reinforcements in case things took a turn for the worst. Your opponent was the Mad King Ashnard after all, and if worse had come to worst... well, you might have needed the help. Duke Perseus ordered us to join in the fight and rescue Princess Elincia at the very least.",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Oh, I see.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Zelgius,My apologies.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"No, no... I appreciate the concern. It was a dangerous day.",negative

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Our success was thanks to the Begnion shield protecting our flank. Not the soldiers you lent us, but your reinforcements capturing and holding the retreating Daein soldiers. Because of that, we were able to concentrate on the enemies before us without concern for our rear guard.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Zelgius,I was merely following the orders of my superiors.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"In that case, please express my appreciation to the apostle and Sephiran. One day, I will go and thank them in person.",positive

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,What about the troops you’ve lent us?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Zelgius,"Though the war may be over, it will take many weeks to see the country secure. I spoke with the princess earlier, and she asked that we help if possible. So I’ll leave them in your care a while longer.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,I see. It’s very appreciated.,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Zelgius,It’s our pleasure. By your leave.,negative

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Makalov,"I think I may try to start over in Begnion. Maybe it’s too much, too soon... But I just want to live a more responsible life. Plus I’m tired of men threatening to break my knees... Good-bye, Ike!",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Astrid,"Good-bye, General Ike. This war has given me the confidence to enter the service of the Begnion knights. Thank you so much!",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Devdan,Devdan is glad all the fighting stopped. Devdan prefers the peace and quiet. War is not good for anything.,negative

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Muarim,"Laguz and beorc... Perhaps the gap between us has narrowed. War is horrible. Yet, maybe we’ve gained something of value, after all.",negative

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Reyson,"While we made our peace with the apostle, we’re not ready to live there again.",negative

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Giffca,Come whenever you are able. The king will be pleased to see you.,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ranulf,"Oh, and another thing. You’ll be seeing me again soon. Gallia’s decided not to spare any effort in aiding Crimea’s reconstruction. I’ll be back shortly with a whole army of workers and laborers. Look for us!",neutral

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"We’ve built quite a close bond, haven’t we?",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Tibarn,"This is true. We’re especially grateful for your help in Serenes Forest. The next time you’re visiting the southern coast, come to Phoenicis. The entire country will celebrate your arrival.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"The country of the hawk tribe, eh? That would be fun. I’m interested in what kinds of food you eat.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Tibarn,"We collect berries from trees on peaks that no beorc could climb. The juices and desserts made from it are beyond compare. We have ocean delicacies, mountain treats... We have everything.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,I’ll pass on the desserts... But I’ll take extra helpings of meat!,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Tibarn,Ha ha! Leave it to me.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Naesala,"I hate to interrupt your gleeful chat, but I thought I should tell you... You don’t have to visit Kilvas. It’s our policy not to invite beorc into our home. Unless they pay well...",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Ah, King Kilvas... Despite all of your posturing, you came to our aid in the end! You turned out to be a better ally than I dared hope for.",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Naesala,Pah! Keep your foolish tongue inside your foolish head! ...And don’t tell anyone! I have a reputation to think of.,negative

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Tauroneo,...I have played my part. All that remains is for me to take my leave of this place. History will judge my actions...,neutral

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Zihark,"Crimea’s an interesting place, but I’ve decided to travel to Daein. Perhaps fate will bring us together again.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"How odd, Ena. We’ve been both enemies and allies.",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ena,"Thanks to you, Rajaion was saved. And...so was I... Thank you.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"So, you were with King Daein because you were trying to save Rajaion?",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ena,Yes.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Nasir,"Ena’s fiance went missing many years ago. After Ena finally found him, she came to me for help. She told me that Rajaion was with King Daein, and that he had been warped almost beyond recognition. Long ago, Ena’s parents died, and I was unable to do anything for her. Even so, she still came to me for help. No matter what, I had to help her... It was to that end that I used you...... I am so sorry.",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,It’s all in the past now. There’s nothing for you to worry about any longer.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Nasir,"Thank you, Ike.",positive

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Nasir,Yes. We must take Rajaion back to his hometown.,neutral

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Nasir,Huh. Even now you defy my prediction.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,Prediction?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Nasir,"When we were sailing off the coast of Phoenicis, remember? I said that war would change how you look at things. And yet... Through all that’s happened, you’ve remained the same.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,I just can’t pretend to be anything I’m not. I’ve never been any good at that.,negative

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"I’ll see you again, won’t I?",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Nasir,"Yes, I’m sure of it.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Mist,"Hah...I’m so tired I could fall over! Peace is all well and good, but it sure is busy.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,We’re rebuilding a country that was completely devastated by war. It’s bound to be tough.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Mist,You’re right. I bet Princess Elincia and the people in the palace are twice as busy.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Speaking of Elincia, what’s she doing?",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Mist,"She’s in that room over there, surrounded by court officials. They seem really busy. I feel so sorry for her.",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"As long as she’s getting at least a little bit of rest, I’m not worried. But she probably isn’t...",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Mist,"Maybe if I sang her a lullaby... Ah! Oh, no! I forgot!",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,You forgot what?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Mist,"I gave the medallion to Reyson, but I forgot all about the galdr! Ike, what should we do?!",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Hey, yeah... We never did find out who Altina is, did we? She was the only one who could sing the galdr... Well, when things calm down, we’ll have to head out and search for her.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,???,Is that Altina you speak of? One of the three who defeated the dark god?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Mist,Hey!,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Sephiran! So you made it, did you?",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,I arrived mere moments ago. Let me congratulate you on a successful end to your journey.,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Thank you. Please tell me, do you know who Altina is?",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,Of course. Altina founded my homeland of Begnion.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Oh, then it was a mistake... We can’t give a song to someone who died so long ago...",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,There is one who yet shares both bloodline and name–the true heir of Altina.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,Who is it?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,Sanaki Kirsch Altina... None other than the apostle herself.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,The apostle? Is this something everyone in Begnion would be aware of?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,"No, there are very few who know that name. Why do you ask?",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,The apostle is Altina...,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Mist,"Oh, I’m so relieved! And exhausted, too! Ike, I’m going back to my room. See you later, Sephiran.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,That was rather sudden. Did I say something to cause her distress?,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"...No, nothing like that. It’s just that so much has happened between Begnion and Serenes...",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,Would you tell me about it? I would hear what you have to say on this matter.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,Sure. To tell the truth...,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,"I see... The assassination of the apostle, the Serenes massacre, and the use of the medallion to revive the dark god... All of it was part of Ashnard’s grand scheme.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,That’s the conclusion we came to.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,...You have me at a loss.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,Why is that?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,"For many years, I have walked these lands. Watching... Listening... And never did I uncover what you have found. Now that you have presented me with this information, I don’t know what to say.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,I merely fulfilled the hopes of my father and mother.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,"Now you speak from hindsight. Rescuing Princess Crimea, winning the apostle’s trust, and defeating King Daein... With laguz at your side, no less! You have accomplished all of these miraculous things.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,I had trusted and valiant companions at my side. It was only through their support that I was able to do these things.,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,"Ever the humble one, eh? Now then, before I return home, may I hear the galdr of release? I must convey it to the apostle.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,You would do that?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,None of you can leave Crimea. The new queen will need your strength.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"...I suppose that will be the case for a little while, won’t it?",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,"...A little while? You are the hero of Crimea, General Ike. If you wish it, no post will be beyond your reach.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"I don’t care about any of that. It’s more trouble than it’s worth. And I don’t see the value of being some fancy lord. When the country’s safe, I’m giving up that title and everything and going back to being a simple mercenary.",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,Ha ha... T-truly...you are a... Wha ha ha ha ha!,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,Is something strange?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,Yes. It’s very... Haaaa ha ha haaaaa!,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Um, I think that’s enough.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,I’m...I’m s-s-sorry. ...Hee! Hee... Ahem...,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Unbelievable. Despite all appearances, you’re really quite rude.",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Titania,Commander? May I have a minute?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"Sure. What is it, Titania?",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Titania,"Princess Elincia... Oops! It’s Queen Elincia, isn’t it? The court ministers want Queen Elincia and you to come out onto the balcony and greet the people.",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,What? Greet the people? ...Me?,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Titania,"Yes, you. I’ve done what I was asked to do! Now hurry up and get going!",positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"H-hey! Titania! Ah, nuts! Why do I... What’s going on?",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Sephiran,The people of Crimea wish to see their hero and to sing his praises–even if the hero himself protests.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"If they want a greeting, surely their new queen, Elincia, would suffice. I’ll go speak to her.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,What’s wrong?,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,Everyone’s waiting to see you.,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Elincia,I’m nervous. I’ve spent my whole life in hiding. No one ever taught me how to rule a kingdom. I don’t think I’m ready to be their queen. I don’t think I’m ever really going to be ready.,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,What’s the matter with you?,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Elincia,"Ike, stop it! How can I–",negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,Did anyone teach you how to hire mercenaries?,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Elincia,"No, but that’s not the same–",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,How to win back lost allies? How to win back your lost kingdom?,negative
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Elincia,But that’s… That’s different.,neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,"No, it’s not.",neutral
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Ike,You’ve done such an amazing job. And I think you always will.,positive
FE9,XX-Epilogue,Elincia,I see.,neutral

FE9,XX-Epilogue,Elincia,"Thank you, my lord Ike. I am… I am so blessed to have met you.",positive
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Gatrie,"Blazes, why does it have to be so blamed humid? If we weren’t being chased, I’d strip off this armor here and now!",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Titania,"Then I’m almost glad that we ARE being pursued. I suppose you’ll have to grin and bear it, won’t you?",positive
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Gatrie,"Hm, I suppose I will.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Titania,"Right. So enough of your griping. You’re merely wasting energy. Still, this heat is appalling.",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Shinon,"Dense forests such as these are not made for us delicate humans. The sub-humans love ’em, though.",neutral

FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Ike,"No, never.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Shinon,"Well, I have. They’re a hairy bunch, I’ll tell you. And ugly as sin, too. Their faces are all fangs and whisker. Their claws are like daggers, razor sharp and deadly. And even though they can speak our language, they’re beasts through and through. Savages, every one.",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Ike,Are there more than one type?,neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Soren,"The ones Shinon calls sub-humans can be divided into three groups, each one named for its physical characteristics. First, the beast tribe, next, the bird tribe, and finally, the dragon tribe. They are traditionally called laguz. The laguz tribe residing here in Gallia is the beast tribe, who possess those feline qualities of which Shinon spoke.",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Shinon,"To the south are the islands where the bird-men live. The dragons are in Goldoa. It’s something every mercenary should know. Looks like you know even less than I gave you credit for, Ike, my boy.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Ike,Hm...Perhaps.,neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Soren,"...A little farther, and we’ll be out of these trees, Ike.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Shinon,"Really? That means Gallia proper! Compared to this forest, even a kingdom of half-breeds will seem like heaven.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Daein Soldier,...And that’s when we lost track of them. I assigned a squad to pursue them and returned so I could give you this report.,neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Petrine,Understood. You may step down.,neutral

FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Petrine,"When the king assigned me a tactician, I wondered what I had done to lose his trust. When I saw it was a young girl,I burned with anger at the king’s judgment. Still, it’s worked out better than I had expected. Keep up the good work.",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Ena,Of course.,neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Petrine,"Now then, it’s time for the hunt to begin.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Greil,"Hold it right there, everyone. We’re coming to the edge of the forest. Form up. Combat positions.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Titania,I don’t suppose our Daein pursuers were willing to let us just slip away.,negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Soren,"There is no doubt that they will attack again. Without knowing their numbers, it is difficult to advise a course of action.",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Greil,"Take your best guess, Soren. With the limited information we have, what is the best way to proceed?",neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Soren,"...Some of our group cannot fight. If we are caught, we’ll have a difficult time defending them and attacking the Daeins. I propose we separate into two groups: a small fighting force to engage the enemy and buy the main group some time, and the rest of us–who will escort the princess to Gallia at full speed.",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Oscar,"You want to divide our combat strength? The main force aside, don’t you think the risk to the smaller group is too high?",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Soren,"I believe this is the only way to achieve our goal and keep casualties to a minimum.It’s possible there’s an ambush waiting for us at the edge of the forest.

FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Greil,Looks like we’ve no choice but to give it a go.,negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Greil,"All right, let’s split up. The diversionary team will be Gatrie, Shinon, and me. The rest of you guard Princess Elincia and proceed to Gallia straightaway. Got it?",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Ike,Are you sure you’re taking enough men?,neutral
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Shinon,Idiot pup. Smaller numbers mean better mobility. Your time would be better spent worrying about yourself than about us.,negative

I don’t want any of you dying on me.In times like these, it matters not what our blood ties are. We are family. If you don’t want to cause your family any grief, then live! Ike will be commanding the main force. Titania, you’re his support. All right, let’s move out! See you all in Gallia!",negative
FE9,06-ABriefDiversion,Ike,So they’re waiting for us after all...,neutral

I am waiting for friends and cannot take leave of this house, but...I would give you this. If you use it, your magical resistance will increase. It will help you fight that mage. Take care.",negative

FE9,09-Gallia,Ike,"We defeated their commander, but we still don’t know what they were after.",neutral
FE9,09-Gallia,Titania,It seems unlikely that they were merely pursuing Princess Elincia. I wonder if Daein is planning to invade Gallia. Perhaps Crimea was only a stone on which to whet their blades.,neutral

FE9,09-Gallia,Ike,"So, it’s war...Again.",negative
FE9,09-Gallia,Titania,"If war erupts between the beorc and laguz, it’s only a matter of time before other nations become involved. Could Daein truly mean to set the land aflame in a blaze of war? If that happens, many of our citizens will be sacrificed on the altar of their ambition.",negative

FE9,09-Gallia,Caineghis,"Hmm...You have good eyes. Honest and brave.I see your father in them. Long ago, Greil...your father...worked as a mercenary for Gallia. We forged a strong bond, he and I. To speak truly, I still do not trust the beorc. But your father was different.",positive
FE9,09-Gallia,Caineghis,"Princess Elincia’s father, King Ramon, and his brother, Lord Renning, are also of a different kind. All are...or were...exceptional men. Men in whom one could put his trust.",positive

I asked him, Why are you being chased? Is there anything I can do to help? But I was unable to loosen his tongue. And then I heard he had returned to Gallia, and I thought I had another chance to hear his tale. His fate was black indeed.

FE9,28-TwistedTower,Elincia,"I want...to grow stronger. To reach that goal, I will do whatever it takes.",neutral
FE9,28-TwistedTower,Tanith,"Well spoken! Now then...to match your desire, I will fall back on the methods I used while training the apostle's bodyguards.",positive
FE9,28-TwistedTower,Elincia,All...right...,neutral
FE9,28-TwistedTower,Marcia,"Oh, horsemeat...",negative
FE9,28-TwistedTower,Tanith,"Come, we have little time for niceties. Both of you, follow me! Now!!! Come on, maggots, do you want to live forever?!!!",negative
FE9,28-TwistedTower,Elincia,"Y-yes, ma'am!",positive
FE9,28-TwistedTower,Marcia,Ugh... She really is a demon.,negative
FE9,28-TwistedTower,Ike,Hmm... The three of them look...busy...I think I'll wait until later to talk to them.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,Father! Brother! It’s that lady Ike rescued...She’s awake!,positive
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Really?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Come on. Let’s greet our guest.,positive
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"So, how are you feeling?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Oh, I...I’m fine...And you are?",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,The name’s Greil. I’m the commander of this mercenary company.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"My lord Greil...You are the one who came to my aid, are you not? I don’t know how to thank you...",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Hold on. The one who found you and brought you here is my son, Ike. If you want to thank someone, thank him.",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,"No, please, that’s not–",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Lord...Ike, was it? You have my gratitude.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Oh...,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Pardon my bluntness, but I have some questions for you. Tell me, who are you? What were you doing in that place?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,The place where Ike found you was evidently the site of a fierce battle between Crimean and Daein forces. Do you have some relation to the Crimean royal family?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,"I make no promises, but we may be able to help you. Will you share your story with us?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,You took me in and cared for me. I will...place my trust in you. Elincia Ridell Crimea. I am the daughter of King Ramon of Crimea.,positive
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,What?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,You say you are the princess of Crimea?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,Yes.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,That’s an odd claim to make. I’ve never heard of King Crimea having any children.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"That is...to be expected. My heritage, my very existence, has never been made public.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Why’s that?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"To avoid national turmoil. You see, I was born after my uncle, Lord Renning, was named as successor to the throne. So...",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"They kept you a secret to avert a possible blood feud. Yes, I’m willing to accept that for the time being. Very well, let’s suppose that you truly are Princess Crimea. You must know what’s become of the king and your uncle. I would like to hear that news.",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"...My father and my mother are dead...They fell at the hand of Ashnard, King of Daein...My lord uncle and the royal knights are still battling the Daein army, I believe.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,I see.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,...I...fled the castle...to follow my lord uncle’s orders and seek refuge in the kingdom of Gallia...,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,In Gallia?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"...Yes. We believed that King Caineghis would grant me sanctuary. So that’s where I was going...But we were discovered by Daein troops, and I lost my escort of knights...My life–the life I have now–was purchased...with the blood of those brave knights...",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Does King Daein know of your existence?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,Yes. I was told the royals of each nation were informed of my identity in the event of dire circumstances...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"If that’s the case, they must be searching frantically for you.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Master Greil, my lord Ike, you said that you were mercenaries, did you not? Please...Would you help me to gain Gallia? I beg of you! I have...no one...no one else to turn to.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,Princess Crimea? Truly?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Father spoke to her as if he believed she were telling the truth.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,I see...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,"What is it, Titania?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,"Mm, it’s nothing. I was just remembering something from the past.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,From the past? Back when you were still a Crimean royal knight?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,What? How do you know about that?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,"A long time ago, I overheard Shinon and some others talking about it.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,They keep such loose tongues.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Was it a secret?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,"No, it wasn’t, but...Much like I have more experience than you, I also have many more things to worry about.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Like Princess Crimea?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,"Well...yes. I myself was unaware of the princess’s existence, but...Now that I think about it, she does bear a striking resemblance to both the king and queen.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,So she probably is the true princess. I wonder what Father will do. Will he take on her request?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Rolf,We’ve got trouble! There are soldiers! A lot of them!,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,What?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Is everyone here?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Yes.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Shinon,"Commander, what are the Daein dogs saying?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Turn over Princess Crimea and leave the area immediately. Comply now, or we will attack.Pretty straightforward.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Gatrie,What are we going to do?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,That’s what we’re here to decide. One thing has been made clear by the arrival of our friends outside.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Soren,"So, I would say this confirms her identity as Princess Crimea, wouldn’t you?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Yes, but what do we do now? I’d like to hear the opinion of everyone here. Titania,I’d like to hear from you first.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,"The blame for this war rests on Daein. If we ally ourselves with them,the company’s reputation will surely suffer. Conversely, if we deliver Princess Crimea safely, our stock will risein the eyes of our primary employers. Our road is clear.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Soren, how about you?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Soren,There’s nothing to think about. We must deliver the princess to Daein immediately.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Even if Crimea is in the right?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Soren,"We are mercenaries. Our actions are dictated only by self-interest. If we want to ensure our future, we need Daein in our debt. They will win this war, after all, and nothing else serves us better.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Shinon? Gatrie?,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Shinon,"Soren’s a pompous, superior whelp, but he’s got the right idea. Besides, the destination’s Gallia, so it’s a moot question. I don’t care how much we get paid; there’s no way under the sun I’m going to stinking beast country.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Gatrie,"Princess Elincia...She does possess a certain regal beauty... There’s a lot to be said for that, you know. However I do prefer country girls...A bit cuter, and not quite so standoffish...Oh! Forget I said that.Whatever you decide is good for me, Commander. Yep, uh-huh, yep...",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Oscar, Boyd, what about the two of you?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Oscar,"I agree with Captain Titania. If we turn the princess over to the Daein army, we’re essentially giving them permission to kill her.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Boyd,I’m in favor of helping her. That’s what heroes are supposed to do.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Well, Rhys? What’s your opinion?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Rhys,I believe...that none of this hinges on whether she’s a princess or not. Refusing to aid someone in need is not something we should ever do. That’s what I think.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Rolf,That’s right! Let’s help her!,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,Please! We have to help her!,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"And what about you, Ike?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,I agree with Titania. I say we help her and take her to Gallia.,positive
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"I see. I think I know where you all stand.......Well then, here’s my decision.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,We escort the princess to Gallia.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Soren,...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Shinon,...Tsk.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,"...Are you sure that’s for the best, Father?",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Yes. Besides, I think the choice has been taken out of our hands.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,What?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Open your ears and listen. Listen! All of you.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Boyd,Huh?...What is it?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Gatrie,Uh...I don’t hear a thing...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Shinon,"Idiot! That’s the problem. Don’t you think that’s a bit odd? Complete silence, in all four directions.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Gatrie,"Oh, so that’s what you’re talking about!",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,We’re surrounded. The soldiers aren’t waiting for an answer. They already decided to attack.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,It would appear they had no intention of keeping their side of the proposed bargain.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Soren,They were planning on lulling us into a false sense of security and destroying every one of us.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Probably so. But the deal is, we’re not so naive or inexperienced as to fall for their trap. take your positions! We’re going to settle this right now!",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,I’ll go and hold the rear entrance. Ike! You’re in command here! Don’t let the enemy take the front.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,"...Got it! Be careful, Commander!",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Hah. I’ll give it a shot.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Daein Soldier,"Reporting in, sir! The mercenaries have taken up arms and formed up in the bailey!",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Dakova,"Oh...so they’ve sniffed out our plan, have they? Which means they’re not an opponent that will be easily fooled. We’ll need something special.[",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Daein Soldier,Shall we continue with the planned attack?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Dakova,"No...Princess Crimea is somewhere within that fort. If we use flaming arrows to try to smoke them out, we might bring the princess to harm. We’ve been told to do our best to deliver her alive and uninjured. It would be preferable if they were to come out of their own accord. If they do, slay all but the princess!",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Daein Soldier,"Yes, sir!",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Dakova,What’s going on? Weren’t they supposed to be completely surrounded?,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Dakova,I...don’t believe it...What went wrong...,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Dakova,Grr...How’ve they lasted this long? Just who are these mercenaries? Knowing your enemy’s strength is vital to any strategy...Soldiers! Retreat! We fall back for now!,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Daein Soldier,"General Dakova! No, not...the general...Not at the hands of these scum...I will not allow it! Aaaaah! Face me, and breathe your last, you wretched scum!",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Soren,Ike! The enemy’s taken the fort!,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Oh no! Mist and the others...,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,"...Ike...It’s too bad, but...We’ve been defeated.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,How...? Father...forgive me...,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Soren,We’ve cleared the surrounding area of Daein troops.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,"There’s no question about it. We’re enemies of the Daein kingdom now, aren’t we?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"We’ve no time for rest! Everyone, pack your things now! We leave at once, before the enemy brings reinforcements!",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Oscar,Understood! Boyd! Come with me.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Boyd,"Right behind you, Brother!",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,"Ah! We’ve got to hurry, too! Come on, Rolf! We’ve got to pack as much food and supplies as we can!",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Rolf,"Uh, whatever you say! Let’s go, Mist!",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Titania! Take Shinon and Gatrie and make sure we have a secure road from here to the great forest. We’ll make our way to Gallia through the sea of trees.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Titania,"On my way, sir!",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,"Rhys, you stay with me. I want you to help me pull essential documents from the library. Everything else we burn.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Rhys,"Y-yes, sir!",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Greil,Ike! You’re in charge of the princess.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,All right.,positive
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Princess Elincia! I’m going to ready a horse for you. What should we have you do...I know–go to the mess hall.,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,I’m sorry?,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ike,Time will go by faster if you’re helping Mist than it will if you’re just sitting around waiting for me.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Oh, I understand. I can do that!",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,"Sorry, this is kind of awkward. Making a princess help with packing...",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Please don’t worry, Mist. I just hope that I don’t end up slowing you down by getting in your way.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,Don’t be silly! You’re so much better at this than I am. It’s a big help! Are all princesses as good at this sort of thing as you are?,positive
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Ha ha! I wasn’t raised at court, so my life was a bit different than other princesses. I cooked,cleaned, sewed...Why, I did all manner of things.",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,Really? That’s surprising. I would never have guessed that by looking at you.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Let’s see, I also rode horses, practiced swordfighting...Ah, Mist. What’s that around your neck?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,"What? Oh, ah...",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to...",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,"...I guess I can show it to you, Princess Elincia.",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"Oh...It’s a lovely... That’s an incredible medallion, isn’t it? I wonder what that light is.",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,"It used to belong to my mother. It’s all I have to remember her by. Hmm...I don’t know where the light comes from. It didn’t used to be like that. A while back, it just started glowing.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Elincia,"The world is full of mysteries, isn’t it? One thing is clear, though...It certainly is beautiful.",positive
FE9,05-Flight,Mist,I wonder what that light means...,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Petrine,"What? What did you just say? I think I must be hearing things. I thought you said, They got away.",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Dakova,Ge-General Petrine. I am deeply ashamed. By my honor...,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Petrine,"Honor? I care nothing for your pathetic honor. Have you forgotten the Daein army’s motto? Success or failure, life or death. Hey, you! Get this trash out of here!",negative

FE9,05-Flight,Dakova,"W-wait! General Petrine, have mercy...",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Petrine,Dog’s breath! I’m surrounded by worthless imbeciles. Ena!,negative
FE9,05-Flight,Petrine,Tell me which way we should move to catch these mercenaries and the girl.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ena,"...The Crimean capital, Melior, is already under King Ashnard’s control...The remnants of the Crimean army are neglible...Which means the only place left for the princess to turn is south, to the kingdom of Gallia.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Petrine,"Hah! So the girl, like her dead father before her, seeks the friendship of those hairy devils, eh? What an absolutely stupefying world we live in.",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Ena,"If she gains sanctuary in Gallia, capturing the princess will become that much more difficult....The mercenaries she has escorting her are a powerful group, not one to be taken lightly. I will gather intelligence on them as quickly as...",negative
FE9,05-Flight,Petrine,It’s not necessary. I will head up the pursuit of our wandering princess.,neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Ena,"General Petrine, you will go...yourself?",neutral
FE9,05-Flight,Petrine,"If we know where the princess and her band are headed, there’s no need for subtlety. I’ll just hunt them down and kill them. Mercenaries? Hah! What’re they to me? Remember, I am General Petrine! No matter who I face, I have never failed, nor will I ever! Ha ha ha...",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Hey, Ike! I heard you're leaving. Going to Begnion, eh?",neutral

FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Well, aren't you the dutiful one! Hey, that reminds me...you were born here in Gallia, right? I knew there was something odd about you. You're awfully friendly for a beorc, you know! Oh, you might not know, but a beorc is what--",positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,"I know what it means. It's what you call us humans, right?",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Oh, knew that, did you? Well then, let me tell you something else. When we use the word human, we mean it much the way you beorc do when you call us sub-human.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,Really? It's an insult to be called human? I'm glad you told me. I would never have guessed.,positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"I should warn you, if you run across any laguz who call you that, be careful. They are no friend of yours.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,Got it. Thanks. I won't forget.,positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,But I've digressed long enough. Let me explain why I'm here.,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,Huh?,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Princess Elincia, may I have a moment of your time?",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,Y-yes. Of course.,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"The king asked that I give you this. Please, accept it as a gift.",positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,What? May I ask--,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Within that leather pouch is twenty thousand gold pieces. Beorc currency, of course.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,"Oh...I truly appreciate this generous offer, but a gift of this magnitude is not something I can accept. King Caineghis has done so much more than necessary already...",positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"The king is ashamed that he cannot, at this time, provide any personal support. Please. Will you accept his apology and acknowledge his desire to aid you?",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,But...,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"No? Well then, let's try this...",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,Yes?,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"You accept the king's gift. Then, as payment for conducting you safely to Gallia,you hand it over to Ike...",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,Um...,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,"Come on, Ranulf. You can't expect her to accept this. And it's an outrageous fee, no matter how you look at it.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Twenty thousand gold for the life of a princess? Perfectly reasonable. In fact, it almost borders on insulting! Consider how you have suffered, the lives you have lost...Ten, no, a hundred times this amount would not be unreasonable.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,"I... I have reconsidered. I will accept the king's kindness. In turn, I will present it to my lord Ike...You will accept it, will you not?",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,I...I will. Thank you.,positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,"No, my lord Ike. It is I who must thank you.",positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Well, now that that's settled, let's move on. Unfortunately, we do not have any ships here in Gallia. If you are to find a ship that will take you to Begnion, you must return to occupied Crimea.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,"If there's no other way, then we'll just have to risk it.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"No matter how cautiously you proceed, you're certain to run into Daein forces. Keep that in mind.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,"I understand. It's too bad we're so short on soldiers...Still, there's not much we can do about that now. However, I will review our supplies carefully before we depart.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"In regard to your personnel problems, the king has decided to lend you what aid he can. Lethe! Mordecai!",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Mordecai,I will join you.,positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,Mordecai! And Lethe? Both of you? Are you sure?,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Lethe,"None of the others could stand the idea of traveling with humans. I myself tremble with loathing at the thought of going to Begnion, but...When the king gives an order,obedience is the only option.",negative

FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Mordecai,We will not fail you.,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Lethe,Hsss! I've no intention of becoming friends! Do not forget that...And stay out of my way!,negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Ha ha! You must forgive Lethe. Her tongue cuts as deep as her claws do. I will return once I've reported to the king. While I'm gone, please finish your preparations for departure.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,Very well.,positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Soren,"Ike, here's a summary of our last battle.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Soren,"There were no casualties, and no one suffered permanent injury. We fought excellently.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Hey, Ike! Hold up a moment. You know, I was thinking...Since this castle is on the way, we should probably stop by.",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,Um...really? Why? Is there something special about this place?,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Why yes! There is! This is Canteus Castle! Daein seized it early on in the war Now, it serves as a camp for prisoners. I've even heard there are a number of Crimean retainers being held captive in the dungeon beneath the castle.",positive
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Elincia,What?! Are you certain?,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,"Princess, I'm hurt! Of course my information is reliable.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Titania,"If we can rescue some Crimean soldiers they might decide to join us. That would be quite a boon, would it not?",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,"Yes, it would. I think it's worth the risk.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,The question now is how do you open these cells and free the prisoners?,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,"The cells are certain to be locked, so in order to open them--",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Soren,"Logic would dictate that the keys will be in the possession of the jailer. We've no choice but to steal them. If we're lucky, the guards will have keys as well...In either case, we must move with caution. We don't want to trade blows with the entire castle garrison.",negative
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ike,"Which means we stay close to the walls and avoid being seen or heard, right? All right, then. Our first priority is to get our hands on the cell keys...",neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Ranulf,Hey! You there!,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Volke,I have business with Sir Greil. Where is he?,neutral
FE9,10-PrisonerRelease,Soren,"You're sorely lacking in social etiquette, aren't you? State your business.",neutral

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ashnard,"These heron royals all look alike, don't they? Perhaps it proves their bloodline, but it's unsettling how similar they are.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Black Knight,I believe you had one in your possession previously.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ashnard,"Yes, I tried to get her to free the dark god from the medallion, but all she did was get sick and die. Pah! They're ridiculously frail creatures. I should have just killed her in the first place and saved some time.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Black Knight,Might I suggest this one be treated with more care? Capturing her was not an easy task.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ashnard,"For you, it did take quite a long time...Didn't it?",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Black Knight,Diverting the sharp eyes of the hawk king proved to be quite difficult. It required much planning and care.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ashnard,Ha! Don't tell me it was difficult! I know you! I know you use that arcane powder to travel about at will.,negative

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ashnard,"No, it has my approval. My wyvern Rajaion, and this armor which renders any enemy attack impotent... Both are well suited to me. They both shine because they are mine! And now the medallion, and that galdr as well, both belong in my hands!",negative

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,So we're finally going to join forces...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ranulf,Reports say that King Ashnard is gathering his forces in the capital. The time to work together is certainly upon us.,neutral

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Daein Soldier,"The enemy approaches, sir.",negative

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Titania,"Commander, the foes are encamped on top of the rise. I wonder what sort of trap they have this time.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Those boulders didn't get up there all by themselves... Are they seriously going to roll them down on us?,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,"At first glance, it seems a simplistic trap, but these narrow paths make avoiding the rocks impossible. I think they may be surprisingly effective.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,So...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ranulf,We run up the mountain as quickly as possible and smash the enemy commander! Right?,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Right... How did you--,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ranulf,I know...genius.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,"Actually, that is the best plan. Try to avoid the boulders and reach the top as quickly as possible. Once there, defeat the general.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Right. Move out!,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Gromell,"Grr! So you've made it this far, have you? Then prepare to be sent down screaming!",negative

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Is this the lot of them?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ranulf,It looked like there were more of them from down there.,neutral

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,Above us! Look out!,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,Need a hand?,neutral

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,How did you come to be here?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,I thought I'd help you wipe out Daein.,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"That's good news for us, but has something happened? Why did you suddenly decide to help?",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,"I asked for his aid. We must defeat King Daein. To that end, the more powerful we are, the better. Yes?",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"So that's the story, is it?",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,"It's true that Reyson requested my aid. However, that's not the only reason that I'm here.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,Hm? What is it?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,"In a moment. First, let us meet with the king of lions. He waits for us at the foot of the mountain.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"Understood. Come on, everyone! Let's get off this peak and take a rest at the bottom.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,King Caineghis! It's an honor to see you again.,positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"First, let me offer you my congratulations. You've made quite the triumphant return, Princess Elincia.",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,Thank you. And allow me to express my gratitude for having the kingdom of Gallia fighting at our side. Your presence fills me with strength.,positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"During this short interim, you've managed to turn the tide of the war. To be honest, I'm quite surprised.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,I didn't...I didn't come this far on my own. My lord Ike and his brave companions were with me. It was only with the support of many that I was able to return home.,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"Yes, my reports cover most of that. Everything that happened in Begnion, and in Daein as well.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,As to that... About Nasi--,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,"King Gallia! Princess Crimea! I apologize for interrupting the festivities, but there's something I must discuss with you. Would you gather over there?",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"This group contains the people who were at the heart of that last battle, correct?",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,"Yes, it is.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,What about those two children? Surely they weren't involved.,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,...Children?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Mist,Um...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,This is Soren. He's my tactician.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"And this is my sister, Mist. Before we begin this war council, there's something I need to share with all of you...It's a story that involves my parents as well. I've kept most of it from my sister, but I felt this would be a good chance for her to hear it, so I asked her to join us.",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,Understood. Go on.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,It all begins when we meet Princess Elincia and escorted her into the forests of Gallia...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,And that is everything I know.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Mist,"F-Father...he... Is that how...Mom? That's...not true, is it?",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Titania,Mist... Do you want to leave?,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Mist,Um... No...I'm all right. I'm all right...I'm just a little confused.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Titania,Mist...,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"That's the whole of it, eh?",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,So this wasn't ever just a dispute between Crimea and Daein... There was something else at play the entire time.,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,"What could King Ashnard's ultimate goal possibly be? He has risked everything, even surrendering his own country...",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"Twenty years ago, even before he became king, he tried to release the dark god from within the medallion. However, he was thwarted by the actions of Greil and Elena.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,What manner of being is this dark god? What would happen if it were freed from its prison?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"I fear the world would once again be beset by natural calamity--much like it was 800 years ago. At that time, all the world, save Tellius, was drowned beneath the seas.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,That is a true story? I thought it nothing more than a fable...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,We have living proof: Goldoa's King Deghinsea. He and two other heroes fought alongside the goddess herself to defeat the dark one.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,King Goldoa was one of the legendary heroes? But he's...still alive...,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,"The Black Dragon King is a living fossil, and as stubborn as anything alive. He's been trying to control the rest of us for years, and he always says the same thing. Do not fan the flames of strife. As long as Lehran's medallion exists, you must never begin a war that engulfs the entire continent.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,...Never begin a war? It's possible...Perhaps there is more than one way for the dark god to gain its freedom.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,"Oh ho! Aren't you the clever one? That's just what the Black Dragon King says. Yet, the truth of that is unknown. There's a war going on right now, but the dark god's nowhere in sight, is it?",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,...Could it be...? I think I may finally know Ashnard's intentions.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Really?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,"King Goldoa said that a conflict which engulfs the entire continent would free the dark god from the medallion. Let us assume that the war would have such an effect on the medallion no matter where it was...or who possessed it. And let's also assume that the king of Daein thinks this as well. I can hear him now...Where is the tinder for the blaze I need? The answer to this question proved to be an easy one. Yet he had to find a way to test his theory...So, he attacked neighboring Crimea. It had to be Crimea. Begnion was too big, too powerful. Daein would have lost. Crimea, however, is a country known more for its scholarship than its military strength. Daein probably felt that a surprise invasion would let them win while taking minimal casualties themselves. And they were right. Crimea was easy prey.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,"King Ramon was also friendly toward laguz...I imagine that this, too, influenced Daein's decision. If things went well, the conflict would be enough to engulf Crimea's ally, Gallia, and the fires would spread. First Crimea, then Gallia...And eventually Begnion as well. Daein's power would increase, and strife and discord would spread across the land, eventually reaching the lost medallion.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,So you believe King Daein's goal is to awaken the dark god after all?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Soren,"At the very least, it is one of his ambitions. There can be no mistaking that.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,"Which means that our plan to attack him at the capital fits right into his strategy, doesn't it? It's the trigger he needs to break the dark god's bonds.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,"Even if that's true, we can't stop now. This war's gone too far for that.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,We have to smash Daein to end its menace once and for all. We bury every one of them and finish it.,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Caineghis,Mmm... Agreed. That's the only plan that makes any sense.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,If only we had the medallion with us...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Titania,"What is it, Reyson? Is there a way to avoid all of this?",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,"We, that is, the descendants of Lehran, we have a gift...Through the power of the slumber galdr, we have the ability to suppress the chaotic energies of the dark god in the medallion. So even if a massive battle occurred, if it were in my possession, I might be able to...",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Mist,I'm so sorry! It's because of my carelessness that the medallion was lost in the first place!,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"Mist! I told you that it wasn't your fault, didn't I?",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Mist,But--,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,"You were never careless, Mist. I know. You kept the medallion next to you at all times. You told me it was a keepsake of your mother's, and you always, always took good care of it. Didn't you?",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Elincia,That's why it's not your fault. So please don't punish yourself anymore. All right?,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Mist,Princess Elincia...,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ranulf,"She's right. And besides, the dark god could be released no matter where the medallion is. So it's nothing to worry about.",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Mist,"Thank you, Ranulf.",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,All right... It's about time for you to hear what I have to say. Reyson!,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,Yes?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,I'm sorry.,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,Huh? F-for what?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Tibarn,Leanne's been kidnapped. It may have been by Daein's hand.,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,That...can't be...,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Why would Leanne be taken? The release galdr can only be sung by the girl Altina. Right?,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Reyson,But Ashnard doesn't know that.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Oh no...,negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ranulf,"What a mess... Nothing can ever be clear and simple, can it?",negative

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Boy,"Mister! 'Scuse me, mister! Are you guys gonna go into these mountains? There are lots of soldiers wearing black up there. Those guys...they killed my poppa and burned our village. That's why we went to the mountains in the first place. You're gonna go up there and take care of 'em, aren't you? Gonna make 'em pay? Please, mister, say that you are! My momma and my sister and me don't have anywhere else to go, and I wanna go back to the cabin my poppa built.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,I understand. We're going to take care of those guys. You just stay here a bit longer. All right?,positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Boy,"Yay! Go give 'em heck, mister! Oh, wait! Wait! I heard those guys talking about something, too! They said if anyone comes up the mountain single file, they'd get 'em all at once. It was something like that anyway.",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Really? That's a lot of help. Thanks.,positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Boy,"Good luck, mister!! Kill 'em all! Do it for my poppa!",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"Excuse me, do you have a moment?",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Bastian,"Forsooth! What ho! My eyes behold Sir Ike! Pray tell, what would you ask of me, good sir?",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,Um...well... I just wanted to chat. I try to speak with all the members of the army when I have a minute.,neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Bastian,"I see! A fine idea that is, good sir. Some generals hope their soldiers all to be aloof, and ready always for the fight. If all goes well, sweet happiness abounds. But if the tides do turn, then anger grows. One wonders if he can lead men at all...I, too, am often plagued by such grim thoughts.",negative
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"Uh...yeah. Listen, I--",neutral
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Bastian,"Yet you walk out among your men-at-arms; spin tales, tell jokes, and lend a willing ear. Huzzah, dear sir! Huzzah until the end! In truth, I did much fear your name at first. I swore to find the mettle of the man, and studied you with cautious, steady eye. I thought to find yourself a brutish rogue. A villain crafty in his fiendish plans! With status and great wealth his only goals. Had such been your own ethic and deceit, I would have taken measures sure and swift to see your person vanished in the night. Yet lo! What do I find before mine eyes? A man so noble, true, and without peer, as would beset the moon herself with lust!",negative

FE9,25-StrangeLands,Bastian,"Commander, you are tired and unaware of how your body doth cry out for rest. If it would please you, I was of a mind to partake in a sweet and soothing draught. A beverage warm, and pleasant to the lips.",positive
FE9,25-StrangeLands,Ike,"...Um, if you're offering me a cup of tea in your tent, I'll accept. ...That IS what you're offering... Right? Oh, and I apologize in advance if I fall asleep again. I'm really tired.",negative

FE9,02-Rescue,Ikanau,"Yeah, of course. We’ve got ’em locked up safe and sound in that little shack back there. We got no problem with those brats. What we’re after is a little revenge. We want the redhead and her pups. And that’d be you boys.",negative

FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Ike,They’re not here either...,neutral
FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Soren,"Ike, pursuing them any farther may be dangerous. I think it would be best if we returned to Gallia for now. It’s possible the commander may have followed another road into Gallia. It’s something we should consider.",negative
FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Ike,...You’re right. Getting killed looking for them would waste everything they accomplished by breaking away. I guess all we can do is trust that they’re well and withdraw.,negative

FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Petrine,"Ha ha ha...You’ve heard of me? Why, I’m flattered. I’ll try to make this easy on all of you. Give me the princess, and do it now. If I roast the girl along with you curs, I won’t be able to present her head to His Majesty.",negative

FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Greil,"What’re you doing back here, you dumb pup?",negative

FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Greil,"...What am I to do with you? Still, you did well. Good work, Ike.",positive
FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Petrine,"Ha! Ignoring me proves you’ve got more guts than common sense. So you’re the commander, eh? Hmph! And I was waiting for some great hero. You’re just another sellsword.",negative
FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Greil,Am I?,neutral
FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Petrine,"Ha ha. You know, I think I’ll keep you! His Majesty, well...Let’s just say he enjoys strong men. Yes, I do think you’ll make a grand souvenir. You don’t have to come along quietly, but I must have you alive. Dead men have no value, after all.",negative

FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Greil,"You said your name was Petrine, is that right? Listen up. This place is nowhere near big enough. There’s not enough room for a true contest between the two of us. I’m going elsewhere. You coming?",neutral
FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Petrine,Do you actually think I’m going to fall for such a simple ruse?,neutral
FE9,07-ShadesOfEvil,Greil,"You and I, we’ve got more power than the average person. We don’t come across a chance like this too often. I’d like to flex my muscles without any distractions getting in the way. You?",neutral

FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,"Oh, I see. So rather than ally yourself with me, your trusted companion of old, you would side with this new protector? That's an unfortunate shift in attitude.

FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Reyson,"Any change in my bearing can be laid at your roost, Naesala. After all...you, my old friend, are the one who continues to engage in commerce with my enemy.

FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Titania,"I wonder what she's planning. That cargo... I can't help but believe that there were living creatures inside, but...What do you suppose the apostle intends to do with them?",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"I don't know. Titania, are all nobles and royals like this? They have plans and paperwork for every little thing, and their speech is as confusing as it is tedious.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Mist,"But, Ike, the other nobles we know are different! There's Princess Elincia, and King Gallia, and the dragon prince, too! All of them have been so nice and friendly and easy to talk to.",positive
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Titania,Perhaps the rudeness of the upper echelon is unique to the beorc class system. Princess Elincia was raised in special circumstances. Maybe that's why she's so different.,negative

FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,It's been like this since your clan's been gone. The area near the entrance is especially bad. They used fire...Most of the trees are dead.,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Reyson,...Unforgivable. How...how can they do things like this. Cursed humans... What did this forest do? What did my clan do...,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,"Humans hold all laguz in contempt. And in the same way, they hold all of nature in contempt as well. They think everything exists for their pleasure and betterment...They are beneath contempt.",negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Reyson,Naesala... It appears that I have misjudged you. I called you a groveling toady to humans and labeled you traitor. I was overly harsh. I apologize.,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,"Not to worry. I engage in occasional commerce with humans...That much is true. A more pressing issue is the growing darkness. You can return to Phoenicis tomorrow, can you not? I'm certain that some noble has a villa in this area. At this time of year, it is almost certain to be empty. I suggest we borrow it for the evening.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Reyson,You would sleep in a human building?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,"Think about it... Bird folk like you and I have no night vision whatsoever. If we were discovered by humans, they would surely overwhelm and capture us, right?",negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Reyson,Mmm... I see your point.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,Very good. I'll go stumble around until I find something to eat. Please...make yourself comfortable.,negative

FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,Is everything in place?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Raven Laguz,Yes. That Duke Tanas cannot sit still. He is literally...quivering with anticipation. It's not pretty.,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,"I bet it isn't. Just make sure that mountain of suet stays hidden. If Reyson catches so much as a glimpse of his bulk, he will take wing.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Raven Laguz,Understood.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Naesala,"Now, time to put on the finishing touches. This, too, I do to raise up Kilvas. Reyson, please don't judge me too harshly. That being said, I'm sure you will. Ah, well. Such is life. Enjoy your new one... Old friend...",positive
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Servant,"Ahem. You are from the northwest nation of Crimea, are you not? You have my condolences for the terrible misfortune that has befallen your country and people. Yet you remain blessed! Fate has brought you here to the Grand Temple Mainal! To the splendor of Begnion, grandest of all the nations of Tellius. By the way, I hear you are traveling north to the Grann Desert. There are ancient ruins there, you know? They are the remnants of a race known as the Zunanma, who come from a civilization that predates our own. I'm sure you will enjoy the sensation of being immersed in such primordial surroundings!",negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,Um...yeah. It'll be a real picnic.,positive
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Servant,"Oh, yes, picnics are indeed nice. Oh, but a word of caution. Studying the ruins from afar is one thing, but you would be well advised to keep your distance... For safety's sake! It's said that there's a bandit stronghold near the northwest ruins. And we hear occasional reports of strange figures wandering the dunes in the northeast. Be careful!",negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,How are your preparations progressing?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,They're underway. We leave within the hour.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,Your next mission takes you to the Grann Desert. You must choose your companions with care.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"A desert is just a large patch of sandy soil, is it not?",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,"Ha ha! With one major difference! Unlike sandy soil, you'll not find solid earth near the surface. You could dig and dig and find only more sand. Those on foot and horseback may find it difficult to move around.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"I see. I'm sure that Soren knows much about these things, but...",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,Hmm? Has something befallen master Soren?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,I don't know if he's feeling ill or just moping about. It all started when we arrived in Begnion.,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,Oh...,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"Be that as it may, it won't hurt for me to have this information. Can you tell me more?",negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,"Of course. There's little water in the desert, and the soil is very dry. Few trees or grasses grow there. Which means there are no groves or anything else which would provide cover. And, as I mentioned before, those on foot or horseback will find the sand slows their pace considerably. The exceptions are magic users, staff wielders, and thieves. Such people will not be affected to so large a degree.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"Thieves are agile, so I understand why they would be unaffected. But those skilled in the magical arts? That doesn't make sense.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,"I once heard an explanation from a magic user that I know...He claimed that the spirits he employed flew before him and cleared the sand from his path. However, considering the source, I'm not sure how much of that is truth.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,Who was the source?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,Prime Minister Sephiran.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,Would he play a joke like that?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,"Ha ha! Well, the prime minister is a very amusing man. But, please, allow me to continue my explanation. What else...? Others who are unaffected by sand are pegasus knights, wyvern riders, and other flying units. Oh, and laguz, too. Terrain features don't seem to affect them much in either form, although they will be slowed some.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"You said laguz, didn't you? Almost everyone here says sub-human.",neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,"Well, of course. Beorc and laguz are both living things. Every precious life was created to be equal by the blessed goddess. The fact that there are still those who persecute laguz in the land of the goddess... It is deplorable.",negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,...Are you of a noble house?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,"Yes, I am. One must be of noble birth to serve the goddess.",positive
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,But I thought...that all nobles were half-crazed fools who can't speak the truth. You seem quite honest.,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,"Ha ha, I'll take that as a compliment...Oh, and one last thing.",positive
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,What is it?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Sigrun,The desert contains the remnants of more than one lost civilization. Rumor has it that treasures from those times still lie undiscovered beneath the shifting sands. Those with good luck may come across such treasures during battle.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Makalov,"Hoooweee! The Grand Temple! Luxury and...gorgeousness as far as the eye can see. If a scoundrel like myself can find employment in a place like this, I guess my luck hasn't abandoned me after all.",positive
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Makalov,"But...for all the glitter and gold, there's an equal amount of dangerous work. Hmm...That I could do without. Maybe I can use my prone-to-illness ploy...Cough!

FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,Evening.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Makalov,WHAAAA! You... Did you happen to hear any of that?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,You were talking out loud. Loudly.,negative

FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Makalov,What?,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"Debts are debts, and you have many. Those peddlers weren't the only people who were owed coin by you... Right? We can't have debt collectors hounding the company day in and day out. My staff officer repaid the rest of the money you owe.",negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Makalov,Tha-that's...very kind of you.,neutral
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"It was from the company coffers. You, my friend, are now in OUR debt. You fight to repay the Greil Mercenaries.",positive
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Makalov,Ah! But! Aaah!,negative
FE9,15-TheFeralFrontier,Ike,"Payment will be deducted from your wages. For...quite some time. It seems you're working for free, friend.",neutral

Witness how they gather in the morning sun and multiply its brilliance. The gentle lustre of those argent wings! Manifest proof of royalty, as sure as I am alive. Magnificent... Absolutely magnificent. A true work of art wrought in flesh and feather. All this beauty... Mine... The fortune I paid the raven king seems like a pittance compared to this treasure!",positive

Prepare his meals with care, and do not disturb his rest. I would not see his countenance marred by displeasure. Herons, you see, are such delicate things. And then, at the proper time... Yes, the proper time. When will it be? I say to you, those haughty senators and their ilk have looked down their noses at me for the last time! I shall show them all! Ooooh, but I must have a grand stage. One where none can fail to see me. The Serenes royals are creatures of legend, and when I arrive with one at my side...

FE9,16-TheAtonement,Sanaki,"What manner of absurd fairy tale is this? In the year Begnion 624, Apostle Misaha, my honored grandmother, emancipated every last laguz slave. In accordance with her law, today there is not a single slave to be found in all of the Begnion Empire.",neutral

FE9,16-TheAtonement,Ike,"Your last mission showed us the slave trade, and now you've put us in contact with an underground emancipation group.

That is your intent, is it not? You are not like them... You are attempting to take responsibility for the actions of the people.

To ensure we were liked by our masters, we were drilled in the etiquette of polite society until it became second nature. We were slaves... We did what we could to live as long as we could. The most important thing was not to incur the wrath of our masters. If we displeased them, we were punished. If we were lucky, we were beaten. If we were unlucky...",negative

FE9,01-TheBattleBegins,Titania,"Ike, before you engage an enemy, take a good look at his weapon. The weapon you use often determines who has the upper hand in a fight. For example, the axe I’m wielding serves me well against lances, but it fares less well against swords.",neutral
FE9,01-TheBattleBegins,Oscar,And my lance is great against swords but not against axes. And to complete the triangle...,neutral
FE9,01-TheBattleBegins,Ike,"Ah! My sword. It’s strong against axes, but weak against lances. Right?",negative
FE9,01-TheBattleBegins,Titania,"Yes, exactly. If you can remember that, you’ll be more effective in combat.",neutral

FE9,01-TheBattleBegins,Bandit,"It’s those fool villagers...They think they can buy a bunch of sellswords to chase us away. It ain’t gonna work out how they wanted. All they get for their trouble is a bunch of ruined houses. Tear’em down, boys! That’ll teach ’em!",negative

FE9,14-Training,Elincia,Yes.,neutral
FE9,14-Training,Sanaki,"I have heard stories that King Crimea had a daughter in secret. My men have reported as much to me in the past. However, whether you are that princess or not is another tale. Do you have nothing that would lend credence to your claims?",neutral

FE9,14-Training,Sanaki,"Oh, really? And tell me, what gives you this strength of conviction? If we believe her story, this woman has not engaged with the outside world since the day she was born. So how is it that you, a lowly mercenary, dare to assert her authenticity?",neutral

Elincia has paid us, yes, but nothing more than the standard fee to purchase our services as her escort. Nothing more.

FE9,14-Training,Sanaki,"Not really. Why don't you fill me in Even if Elincia is truly Crimean royalty, she is at best heir to a dead country. Nothing more. Without Begnion's support, Elincia's claim holds no meaning. Am I mistaken?",negative
FE9,14-Training,Ike,Pah!,negative
FE9,14-Training,Sanaki,"Even if we harm her fragile feelings, for the sake of her country's future, she must stand by and say nothing. In fact, she is in no position to do anything but beg for Begnion's favor. Or...hadn't you noticed?",negative

FE9,14-Training,Ike,What?,neutral
FE9,14-Training,Nasir,Titania is correct. Begnion is a nation ruled by time-honored custom and ancient conventions. You insulted the apostle--the very symbol of their way of life. The fact that you are still breathing is a miracle.,neutral

FE9,14-Training,Soren,"Ike... This may not be much of an answer, but letting madness rule the day is the prerogative of nobility. The beorc divide themselves into classes.

FE9,14-Training,Caineghis,"Fellow kings and countrymen, attend to my words! As you no doubt have heard, Daein has invaded Crimea and overrun her. Of course, Crimea is a beorc nation...However, since the time of her founding, she has made every effort to engage the laguz with honor and dignity. Never has this been more true than during the thirty-year reign of good King Ramon. During this era, Gallia and Crimea initiated many ambitious cultural projects in an attempt to bring our divided people closer.Yet one man has always reviled our work...The Daein king, Ashnard. Why he took this recent course, however...I know not. Ashnard's actions are monstrous. His army has put much of Crimea to the sword. Her people live in terror. Her king lies dead. And now, the Daein forces continue their ruinous march and cross the border into laguz territory... Into Gallia.",negative

FE9,14-Training,Deghinsea,"I care not about the reach of your ambition, but you should choose your methods with more care. What good will it do you to expand your domain only to find enemies at your every border?",negative

FE9,14-Training,Naesala,"Ah, the luxury of a large nation! You would waste a chance to expand your territory just to maintain the status quo? Sad.",negative
FE9,14-Training,Deghinsea,"I agree with King Gallia. If we were to form a laguz alliance against Daein, we would drive Begnion to Daein's side and lose a valuable ally. The flames of war cannot be fanned haphazardly. Above all, we must think of Lehran's Medallion. Its location is unknown...But it still exists. We know this.

FE9,29-Endgame,Tibarn,"So, tomorrow it is. Did you come by to check on our preparations?",neutral
FE9,29-Endgame,Ike,"You know me too well. You're going to circle the capital and ensure that no airborne enemies escape. That's clear, isn't it?",neutral
FE9,29-Endgame,Tibarn,Yes. I think encircling the capital's a good idea. We'll guard the west and take care of airborne combat as well. The Phoenicis and Kilvas armies are unbeatable in that regard.,negative

FE9,29-Endgame,Giffca,"That is my purpose. That is, if Lord Ike grants his permission.",neutral

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,"I know what you mean. I don't have the sense that we're on the brink of being back in Crimea, either. I don't even remember this area at all. Maybe it's because I was born in Gallia and raised in the countryside. But countries are joined together like this all over the continent. I'm really in awe of it all.",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Elincia,So am I! For one who knew nothing of life outside the royal villa... Everything...is...So very big.,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,"Big? Hmm... Yeah, I guess you're right. When we left Crimea, it was spring... The snows were melting, the days were getting longer, and the weather was mild.",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Elincia,"It's been almost a year since we departed. Only a year, but the distance we've traveled to get here has been long and hard...It feels like many years have passed us by.

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,King Gallia is being most gracious. That posture will allow Crimea to lay claim to any victories we achieve.,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,"Don't say things like that! I'm shocked that you would understand such subtleties. Who are you, and what have you done with Ike?",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,"I don't believe you have the right to speak to me like that. Kidding. Actually, Soren just lectured me on the same situation when we received reinforcements from Begnion.",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,Of course. You were tutored by your nervous little staff officer. Now I get it... Has he snapped yet? He seems high-strung.,neutral

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Daein Soldier,"Y-yes, General! Do you think it will work?",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Petrine,"Sometimes the simplest of traps offer up the best results. Lure the enemy in, and then finish them off one by one. Got it?",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Petrine,"Listen up, dogs! There will be no retreating today! We stop Crimea's advance here! We will not allow them to gain the comfort of their homeland! Any who do not fight to the death will face my lance!",negative

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,I haven't seen Nasir around. What's happened to him?,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,He was declared an enemy combatant and locked up.,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,"What? Hey, I understand you being irked that he didn't mention testing you and all, but treating him like a criminal is too--",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,Testing me? What are you talking about?,neutral

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,We're going to talk. Now.,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,Nasir is a Daein spy? No way! That's not possible! He was our spy!,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,You're telling me he was a Gallian spy? None of this makes sense to me...,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,"He worked for us on behalf of the king. But...Daein? As a laguz, he would have absolutely no reason to work for them.",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,But there was a Goldoan named Ena who was working as a general for Daein.,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,...Are you serious?,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,"Yes, we were forced to fight her in the Daein capital. When we attempted to capture her, Nasir intervened and allowed her to escape. He betrayed us.",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,What? Hold on a minute...,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,"Maybe that was... If that's the case, then I can see why...No, even so, teaming up with Daein is just too much...hmm......",neutral

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,That's just what I want.,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,"Oh ho! Well said. And by the way, I thought I'd join you today.",positive

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Jill,That's what I was going to say to you! You survived! I'm very pleased.,positive
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Haar,General Shiharam left me in charge. I'm supposed to get our survivors and their families to Begnion. I can't die until that's done.,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Jill,"Oh, I see... But then... Captain, why are you still in Daein?",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Haar,"I... Believe it or not, I'm a vindictive man. Revenge for the general is something I couldn't let go.",negative

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Haar,Don't get the wrong idea. You're not the enemy I'm seeking.,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Jill,Huh? But...,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Haar,"The ones responsible for General Shiharam's death, are the Daeins. I pretended to return to the fold so I could get close to General Petrine...I'm just waiting for my chance. But I think they may be on to me. My unit's a bunch of tough guys who serve as Petrine's watchdogs. Plus, I've been ordered to charge the Crimeans head-on. It's Daein's way of killing two birds with one stone.",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Jill,"Don't do it! Come fight by our sides! If you're looking to kill Daeins, then we share the same goal!",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Haar,"Jill... I, um... I don't trust Crimea anymore than I do Daein. I'm sick to death of serving countries.",negative

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Lucia,Good advice. And you watch that you aren't waylaid on the way back to the castle.,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Bastian,Even if Daein unleashes on myself the full force of their army's wrath...They are no match for clever Bastian! I'll meet you at the castle gate anon.,negative

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Haar,...Combat. Tsk. It's one of those things you simply cannot control.,negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Haar,The Dark Angel... She's found me at last... At least I can sleep now...,neutral

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Elincia,Then Geoffrey is safe as well? Happy day! Are there others? How many Crimean retainers have survived?,positive
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Lucia,"Well, there's Count Bastian. That silver-tongued rascal is as loquacious as ever. Also, General Tagio, Marquis Katol's orphan, Silok, and Marquis Mitnala are all with us. The soldiers we have contacted so far do not even number one hundred. But if they know you've returned, retainers hiding throughout the land will surely come pouring in.",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Elincia,"Yet, my existence... It is not known to the general populace...",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Lucia,"There's no need to worry about that! Tales of your exploits in Daein have reached every corner of Crimea. In every village, in every town, the people are talking. Our fair king had a hidden child, they say. The secret princess of Crimea is fighting to save us all! In addition, Daein soldiers have been frantically searching for a mysterious and elusive Princess Crimea. All they've succeeded in doing is convincing the people that you truly are their princess. All of Crimea has been anxiously awaiting your return.",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Elincia,"Oh, Lucia, do you speak truly? They have...acknowledged my existence?...I never...expected this day...",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,"News of your actions in Daein reached the ears of King Gallia through Nasir. I then told Lucia, who passed it to the citizenry....You know, the thought that Nasir is a traitor just doesn't feel right to me. I can't believe it.",negative
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,"You think I don't see that? Look at what we know about the medallion. We discovered it thanks to his hints. He's helped us throughout our entire journey. In that, at least, he was not false. Yet, if he will not speak, there is nothing I can do to save him.",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ranulf,"Let's go see him. One way or another, I will loosen his tongue.",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,This way.,neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Ike,He's being kept in this supply tent. We wanted to keep him away from the other soldiers.,neutral

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Soren,"If I may continue, I believe that there is only one of these in all the world. It truly is priceless. And you want to give this to Ike?",positive

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Soren,"...If you truly wish to capture Ike's attention, bringing him staves and whatnot will avail you nothing.",neutral
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Aimee,"What? Really? Oh, dear... I was so hoping he would like it.",positive
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Soren,"Food, however, would be much more effective than a staff. He's particularly fond of spicy meat dishes.",neutral

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Soren,"Ah, good! He will be very pleased! Um...what about the staff?",positive
FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Aimee,Hee hee! You can keep it as payment for the cooking tip! Take good care of it.,positive

FE9,23-TheGreatBridge,Shinon,"What do you care, you snotty whelp?! It's none of yer business! AND another thing! About the command of the company.

FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"I see. So Crimea and Gallia have finally joined forces, have they? Half-breeds and humans fighting side by side... How sweet!",positive
FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,"In addition, it seems the incident with the heron princess has brought more Phoenicians to the struggle as well.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"Oh, the hawk king is getting involved, eh?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,"Which means that the Crimean army's strength of arms is all but equal to our own...and growing daily. Of course, this pathetic, ragged band is still no match for our superior leadership and skill.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"Heh heh heh... Heeee hee hee hee! Things are getting interesting, are they not? But I am still unsatisfied. Divide our army into two battalions, and send one to meet the Crimeans.",positive

FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,Bertram.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,Bertram?,neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,Do you believe I would betray you?,negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,I believe your heart has considered it.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,Surely you jest...I will divide our forces and see that they march to meet Crimea under Bertram's command. Is this satisfactory?,neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,"One other thing, Your Majesty. In my absence, did you order the death of Ena?",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"Ena? Ena...? Oh, yes, her. I'd forgotten about that one. I lost all interest in her when she failed to hold Daein's capital, you know? I've no use for failures...Yes, yes, I remember it now. I ordered General Petrine to take care of her...Ha! Another failure under my command...I told Petrine that if the task was beyond her, capturing Ena would be enough.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,I see.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,Why do you ask?,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,"According to one of General Petrine's men, they have indeed captured Ena. But, with the general's death, they're unsure what to do with her.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"Heh heh. That was one of Petrine's better qualities. She always did follow orders. Well, what do you intend to do?",positive
FE9,26-Clash,Black Knight,"I wish to receive your instructions. Do you still wish to see her killed, or have you changed your mind?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"Mmm. Do as you will. I care not. However! Do not bring her into my presence! When that one is near, Rajaion seems to grow restless.",negative

FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"Everyone seems to be here. Go ahead, Soren. You can begin now.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,Very well.,positive
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,Please look at this map. The current position of our army is here in the Marhaut Range. Between us and the capital there are two large outposts of enemy troops--Fort Pinell and Nados Castle.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Bastian,"Both holds were built to guardian our fair land. But now Daein rules them both, and knows of us. With rations set, they could hold out a year. Say what you will of Daein and her foul plans. One must admire her skill in things of war.",neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Bastian,"I do but speak the mean of it, good sir. The truth is harsh, but lies would be worse still.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Lucia,Will you two please shut up? Please? Sheesh!,negative
FE9,26-Clash,Geoffrey,...,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"Pinell and Nados are fairly close to one another. I doubt they would expect us to attack both at once, but...",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Titania,That seems to be a waste of our strength. And we don't want to get ambushed from the rear while attacking.,negative
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,"We cannot divide our army, but we could send a small force to attack the base with weaker defenses and keep it occupied. At the same time, the main army can focus on the other one and conquer it.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,"These are both strongholds built for the defense of Crimea...Now that they're under enemy control, they pose a significant danger.",negative

FE9,26-Clash,Ike,I see... So which one has more soldiers?,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,That would be Fort Pinell.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,"Very well. Then the main army will lead an assault on Fort Pinell. Meanwhile, I'll take my army and a unit or so of Gallians and set out for Castle Nados. We'll launch an attack, and when they come out to meet us, we'll retreat. Then we'll attack again! It will keep them busy.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,That should give us the time we need. We'll take care of our front by day's end...Let's go capture a fort!,negative

FE9,26-Clash,Elincia,My lord Ike.,neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Ike,I'm surprised you were able to hide armor and a flying horse from the Daein army.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Bastian,"Ahem...Prince Renning foresaw a time when the princess would need them, and bade us convey them from the palace. Prince Renning's thoughts were always of the princess, even as his life abandoned him. Be true to your heart, and live life as it dictates. Those were his final words to her.",negative

But...this constant waiting behind and doing nothing...it sets my heart beating with such unease I fear it may burst. Even if I cannot fight, I could use a staff to heal the wounded. If I could save just one soldier, it would mean so much to me. Please, my lord Ike. I promise to obey orders and stay out of harm's way as best I can.",negative

FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"One of the Four Riders? So he's on par with that woman we fought earlier, General Petrine?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,...That's not necessarily so. The name Four Riders is given to the four persons of highest ability among the king's advisors.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Titania,"So the members can change, is that it? Who are the current Four Riders?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,"First, there was General Petrine, whom we defeated at Riven Bridge. Then the man we face today, General Bertram. Next is General Bryce, who served the previous king. And finally, the enigmatic general known as the Black Knight. Those are the four.",neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Titania,So he's a man of no mean ability.,negative
FE9,26-Clash,Soren,"Like the Black Knight, he always wears his armor and never shows his face unhelmed. Some say he's not even in his armor, but that it's inhabited by an ancient spectre or a demonic creature. It's all just superstition and rumor designed to heighten fear of the man.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"It's not important. Once we cross swords, we'll know the truth. Then we can discover for ourselves if he's just a loudmouthed braggart or truly a monster. As long as our blades can wound him, I care not either way. Let's go!",negative

FE9,26-Clash,Titania,"Ike, there are more enemy soldiers than we expected. Just from what I can see now, they are double our numbers.",neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Crimean Soldier,"Sir, the enemy troops are fleeing! Shall we give chase?",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"No, let them run. We fought enough today. Get our men inside the fort and give everyone a break.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Crimean Soldier,"Yes, sir!",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"I see. So Crimea's won another victory, have they? Heh heh heh. Heeeee heee heee! Well then, send the rest of our troops to Castle Nados as reinforcements. Put General Hafedd in charge and let him exchange blows with them.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Bryce,"Yet, that would leave the capital protected by only the Imperial Guard.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"You forget yourself, knight. I will be here as well. If they defeat Hafedd and make it all the way here, then they are worthy to cross swords with me.",positive
FE9,26-Clash,Bryce,"I would beg a question, Your Highness. Why do you divide our troops and give the enemy the advantage? It's as if you were--",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,As if I were...? What? Go on.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Bryce,It's as if you desire the Crimean army to continue winning and make its way here to you.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,I'll not deny it.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Bryce,Are you saying...that you desire Daein's defeat?,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"No, I am not. If you think through it clearly, Daein will not lose. We had many plans when we started this war. We went through many scenarios, many predictions...But, as you know, our predictions have been completely overturned by this gang of rabble. Was that luck? Or was it the gap in skill between the individual soldiers? And if it is, aren't you interested in seeing how far they can come?",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Bryce,I...do not understand.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ashnard,"Heh heh heh. Heeee heeee heee! Perfect!! Nothing raises my spirits like war! Come, Crimea! Let me be the one to consume your noble hearts!",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Crimean Soldier,"General, may I have a moment of your time?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,Yes? What is it?,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Crimean Soldier,"I'd like your advice on something, sir. Let's say I was faced with an undefeatable enemy. In that case, what should I, as the weaker fighter, do? Should I try to avoid slowing down other better fighters and retreat? Or do I sacrifice myself and try to at least land a single blow on the opponent?",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"If it's an enemy general, or just someone that's far too strong for you, there's no need to get yourself killed. But I don't want you to simply run away, either. Study the enemy first, and see if retreating is your only option. I'd like you to do that much, at least.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Crimean Soldier,Study the enemy?,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"That's right. What type of fighter is he? What kind of weapon is he using? Things like that. If you can learn to do that, you can determine how best to engage your opponent.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Crimean Soldier,"Those are the very core of combat fundamentals, aren't they? Oh, I'm a danged fool! It could be...I think all my troubles started because I wasn't paying enough attention to the basics! You've given me something to think about. And some hope, too. Thank you, sir! You're the smartest general ever!",positive
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,Huh... What a brave little fella'.,negative
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,Are you leaving now?,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,Yep. We're going to do some reconnaissance and tease those Daeins a bit.,neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Reyson,"Tibarn, about--",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,"Reyson, no. I truly am sorry. Leanne's kidnapping is completely my fault.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Reyson,"It's not your fault. Please don't apologize. I know Leanne is alive. These battlefields are filled with chaotic energy, but I can still sense her...It's faint, but I know it's Leanne.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,"Which is all the more reason for us to hurry. There may be other ways to finish this, but crushing Daein is the surest.",negative
FE9,26-Clash,Reyson,Agreed.,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"Reyson, is this mysterious power that you use to sense Leanne something only herons possess?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,It's not something any of the hawk clans have! That is a certainty!,neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Reyson,"That's not true, Tibarn. The power may differ in potency between us, but all laguz possess it to some degree.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,"Ah, so it's just that my sense isn't developed, is that it?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Reyson,"The power is distributed something like this...Among the bird tribes, it's very strong in the heron clan. Among the beast tribes, I've heard it's most developed in the cat clan, though not as strongly as in the herons. As for the dragon tribes... It's said they may be equal to, or even surpass, the strength of the herons.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,"Even though I knew that all laguz were not alike, there are even more differences than I'd imagined.",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,"Your eyes should have told you that. Once we change, we don't look alike do we?",neutral
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,Good point.,positive
FE9,26-Clash,Tibarn,Enough pleasantries. It's time for me and my men to take wing.,positive
FE9,26-Clash,Ike,Right. See you later then.,neutral

FE9,26-Clash,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nasir,"Ike, there's someone here claiming to be an envoy from the theocracy of Begnion. She's been asking if the princess of Crimea is aboard...What do you want to do?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,A Begnion envoy? How did she know about this ship?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nasir,"Hmmm...Perhaps she had word from King Gallia...On the other hand, this is Begnion we're speaking of. I imagine it has spies in every corner of the continent. Perhaps one of those spies is the source of her information.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"So we shouldn't be surprised that she knows about Princess Elincia, right?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"No, but it's extremely unusual for Begnion to send an envoy to meet a princess whom they do not even acknowledge.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,What do you mean?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"It is a complicated matter. You see, the envoy is essentially an extension of the empress herself. Both Crimea and Daein were once part of Begnion. Both nations have only recently splintered from the theocracy. I can't fathom why the empress would extend the courtesy of an envoy to a nation she must consider somewhat beneath her. She must be planning something.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nasir,"Beneath her? That is somewhat harsh, don't you think?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"Harsh, perhaps, but it's true. Clothing it in sweet words will not hide its bitterness, will it?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Soren, even I would question the tactfulness of your words.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,I will try to be more diplomatic.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,"Ike, Nasir. You've no need to scold Soren. His words are just that. They do me no harm.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nasir,"I'm glad to hear that, Princess, but he should mind his manners.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Deciding how we ought to treat with this envoy is a more pressing issue. Princess, will you meet her and hear her message?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,I believe I must. We gain nothing by refusing to see her. Let us meet with the envoy.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"Princess Elincia of Crimea, I presume...",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,Yes.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,It is an honor to meet you. My name is Tanith. I am deputy commanding officer of Begnion's holy guard.,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,"I must ask, what would Begnion want of me that she would send her holy guard to greet me?",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"The apostle has learned of you, Princess Elincia, and she has come here to meet with you personally. The duty falls upon me to take you to her now.",neutral

FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,Will you accompany me?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,I suppose that I...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"We are the princess's escorts, and we will be coming with her. I hope you understand.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,Of course.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,"Then yes, I will go with you. Thank you.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Pegasus Knight,"Bad news,ma'am. We've sighted laguz near the apostle's position. Birdmen. Crows, most likely.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"Hmph! We've seen their kind before. They fancy themselves pirates without a ship, but they're thieves plain and simple. Commander Sigrun is with the apostle, and it will take more than a few winged scavengers to get past her. Let's remain calm.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Pegasus Knight,"I... Actually, I'm afraid we aren't quite sure where the apostle is.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,What!? They've kidnapped the apostle!?,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Pegasus Knight,"No, no! I...From what the commander said, the apostle grew impatient and had another of her more...willful moments. I asked at the docks, and sure enough, one of the longshoremen heard her order the ship to set sail without us.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,What!? Where were her attendants? What was she doing without her guard? Why can she never just stay put? I've told her time and time again that the seaports here are rampant with pirates and crow thugs!...Right. Where is she now?,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Pegasus Knight,"The wind is poor today, so we think her ship should not be too far from us. I came here as quickly as I could.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,Understood. We'll move immediately.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,"Excuse me, but is something wrong?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"Your Highness, I must apologize, but an urgent matter has arisen, and I must attend to it immediately. I will return for you later. Await my return!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,What was that all about?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"Judging from her expression, I'd say something has happened to the person she's meant to be protecting.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Mist,"Say, do you think that ship over there is involved? The envoy is flying in that direction.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"If so, then the pegasus knight's fears have already been realized...They're under attack. It's the ravens they spoke of, isn't it?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"Ike, why don't we go lend them a hand?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Are you feeling all right, Soren? It's not like you to offer to help anyone.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"It's a great opportunity to put the empress in our debt. We'd be fools to pass that up, wouldn't we?",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"I should have known you'd have an angle. What do you want to do, Titania?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"I don't approve of Soren's motivations, but I agree that we should help.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Well, then that's what we'll do. Will you be all right on your own, Princess?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,You're doing the right thing. I would not dream of stopping you. I know those pirates are no match for your strength.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Elincia,Give them...Give them a sound thrashing!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Huh...You're starting to sound like one of us, aren't you? All right then, we'd better go!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"Ugh! No matter how many we defeat, there are more waiting to attack! And not just those ravens of Kilvas, either--there are beorc, too. What do they all want here!?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Need a little help?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,You! Aren't you Princess Crimea's escort?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Yes. The princess ordered us to come to your aid. May we join the fray?,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"That would be appreciated. We'll keep the ravens at bay. In the interim, why don't you go ahead and move onto that ship. The big vessel is ours. I'm not sure who the small one belongs to.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"There are human soldiers aboard, but if they're in this part of the sea, they must be pirates. Cut them down!",negative

FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Begnion Soldier,"Oh, no! There are more of them!? We're doomed!!",negative

FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Wait, wait! Don't get confused. We're here to help you! We're your reinforcements. The deputy commander of the holy guard asked us to help drive the enemy from this ship.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Begnion Soldier,Oh! Commander Tanith sent you? We're saved! The apostle has taken refuge in the cabin belowdecks.,positive

FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"A blueblood, huh? Well, unless you're good with a sword, you'd better hide yourself in a cabin.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Astrid,I'll do no such thing. I once trained with knights and cavaliers. I may be of noble birth...but I know something of battle. I can fight.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Well, if you can fight, we can use you. Let's work together. You going to be all right with that?",neutral

FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Yeah.,neutral

FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,"Aye, after a fashion. Judging by the look of things, you must be on Begnion's side, yes? I certainly hope so. I'd hate to have to slay you after all we've been through.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"No, you're right. We're here to defend the apostle.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,"Well, that's a relief. There's nothing more awkward than having to kill a friend because of his poor taste in employers, I tell you. Still, I guess that's the hazard of life as a mercenary. It's good to see you, Ike. Let's finish this together!",negative

FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,"You were worried? That's nice, but to tell the truth, I've never been happier, my boy!",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rolf,I'm glad to hear that.,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,But enough chitchat. There's a battle to finish!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rolf,I'll second that.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rhys,"Hm? Is that...Gatrie, is that you?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,"Hm? Rhys? Rhys, look at you! It's been so long! How are you doing?",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rhys,Oh...I'm hanging in there. And you? How has it been since you left? Is the new job going well?,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,"You bet! In fact,I'm on a very serious mission right now! I can't afford to lose. A life hangs in the balance!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rhys,"I'm glad to hear everything's going well for you. I knew it would, but I was worried...Just a little.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,"Tee hee! You don't need to worry about me. Why, I can't remember when I've been this happy.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rhys,I'm relieved to hear that.,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Gatrie,But enough chitchat! There's a battle that needs fighting.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rhys,"Agreed. It's nice to fight at your side again, even if we're working for different people.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"Tell me, walker, are my soldiers proving useful?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,K-King Kilvas!,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,What? Aren't you happy to see me?,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,"Grrr...Look at this mess! I paid you good money to help me outmaneuver everyone else and catch the Crimean princess's ship first. Everything seemed to be going exactly as we'd planned. But now, we're being attacked by a squad of pegasus knights! We're flying no flags! We've stripped our armor of any crests! They should have no clue who we are! Why are they attacking us!?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,Didn't you know? That is a Begnion ship you're attacking.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,What?!? That's...a Begnion ship? It was your featherbrained lackey who told us that Princess Crimea was aboard that vessel!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,Call it a miscommunication...One of those unfortunate misunderstandings that seem to happen now and again.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,You deceitful...King Kilvas! I wouldn't be surprised if you'd planned this treachery from the start!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"Such unkind words! You wound me. I would never intentionally lie to you. And as proof, I bring good news. I have it on unshakable authority that the ship that just sailed up alongside Begnion's carries the Crimean princess.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,"Oh...But unless we can break through the Begnion ranks, there's nothing we can do...",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,Would you care for some assistance?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,And what would it cost me this time?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"You learn quickly, my friend. Let's see, you'd be receiving my own royal assistance, so...double--no, triple rates.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,Ludicrous! So much gold... Where would I...,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"I suppose I could defer payment until later. Of course, that does bring up the question of interest...",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,Leave my sight! I wouldn't seek your aid if the world were burning down around me!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"Very well, we've no more to discuss. Call me if you change your mind. I'll find a nice perch and enjoy the show.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,Curse you! You're no better than your feral cousins!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"Those humans take themselves far too seriously. It's almost as though being obstinate is a way of life to them. They let their foolish pride stand in the way, and what do they get in the end? A swift and stupid death. Now I'm getting terribly bored merely watching their foolishness.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nealuchi,Ne-Ne-Nestling! I can sense you're up to no good again!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"Stop calling me Nestling...Really, how many times must I tell you that, Nealuchi?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nealuchi,"To me, you will always be Nestling, Nestling. You can tell me as many times as you like, but I can't stop. You may be king now, but in my eyes, you will ever be my little nestling with eggshell stuck to your tail feathers!",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,Oh...curses! Senile old fool. Forget it.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"Hey, you there!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Raven Laguz,"Yes, sir!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"We should take advantage of the confusion of battle to help ourselves to the cargo. These humans seem interested only in fighting their fellow men. If they can't be bothered to defend their treasure, I think it fair to say they've lost their claim to it.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Raven Laguz,"Right you are, sir!",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"Hmph. Fight. Fight till you drop, ground-bound humans. We Kilvas will be sharpening our black beaks in the mean.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tibarn,"Hm. A battle...Tell me what you see, Janaff.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Janaff,"It's a bit far off, but with no fog, it shouldn't be a problem. Hmm...The middle ship... I see beorc aboard. By their crests, I'd say they serve the hated Begnion empire. And the other ships...I'm not sure who they belong to. Neither flies any flag...and I see no crest, but I can make out more beorc. From their behavior...I would say that one side fights Begnion, while the other rushes to Begnion's aid.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tibarn,"A battle between beorc ships? I do not understand this at all. Ulki, tell me what they are saying.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ulki,"Just a minute, sir......The apostle is...aboard the Begnion ship. And coming to her aid...Soldiers serving Crimea's princess? They appear to be mercenaries. And on that last ship...More soldiers, although I do not know which country they serve. It seems they had a contract of some sort with the raven king.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tibarn,The apostle!? That would explain the presence of those graceless pegasus knights.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ulki,"What would you like to do, Your Majesty? We will fight if you give the word.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tibarn,"The apostle...This is a tempting opportunity. However, we are no scavengers, feeding on others' scraps. When we fight, it will be with honor. We're going back home. Do some scouting and report back to me with what you find.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ulki,"Yes, sir!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,Blast! All my plans are falling apart. I'll cut you all down!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,Accursed crows...You ruined...all of...my plans...,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sigrun,"Finally! There they are! I hope we'll find Empress Sanaki...safe and sound...Ladies, chaaaarge! Show them what we've got!!",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Oh, no!!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Norris,"Pegasus knights? Begnion sent their holy guard here? Blast! Accursed crows...My plan was perfect! It's over...Men, into the seas! Swim for your lives! And if you get caught, tell 'em nothing! Not a word about our homeland, or your life is forfeit!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Naesala,"I saw this coming, of course. You know...If they'd just paid me more, I'd have been willing to lend a hand. Oh, well. What do a few human lives matter to us? They're none of our concern. We're done here. Let's go.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Raven Laguz,"Yes, sir!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,That's it. It looks like the dust is finally starting to settle.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"Looks like those crows took flight as soon as the holy guard arrived. The other assailants fled, too.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Then our job here is done. Crows are one thing, but what were those men doing with them?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"Yes, I thought that was odd, too.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"They looked like pirates, but they certainly didn't act like them.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"True. They weren't interested in treasure, and their soldiers definitely were trained fighters. But who were they? Which country did they serve? Was this an attempt on the apostle's life?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nasir,"It's possible. The apostle is the symbol of the Begnion Empire itself. The apostle is its empress. If she were to perish, it's fair to say Begnion itself would perish as well.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,I see...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Unknown,The apostle is missing!? What do you mean!?,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Nasir,That voice...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Something must have happened. Let's go find out.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,...Ugh. This business is becoming quite the headache.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Begnion Soldier,"I-I'm sorry, ma'am! If I can offer up my life in repentance for--",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"Oh, stop it. If you want to repent, go do something useful and find the apostle.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Begnion Soldier,"Yes, ma'am!",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Did I hear correctly? Is the apostle missing again?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"Oh, you're that mercenary...",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"My men guarded the cabin entrance. As far as I know, we kept it safe from the enemy...",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"From what I have been told, the apostle slipped out of the cabin on her own in the chaos...",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,On her own? Now why would anyone called the apostle do something as stupid as that?,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"Hey, Ike! Watch your words. You're being rude.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"It's all right, dame knight. I have more important matters on my mind. I hate to ask, but would I be able to enlist your help in searching for the apostle?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"Of course! You don't mind helping, do you, Ike?",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Nah.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Tanith,"We'll search the enemy ship. Would you search your ship, just to be sure? I would appreciate it.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"I'll do what I can to find her, but I don't even know who I'm looking for...",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"I think it's safe to assume she will be a woman of stature, a noblewoman of some sort.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Huh.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"Well, I suppose all I have to do is keep my eyes peeled for any stowaway--anyone I don't know. Let's split up. It will go faster if we search separately. Mist and I will check this side.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Then Soren and I will search the rest of the ship.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Soren...About what I said this morning...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,Yes?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,About the way you phrase things.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,I...I ought to apologize for that.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"No, don't apologize. I know you. I know it's been bothering you, hasn't it?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,No. Well...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Don't take it personally. I'm no better, you know. Your ability to speak plainly the things others won't is part of what makes you brilliant. Others are too bound by courtesy...With you, I trust that what you say is exactly what you think.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"Well...yes... Thank you, Ike.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Now, about that missing apostle...",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,Oh...!,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,You found her?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"No, I don't think so. But there's a child stowing away in here!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,What!? What is a child doing hiding on our ship!?,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,She must be some aristocrat's daughter. Probably slipped on from the Begnion ship...It was a hectic battle. She must have been frightened and hid herself here in the confusion. Are you going to help her?,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Well, we can't just leave her.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Hey, are you all right?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,I-I'm...fine...,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Hey, don't be scared!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,Uh...Wh-who might you be? You don't look like a laguz. Perhaps a new recruit?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,No. I'm a mercenary. I was hired by Princess Elincia.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,The Crimean princess? Ouch!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"What's wrong? Oh, you hurt your foot. Let me see.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,"Hold! Do not approach me! Hey, I told you not to--Oooouch! You're hurting me! You fool!!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Looks like the bone's not broken. Still, we'd better have Mist take a look at it just in case.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,Oh? What? What are you doing!?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Just hush up and hold on to me. There's my sister. She can heal that foot of yours right up.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,Are you trying to help me? Shouldn't you be elsewhere?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"I'm supposed to be looking for some sort of apostle person. But I think there are enough other people looking, and I'd rather help the injured first.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,Ha...I see. This is indeed...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Hm? What is it?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,"Oh, nothing. If that's the case, I accept your help.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Mist,Ike! Any luck finding the apostle?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Nope. All I found was a little lost child.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"Hey, she's quite a cutie.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Mist, do you think you could use your staff to heal this kid?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Mist,Yeah. Is she hurt?,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Just her foot...But maybe she bumped her head, too. She's been mumbling complete gibberish since I picked her up.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,"I kept silent, blaming these antics on your ignorance, but I can no longer tolerate your manners!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Huh? What's wrong? It's your foot, isn't it?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,"Prepare yourselves, peasants!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Prepare? For what?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,"You stand in the presence of Sanaki, empress of Begnion! I am the apostle, the voice of the goddess!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Empress? What did she say?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,What? Then she is...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Mist,"Oh, no... Is she really...?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"No, she can't be.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,No way,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,"Hold your judgment...Even if she's lying, there must be a reason...",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,Y-you...ignorant...!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Unknown,"Are you all right, Empress!?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sigrun,"My apologies! We were unable to reach you, and we left you in terrible peril. I accept full responsibility.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,"You're late, Sigrun! What would you have done had something happened to me?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sigrun,"Please, Empress, I beg your forgiveness.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,That won't be necessary. I am also partly to blame for what happened.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sanaki,"Let's focus instead on our rescuers. As a reward for rescuing me, I would like to invite them to visit our court. And be sure that the one they serve, that girl who claims to be the princess of Crimea, is invited as well.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sigrun,"Princess Elincia's bodyguards, I presume. I am sorry for the trouble you've gone to.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,And you are...?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sigrun,I beg your pardon. My name is Sigrun. I'm a commander of Begnion's holy guard. No word of thanks will ever repay you for saving the empress.,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Mist,Wait...So it's true?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Titania,Are you saying that little child...,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,is Begnion's...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Soren,"Empress...Hm. It appears so. I can't say I quite believe it, but she seems sincere. Besides, how many people do you know who command a legion of pegasus knights?",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Sigrun,"The empress has invited us to join her at Sienne, the capital of Begnion. I think we should go. Where is the princess? We should ask her permission before agreeing.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,She must be in the cabin. I'll take you to her.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,"Commander, how are you? Staring at the sea, I see...",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"I know you...You're Jorge, right? You make weapons for us.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,"No. Jorge buys used ware. I'm his twin brother. Well, mostly his twin. He has blond hair, you see. My name is Daniel. Just remember that I have brown hair and that Jorge has blond, and you'll be fine.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Brown hair, Daniel, and weapons...Blond hair, Jorge, and items...I think I'll remember.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,"Fantastic. Say, can I ask you a quick question? You're a battle expert, right? You've fought a lot?",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Enough, yeah. What is it?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,Picture this. Let's say there are two ships. And suppose there are planks connecting the ships at three different points.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,All right. I'm picturing it.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,"Now then, soldiers from one ship are about to attack the other one. Imagine that the defending side has fewer soldiers. If they want to mount a solid defense, what should they do?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"It seems clear enough to me. Position the soldiers with the best defense on the planks, soldiers like cavaliers and knights.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,I see. So you would hold the enemy at bay by using your strongest allies to block the primary crossing points!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Then, you'd want to have your long-range attackers line up behind the tougher units barring the bridges. I'm talking about anyone with javelins, axes, or magic. You'd be able to do a lot of damage without much risk.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,Sounds like a good plan but...it seems rough on the soldiers defending the bridges.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"You would want to heal them often,obviously, but maybe there's a way to reduce how much damage they take.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,"It's a stretch, but what if I don't have them attack at all? That way, they won't run the risk of getting any counterattacks!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Hmm... That's not a bad idea.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,Great! Thanks. That gave me some good ideas.,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Ideas? For what?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,"Oh, my brother and I have been playing a wargame. I've lost four times in a row.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,A wargame?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Daniel,We'll let you join if you bring some parchment and a quill. Come see us anytime if you're curious. See you later.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Maybe I shouldn't have been so serious with him...,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"Well, well! If it isn't our commander! What brings you down here?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,I was just on my way to the deck.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"Oh, I see. That's too bad. I had a story I wanted to share with you.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,A story?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"Hm mm. And quite a ripping yarn it is, too. Interested?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Well... Not really.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"Oh, you're so rude! And after you were so sweet the other day!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,What are you going on about?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"When those crows attacked... I had wanted to see what they looked like, so I was hiding on the deck, watching. I had heard they could fly, of course, but I had no idea they could fight! I thought one of them had the drop on you, and I couldn't help myself! I cried out, Commander, watch out!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"I thought I'd heard a strange, shrieking sound. That was you?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"And upon hearing my sweet voice, Commander, you turned around and brought down that crow with one shot! It was awe inspiring.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Not really. He was exhausted from the battle. He could barely move.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"And that's when you first caught my eye, my dynamic young commander!",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Is that why your hand always lingers on mine when you hand me my equipment?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"Oh, no! Have I been too...obvious?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Maybe I should send one of the others down to pick up our gear from now on...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Aimee,"Hm. You're embarrassed, aren't you? You're so cute when you're being coy! But once I set my sights on a man,I never let him get away. Remember that.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,Hey.,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Jill,What do you want?,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Is there any reason you're still on our ship? The crows are gone. The truce is over, isn't it?",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Jill,"...I have a duty. As a Daein soldier, I cannot allow a Crimean princess and her band of mercenaries to run free where they will.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"If you want to start a fight,you're on the right path. Think you can take us all on your own? Because if you want to get your friends, I won't stop you from leaving the ship.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Jill,"Watching you all fight those crows like a band of street rats with sticks,I could see you were no match for me. But even if I were to leave this ship, the land is too far away for me to reach.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Nonsense. I can see land in the distance from time to time, and I thought you could go anywhere on that wyvern of yours.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Jill,"No wyvern could fly that far without resting, and these islands are thick with half-beast scum. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't leave this ship.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"Then let me ask you, why did you follow us alone knowing that?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Jill,I wanted to be recognized...I wanted my deeds to earn me fame. A soldier has little else to strive for...,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,And yet you soldiers sneer at mercenaries. At least we fight for something real. There are some dumb soldiers in this world.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,You leave us no choice. I'll take you as far as Begnion.,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Ike,"But as long as you're on my ship, you will not utter the phrase half-beast. If you can't agree to this condition, I'll kick you off the ship right now.",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Jill,...,neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Boyd,"I'm just saying, there has to be something more we can do.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Oscar,"Boyd... You're not making any sense. I understand your enthusiasm to help , but try to explain what you mean...We can't do anything until we know exactly what it is you want to do.",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Boyd,"You're so impatient, Oscar. I was just getting to it, all right?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Oscar,Impatient? You're calling me impatient? You're so impatient you can barely be bothered to put your armor on!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Boyd,"Nag, nag, nag. Listen, I think we should come up with an unstoppable killer attack, something only we can do!",negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rolf,An unstoppable attack!? That sounds good...,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Boyd,"Doesn't it? I'm glad you approve, peewee!",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rolf,Don't call me peewee!,negative
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Oscar,"It is a fine plan, but you haven't explained what this new attack is supposed to be. How do we do it?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Boyd,"Hey, I came up with the idea. It's your job to figure out the details. Make it cool, though, Oscar.",positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Oscar,"Boyd, this plan sounds...Oh, dear... How do I put it?",neutral
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Rolf,Let me do it! I'll think up a great one!,positive
FE9,13-AGuidingWind,Boyd,No way. Forget that. It's too much for your little peewee brain.,negative

FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,It’s Crimea and Daein. They’ve gone to war.,negative

FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"That’s why I’ve called everyone here. Soren has some more information. Go ahead, Soren.",neutral

FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"Ah. It’s a map of Crimea. Quite detailed, from the looks of it.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"Yes. This is the Melior, Crimea’s capital. Our base of operations is...",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"Everything started three days ago. I needed to do some research, so I went to the archives of Melior’s royal library.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"Without warning, the scream of a terrible beast–a wyvern, perhaps–rent the air, and the building was rocked by a tremor.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"I rushed outside and saw wave after wave of knights, cavalry, and wyvern riders, each clad in glistening ebon armor, black as night.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,The Daein army?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,Correct.,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,Was there provocation?,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"As you know, relations between Crimea and Daein have never been...friendly. However, the past centuries have seen only minor skirmishes, nothing that has ever approached the scale of this attack. It was brutal and without warning. Daein laid the capital to waste. I’ve never seen destruction on this scale before.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,"A swift attack, devastating and brutal...A daring gambit, indeed.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"But if it succeeds, a very well-chosen one at that.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"Yes, the king of Daein would not hesitate to employ such treacherous tactics. What happened next?",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"King Crimea’s brother deployed the Crimean army to meet the attack. The king ordered his people to flee the city before the battle reached them. Fearing the worst, I also fled and made my way here.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"So we don’t know how the tides of battle flow now, do we?",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"That’s all right. Word of the war cannot have traveled far yet. We may well be the first ones who know of it out here. You did well to bring us this information, Soren. I know some risk was involved.",negative

FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,"Daein has invaded Crimea...We may be mercenaries, but this still affects us.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,What are we going to do?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"That’s the question of the day. How do you see it, Titania?",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,"Crimea is the closest thing our company has to a homeland The Crimean royal family and noble houses have been generous, providing us with many lucrative jobs. From a moral standpoint as well as a business one, it’s in our best interest to help Crimea.",positive
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"And you, Soren?",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"I agree on one point: we are mercenaries.We are not Crimea’s private militia. No coin has crossed our palms, so I think we should stay out of it.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,So you would have us sit and watch as Crimea is overrun?,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,I would. Daein’s troops are superior in both numbers and morale. The chances of a Crimean victory are slim indeed.,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,"But Crimea is ruled by King Ramon, who is known throughout the land for his wisdom. And his brother, Duke Renning, is said t possess peerless valor and courage. Daein may not find victory so easily.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"Valor and courage are for children’s tales. In terms of military prowess, Daein’s King Ashnard is every bit Lord Renning’s equal. Victory will hinge on troop numbers and supplies, and Daein is superior in both. I think the outcome is painfully obvious.",positive
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,"Curse you, Soren! Crimea is not doomed! If they can turn aside Daein’s initial thrust and turn it into a test of endurance...",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,With the Crimean army both demoralized and ill prepared? They simply will not be able to hold out that long.,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,All right. That’s enough. Both of you.,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"I hear what you say. However, we must ascertain the current situation before we decide on any action. We’ll send a scouting party to get a closer look at Melior.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"Ike, I want you in charge of this. Assemble your men and get going.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,What? Me?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,Titania will accompany you as an advisor.,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Shinon,"Commander, you must be joking! He’s just a boy, and he’s had barely more than a taste of battle. What do you expect a whelp like him to accomplish?",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Greil,"Ah, Shinon. Since you’re so concerned, you can go as well.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Shinon,"Wait, that’s not what I...Blast.",negative

FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Rhys,"Are you feeling all right, Ike? You haven’t said a word in quite some time.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,I don’t understand what my father’s doing. Why put a new recruit like me in charge of something so important?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Rhys,You’re going to succeed him as our commander one day. Don’t you think he wants you to know how to lead?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,"Me? I don’t... I don’t know if I’m capable. And even if I am, that day’s a long way off, right? I mean, I’m inexperienced. Weak. I’m nothing compared to my father.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Rhys,"I’m not so sure about that. When I look at you, I see a young man full of promise. Commander Greil is a great man, but...I think you’ll be every bit his equal.In time, you might even surpass him.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,Don’t be ridiculous!,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Rhys,"It’s just my opinion. You need not pay it any mind. Yet, if you fear your own weakness, why not take this chance to go out and better yourself? That would be more in keeping with your personality, no?",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,I suppose you’re right.,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,"How did things look over there, Soren?",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"Same as here. There are corpses strewn everywhere. There are quite a lot of them, especially when you consider how far we are from the capital.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,Are they Crimean?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Rhys,"...Judging by the armor, the vast majority of the dead are Daein soldiers.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,So Crimea has the upper hand?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"Just the opposite, I think. The Crimean soldiers were members of the Imperial Guard. That means King Ramon–or another member of the royal family–was on the move when Daein soldiers fell on them.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,Could it have been Lord Renning?,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"No. As long as the Crimean army still draws breath, Lord Renning will not leave their command. Perhaps another member of the court...",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Gatrie,We’ve got Daein soldiers moving in on our location! And they don’t look happy!,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,You there! Who are you? What are you doing here?,neutral

FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,Tsk! Headstrong fools!,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,Getting caught up in some skirmish is not art of the plan...,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,But they’re obviously not going to listen to us. Greil Mercenaries! Get ready to fight!,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Shinon,"All right, Ike. Let’s see how you handle the role of captain. Well? What are your orders, boy? We’ll do what you say, so long as you hurry up and spit it out!",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,"I know, I know! I’m thinking! Give me a moment, will you, Shinon?",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Shinon,"Bah. Useless! We’d be better led with Mist than this soft, untested whelp.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,"Let’s see...We’re in the middle of the road, and there’s not much cover. Soren and Rhys are vulnerable, so we have to protect them from enemy attacks...Right?",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,"That’s a sound strategy, Ike. I can attack from behind your defenses. Good thinking.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,Do you mean that? Um...all right! Let’s do that then.,neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,"Grrr! Blasted mercenaries. They’re better than I expected. Even so, they’ll not prove a match for Daein’s finest!",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,Gwaa haa...Wretched curs...You will regret your decision to oppose Daein...,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,Bah! You’re nothing more than a bunch of ragtag sellswords. Who are you to oppose Daein!? You are so terribly ignorant of your position in this world.,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Ike,"You refused to listen to us, and then you attacked without provocation! Is this the way of the Daein army?",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,"You’re a cheeky little monkey, aren’t you? Once you’re dead, you’ll regret sassing me!",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,"A mage, eh I’ll have to keep my guard up around you, no matter how young you look.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Soren,You forced this combat. We cannot allow you to return home. Are you ready to die?,negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,"I’ve fought the Crimean army before. The Imperial Guard has some skill, but the rest are a poor joke. Which will you prove to be? Hmm? Perhaps you’ll offer me some entertainment after all.",neutral
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,"If you attacked us because you thought we were with the Crimean army, you made a mistake. I left my post years ago. Now, I’m nothing more than a common mercenary.",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Maijin,"That means nothing to me. You’re not of Daein, you’re armed, and you’re here. It’s our job to destroy you. Simple, wouldn’t you say? Come, dog! Prepare yourself!",negative
FE9,04-RoadsideBattle,Titania,"I’d just as soon avoid this bloodshed, but that seems unlikely. If that’s the way it is, I’ll not hold back!",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,The crow king himself is cooperating with Daein?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"Yep. And compared to the other crows, the king is in a class by himself. Obviously, he's no match for our king, but... Anyway, you should move carefully.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,...General Ike. I hear the sound of many wings ahead. It would seem Kilvas soldiers have joined the troops of Daein for this fight.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Is Kilvas's contingent larger than the what we faced in the last battle?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,There are many... But what causes me more concern is the voice of King Kilvas.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,The king himself is cooperating with Daein?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,"Yes. And compared to the other crows, the king is in a class by himself. We must be cautious.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,An entire unit under the command of King Kilvas? I think that bodes ill for us.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Soren,The outcome of the battle hinges on how we deal with them.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Titania,"Kilvas soldiers, hm? As fellow bird tribe laguz, what can you tell us about them?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,Please don't lump us together with those carrion birds.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,We're not partial...to the crows.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"As you know, we are outmanned by the Daein troops. Is there any way to get the ravens to withdraw? That would be a tremendous help.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"...Well, suppose I could go meet with King Kilvas... If I had to. I don't think that my speaking to him is going to make a difference, though.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,"If you like, we will try, but...Don't expect anything to come of it.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,"No matter the circumstance, I will never again speak to a crow.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Soren,"No matter what we decide, sitting here like this is giving the enemy more time to prepare.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"You're right. Come on, let's get moving!",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Daein Soldier,Sir! The Crimean army has arrived!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Homasa,I hope they are prepared to pass into oblivion. For this will be their final resting place!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Crimean stragglers joined with an army on loan from Begnion. I've even heard they have a betrayer in their midst. And yet they still march on... What an odd group. But as long as Kilvas stands at the side of Daein, they have no future. Ah, I suppose they're just unlucky.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,It appears the enemy has spotted us.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Well, a group this large is hard to miss.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,How will you proceed?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,No tricks. Nothing fancy. We'll hit them from the front--fast and hard.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,"I'm sure you're already aware of this, but if you don't do something about Kilvas, you're at a disadvantage.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Yes, I've heard about the ravens... But even so, it's not as if we can turn tail and run away.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,"Now that I think on it, King Kilvas and Prince Reyson used to be close friends. Did you ask him to speak to the king?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,He was most emphatic in his refusal. It seems that Naesala was responsible for Reyson's capture at the hands of Duke Tanas. I can't really blame him.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,"And the hawks? They, too, are of the bird tribes. Surely some connection can be found there.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,They...weren't very excited about the suggestion.,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,You could command them to do it.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,There's an antagonism between the tribes that we don't understand. I'd rather not force the issue. Trying to coerce them into it would be...unfair. I will let them do as they please.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,"That is so very like you. However, giving orders that are unpopular is often necessary when one is in command, and--",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Maybe so. But I can only do things the best I know how. My own way.,negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"One of Tibarn's flock, eh? You are his eyes, if I'm not mistaken.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,It's not enough that you sold the White Prince to humans? Now you're fighting against laguz?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,You hawks rescued Reyson didn't you? So everything worked out in the end! What's the problem?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,I'd like you to repeat those words to the prince's face.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,Reyson is here? HERE?! Why?!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,He supports the Crimean army! The beorc leading this army helped him to escape Serenes Forest.,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,Helped him? Are you saying a human came to the aid of Reyson? A laguz?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"Yes! And he rescued Princess Leanne, too!",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,Leanne...is alive?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,Don't play the fool! You know the life of the forest has returned. That was their power at work.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,I see. That's how the forest...Of course.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"Listen up, crow! You need to fly over there and talk to the prince. If you don't do it, I'm gonna know that you really are the enemy and report that back to King Tibarn. Think it over!",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,Yes... Mmm...What to do.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,You...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,King Kilvas. Why have you decided to make the laguz your enemy?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"One of Tibarn's flock, eh? You are his ears, if I'm not mistaken.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,Why did you sell Prince Reyson to a beorc?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,You hawks rescued Reyson didn't you? So everything worked out in the end! What's the problem?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,Would you repeat your words to Prince Reyson himself?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,Reyson is here? HERE?! Why?!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,The beorc leading this army helped him to escape Serenes Forest.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,Helped him? Are you saying a human came to the aid of Reyson? A laguz?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,That is what I say. He also rescued Princess Leanne.,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,Leanne...is alive?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,She was asleep for all these years. The forest protected her. Their voices brought the forest back to life.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Of course, so that's how...",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,"Why don't you try speaking to Prince Reyson? If you do that, perhaps King Tibarn's rage will burn less brightly.",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,You... How dare you show your face to me!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Well, I have been called brazen before. Some have gone so far as to say shameless. Come on, at least let me give you a reason.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,Begone! My ears are closed to you.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Reyson, we're friends, are we not?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,"Oh, yes! Friends! In fact, we're such good friends that you sold me to that foul, bloated man!",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"I didn't really sell you! Besides, I planned on rescuing you right away. You were just impatient and flew away on your own, so--",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,Leanne is alive.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Yes, Tibarn's attendant told me. That's wonderful news. When he sees her face, I'm sure King Lorazieh will begin to feel better at once. Things are really looking up, aren't they, Reyson?",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,"...I suppose that... If you hadn't deceived me and taken me to the forest... We might not have discovered her... So, I will forgive you. Just this once!",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,...What are they?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,Pull your troops from this battle. Now. And never again enter into combat against your fellow laguz.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Oh, come now, Reyson. That's asking too much--",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,"What will you do, then? Will you continue to fight the Crimean army to which I'm in service?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Very well. You win, Reyson. I'll leave and take my soldiers with me. However, I cannot say what the future will bring. I have the fate of my nation to consider after all.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,Hmm... Very well.,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"So, we're friends again? Come to Kilvas for a visit, will you? Nealuchi will be so pleased.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,"I'll do that. When this war is over, Leanne and I will both come.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Oh, and as for Tibarn...",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,I'll speak with him. There's no need for you to worry.,neutral

FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,Eh? What's this supposed to be?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,It's a human trinket. It's called a knight ring.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,Something made by beorc?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Don't make such a disgusted face. I tried it, and it proved to be quite useful.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Reyson,Understood. I'll take it for now.,neutral

FE9,19-Entrusted,Homasa,Kilvas has betrayed us?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Daein Soldier,"I think abandoned would be more accurate, but--",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Homasa,Idiot! It's the same thing! Aaaargh! Accursed sub-humans! We should never have trusted them.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Homasa,My sword is lightning! Do you think you can follow its dance?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Homasa,...The shame...,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Oh ho! Black wings! Among humans these are considered bad omens, are they not? Then take these omens as fact, and let them herald you to the afterlife!",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Raven Laguz,"Are you sure? If we retreat now, what will General Petrine say?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Promises made to humans are worth less than a dead snake. Forget about her. Losing the remainder of our payment stings, but still... You can't buy your life back, can you?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Raven Laguz,"Good point. Well made, sir.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Naesala,"Fly, my darkwings! We return to Kilvas!",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,We won...somehow.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Nasir,It's because you did an excellent job of driving off the ravens.,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Yeah, if we had continued to fight them, we would have suffered more casualties than this. I must extend thanks to Reyson.",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Elincia,What could it be?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Let's go see.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Elincia,This is...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Holy...,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Titania,"Incredible, no? It's gold. All of it.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Daein must be filthy rich! There's so much, it doesn't even seem real. What do we do with it?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Soren,"It's the spoils of war. So naturally, it's ours.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"In that case, I'd like to borrow fifty thousand. Would that be all right?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Titania,That's a lot of money. What are you planning on doing?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,It's a private matter...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Titania,"I apologize, Commander. You're not a child. There's no reason for me to pry.",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"No, if I may borrow the fifty thousand, that will be more than--",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Titania,"You won't borrow it, you'll accept it! And in good faith. The remainder we'll give to Soren for company maintenance. Would that be all right, Princess Elincia?",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Elincia,"Yes, of course.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Petrine,Grrr...,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Daein Soldier,"Um, General P-Petrine? P-please, General! I'm just a...m-messenger! H-however...I have to tell you--",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Petrine,"I already heard, you dunderhead! I hated those filthy crows right from the start. Even so, to be betrayed in such a fashion... Grrr... Someone will pay for this! Oh, you certainly had your way with us, didn't you, King Kilvas? But if you want to make an enemy of Daein, then so be it! Once Gallia's fallen, we'll turn our attention to your puny nation and wipe it off the face of the world!",negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Petrine,"Dog's breath! I need...something. A brilliant plan... If this continues much longer, the king will have my head.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,You wanted to see me?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,You've waited a long time. Take this. It's the gold you were promised.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Finally scraped it together, eh? I'll gladly accept it.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Aren't you going to count it?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,There's no need. I'll trust you.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"All right, then I'll take what was promised. The report you wrote for my father.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,There isn't one.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,What?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,There is no report. Never was.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,You lied to me? You exploited my need to know more about my father!?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"There is something I must tell you. However, it could not be written down. It is too great of a secret for that. Your father told me to wait until I thought you were mature enough to hear it, and then to tell you myself.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Mature? Then what was the fifty thousand gold for?!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Ah, the gold. That was my idea. I thought it would be a good way to test how resourceful and responsible you were.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Get started. I want to hear it all.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"I've spent a long time as Greil's hired shadow. A long time. I remained hidden from sight in case the day ever arrived that I needed to fulfill my contract... All that time, for one job.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,What was it?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"If Greil were ever to go berserk, I was to stop him. I was to take his life.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,What?!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Actually, there was one other thing. If Greil were ever slain by his pursuers... I was to watch over his son and tell him Greil's secret at an appropriate time. That was my job.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Berserk... What are you talking about? Why would you have to kill my father?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,Because of Lehran's Medallion.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,What medallion? What are you talking about?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,The medallion your sister carries.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Huh? That old bronze thing? I thought it was just a keepsake of my mother's... Are you telling me that it's something more?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Greil told me it was an object of great peril, but nothing more. I did some investigating on my own, though. And what I discovered...surprised me.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Tell me.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Lehran was one of the heron clan, an ancestor of our Prince Reyson, who  carried with him a bronze medallion. Long, long ago, a band of heroes defeated an evil god and imprisoned it therein.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"An evil god? Do you think this is funny? You ARE joking, aren't you?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Unfortunately, I'm not. And I've no idea how the cursed thing came to be in Greil's possession. That being said, I do know that the men who hunted your father were actually seeking the medallion. Why they wanted it and what they planned to do with it... Just thinking about it gives me chills.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"I'm finding all of this a little hard to believe. You said the medallion was an object of great peril, didn't you? Then why would my father allowMist to carry it around? That doesn't make any sense.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"It's because she can carry it safely. Actually, she's the only one who can. If you want proof, think back. Have you ever once touched it?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"...No. I haven't. A long time ago, I remember reaching out for it while Mist had it in her hand... My father scolded me harshly. After that, I assumed...it was my sister's alone, and I never reached for it again.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Compared to other people, the balance within your sister is extremely strong. Your mother, it seems, was the same. That's why they could bear it safely. The medallion is like a strong poison. It takes the worst aspects of a person and magnifies them a thousandfold. Greil touched it only once, and it drove him to complete madness.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,So that's what you meant when you said he went berserk?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"That's right. Beorc and laguz are made up of two forces: balance and chaos. In this, there is no difference between us. It is the proportion of balance to chaos that determines how much the medallion affects a person. In that sense, it predicts how much harm that person might do.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Your father was one of the preeminent swordsmen of his generation. That day, after he touched the medallion...Twenty soldiers had come for him. Twenty highly trained killers. Your father barely broke a sweat cutting them down. Then he began attacking his neighbors, those who had taken him in, concealed his identity, and called him friend. He slew them one by one, until your mother rushed in...thinking only to save her husband from himself.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,It was over in an instant. Your mother grabbed the medallion from his hand and stepped away from him...They say she smiled as he pulled his sword from her breast and forgave him as her life's blood spilled into the street.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,My father...killed my mother? No. That can't be...,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"It was the medallion. Its power is too great for any man. Even one of your father's caliber. Me? You? If either of us touched it, I'm certain that we both would have been consumed by madness. When your father regained his senses, he tracked me down. It seems he'd heard rumors of me some time before. He said he had need of someone like me: closemouthed, skilled, and most importantly, willing to do any sort of work. Of course, after hearing what he wanted me to do, I turned him down. Greil was once a famed general... He was Sir Gawain, one of Daein's Four Riders, and I recognized him at once. There was no chance someone like me would ever be able to stop him.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,But you took the job anyway...Why did you change your mind?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Greil had lost his wife, and his grief was overpowering. To keep anything like that from happening again, he crippled himself. He slashed the tendons in his sword hand so that he could not wield a sword again. I took the job only because he had become someone my skill could handle. And even then, he was still far stronger than most men...",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,I... I don't know what to say...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"That is Greil's secret, as I know it. I now entrust to you the responsibility of seeing that the medallion does not fall into the wrong hands. Your sister must keep it.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"...As my father lay dying, he told me to forget everything and live in peace. What did he mean?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"He didn't want you to lose yourself and go hunting for revenge, I suppose. He was killed much, much sooner than he ever expected to be.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"So my father's dying wish was for me to protect the medallion? If I can do that, everything will be all right?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"I believe so. At the very least, that must take precedent over everything else.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,I understand.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Well then, my work here is done.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,Whatever you decide to do now is up to you.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"If I call, can I count on your assistance again?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"If I'm not busy with anything else, I might agree to work for you again. Farewell.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Father...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Oh, one last thing.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,What is it?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"Do you want to hire me? In the event that you go berserk someday? If we make a deal now, you won't have to worry about it anymore. As for payment... I can take it out of the fifty thousand you just gave me. What do you say?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Please.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"That's a wise decision....And in that case, I no longer need to conceal my true identity.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Huh?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Volke,"I'm not really a thief. I'm an assassin. From now on, I'll take on any job you've got, no matter how...dirty.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Father... Mother......Oh, why...",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Mist,Bye. See ya later!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,"Yep. Oh, Mist! Watch your step! It's slippery...",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Mist,Whooooa!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,Mist!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Mist,Ow! I landed right on my butt! Hee hee! This snow's cold!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,Be careful!,negative

FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,...It must be nice to be so cheerful.,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Unknown,Jill!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,...Who's there?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Haar,It's me.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,Captain Haar? B-but...This is an enemy camp!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Haar,I've been trying to track you down ever since you disappeared at Toha. I figured you were off chasing after the Crimeans. I never imagined that you would join up with them.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,"At first, it was just circumstance, but... But now it's different. Now I'm with them because I want to be. Spending time with them--and coming into contact with laguz--has shown me what a fool I've been.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Haar,Laguz? I never thought I would hear that word from someone who once said sub-human with such absolute hatred. Sounds like you've had some good experiences with this happy little band.,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,"I knew that if anyone would understand, it would be you, Captain.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Haar,"So you're forming your own set of values for the first time. That's good. That's very, very good. But what are you planning to do now? If you keep moving forward, you're going to face General Shiharam before long.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,"Causing trouble for my father was never my intent. However...As a member of this army, I will face him with my shoulders straight and my head held high.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Haar,So you're determined to see this through?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,I am!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Haar,"So be it. Then there's nothing left to be said. Farewell. The next time we meet, it will be as enemies. Prepare yourself... And get some rest! You know how important it is.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Jill,...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Mist,"Ike? Can I talk to you? A few minutes ago, a man I've never seen before showed up and spoke to Jill. I wasn't sure what was going on, so I went and found you. W-what should we do? Whatever they're talking about, it sure looks serious!",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Jill trained in the Daein army. Fighting against her countrymen will be tough...No matter how prepared she thinks she is.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Mist,"I don't care what happens! You can't let her fight against her own father! All right, Ike?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Hmmm. It might not be a bad idea to keep her at the base camp...Just while we're in Daein.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"What do you think, guys? Are we going to be able to perform a new special attack?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,"I think we might. I was looking through some old scrolls on fighting techniques, and I found one that looks perfect.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,Awesome! Nice work!,positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Rolf,"What is it?! What is it!? Come on, tell us how it works!",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,"Well, if we want to learn it, there are some things we'll have to do.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Aw, dang! I hope it's not all technical, 'cause I won't be able to keep up. Just summarize it, will you?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,"I can do that. All right, the most important thing is we all have to use the same weapon. So, if all three of us can use a bow, that'll be one problem out of the way.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,A bow? You and I have to use bows?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,"Boyd, are you even listening to me? Yes, we all have to use the same weapon. That's part of the deal.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Crud! Nothing we can do about it, I guess. You better not slow us down, Rolf! You little brat.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Rolf,"Stop calling me a brat! I'm a better archer than you! If anyone slows us down, it'll be you, Boyd!",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,What did you say? I'm gonna--,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,"Knock it off, Boyd! Your skills with a bow aren't as polished as Rolf's. Anyone can see that. Which means that even if Rolf has some natural skill, whoever taught him the fundamentals was an expert archer...",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Yeah, I know, but he just keeps blabbering this nonsense about how he taught himself.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Rolf,I... I did teach myself! I'm a prodigy.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,"Well, judging by your stance and the way you hold the bow, I think we all know the real story.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Rolf,Eeep!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,Huh? What is it? What real story?!,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Rolf,Oscar! No! Shhh!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,"...The story... That Rolf's lucky to have a genius like me for a brother, that's what.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Aw, stop messing around. This is getting stupid.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Rolf,Whew...,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Unknown,What're you guys talking about?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,The three of you have been huddled up here for a while now. What are you scheming?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Shh! Um... Uh... Hi, Ike!",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Oscar,Scheming is such an ugly word! We're just--,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Rolf,"Oh, hey, Ike! We're working on this special man--",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,Yaaaaaaaaa!,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,Gaaa...I forgot something...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,Oooo...gotta go...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Sorry about that, Ike. He's been acting a bit odd these days.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Really? Seems to me that you're the odd one in the bunch.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Um, sure, all right! Do us a favor, though, and make sure the three of us are all in the next battle.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Sure, I guess that's fine. But why?",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Boyd,"Well, it's a surprise. That's all. We'll show you later! I'm sure you'll like it! Come on! We can't be standing around all day. Let's go! Oscar! Rolf!",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Special man? Hmm... Man......Mandolin?...Manicotti?...Manifesto? Oh, who cares?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"Brrr... I'll take on any number of enemies, but this snow is another story! I think my beautiful wings are icing over.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,That sounds like trouble. Are you going to be able to fly?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"...Yes, of course I can fly. These wings aren't for looks, you know? They're made of flesh and blood and feathers. It's not like I'm some animal that has to hibernate when winter rolls in. Sheesh! Can't you beorc tell the difference between comic exaggeration and serious conversation?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Um... Oh, I was supposed to laugh, was I? Sorry about that.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"Oh, my...such sincerity. This is unexpected. It looks like someone taught you manners.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,Er...,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"By the way, I've been meaning to ask...What are our chances for victory?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,We're still at an extreme disadvantage.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"What? That's not the answer I wanted! You gotta do better than that, beorc general! I'm here! If we lose, how am I ever going to show my face in Phoenicis again?",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"We're at a disadvantage, but I don't intend to lose. There's a man in Daein that I need to find...and I will be the last thing that he sees.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,Ha ha! Well said! I wish you could repeat that to today's younger generation. There are some weaklings back home that I don't even want to call hawks. I'd love to stick 'em back in their eggs and start over from scratch.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Hey, you hatch from eggs?! Eh?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Janaff,"I was speaking figuratively. You know? Like...a metaphor? We haven't hatched from eggs for many generations now. Silly beorc... All right, I'm outta here. I gotta warm up the ol' wings before battle, or who knows what might happen.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"I figured that egg thing was a joke, but I had no idea it ever really happened...Bird tribes... Go figure.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Excuse me, do you have a moment?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,...Oh. General Ike. What is it?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,It's nothing really...I just thought I'd say hello.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,That's...considerate.,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Um... Your king is very generous, isn't he? And it's not just Reyson I'm talking about. He left us his two retainers as well.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,...How do we pertain to the king's generosity?,neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,I guess it's because Reyson kept apologizing... I just thought that... Am I misinterpreting something?,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,I...don't know. But I know that the king can survive without our help.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"Is that true? That's pretty amazing. I've been given the title of lord, but I still can't run this army on my own. Titania and Soren handle all the little details, and that's what keeps us from collapsing into chaos.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,Our king...does nothing special. Everyone just does what's needed. There is no chaos.,negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"He's really trusted, isn't he?",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,"That's...natural. In laguz society, the strongest become king. Unlike the beorc, kingship is not tied to blood, so we have no weak kings. I'm sorry... Perhaps that was improper.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"No, I agree with you. Choosing a ruler by strength instead of birth makes much more sense.",negative
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,"When we face Begnion troops, we target the units with weak leadership and eliminate them first. Beorc weapons can be very powerful, but not everyone wields them well. Since beorc also choose generals by bloodlines, their competency is uneven...and that is a weakness of beorc armies. As for you, General Ike, the time to prove yourself is approaching.",neutral
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ike,"It's true. No matter how strong the individuals are, that strength is worthless if they're weak as a unit. An army's power comes from leadership and management... That's good to remember. Thanks.",positive
FE9,19-Entrusted,Ulki,Mmm.,neutral
