FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,"Phew! I've been marching along for what seems forever and a day. But it's not much farther until I reach Nohr. I hope Father is glad to see me. But the closer I get, the more enemies I see. Is trouble everywhere here? I hope I'm able to reach him. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Just need to keep telling myself that. I'm not a child anymore.",joy
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Child,Help! Help me! Please!,fear
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,What's wrong? You look as if devils have been at your back!,surprise

FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,"Invisible enemies? Oh, no! What will you do? I mean, what can I do? I am Ignatius, son of Benny, one of Nohr's most formidable knights. You can have...confidence in me.  All right, you two run past. I'll stand my ground here and fight them off. I swear that I won't let them inside. But summon more help, if you can.",anger

FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Old Woman,"Oh! You! Burly fellow! We need your help! Our village is about to be attacked! Some brave soul is standing guard alone to fight them off. He may be a knight, and he's got the courage of 10 men. But he'll be a goner! And then...our village will be wide open to those fiends.",anger
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,What's that? Who was he?,surprise
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Child,We don't know. He said his name was Ignatius. I think he was scared. But he didn't want to show it.,fear
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"Ignatius, you say?!",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Child,Yes. Said he was son of someone... Flenny? Denny? Penny? Some knight of Nohr.,surprise
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"No doubt. It's him. What's he doing putting himself at risk? He should have run too! I'm coming, Son. Oh, yes, and with the vengeance of ten thousand men!",fear
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,Have no fear! Dad is here!,fear

FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"Ah, of course, Son. Came running as soon as I heard you were in trouble. I'm going to make all their heads roll—far, far away. Where they can't hurt you. Please now. Step back. Dad's going to fix all this.",neutral

FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"Has my little boy grown up? Already? Ignatius, are you sure you want to join your dad on the field of battle?",joy
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,Yes. It would be my honor. Let us defend this village...together.,joy

FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,"What do you mean by that? I'm...not strong. I would have died had you not come to my rescue, Father. I'm a damned shame, standing beside someone as formidable as you.",anger
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"Ignatius, no!",anger
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,"Father, as long as I'm at it, I need to speak my piece.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"Hmm? Please, Son. There's no need.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,"Yes, there is. You've got to let me join your forces. I will never be the man you are unless I get the right kind of training. Or else I'll never be anything but a lily-livered fool.",anger
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"But, Son, you're still so—",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,"I'll help you, Father! I swear I can. You've kept me so well protected in the Deeprealms. But I must learn to give protection. I can't hide behind my father forever!",fear
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Benny,"... Ah, all right. I'll agree, Ignatius. But only to show you what your dad's life as a knight is really like. I am not half as brave as you think. I just have a taste for war.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P17-TwoDefenders,Ignatius,"Thank you, Father. I won't let you down. One day, I will be a great hero like you. I'll work hard. I'll pay attention. I want to be just like you, Father.",joy

FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Takumi,What?! Shiro's missing?,surprise

FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Takumi,We need to find him! I'll alert the others at once.,neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,Thank you. Shiro has no idea what sort of danger he's in here.,fear
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,"Hmm... So THIS is the world that has been kept a secret from me? Pretty dull, if you ask me. Maybe if I can find this Hoshido palace then it'll all make sense. From what I overheard back home, my dad is a bigger deal here than I thought. What's he called again? Big Cheese of Hoshido? Which would make me... I dunno. Little Cheese? I must be some kind of royalty though. I always knew Dad was a major deal. But, royalty?! I still can't believe it.",anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Tarba,"Wait up, fancy britches. What brings you all the way out here?",surprise
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,What? None of your business.,anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Tarba,"You're not welcome here. Now I'll forget that I ever saw you. Long as you hand over your weapons and armor, that is. Refuse, and you won't walk outta here alive.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,You ready for this? I doubt it. Fine then. Take your best shot.,neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"Over there, that's...that's Shiro!",neutral

FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,Dad! Or should I say...Big Cheese of Hoshido?,sadness
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,We can discuss that another time. Leave here now. I'll take care of this.,neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,"Ha, really? When the party's just getting started? Hey, also, you big liar, where are all the monsters you said were here? These guys are just...well, guys. Hardly a match for me.",anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"Don't be a fool, Shiro. I haven't prepared you for a place in my world. That includes knowing how to handle yourself on the battlefield!",anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Tarba,"Hand over whatcha got, and I swear that you'll walk outta here alive. Bah! Who am I kidding? I'm gonna sell all you got, right down to your bones!",anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"Shiro, you have disobeyed me for the last time. And you will show me respect—or I will show you how I deal with utter fools.",anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,How can you call me that?!,anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,I didn't raise you to be this irresponsible.,anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,"Dad, want a reality check? You didn't raise me at all.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"What? I did what I had to. I have the weight of the world on my shoulders, Son. I put you somewhere that was safe from our family's enemies. What was all this anyway? Some sort of adventure? Had you been slain, don't you know that all of Hoshido would grieve you?",surprise
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,Hoshido? Then it's true.,surprise
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,Tell me who told you. Your caretakers were under strict orders of secrecy.,neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,What?! No one. Everyone kept your secret. But you really are...?,surprise
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,That's right. I am the royal head of a kingdom known as Hoshido. A kingdom that you will rule one day. If you survive so long.,neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,How could you keep this secret from me?! Didn't you think I have a right to know?,surprise
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"I'm sorry. I had my reasons initially. And then later... Well, the truth is that you haven't been maturing the role.",sadness
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,"That's not right. If you'd only told me, I would have taken things more seriously. How else was I supposed to turn out, being treated like I'm special for no good reason! This battle has been the only moment of truth in my whole damned life. I don't mean your confession here. I mean seeing all this...death. I can barely stop my hands from shaking. I was trained to fight. Not to kill. You...you should have prepared me for this sort of life.",anger
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"I see... Yes, I suppose I should have. But now that we're here, answer me this. From what you've seen of me today, what do you think your father's power is for?",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,"Huh, your power? To leave the field bloodied with your enemies?",surprise
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,No. Is that really what you saw here? What we ALL achieved here?,surprise
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,No. I guess not. Those guys wanted to bloody the field with us.,neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"Yes. They abused their power. You and I had to stop them. All lives are sacred. Even theirs. And so, taking their lives is a serious decision. But it had to be done, for the sake of OUR way of life. I falls to me, and one day to you, to bear that heavy responsibility.",sadness
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,"Still, you didn't prepare me for this...",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"Shiro, I'll prepare you now, if you're truly ready to join my side. Now that you know who I really am, you can decide to be who YOU really are.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,Are you sure you want me around?,neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"Sure, if you're sure. But remember that I'm more than your father. I'll warn you—speak to anyone in our family, and they'll tell you about me. I'm as strict as they come. Some even say I'm severe. But it's all for Hoshido.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Shiro,"I'll do my best! Er, not that I have a clue what I'm up against.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P07-FatherAndLiege,Ryoma,"We stand together then. Now, I make you this vow, Son. No more secrets. I need to prepare you fully to fill my role...in due time.",neutral
FE14Paralogues,P08-AGreatHunt,Takumi,"Weird. Where's my son gone to? Damn his Deeprealm for being so big. I know I can't expect Kiragi to stay in his village all the time. But I thought at least he'd be out here, hunting or fishing. Somewhere.",anger

FE14Paralogues,P08-AGreatHunt,Takumi,Come on! We go to THEM!,anger
FE14Paralogues,P08-AGreatHunt,Kiragi,"What a day. Those fish pretty much jumped into my bucket! And then this bear - couldn't have been an easier target! Wish I'd bagged him a little closer to town. Too big to lug outta here. Too big to roll home too. Hmm. Gotta be some way... Er, hold on. What's that? Something lumbering around the forest... HELLO? Hmm, nothing. Eh, no way that's a person anyway. Too freaky. Whatever it is, it'll make a great trophy for my wall! All right. Fly straight and true, little arrow buddy. Ready, aim... FIRE!",anger

FE14Paralogues,P14-AfterTheEnd,Subaki,Did what?,surprise
FE14Paralogues,P14-AfterTheEnd,Hayato,"Hmm. There's something I haven't told you about my daughter. She dabbles in the dark arts—the darker, the better. Last time I came here, Rhajat was amusing herself with summoning spells. But she couldn't get them to work.",neutral

FE14Paralogues,P14-AfterTheEnd,Rhajat,"Huh? But I've only just begun. They're a part of our family, Father!",neutral
