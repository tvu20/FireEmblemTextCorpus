FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Soldier,"All troops are at their posts and ready for battle, Lord Murdock.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,Good.,joy
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,Galle. So it begins.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,"Yes, my lord. We are prepared.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,Your squad will be the key to winning this battle. Understood?,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,"Of course, my lord. I will not let you down.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,Yes. We shall show them the power of Bern’s main forces. Still...that general from the Lycia Alliance Army made it this far.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,General Roy?,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,"Yes, him. I wish to see how he fights...by going up against him in person.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Ah, General Roy! I have found you at last.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Bishop Yoder! What brings you all the way from Etruria? Is something wrong?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,I did some research after receiving your letter. I have come to the conclusion that Bern has indeed resurrected the Dark Dragon!,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Is that true!? ...But Hartmut defeated the Dark Dragon in the war. How could Bern have brought it back to life?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Apparently, Hartmut did defeat the Dark Dragon, but he did not finish it off.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,What!?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Instead of killing it, he sealed it away in the mountains of Bern. And the sword he used to seal it was...",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,The Binding Blade?,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Oh, did you know?",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Yes. I have done a little studying myself...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Even if the Dark Dragon has been released, if we can obtain the Binding Blade, then we may be able to seal it again, or even kill it once and for all. That is the Church’s conclusion, and they sent me to ask for your assistance.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Do you know where the Dark Dragon is?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Yes, that is my next point. As the the fire-breathing Dragons can change into human form, is highly possible that the Dark Dragon can as well. In fact, we have a suspect. There is a shaman called the Dark Priestess whom King Zephiel keeps at his side at all times.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,The Dark Priestess...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"We have no solid evidence, but it is true that she appeared at around the same time that the other fire-breathing Dragons started to be seen.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Apparently, the Dragons sealed away their power in gems called Dragon Stones to change into human form so that they could adapt to this environment. In that case, it would not be surprising if the Dark Dragon was in the form of a human woman as well.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,"In any case, we have to go see her to confirm the truth.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,Yes. I shall accompany you.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,You would fight alongside us? That would be most helpful!,joy
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Also, take these. These are the Divine Weapons that the Church found on its own. I have instructions to give them to you.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,"Divine Weapons, too!?",surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"If the Dark Dragon has really been released, this would be the greatest danger mankind has faced since the Scouring!",fear
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Yes. We will face it with all our strength!,anger
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,"All right, let’s go! Crush them all. Leave none alive! Show the enemy the wrath of the Dragon Masters of Bern!",anger
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Saul,"Ah, Bishop Yoder.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"Saul, it is good to see you are well. And thank you. The Church has been saved countless times because you and Dorothy fought alongside Roy.",joy
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Saul,"...If one such as I was to be of any help at all, then I am truly proud.",joy
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,Oh? It seems I have never seen you so...serious.,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Saul,"Bishop Yoder, even I am a priest. I have as much concern for the common good as anybody.",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Yoder,"I see. I am sorry. Then let us fight together, shall we?",sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Zeiss,Sir Galle...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Zeiss. You seem well.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Zeiss,Sir Galle... Must we fight?,fear
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Yes. We must.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Zeiss,I... I don’t want to fight you! You’re the last person...,sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Zeiss! Don’t be a child!,anger
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Zeiss,Huh...!?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Did you have only so much resolve when you left Bern? Is that all the resolve you had when you decided to fight against Bern!?,anger
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Zeiss,"No! My mind is...set... Even now, it hurts to point my blade toward Bern, my homeland... But I believed with my heart that the path I chose wasn’t a mistake...!",sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Then cast away your hesitation! Focus on crushing those who block the path that you have chosen. ...No matter who it is.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Zeiss,Sir Galle...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Zeiss... Were you not a knight of Bern?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Zeiss,...Of course I am!,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,"Good! When we meet next time, neither of us will speak. We will fight!",joy
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Melady,Galle...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Melady...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Melady,Galle... I...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,Don’t speak... You and I are both loyal knights. We both fight for whom we have pledged our loyalty to. That’s all.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Melady,......,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,"Melady... This is probably the end, so let me say this. Melady, I am truly grateful that I was able to meet you. We trained our skills together, and we fought alongside each other. Melady... The days I spent with you... Those were the happiest days of my life.",joy
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Melady,"Me... Mine, too...",sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,"...Goodbye, Melady... I always wish we had met in a more peaceful time.",sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Melady,Galle...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Melady,Wait...! Galle! Don’t go! Gaaaaaaaaaale!,fear
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Galle,I have no regrets… Zeiss… Take care…of Melady…,anger
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,Hm...you made it this far. I congratulate you. But can you defeat me?,anger
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,Gah...! You...are strong... Zephiel... My king... I cannot protect you...any further... Forgive me...!,sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,So! You are General Roy! I have always been looking forward to matching blades with you!,anger
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,"Melady... I don’t want to fight you, but you stand here before me. It seems we have no choice. Come!",fear
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Murdock,"You were one of Narshen’s troops... I heard the story from Galle. I do feel sorry for you, but you are currently an enemy. Come! We fight!",sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Elffin,Master Roy... There is a path leading underground.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Does that mean that the Binding Blade is in there?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Elffin,I don’t know... But I heard from a captive that two things are hidden inside the temple.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,! Does that mean that there’s another Divine Weapon?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Elffin,Possibly... Perhaps we should ask those from our army who are natives of Bern.,fear
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,All right. I’ll check with them.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Elffin,Master Roy. This sword stuck in the altar...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,This must be the Binding Blade.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Merlinus,Let’s see... ...I can’t seem to draw it from the stone.,sadness
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,It’s sealed. You have to use the Fire Emblem.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Merlinus,Use it? How?,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Princess Guinevere said that you just have to stick it into the opening in the handle...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Whoa! What the...,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Merlinus,The blade is glowing!,fear
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Now I should be able to draw it... ...!,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,"...What...is this...? This is the Binding Blade’s... No, Hartmut’s... Memories...?",surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,Who was that? What’s this feeling... It’s very...,surprise
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Merlinus,Master Roy? Are you all right?,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,"Yeah... I’m fine. So this is Hartmut’s sword, the Binding Blade... Am I allowed to use it...?",neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Elffin,It has been said for centuries that the best swords choose their owners. The sword is in your hands now. You were chosen by it.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,But it’s only coincidence that I’m holding it...,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Elffin,What we may think of as being coincidental... Even that might be part of our fate.,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Merlinus,"Anyway, now that we have the Binding Blade, all we need to do is head for the castle. We must hurry!",fear
FE6,21-TheBindingBlade,Roy,...Right! We have to defeat Zephiel!,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,This is the Dragon Temple... The air is strange. Did the Eight Heroes fight under such pressure as well?,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"You would stand before us again, humans?",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,What... Who are you! When did you...,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,I am Jahn. I am the last remaining Dragon of the Dragon Temple.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,The last Dragon? You seem...different from the other Dragons... Are you the Dark Dragon?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"The Dragons which you have been fighting are War Dragons who know nothing but battle. And the Dark Dragon is something completely different from me. I am a pure, full-blooded Dragon that fought you humans in the faraway past.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Different? Wasn’t the Dark Dragon supposed to be the leader of the Dragons?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,The Dark Dragon is an ‘object’ meant to bring hope to us Dragons again. It is no leader.,joy
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,What? Then what is the Dark Dragon?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,It seems you have much to learn.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Tell us! What is the Dark Dragon? We...I have to fully understand my enemy before I fight!,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Well... I have no reason to tell you. And, yet, I have no reason not to tell you. What should I do?",sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,...Very well. I shall test you to see if you are worthy of hearing the truth. I am deep inside the temple. Fend off our attacks and come to me. Then I shall explain everything.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,But you’re right here!,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"What you are seeing is just an illusion. If you wish to know the truth, then come to me. If you prove yourself worthy of my time, then you shall hear it all...",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,You... Are you real this time? Or...,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"This is but the entrace. You have a long way yet to reach me. Still, you seem to be strong enough not to die immediately.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Of course. We’ve gone through many hardships.,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"So I see. Very well, I shall tell you a little about the Dark Dragon. The Dark Dragon is not the leader of the Dragons as you thought. The Dark Dragon was created by us to bring us victory.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Created...? So it wasn’t the Dark Dragon that was making more Dragons...,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"The Dragons you speak of are correctly referred to as War Dragons. As I said before, they are different from pure Dragons such as I. Indeed, the War Dragons are created by the Dark Dragon. And the Dark Dragon was created out of the Divine Dragon, the most powerful of our kind.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Created out of the Divine Dragon? Then the Dark Dragon is actually... The Divine Dragon agreed to become the Dark Dragon?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,Agreed? No. We destroyed its soul so that it would follow our leader’s every command.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,What...!,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,We desperately needed the power of the Divine Dragon. Our entire species was at stake.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,You needed the power of the Divine Dragon... But...why did you have to destroy its soul!?,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Why, you ask. If you want that answer, then seek me out again. I shall witness more of your power...",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Not bad, not bad at all. I wonder how far you will come.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,I want you to go on with your story.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"...No matter how much we fought, you humans just seemed to multiply endlessly. Eventually, we began to lose because of the humans’ sheer numbers. Therefore, we created the Dark Dragon that would create War Dragons.",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,War Dragons... Dragons meant only for battle.,sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"That is correct. However, the Divine Dragons did not agree with us. They said that that would be defying the laws of nature. As we were discussing how we could persuade the Divine Dragons to help us, they suddenly disappeared.",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Why?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Most likely, they left us to prevent us from taking advantage of them. We were never able to find the Divine Dragons, but fortunately, we were able to capture one.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,And that became the Dark Dragon?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Yes. That Divine Dragon, Idunn, became the Dark Dragon. Apparently, she had hestitation in escaping with the rest of the Divine Dragons because she feared that we would go into conflict with each other. Hesitation...such nonsense is only for humans. We Dragons have no need for it.",fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Then that hesitation worked against her...,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"When the Divine Dragons disappeared, she refused to go with them. That was when we were fortunate enough to find her. Idunn was still young, but she had no problems in fulfulling our purposes, except for one... Her heart was not with us. She would not follow our commands.",sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,So you destroyed her heart...,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,Exactly. We destroyed her soul to make her follow our every command.,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,That’s...terrible.,sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"That is enough for now. If you want to know more, then show me more of your power!",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,You have taken another step forward. But the way is still long.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,We shall reach you!,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,You have a stout heart. What do you wish to hear next?,joy
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,You succeeded in creating the Dark Dragon. The Dark Dragon produced War Dragons. Then why did you lose to the humans?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Indeed, the Dark Dragon continued to produce War Dragons to use in the battlefield. We were able to turn the tables on the humans.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"However, the humans soon found out about the Dark Dragon. They concluded that their numbers alone would not be enough to defeat us. Therefore, they put their efforts into constructing powerful weapons that would pierce our scales. They are what you call the Divine Weapons.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,That part is the same as our legends...,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"The most powerful and potent were chosen out of the humans to wield their newly crafted weapons. They came and charged this temple. However, when the immense power of the weapons and our power clashed near Bern, something unexpected happened.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,What happened?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,The laws of nature started to collapse. Snow began to fall in mid summer. Stars shone in the middle of day...,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Is that the Ending Winter? I heard that that happened because you Dragons unleashed too much power into the world...,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,Is that how your legends go?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,The power in the Divine Weapons was then used to restore order to the world. That’s what our legends say.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"So, all the bad things that happened are our fault? I would have expected you humans to think like that. However, the truth is what I said.",surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Then... The Divine Weapons were sealed away so as to not let such a disaster happen again? Then all those traps that protected them were to warn us...,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,You sealed them away? That was a good decision. But they seem to be in your hands right now.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,Do not worry. The weapons do not seem to have as much power as they did in the past. They are unable to bring about such a disaster again.,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,The great disaster hurt us Dragons greatly.,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,How?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,The disaster was originally the reason that we lost to the humans. ..I shall continue when you advance a little further.,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,You have come again. You are doing better than I expected.,joy
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,...Please continue the story.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"When the order of nature collapsed, we Dragons took a fatal blow. The forces of nature weakened, and it became difficult for us to retain our original Dragon form. Therefore, we decided to seal our powers in gemstones and take human form instead.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Those must be the Dragon Stones...,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Yes. We were rendered utterly powerless against the humans. We were just as weak, no, even weaker than the humans in their pathetic form. The humans took advantage of our handicap and started attacking the Dragons that had taken human form.",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Why did you choose the human form?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"In the new order of nature, the human was the form that required the least amount of energy to transform into. The Eight Heroes mercilessly crushed us, helpless in our human form. I, too, suffered a deep wound.",fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Do you have hate for the humans who wounded you?,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Hate? Only humans have such ridiculous emotions. We battled to maintain our species, and we lost. That is all.",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"This time, however, you humans might lose. Some human named Zephiel brought the Dark Dragon to life again.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,! Then Zephiel did break the Dark Dragon’s seal!,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"That is correct. If you want to hear more, then show me your more of your worthiness.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Jahn! I know you’re there.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,Hm... It seems that you did indeed defeat Zephiel... You might make it far enough to be able to fight me.,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,What relation did the Dark Dragon have to Zephiel?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"You know that the founder of Bern is Hartmut, the leader of the Eight Heroes, do you not?",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,I know that.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Then do you know that Hartmut didn’t kill the Dark Dragon, but only sealed it away?",surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,I know. But I still don’t know why he did that.,sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Hm...I see. The Eight Heroes eventually defeated our leader, and they made their way deep into the temple to find the Dark Dragon. However, when they arrived at the Dark Dragon’s chamber, all they saw was a human girl, looking off into space. It was Idunn.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,They didn’t fight?,fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"The Dark Dragon had its soul destroyed to follow our leader’s commands. Since our leader had been killed, there were no further commands to follow.",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Then what happened to the Dark Dragon?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"The Eight Heroes naturally hesitated. They had expected to see the most powerful Dragon, but all they saw was a girl who wouldn’t respond even if spoken to.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"But the Dark Dragon still had to be defeated, so the Eight Heroes prepared for battle. Idunn then must have reacted to their attacks. She changed into the Dark Dragon and fought back, just like the War Dragons who have no heart. Hartmut then used a blade even stronger than the Divine Weapons and slashed at the Dark Dragon’s scales.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,The Binding Blade!,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"I don’t know what you humans call it, but that must be it. Anyway, when that sword cut through the Dark Dragon’s flesh, it suddenly fell unconscious.",sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,It didn’t die?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Yes. Apparently, the sword reacted to its wielder’s feelings and changed its power accordingly.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,"So Hartmut didn’t want to kill it, so the Binding Blade reacted to his emotions and only knocked the Dark Dragon unconscious?",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"I understand that Hartmut did know a little bit about the Dark Dragon. Then, after seeing it as the little girl, Idunn, he must have felt pity. It is another emotion that we Dragons cannot comprehend.",sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Pity...,sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"And thus, at the bottom of his heart, he didn’t want to kill her. In my opinion, I would never leave something that would be a danger to me alive.",fear
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,So Hartmut’s feelings changed the sword’s strength...,sadness
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,Hartmut persuaded his comrades and decided to seal the Dark Dragon. He built a temple deep in the forests of Bern and sealed Idunn away using the sword and a gemstone. They are what you call the Binding Blade and the Fire Emblem. He then created a nation near the temple that would watch over and protect the seal from being broken. That is Bern.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,...How do you know all this? Were you watching?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"No. I had been deeply wounded, so I was leading a hidden life healing myself. I heard the story about the seal from Zephiel. Although, he said that he had read about it in the ancient scrolls kept in the castle library.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,How did you meet Zephiel?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"How did I meet him? Hm... If you reach me, I will tell you. It is not far now.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,You have come far. I am in the chamber right in front of you. It has been long since I last met humans in my true form. I have not left this place ever since the war.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,You... You were always here?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"One thousand years... Having survived the Scouring, I waited, healing my wounds in the process. I waited for the resurrection of the Dark Dragon that would bring hope to us Dragons again. And that time finally came. The Dark Dragon’s seal was broken, and I felt power flowing in my veins again.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,How does the Dark Dragon’s seal being broken make your strength recover?,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"The Dragon Temple’s power depends on the Dark Dragon’s, and thus the Divine Dragons’, life force. If the Dark Dragon were to be sealed, then there is no way I could have recovered to full strength by using the temple’s power.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,I see...,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"After my strength fully recovered, I set out to look for the person who had broken the seal. I used my illusion to search him out and ask his intentions. I did not wish to go outside in my true form, knowing that you humans now ran the world.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,Wait... I thought that Dragons in their human form lost most of their powers. Then how are you creating this illusion?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"This temple is for the Dragons. It is the only place that Dragons can use a little of their power even in human form. I am a fairly powerful Dragon. Even in human form, as long as I stay in here, creating an illusion is easy. Still, I am not able to create actual things like the Dark Dragon can.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,So...you found Zephiel.,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Yes. I found Zephiel and asked him, ‘Why did you break the Dark Dragon’s seal?’ Zephiel was an odd man. He didn’t seem to be the least bit surprised. He looked me right back in the eye and asked who I was. After I told him that I was a Dragon, he started to smile mysteriously. He then said, ‘My intentions are to give the world to your kind.'",surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,......,neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"I cannot say that I fully trusted him, but he was still the Dark Dragon’s new master, so I decided to work with him. Zephiel then ordered the Dark Dragon to lead the world in the place of foolish humans.",anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,But Zephiel is dead. What is the Dark Dragon doing now?,surprise
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,"Although he is gone, the Idunn resides in the chamber behind me. She is waiting for the chance to free the world.",neutral
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,But her master is now gone! Are you her new master?,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Jahn,I did not need to become her master. She was commanded to carry out Zephiel’s orders even if he were to die. Idunn has absolute obedience to her master. She will make sure that you humans are banished from this land.,anger
FE6,24-TheTruthOfTheLegend,Roy,"What? Her soul was destroyed, and now she’s bound to orders given by a person long dead?",anger

The shock was so great that he never completely recovered from it. And today, it seems like he's always in a different world, and he doesn't really pay attention to anything going on around him or in his country. Roartz took advantage of this. Now, he's basically in charge of what goes in the palace. Ever since then, he has kept the Three Etrurian Generals, Lord Douglas, Percival, and me, away from the king unless there's a great emergency.",sadness

FE6,23-TheGhostsOfBern,Roy,What...? I don’t understand.,surprise
FE6,23-TheGhostsOfBern,Elffin,"This is just my estimate, but perhaps it means that the Dragons inside the temple have much greater power than those on the outside.",neutral

FE6,19A-BitterCold,Niime,"Who knows... Popular belief says that the laws of nature were twisted when the Dragons unleashed vast amounts of magical power, but I have no idea about what really happened.

FE6,07-TheRebellionOfOstia,Merlinus,"Ilia is a snowy area with a harsh temperature so the land isn't very arable.

FE6,07-TheRebellionOfOstia,Fir,"They're building a new mine there, and I heard that a lot of people are going there looking for work. They must be strong people if they're miners, so I thought it would be the ideal place to find people to fight for my training. And besides...",neutral

FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Lilina,"That's how the legend goes. They also say that after the war ended, Roland returned to his hometown of Ostia. He raised the Durandal high above his head, and the land that had become barren after the war suddenly became lush with vegetation and life again.",neutral

FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Lilina,Roy! Here it is!,fear
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Roy,So this is the Durandal... It's a very large sword. I don't think many of us are going to be able to swing it.,neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Lilina,But history has it that Roland was a small man. I think it's the person's skill that determines whether he can use it or not.,neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Roy,"Then if I become better with my sword, I can use it as well?",neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Lilina,Well... maybe.,neutral

FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Percival,"I'm not the one to thank. I simply followed my king's orders. You should thank Cecilia, who went against the king to help you.",joy
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Roy,She... disobeyed the king's orders?,anger
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Percival,"Yes, now isn't that something? Well, I must be off. Two of the three Etrurian Generals shouldn't be leaving the country for so long. Cecilia, can you take care of the rest?",sadness

FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Cecilia,No. It's going to be beneficial for Etruria for Ostia to go under our protection.,neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Roy,Beneficial?,neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Cecilia,"Yes. Bern's been acting aggressively these days, as you know. We also want to do something about it, but since we haven't been directly invaded, we have no reason to go to war with them. But if Bern gets any stronger, the balance of powers would be shattered.",neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Roy,"So when Ostia requested protection, you saw it as a good reason to declare war on Bern?",neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Cecilia,Right. We just did what would be best for us. You don't need to feel that you're in our debt.,neutral
FE6,08x-TheBlazingSword,Roy,Yes.,neutral

FE6,14x-TheInfernalElement,Elder,"What is it, Igrene?",surprise
FE6,14x-TheInfernalElement,Igrene,Sophia said that she could detect evil energy coming from Bern’s troops. That may have something to do with the Dragons Master Roy says he saw in Bern’s army.,neutral

FE6,14x-TheInfernalElement,Roy,Energy? What is that?,surprise
FE6,14x-TheInfernalElement,Elder,"Sophia is half Dragon, half human. That gives her the ability to detect the pulses emitted from other Dragons. But because she can’t detect them clearly, she only said that she felt a force...twisted and unnatural.",anger

FE6,21x-TheSilencingDarkness,Roy,I was wondering why there’s always some kind of trap where a Divine Weapon lies.,surprise
FE6,21x-TheSilencingDarkness,Guinevere,...Perhaps it is to warn people that their power is too great to be dealt with lightly.,neutral

FE6,19B-BattleInBulgar,Guinevere,"No... Even then, Zephiel was always trying his best to gain our father’s affection. He excelled in his studies and military training, and he was always trying hard. He grew to become a proud heir to Bern’s throne.",joy

FE6,14-Arcadia,Roy,Energy? What is that?,surprise
