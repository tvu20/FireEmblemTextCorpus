FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,That must be...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Titania,...the Tower of Guidance. It's so bright I can hardly bear to look at it! What's happening in there?,fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Soren,"Let's hurry, Ike. I can't imagine that the glowing is a good omen. We're running out of time.",fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,The city gate is shut. I guess we'll have to force it to get to the tower--,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,???,Ahh! You guys made it!,joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,Skrimir! I didn't realize your group had already arrived.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Skrimir,"Yes, we've been here for quite some time. I've been itching to go inside and see what the bad guys have waiting for us.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Sanaki,"Skrimir listened to reason, however, and agreed to wait here with us. We know nothing about the numbers or strength of the enemy.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Micaiah,It seemed safest to wait here for the rest of you to show up. We pitched tents outside the gate.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,"Hello, Micaiah. Any word from Yune?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Micaiah,She came back to me a number of times during our trip. But nothing for the past few days...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,I see... Do we know where Tibarn and Elincia's group is?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Skrimir,"No word yet, no. Ike, it's a waste for us to just sit around waiting. Why don't you and I have a look inside?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Skrimir,Wait! What's happening?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Naesala,"Get ready for an attack, people!",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,Caineghis? What are you doing here?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Caineghis,"In an occurrence I'm told is increasingly common, we heard a voice in our dreams and followed it here.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,And Lord Tibarn! I should have guessed your group would beat everyone here.,anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Tibarn,We joined up with King Caineghis and mopped up the Disciples of Order around the capital.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Elincia,The only people left within the city are the ones who have been petrified.,fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Good! I like air-breathers with initiative!,joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,Yune! Here to give us our next instructions?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"Yes, good guess! Everyone, gather around. You'll all need to hear this.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"Good job, everyone! All three teams got here, and a little faster than I thought you would. While you were traveling, I went around recruiting more help, including King Caineghis here. Unfortunately, it looks like Ashera had the same idea. By the time I made my way to Goldoa, there was no one there.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,Wh-what do you mean? Where were they?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Tibarn,"If you're saying what I think you're saying, then we could have a very big problem. Lots of very big problems.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"I don't know for sure, Tibarn. There aren't a whole lot of dragons altogether, but... It looks like every one of them joined Ashera.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,How...how could this be?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"I haven't seen them anywhere else on Tellius, so they must already be inside the tower. Let's camp for the night before walking into Ashera's own home.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"...What can I do for you, Goddess Yune?",surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,You're very strange. What are you?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"That's a strange question, especially coming from you. Didn't you create all of us?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"I didn't create anything. Not laguz nor beorc. But I know what they are, because I've watched them change and grow over time. You... You're not something I've seen before.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,I'm the same as the girl you dwell inside.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Ohhh... I thought Micaiah was the only one. She could hear my voice and sing the galdr of release. But I learned that others existed. There's that boy who's always with Ike. Or the little girl who stays by the queen of Crimea.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"There are several in my village, as well. They are my comrades. We all live under the safe fate...and carry the same curse in our blood.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"When you say these words, what do they mean? Why are you cursed?",surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"It means that we carry the blood of both beorc and laguz. Beorc call us Branded, and laguz call us Parentless.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Does that mean your parents are beorc and laguz?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"Not always. It means that laguz and beorc mixed blood somewhere along the line. Beorc and laguz rarely associate in that way. For them to conceive a child together is an even rarer event. What's strange is that the child bears no laguz characteristics. It's just a normal beorc infant. However, the laguz blood lies asleep, waiting, in the child's veins.",sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Oh...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"One day, the laguz blood shows itself, marking the child's body with a brand. How old is that girl, hmm? I don't think she's as young as she looks. The other curse is that we age differently from beorc. It depends on what laguz blood the child has, but it always slows how fast we age.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"Micaiah says that's true. She's listening to every word you say. Please, continue.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"The laguz blood gives the Branded unnatural powers. Beorc fear and distrust us because they can't understand those abilities. The laguz are even worse. They treat us like we're phantoms, refusing to acknowledge us, as if we don't exist.",fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,I see...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"It's easy to hide among beorcs. You just cover the brand, avoid getting close to anyone, and never settle down. Pretending you're normal. The laguz are different. They can sense what we are... They have an instinct for it. Not all laguz know for sure, but the sharp ones figure it out instantly. Others just feel uneasy around us. Some never figure it out, but they're surrounded by ones who do. Either way, the laguz would never talk to us voluntarily. Why would you pay attention to someone who doesn't even exist?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Why? That doesn't make any sense. How did things get like that?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,I would like to know that as well. It's said that a union between laguz and beorc is a crime against the goddess. That's what we've always been told.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,That's silly. I've never heard anything of the sort.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,...Heh... Heheh... Hahahahaha...!,joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Why are you laughing?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Stefan,"It's all been a lie! For hundreds of years, we've faced persecution, abuse, and isolation. And for what? A lie! What's not to laugh about, huh? Hahaha...",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,What's happened? This is all wrong... How did history get so distorted? Was it at a particular place and time? I don't understand. I've been asleep for too long...,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,Almedha! You're safe!,joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,Kurthnaga...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,"Al, what's wrong? You're so pale, and you've grown so thin...",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,"Oh, Pelleas... My little Pelleas... Why? Tell me why?",surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,"Almedha! Almedha, you have to pull yourself together!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,???,Prince Kurth? Are you there?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,"I'm busy, Ena! Stay where you are.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,Oh!,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,"...Ena. It's been a long time. I felt your presence nearby, but you never came to see me...",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,Lady Almedha...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,I understand that you don't want to see me. I'm sure you hate me for what I've done. My brother Rajaion... Your betrothed... He died because of me.,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,Don't. It's not important. That's all in the past...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,"...What? How can you pretend like nothing happened!? You can't! I know you hate me! You have to hate me! Go ahead, blame me for what happened! Insult me! Do anything, but you have to hate me!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,"...I don't hate you, Almedha. Rajaion made his decision. He gave his life to save you and his little nephew. Did you know that? He decided to sacrifice himself to protect you. I can't blame you for what Rajaion decided to do. That would mean insulting my beloved for his sacrifice... For his nobility.",sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,Sniff... Sniff... Sniff...,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,"Prince Kurth, my grandfather is here to see you. The king knows nothing of this visit.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,Nasir is here?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"Prince Kurthnaga. I am glad to see that you are safe. And Lady Almedha, as well. It has been a long time. We haven't seen each other in over ninety years, I believe.",joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,Nasir.... You returned to Goldoa?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,Yes.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,"Nasir, I need to know something. Why has Goldoa sided with Goddess Ashera!? What is Father thinking? The laguz and beorc have joined together to save the petrified. Why hasn't Goldoa joined the effort?",surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,As you wish. Lady Almedha... Are you aware of the fact that everything that's happening is due to your decision to leave Goldoa?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,...What?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,"Explain, Nasir.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"King Dheginsea forbade the dragon tribe to use our transformation for the purpose of war. Almedha, you left because you did not agree with this policy, did you not?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,That's right.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"Shortly after you left Goldoa, you met Ashnard in Daein and were united with him. However, your union begat a chain of tragedies. Did you know that the red dragon platoon which went in search of you was captured and turned into Feral Ones by King Ashnard?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,I-I had no idea.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"Ashnard needed Goldoa to get involved in his war. That's why he did everything in his power to provoke King Dheginsea. Most of you have never fought in a war, but even more than other laguz, the dragon tribe loses control once they taste battle.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,Oh...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"Near the end of the war, we found out that Prince Rajaion could not be saved. I thought the king would surely go on a rampage. At the time, we had no idea that Lady Almedha was still alive. The king thought he'd lost not only dragon soldiers but also his children.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"If the war had ended any later... Had Ike not killed Ashnard... Goldoa would have joined the war. And we would have started killing. We would have destroyed the Daein army, it's coconspirators, everyone. We would not have stopped until the continent was ashes. Then the spirit of chaos would have spread across Tellius, awakening the goddess and destroying the dragon tribe. That was the danger we faced in the Mad King's War.",fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,But Ashnard was defeated. And Rajaion regained his sanity thanks to the songs of the heron clan.,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,...Sniff. Bwuah... Sniff...,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"We escaped annihilation once. We took Prince Rajaion's body back to Goldoa. And the king did not shed a tear, nor fly into a rage. He endured his loss by himself. He endured for the sake of his last child, and for the sake of his people. Goldoa remained neutral.",sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,Father...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"But now... All that effort has been wasted. The war between the Laguz Alliance and Begnion has spread through Daein and Crimea. And to top it all off, Goldoa can no longer stay neutral because of what Prince Kurthnaga has done!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,You're saying this is my fault...!? That I've started a war that my father tried to avoid?,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,"No, Kurthnaga! This was my fault. You fought because of me.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,"This was not Prince Kurth's fault! Besides, the goddess Yune was not awakened by chaos sweeping across Tellius. She was awakened by the galdr of release!",fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,By a galdr!? Are you certain?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,Yes. That was what Sir Ike said.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"That's...very strange. Nevertheless, the end result remains the same. Goddess Ashera has rendered her judgment. The laguz and beorc must follow her decision.",fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,What...!? Nasir!,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"I've come here as a favor to the king. Prince Kurthnaga, you have to return to us. At once.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,"If we just accept Ashera's judgment, we'll all be turned to stone! That's the end of history as we know it! Do you expect me to just lie down and accept that? How can I? What you're asking is insanity! I won't do it.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"And you, Ena?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,I feel the same as Prince Kurth.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Nasir,"Then I have nothing more to say to you. However, I hope to avoid fighting my own people if at all possible.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ena,Nasir...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Almedha,"...What will you do on the battlefield, Kurth? Will you face your father as an enemy?",surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Kurthnaga,...I will do whatever I have to.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"Oh, no!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,"Yune, what is it? What's happening?",surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Caineghis,This isn't good...,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,These soldiers... We've killed them already. They've been reborn in flesh but not spirit.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Sanaki,Brought back from the dead...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Elincia,A miracle of the goddess...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Caineghis,"A blasphemy, you mean! How could the goddess of order violate the most fundamental natural law?",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,"Philosophy later, everyone! They're about to attack!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,"Are you all right? Those dead soldiers really got to you, didn't they?",surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"...We can't win. All we do is kill the flesh, but she brings the flesh back... We need more time... No, there is no more time! Everyone else will be turned to stone...and I will be lonely forever. There's nothing more that I can do! I've failed... I've failed.",sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,Yune! Get a hold of yourself!,anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Ouch! My ears!,anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Wh-what was that for? You big bully! Who do you think I am?!,anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,"Yune, the goddess of chaos... The warmhearted being whose courage and love gives us the will to go on.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Ike... Thank you.,joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,"As things stand, we can't bring everyone into the tower. We'll need support here to hold this position. But at the very least, how many are we going to need inside?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"They'll have much stronger forces inside the tower...not to mention Ashera herself. We'll send in our best 11. Oh, and we'll want the two dragons! ...And one from the heron tribe... And...uh...the empress. Plus, it wouldn't hurt to have Sothe.",fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,"Understood. If that's everyone, I'll gather them together.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"...And once we get inside, you can leave most of the fighting to Micaiah.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Something like this should work.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,We're ready.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"All right, everyone's almost ready. Who would you like to bring from the heron tribe?",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,Rafiel... Would you join us?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Rafiel,Of course. I am honored.,joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,Reyson... Would you join us?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Reyson,Gladly. I'll give you everything I've got.,joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,Leanne... Would you join us?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Leanne, I...I do...best fighting!,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"All right, Tower of Guidance, here we come!",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,It's...so quiet. Is the goddess here?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"Uh-huh. She's at the top. Be careful, everyone. This tower is Ashera's home territory. She's certain to have her most powerful troops waiting for us up ahead. We must proceed with the utmost caution.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,Hm?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,"So, you were companion to the very first empress, Altina. I am honored that you have chosen to speak with me.",joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,You would trust in the word of a stranger?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,Yes. I can see inside you. I know you cannot speak lies.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,Is it possible? Do you share some aspect of my power?,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,"I do, as did my mother... Generation after generation, each apostle has been blessed to hear the voice of the goddess. We know of impending disasters, how crops will fare.... All revelations originally intended for you.",sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,The children of my union with Altina... I had no idea...,sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,Please look at this.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,That mark...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,"All of the apostles have born this brand. It is our greatest secret. The senators must never know. Because of this brand, I thought that I had been born of some great sin. It plagued me always. Guilt tore at me every day as I hid my mark from my people, deceiving them constantly about my true nature.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,"Oh, child...how can I apologize to you?",sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,"And yet, now that I've met you, I understand. There is no shame in my heritage. None at all. I will not live in hiding. I will reveal to the world that I am one of the Branded. They must see there is no shame in who I am.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,No! You mustn't! You don't understand the danger you will be placing yourself in!,fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,"Oh, but I do. The senators will do their utmost to rally the people against me, as they did when I freed the laguz from slavery. But I will not be deterred. If I am to lead this nation, I cannot allow it to be corrupted by prejudice and hatred. I can put the life the goddess has given me to no greater good than this.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,...Such determination. Your eyes... They very much resemble Altina's.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,I will stand before my people and proudly proclaim the truth. And then I will guide them to a just and honest future. This is my promise to you.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Male Voice,"Thank you. Your strength of will, the truth that guides your life... You have shown me the way back to myself. I shall return to Goldoa and tell my friends of you and your actions. I will tell them that laguz and beorc may once again live together in peace. I will tell them that there is hope.",joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Female Voice,"Thank you, father of my mothers. I strive to be worthy of the gift of live you have granted me.",joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,...What was that? Someone's... Was it someone's memory?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Ike,What is it?,surprise
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,"Sorry? Oh, I... Don't worry. It was nothing. All right, then... Our path leads through that door there.",sadness
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Yune,...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"Well, well... ""Apostle"" Sanaki. What a surprise seeing you here. Frankly, I'm amazed that you, of all people, would dare to set foot inside the most holy Tower of Guidance.",joy
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Micaiah,"Lekain... We've been looking for you for a long time. You bound Daein to your awful pact, hounded noble King Pelleas, and stole countless lives in your appalling war. You are...beyond redemption!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"Beyond redemption? My, that does sound awful. Whatever will you do with me? Oh, and let me remind you, the blood pact is still in effect. You would do well to remember that. I think you know what will happen to the people of Daein if you should dare oppose me.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Micaiah,"Enough. We fear your threats no longer. No more will we bow to your every whim. Now that we've found you, we will exact justice upon you, then destroy the blood pact itself, ending its power over us!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"So you figured it out, did you? Heh, heh... It matters not. This changes nothing, do you hear me? Here is the scroll for which you've been searching so diligently. Right here in my hands.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Micaiah,Ah!,fear
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"And yet, none of you will ever lay one grimy little finger upon it. I have been blessed by the goddess herself. Her protection will not allow you fleas to even approach me!",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Sanaki,Lekain! Cease this travesty of virtue at once!,anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"What have we here? Oh yes, the apostle. Excuse me, child, but I had completely forgotten you were here. Since you've deigned to grace us with your exalted presence, dear apostle, let me share a bedtime story with you.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"The year was 640, Begnion era... The empire had been without an apostle for 15 long years. The senators were being constantly harassed with complaints from the people. There had been nothing like it in history. The voices calling for young Sanaki to be crowned grew louder every day... You had just turned five years old when the senate welcomed you to the throne as the new apostle. Ah, but my young mistress Sanaki, what a difficult child you were. You threw tantrums, you screamed and cried constantly. Your conduct was hardly befitting an empress of Begnion! Everyone was at a loss... You wouldn't even stop mewling and crying during official proceedings. But then along came our youngest senator ever, Sephiran, Duke of Persis. When he took you in his arms, you immediately stopped crying. You even smiled. We had to take advantage of this obvious miracle. In an unprecedented move by the senators, we elevated Sephiran to prime minister, keeping him serving as close to you as possible. This plan, radical as it was, proved far more effective than we dared dream. A young, handsome prime minister and an adorable moppet of an apostle brought the people's support to incredible new heights. Apparently the common citizenry is gullible enough to blindly follow any leader who is sufficiently attractive. Enamored as they were, no one ever seemed to care whether or not you could hear the voice of the goddess. With the new apostle and prime minister, the political landscape became unrecognizable. Even in the face of overtly unreasonable legislation, the two of you would stand on the balcony... A smile and a wave later, the people would cheer and go on with their happy lives.",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Sanaki,...,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"It was too good to be true, however. Both of you were only meant to be puppets! Each year you interfered with our government more and more, imposing your soft-hearted ideals over our sovereign rights. Were such trivialities as laguz slavery and the Daein occupation worth making issues of? The pair of you were becoming an increasingly bothersome thorn in our side. And then this war against the laguz forces... You went so far as to expose our previous indiscretions and demand reparations for the sub-humans. This was unforgivable. Clearly you both had to be removed. Sephiran would be falsely accused and jailed, necessitating his removal from office. The apostle would suffer a sudden illness, and be excused from official proceedings. Or so we intended...",anger
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"And somehow, despite the extraordinary plans of great me, here you are standing before my very eyes.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Sanaki,If Sephiran and I hadn't been freed... You were just waiting for your chance to kill us? Just as you killed my grandmother.,neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Lekain,"Out of respect for the imminently deceased, I'll be completely honest. Yes, you assume correctly. Your assassination, and the plot to once again frame the Serenes herons for it, was entirely my idea.",neutral
FE10,4:11-Rebirth1,Sanaki,Yes... I thought as much.,neutral

FE10,1:7-AGatheringHope,Sothe,"They are my personal acquaintances from Begnion. And yeah, they can handle themselves in a fight. But if any more laguz join us, there will be problems. We've managed to hide Volug and his true nature, but...with more laguz, it will surely get out.",neutral

FE10,1:7-AGatheringHope,Sothe,"I began to doubt that the apostle--Begnion's empress--actually knew what was happening in Daein. At only thirteen, the apostle may be young, but she's proud and upstanding. She'd never let these kinds of things happen to Daein. So, I asked Tormod to fill her in on what was really happening here.",sadness
FE10,1:7-AGatheringHope,Tormod,"This is what we learned... The apostle had noticed something shady about Daein. She was investigating on her own. She traced the ones pulling the strings to a certain faction of senators. Now, she's snapping mad, but without proof, she can't publicly move against them.",anger

FE10,1:4-ADistantVoice,Sothe,"What do you think it would be like, to change into a bird or a dragon, as the laguz can? Being part beast is one thing, but being able to transform into that beast, with more strength than we could ever imagine... I mean, they could build a place like this before breakfast.",neutral
FE10,1:4-ADistantVoice,Micaiah,"I suppose that's true... But what surprises me most is not that these could be laguz ruins, but you, Sothe. You've changed, haven't you?",surprise

FE10,1:4-ADistantVoice,Sothe,"Well, come on. Beorc are called the ""Children of Wisdom""--and the laguz the ""Children of Strength""--for a reason. But I know now that just because our two races differ, that doesn't mean one is better than the other. The age-old beorc bias against laguz is based on sheer ignorance. When I met Ike during the war three years ago...and fought beneath him...he made me realize this.",anger

FE10,1:4-ADistantVoice,Micaiah,"Sothe, sometimes, every other thing you say is like an ode to Ike. I know you fought beside him. I know you owe him your life. And I know you want to be just like him... But to the people of Daein, he's the man who crushed us three years ago. Some would even call him our archenemy. If we hadn't lost the war to that man, Daein wouldn't be in the mess it's in now. You know that.",sadness

People are worried that Daein'll start another war like the one three years ago, and they're taking it out on you.

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,How's Tibarn?,surprise
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,"He's resting inside that tent over there. Ike, did you see them? Did you see his wings?",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"Yeah. They were covered in blood. He's not hurt, so it must be someone else's...",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,I have this awful feeling... A feeling that something terrible has happened. I really hope I'm wrong...,sadness

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"Janaff, Ulki, what's going on? What happened to you out there?",surprise
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,Naesala and the ravens of Kilvas betrayed us? Again?,anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Janaff,I'm so mad I can barely see straight! The ravens were informants. They told Begnion our battle strategy.,anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ulki,"It was a trap. The supply unit we raided turned out to be the Central Army itself. The troops were under the command of Begnion's most famous general, Zelgius.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,General Zelgius? This just got a lot worse...,sadness
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,You've heard of him?,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"I met him during the Mad King's War. He's powerful, experienced, and clever. One of the best generals of our time.",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Janaff,"Yeah. For a beorc, he was quite powerful all right. Tibarn, while shifted, mind you, attacked this Zelgius guy. Zelgius didn't even budge an inch. But all of a sudden he stopped fighting and said, ""We've delayed you long enough. If you cherish the lives of your people, return home at once.""",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,He said that?,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ulki,"So the king made a decision. We flew night and day and reached Phoenicis, but...it was too late. Save for the elderly, women, and children, they were all...",sadness
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Reyson,"I also heard what happened, and... I just couldn't believe it. Naesala has betrayed us once again. I cannot believe he'd play a role in wiping out Phoenicis...",sadness

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Reyson,Huh?,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Reyson,Tibarn!,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Tibarn,"I'm alive and well. My people are few, but they still live. Phoenicis is still a country. Janaff. Ulki. You know what we must do.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Janaff,Of course!,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ulki,Yes. Begnion and Kilvas will burn for this.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Tibarn,"...So, that's the whole story. Sorry we were late, but now we're here to stay and see this war out. Don't tell me you kittens are going to run off with your tails between your legs. I won't accept that.",sadness
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,"Of course not, King Tibarn! I'll get Skrimir right now. A slight delay, but now that we've merged with the hawk tribe, we have the strength to fight.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Soren,"Our goal is to cross the Ribahn. The core of our forces will ford the river and attack the Central Army head-on. Ranulf, you'll need to form a small unit of your best warriors and lead them behind enemy lines, undetected. Can you do it?",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,No sweat. We'll do some officer hunting and keep their leaders' attention on us.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Soren,Good. But a distraction alone will not get us across the river. They've got the terrain and Zelgius in their favor.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Skrimir,"Bah! Use fewer words, tiny beorc! Tell us what we must do! Some of us have a battle to fight!",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Soren,"Don't interrupt me again, Skrimir. All these words may be the only thing that can possibly win this battle. As I was saying, while Ranulf and his men sow confusion in the rear ranks, a group of hawk laguz will carry the Greil Mercenaries south, around the battlefield. We'll cross the river and make our way to the supply train, which also serves as the senators' camp.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Tibarn,"Ahhh, I see what you're doing. You're going to involve the senators and have them start messing things up.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Soren,"Precisely. Zelgius is the military commander, but the senators have authority over him. If attacked, they will panic and request aid. He will be forced to return and rescue them. Zelgius is a soldier through and through. He will not disobey an order, no matter how foolish it might be. Once he leaves, their front line will crumble. That's when you advance. Tibarn and Skrimir will lead the charge. That's all. Is everyone clear on what they have to do?",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Skrimir,"Hmph. I still dislike beorc tactics. I'd rather face my enemy and give him my name before I snap his neck in my jaws. But in order to defeat cowards, we must use the weapons of cowards. Let's go.",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Levail,General Zelgius! The men are in position.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius,Good work. Hm... It's becoming foggy.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Levail,"It looks like the hawk tribe has joined with the main force, but I'm sure this fog will hinder them.",fear
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius,I wouldn't be too sure about that. The fog might actually be a boon to them. We'll wait and see what move they make.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Begnion,General! We hear splashing. The Laguz Alliance is on the move!,fear

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Skrimir,Then it's time to fight. You should go.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,"Don't remind me. I hate flying. Anyway, give the word, will you?",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Skrimir, No need. Our friends heard every word.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Tibarn,"Ah. Finally it's time. I've had enough of sitting around. To wing, brothers! Keep up with me if you can!",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Begnion,My lord?,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius, It's nothing. I'm needed elsewhere. Keep them engaged until I return.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Begnion," Yes, sir.",neutral

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius, Of course. Interesting maneuver.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,Will you draw your blade?,neutral

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius,We shall see. I shall accept your challenge.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius,At your ready.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Senator,What is all that noise? And at this hour!,surprise
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Veyona,"A battle has begun on the other side of the woods, near the river.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Senator,"Then tell Zelgius to wipe out the sub-humans quickly and quiet down! I cannot sleep with all this racket. Don't you peasants know I need my beauty sleep?! I should have you all flogged, you inconsiderate fools!",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Veyona,Wretched snob...,anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"We're in. Soren, let's go over the plan one more time.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Soren,"Our objective is to destroy the enemy supplies. The senators store their food and personal effects in crates. If we burn those crates, the senators will likely pull their troops back to protect their own hides.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"So, while the laguz distract the enemy, we force the gate open, storm inside, and burn all the supplies.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Soren,Exactly.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Titania,We can also set their horses loose. That should add to the confusion.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Soren,"Agreed. Also, please try not to hurt the senators themselves. Harming them might cause us trouble later on, especially once the fighting is over.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,All right. We've got to finish before the fog burns off. Let's get this done. Attack!,anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Begnion,Enemies in the camp! We're under attack!,anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Veyona,"How interesting! I never expected them to attack this particular camp. While the senators may deserve to get kicked around a little bit, I cannot let my general down. I shall protect this camp with all my power.  Soldiers of Begnion! Wipe out the bandits! Kill every last one of them!",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Begnion,"You're with the Laguz Alliance? W-wait! Please! I don't want to die for those useless, decrepit old senators! I'm getting out of here. You can take whatever you want from this stash. Thanks!",fear
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Lass,"What? Um...yes, I was ordered to keep the lord's valuables neat and tidy. But the lord, he ran away, and, well... What, this? He told me it was very precious. Here, you take it.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Senator,Aaaaahhh!  P-please! I beg of you! Spare me! Mercy!,fear
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Veyona,"Protect the supplies, men! If anything is ruined, the senators will have our hides! We cannot let this camp fall into chaos! For the honor of General Zelgius, protect the stores!",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Veyona,"The laguz assault was a decoy, and your real objective was this camp? You're more clever than I expected. This isn't the strategy of laguz. It must have been planned by beorc.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"Our objective is only to burn these supplies. Step aside, and I'll spare your life.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Veyona,"You know I can't do that. Our masters may be fools, but we are their soldiers nonetheless. Our duty is to carry out orders from our masters.",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,I thought you'd say that. But I have a duty as well.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Veyona,Protect the supplies... Stay...calm...,neutral

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius,The king of Phoenicis! Why did you transform? Do you not wish to fight me?,anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Tibarn,"Oh, I wish to fight you, all right. Unfortunately, I don't really have the time. So, I'll let you go this time.",sadness
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius,What do you mean?,surprise
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Begnion,General Zelgius! You must return at once! Our supply camp is in flames! We need you to take control of the situation!,anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Zelgius,What?!,surprise

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"Well, I do pay him plenty for them.",neutral

FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Tibarn,We can handle it. We can do anything if it involves teaching those vermin in Begnion a thing or two.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,"Soren has even answered some of Skrimir’s more insane requests. He doesn’t listen to a word I say, but when Soren talks strategy, he’s all ears.",anger
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,Is that why he hasn’t been complaining during the briefings?,surprise
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,He says he looks forward to what the little strategist will say next. It looks to me like Soren’s charmed his way into the most powerful position in this army.,neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Titania,"I’m glad to hear it. He’s changed, hasn’t he?",joy
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ranulf,"Yeah, I think so. He still doesn’t say much, but he’s a lot more at ease these days. He used to be completely closed off, rejecting anyone who tried to get close. Like he’d lock himself away, all alone in his own little world.",neutral
FE10,3:3-RiverCrossing,Ike,"We all lost and gained something during the Mad King’s War. Maybe it wasn’t a complete waste, after all.",anger

This spurred the laguz to strike against Begnion. That's why I came looking for you, Ike. We need your help.",fear
FE10,3:0-TheGreatAdvance,Ranulf,Flaguerre is close now. It's a fortress city near the Begnion border. We'll storm the city at night and hit them fast enough that the troops inside the fortress won't have time to take their positions.,neutral

FE10,3:0-TheGreatAdvance,Ike,What's our role in this?,surprise
FE10,3:0-TheGreatAdvance,Ranulf,I want the Greil Mercenaries to act as a guerrilla force. Take out their fire mages and ballistae. They're really bad news for us laguz.,neutral

FE10,3:0-TheGreatAdvance,Titania,Don't say things like that. I hear that King Caineghis of Gallia was not so different when he was young. So try not to judge so quickly.,neutral

FE10,3:0-TheGreatAdvance,Ranulf,"Hello, all. Sorry to interrupt. Lady Titania, Soren, you're both very perceptive. I'd expect nothing less from the deputy commander and the strategist of the Greil Mercenaries. You don't have to worry, though. The whole situation is under control.",sadness

FE10,3:0-TheGreatAdvance,Ranulf,What about the Black Knight? Are you going to abandon your search?,surprise

FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,A dream?,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Tormod,"Yeah. Shortly after that light turned everyone to stone, I had a really strange dream. I don't remember it very well, but it was like there was a voice in my head, whispering encouragement. When I woke up, I knew what I had to do. I knew that everyone who hadn't been petrified was heading to the Tower of Guidance, and from there we'd all be saved.",sadness
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Muarim,"I had the same dream. I thought this must be a divine revelation, so we left the desert to make for the tower.",fear
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,Sounds like more of Yune's handiwork.,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,Agreed. This is her way of gathering able bodies. I suppose a goddess of chaos will do things her own way...,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Tormod,Yune? Isn't that the dark goddess I keep hearing about? Should I even be listening to her?,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"I can't really put it into words, but I can feel it inside. Listening to her is the right thing to do. I guess it's a lot like the dream you described.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,We laguz are pretty intuitive. I feel it in my blood that Yune is the goddess of our ancestors.,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Tormod,All right. That makes it a little easier to come to grips with.,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,Are you feeling any better?,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"Yes, much. Sorry if I worried you. That was quite a shock.",sadness
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,No problem... Can we talk about it? I'd like to know about you and that man...,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"Yes, Hetzel... It was some time ago now, a little while before the Serenes Massacre...",surprise
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"I was alone outside of the forest. There, I was found and captured by beorc slave traders. The slavers sold me at auction, and the winner was Lord Hetzel. I didn't know until later, but the bidding for me among the senators was extremely competitive. Lord Hetzel actually spent much of his fortune on my purchase.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"After he took me home, I fell deathly ill, mostly just from desperation. Lord Hetzel was deeply moved by my plight... He brought me to a temple and spent many days nursing me back to health. I have no doubt that he saved my life, but my wings never fully recovered. I haven't been able to fly since. Lord Hetzel felt terrible... Do you know what he told me? He said, ""Once you fully recover, you can return to the forest."" Members of the heron clan, we can look inside people's hearts. I knew the truth of what Lord Hetzel said... He was being absolutely honest. I knew I could trust him from that moment on.",sadness
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"Then... The Serenes Massacre. I didn't need to be told. I would have felt the suffering of that many of my brethren from anywhere in the world. Lord Hetzel never said anything, but I knew that the senators had murdered the apostle and blamed my clan. Because of the monstrous ambition of a handful of evil men, my entire race was burned to ash.",sadness
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,Rafiel...,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"Late that night, I returned to the temple. Something happened to me there... Some sort of force took hold of me... The next thing I knew... I was lying in the sand. If Queen Nailah hadn't come, I would have died right there. I didn't even realize how far I was from my dear home.",sadness
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,So Duke Hetzel is both your savior and your enemy.,joy
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"Hetzel was not directly involved, nor did he give orders to those who were. Something about him still troubles me, though... Whenever I think of him, I feel chaos boiling up from his heart. ...I sense it in myself, as well. I have the same feelings welling up in me. I suppose that's why I can accept it in him.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"Your people, the remaining heron tribe... They've also changed. King Tibarn has said many times that Reyson and Leanne are far from typical herons.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,"Yes, I was surprised when we met again. They're both so strong...and vitality seems to shine forth from within them.",surprise
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"It makes you wonder if chaos is really all bad, doesn't it?",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Rafiel,I am starting to think that what the world needs is a balance between order and chaos. What do you think?,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,I don't know. I think there are some things we're not meant to understand.,neutral

FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"No, that’s fine. I would have been confused either way. I didn’t know you could speak the ancient language.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,It’s Hatari’s common language. I would never have known about the Tellius language if I hadn’t met Rafiel.,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,The Tellius language?,neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,"You don’t know? The language we are using right now is called the Tellius language. You call it modern speech, I suppose.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"Oh, I see.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,"Long ago, beorc created the Old Tongue. The ancient speech is what we laguz call it. The language was too difficult for the laguz to master. So the language of Tellius was created in its place.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"Huh. I’ve never heard that before. The only people I’m aware of who know the ancient speech are the heron laguz. I think Nasir of Goldoa said he could read it. Among beorc, only mages know how to use it, and that’s only for spells.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,"Well, the laguz who live a long time, such as dragons and herons, have all the time in the world to learn it. Beorc probably left the ancient speech behind in favor of a newer and improved language, with the exception of spells.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"That makes sense, I suppose. Mordecai once told me that speech lets you avoid fighting when it’s not a good idea. He said that’s why it’s a good idea to know many languages.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,"Did he, now? Volug, did you hear that? You can learn the language of Tellius with Mordecai.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Volug,...I will... I...will try.,sadness
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Nailah,"He understands what you’re saying, for the most part. It’s the speaking that’s the hard part for him.",anger
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"You don’t need to feel obligated. I mean, it isn’t like I can understand ancient speech.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Volug,"(Here, I want you to have this.) Um, here... Take.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,"Oh, I understand. Thanks.",neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Volug,(It’s about time!),neutral
FE10,4:4-Revelations,Ike,I think I understood that. You were happy that I understood what you just said.,joy

The dragon tribes are neutral, and known for their hatred of blood and war. As their prince, I can't see why you would do it.",neutral
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Kurthnaga,"I suppose I owe you an explanation for that. First of all, the dragon tribes had nothing to do with any of this. I... I disobeyed my father, and the laws of Goldoa. I joined the battle against all my training, of my own free will. Ena just saw me leaving, or I wouldn't have brought her into this. I just wanted... I just wanted to help my sister.",neutral

FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Kurthnaga,"My sister was tangled in Ashnard's schemes, our brother was killed, and her son taken away... She was unable to return to Goldoa and unable to consult our father... My sister has suffered so much. I wanted to help her.",anger
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Ike,So that's why you came to Daein... I'm sure that was difficult for you to tell me. Thank you.,sadness

FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Rafiel,Why do you say that?,surprise
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Ike,"You look a lot like your brother Reyson, but you’re nothing like him. Reyson looks delicate, but on the inside he’s all iron. You, on the other hand... I don’t know. I worry that I might kill you if I shout too loud or something.",neutral
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Rafiel,...I’m sorry.,sadness

FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Ike,There you go again! What I mean is that--,surprise
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Nailah,"That’s enough, Ike. Rafiel is everything that herons are expected to be: quiet, elegant, and delicate. Those are words people use to describe herons, and he fits all three.",neutral
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Ike,"Yeah, well... None of those words fit Reyson.",neutral
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Nailah,True. Maybe Princess Leanne is only so innocent and sweet because she was asleep for twenty years. Prince Reyson certainly doesn’t seem to have any of the characteristics herons are known for.,joy
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Ike,"King Tibarn did mention that ""real"" herons are more like Prince Rafiel.",neutral
FE10,4:1-RoadToTheEmpire,Nailah,"Prince Reyson spent a long time in the care of the hawk tribe. No doubt he’s picked up all sorts of quirks. Thank goodness Reyson hasn’t picked up Tibarn’s speech or mannerisms, though. It would be completely ridiculous. Can you imagine a man with Reyson’s looks, talking and acting like Tibarn? I don’t think I could help but laugh at him.",joy

FE10,4:5-UnforgivableSin,Bastian,"Duke Renning was one of the strongest warriors in Crimea, and while Daein tried to kill him, he survived. When the Mad King heard of his skill, he had Renning kidnapped and gave him the drug that creates Feral Ones. This drug made Duke Renning even stronger, but shattered his mind. He became Bertram, one of Ashnard's infamous Four Riders. After Her Majesty and company defeated him, I had him taken back to my castle. I hoped to find a cure, but I didn't want to raise false hope, Your Majesty, so I kept the secret. However, his mind continued to deteriorate, and there were no signs of improvement. As a last resort, I hired Volke to investigate a way to cure him.",neutral

FE10,3:7-RivalsCollide,Ranulf,"You might have a point there. I went scouting after the fog cleared, and their forces looked really unprepared to fight us. They had no ballistae, and they hadn't fielded many fire mages. It felt like they didn't know a thing about fighting laguz.",neutral

FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Ike,Good to hear. So what are you going to do about all the escaped rebel soldiers?,surprise
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Elincia,The rebel army will be eradicated. We cannot allow them to sow the seeds of discontent among the people of Crimea.,anger
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Ike,That's the right choice. Would you consider contracting my mercenaries for the job?,neutral
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Elincia,"...No, Sir Ike. I'll leave that up to the Royal Knights. I'm certain this task will create anger among the people, and the Royal Knights may be resented for their role in it... But my duty as queen demands that it be done.

FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Elincia,When you heard from Bastian... Did he say anything about Daein?,surprise
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Ike,"No, nothing.",neutral
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Elincia,"He informed me of a number of things. Apparently Daein's reconstruction is playing out much like Crimea's... He spoke of a new king raising the banner of war, and a charismatic young hero carrying it into battle. He compared King Pelleas to me, and a ""Silver-Haired Maiden"" to you... It's almost unnatural. He suspected that someone might be scheming, trying to manipulate Daein. Bastian seemed quite suspicious of it all.",sadness
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Ike,So Bastian went to Daein to try and confirm his suspicions on that?,surprise
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Elincia,Yes. There was also something about Daein's resurrection that we can't afford to overlook. ...The Black Knight.,neutral
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Ike,What?!,surprise
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Elincia,"I'll never forget him... He was the one warrior who the late King Ashnard trusted. Encased in pitch-black armor, standing tall with a crimson cape... When the Liberation Army fought at the capital, he was there. He sided with the Silver-Haired Maiden.",neutral
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Ike,"The Black Knight... The man who killed my father... But I defeated him three years ago. I'm sure of it. At the very least, he couldn't have escaped when Nados Castle came crashing down on him.",sadness
FE10,2:4-Elincia'sGambit,Elincia,"The day after you fought, Bastian ordered some men to search the remains of Nados Castle. There was no trace of the Black Knight. No armor... No sword... No corpse.",neutral

FE10,3:9-Marauders,Lady,Shhh! Not so loud! Begnion is ruled by the apostle. They helped us when Daein invaded. It's only right that we pay back the favor by coming to their aid.,fear
FE10,3:9-Marauders,Man,But Begnion is fighting the beast tribes of Gallia. Why would we fight Gallia? The beast tribes helped us rebuild Crimea.,neutral

FE10,3:9-Marauders,Youth 2,But why?,surprise
FE10,3:9-Marauders,Youth 1,"The people of Gallia helped us rebuild the village, even though we're beorc. They even repaired the road to the farm that's up on the mountain. That wasn't an easy job, either.",neutral

FE10,3:2-Stormclouds,Titania,I see. An army of that size would require a massive amount of supplies to be able to sustain itself. So the bird tribes will hit the Central Army's supply unit and slow their advance.,neutral

FE10,3:2-Stormclouds,Levail,"It was no use. No one would even listen to me. It makes my heart heavy.

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,I don't care what you're called. Was it you who turned everyone into stone?,surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"No, that wasn't me. I haven't done much of anything. I just woke up, so I don't have that kind of power just yet. That was Ashera's doing. It was her judgment upon this world.",sadness

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"You've got it all wrong, little meatling. Ashera is neither kind nor loving to the beings of this world. Neither is she holy nor base, angel nor devil. She is...restriction. Order. Stability. Past. Certainty. Restraint. She is Ashera.",neutral

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,Instead...I'll talk to...you. Yes! You're the one I'll talk to!,fear

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Mist,"Oh, OK... So... You're Yune?",surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"That's right. I'm Yune. Ashera is order. I am chaos. We are sisters, but opposite in all things. We're linked to one another, though. When I sleep, Ashera sleeps. When I wake, Ashera wakes.",neutral

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,That's right.,neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Mist,"...And the goddess Ashera was the one who turned all the beorc and laguz into stone. Oh! Are you here to tell us how to save them? Wait, I get it! You were the one who spoke to me! You said, ""Wake me with the galdr of release, not with the spirit of war.""",fear
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"Yes, I did! I'm so glad you understood! You're so very clever! Of course, I was hoping, by sending you that message, I would stop all of this from happening.",joy
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Mist,What do you mean?,surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"We're running out of time, so I'll explain quickly. Long, long ago, your ancestors made a promise to Ashera. They promised they would start no wars among all the nations for at least one thousand years. If this promise was broken, then Ashera would destroy the world and try again with a new one. Despite this promise, you bone-cages kept fighting each other. Eventually, war and conflict spread throughout the world. When Ashera woke up, she cast down her judgment upon those who failed to keep her promise.",sadness
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,I still don't understand. Why would it make a difference whether you were woken up by the galdr or by the spirit of chaos? How were you planning to stop Ashera from passing down her judgment?,anger
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,I'm not talking to you!,anger
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,"Oh, by all that's-- Would you stop acting like a child?",surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Mist,"Please forgive my brother, Yune. We want to save the people who were turned to stone. We need you to tell us how. It did matter that we woke you with the galdr of release, right?",sadness
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"First of all, you should understand that, because of our link, waking me is the same as waking Ashera. Now, if Ashera had been awakened by the spirit of chaos, none of us would be standing here right now. By the terms of the promise, she was just supposed to destroy the world. No hesitation, no discussion. But if she was awakened by the galdr of release, she was supposed to consult with me first. She wasn't supposed to pass down her judgment until she heard from me. Ashera went ahead and turned everyone into stone without asking me. That's so unfair! I'll show her, though. I'll turn them all back somehow! The problem is that I can't do this by myself. I need your help. Will you help me?",anger
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Mist,"Of course we'll help! It's strange, but I trust you, Yune. And we all want to save the people who got turned to stone!",fear
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,Yes. We'll do whatever it takes.,neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Skrimir,That's right! We will allow nothing to stand in our way! We will fight!,anger
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Elincia,It's all so confusing... But we must do everything in our power to save the people.,fear
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sanaki,"...To be honest, I've spent my life teaching that the goddess Ashera watches over and protects us. This is all a little hard to accept.",sadness
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,You don't have to believe me. You could just let her destroy the world...,sadness
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sanaki,"No, I will do whatever it takes to save the people who were turned to stone. I will join the others in helping you.",anger
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sothe,So what you're saying is that we all have to play nice and work together? Just forget about all that's happened?,surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,"Sothe, open your eyes and look around. There aren't that many people left to fix this mess. If you don't help, we can't do it. Besides, I would think saving the world is something we could all agree on.",neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sothe,"You're right, Commander. All of this is the result of our war. I guess there's not much reason for flag-waving on either side. First thing we have to do is...unpetrify everyone. And, well... I, uh... I'm actually kind of relived. At least I don't have to worry about fighting you anymore.",neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,"I wasn't looking forward to that matchup, either.",neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"It's settled, then! How should we begin? I know! Let's divide the army into three teams. I'm pretty sure that Ashera is going to notice what we're up to...",neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,Dividing us up is smart. It reduces the risk of everyone getting killed at once.,neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,We have to hurry. I can feel Ashera's power building.,fear
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,"It's all over if we get turned to stone, too. All right, everyone, it's up to us!",anger
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,What's your name?,surprise

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,Not if you don't like it. Can I call you Yune?,surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"I would like that. I guess I forgive you, then. Oh, I know! As a sign of my forgiveness, I'll make sure that you can get to your destination safely. I can't do it for everyone because it's a bit exhausting for me, but... Hold still and close your eyes.",sadness
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Ike,I'm ready.,neutral

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sothe,...Damn it.,anger
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"Each team will take a different route, but your destination is the same. It's the Tower of Guidance that stands in the middle of the land you named Begnion. Go there at once. ...I hope to see you all there. I'll be waiting.",neutral

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Tibarn,At least we know what we have to do. Let's move out for the tower.,neutral

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Yune,"I sent a message to Micaiah about the impending attack, then returned here as fast as I could. Ashera freed the petrified soldiers who would pledge loyalty to her.

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sothe,Then why do people call her the dark god?,surprise

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sothe,"Yeah... They called out Lekain by name. No mistake about it. That means he's still alive, and probably not petrified, since they said he was their leader. I suppose we'll run across him once we get closer to the tower. That'll be our big chance.",fear
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Micaiah,"Right. We must break the blood pact. No matter what it takes. Of course, our first goal is to save everyone from the goddess's judgment. But we have to break the pact while they're all stone. If we don't, we may save the world, but still lose Daein.",sadness
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sigrun,"...We seem to have missed our chance to speak with her. What a remarkable girl. Lady Micaiah can hear the voice of the goddess Yune and learn of impending danger. She is much like you, Empress Sanaki.",joy

I hate to say it, but I feel like the world is back to the way it ought to be, finally. I know that sounds horrible. But that’s how I honestly feel. Like all debts have been settled, and everything is properly arranged.",sadness
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Sothe,Hmm. I think I understand what you’re trying to say.,neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Micaiah,Sothe... I’m scared. I don’t want to get used to this. It’s too comfortable. Like our mother’s come home.,fear

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Micaiah,How much are you asking for it?,surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Muston,You want it?,neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Micaiah,"Yes. Yune told me that the goddess Ashera would do everything in her power to stop us. I have no idea what to expect, but I’m certain the battle ahead won’t be easy. We have to be prepared. For anything.",neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Muston,I know. You can have it for free.,neutral
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Micaiah,What? But why?,surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Muston,"It’s not like we have any other customers. Everyone else has been turned to stone. Listen, Micaiah. I still have hope. We have your goddess and an army of heroes on our side. I believe in you--all of you. You’ll put the world right again, I’m sure of it.",neutral

FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Skrimir,Ah. So maybe there are more?,surprise
FE10,4:0-ChaosNamed,Micaiah,Yes... I think so. Somewhere...,neutral

FE10,1:5-TheLostHeir,Micaiah,"I'm not sure what it is. I see a lot of images, stacked on top of each other. It's hard to see what they all are. There's danger, battles, and terrible sadness, but also...hope. Whatever our destiny is, I know we'll find it in the desert. Let's go.",fear

What I needed was a war that would spread all across the continent. How could I achieve this? My attention turned to the young Daein prince... I could use the fiery Ashnard for my purposes. He was ambitious, a fierce warrior, and more than anything, he had an earnest desire to change the world. When I allowed him to know of the goddess sealed inside the medallion, he became determined to set her free.

FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Sephiran,"Sanaki, my long life has shown me the people of this world deserve only destruction. The selfishness, the brutality... The disregard for others, the endlessly quarreling laguz and beorc. We have been given many chances to correct our behavior and ourselves, and have squandered them all. The only remaining hope for a peaceful, orderly world is for Ashera to wipe us all out and begin again. To fulfill my ambition of destroying all beings, I had to use you... I had to betray you.",anger

Lehran supported her as an advisor...and as a husband.",neutral

FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,That was what King Dheginsea said. This was before the people thought of such differences. They saw only a queen and her husband.,sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"At this time, King Dheginsea also created his own kingdom far from other laguz tribes and beorc nations. He believed that the dragon tribe was too powerful to interact equally with other tribes and peoples. That kingdom became Goldoa.",neutral
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,"Begnion had been established for four years when King Dheginsea received news that Altina had become pregnant. The news brought great joy. You see, the news was also quite surprising. There had been other unions between beorc and laguz, but until Altina's pregnancy, no children had ever been conceived. Indeed, hers was the first child ever to be born of beorc and laguz.",sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"As close friends of both Altina and Lehran, both King Dheginsea and Soan rejoiced at the news. The child would be the first to carry the joined blood of both laguz and beorc. The king said that the baby would become a symbol of peace between the two peoples.",neutral

FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"It became apparent that the child of such a union neutralizes the laguz parent's powers. To make matters worse, the child bears only the characteristics of a beorc.",neutral
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,"Lehran felt he was no longer a true laguz, and felt he could no longer act as a bridge between the goddess and the people of Tellius. He lost hope, and also his mind...at least temporarily. He attempted suicide several times, which is an unthinkable taboo for anyone who has sworn to serve the goddess.",sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"King Dheginsea fell into despair. If people caught wind of this news, he believed it would create a deep rift between the two peoples. The king was especially concerned about the reaction from the laguz. They might interpret the birth as a herald of their eventual end. Some might even attempt to harm the child.",fear
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Kurthnaga,Lehran needed to hear the voice of the goddess then more than ever before... But he could no longer sing the galdr of release. Is that what happened?,sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,"Just so. Lehran was forced to make a very difficult decision to protect the peace between beorc and laguz. He decided to retreat into seclusion and consider the problem. Once he regained his sanity, he announced his decision.",neutral
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"Lehran was forced to ask the  unthinkable of his wife, his aides, and close friends: ""For the sake of Begnion, you must tell the people that I died in an accident. Tell them the birth was merely a false rumor.""",sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,"Lehran left the medallion to his tribe, moving to Goldoa under King Dheginsea's protection. He simply disappeared from history after that.",neutral
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"After Lehran had left and life returned to normal, Altina eventually welcomed a beorc husband. She raised the child she'd had with Lehran as though it were an ordinary beorc child, born of her new husband. Since then, marriages between laguz and beorc have been forbidden. It became known as a ""crime against the goddess.""",anger
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,"Even so, the taboo was broken several times over the next few decades. Usually no child was conceived, but when there was, it was swiftly covered up. The parents soon learned what it meant to bear a child who possessed both laguz and beorc blood. After they learned of the consequences, none of these parents ever rejected the edict forbidding it.",sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"The child was to be raised by the beorc parent, and raised as a beorc child. That should have been enough to hide everything, end of story.",neutral
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,"It was several generations later that the certain descendants began to manifest physical marks which indicated their ancestors' sins. Fortunately, this mark looked very similar to the marks on those protected by spirits. They could pass as students of the dark arts for at least a few years. Unfortunately, the Branded lived much longer than beorc.",neutral
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"Most Branded chose to hide, living outside of ordinary society, and they disappeared into the shadows of history.

Where the laguz held power, they persecuted the Branded and executed them in honor killings.",anger
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Micaiah,That's horrible!,sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"It was King Dheginsea's opinion that these were crimes that he had to carry on his conscience. From the beginning, he realized that he and the others in power had made a mistake. They understood that they should have revealed everything about Altina and Lehran's child. The people should have been told the truth. But since they'd kept the truth from everyone, the Branded were marked as unclean, persecuted wherever they traveled.",sadness

FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Kurthnaga,Father... You've had to endure this burden alone for so long.,sadness
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Gareth,"It was the same in Lady Almedha's case. When she lost her powers after giving birth to the Mad King's son, King Dheginsea had no choice but to hide the truth from everyone. So he chose to hide Almedha from everyone. Better to deny her existence than be forced to explain long-hidden secrets.",anger
FE10,4:14-Rebirth4,Nasir,"In the process, he'd lost someone even more dear to him. Prince Rajaion. He deeply regretted his decision when he learned of the prince's death. The only choice left for King Dheginsea was to remain stubbornly neutral in all wars on the continent. He hoped--in vain--to keep the goddess from waking up before the thousand years had elapsed.",sadness

I think you can see where this is going. The wave of mysterious deaths spread across the kingdom like a contagion. After thirty days, the king finally realized that this was the curse of the blood pact, the price of infidelity. He apologized to the empire and pleaded with them to lift the curse. His plea was graciously accepted on the one hundredth day. By then, the king had lost half of his subordinates, as well as his lovely wife and child. That country remained under the control of the senate for a very long time.",sadness
