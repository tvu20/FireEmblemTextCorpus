FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Countless days have passed since Dolhr took my kingdom from me- days I would never have lived had it not been for my sister Elice's sacrifice, and the sacrifices of so many others...",sadness
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Nyna,"What became of your sister? And the rest of your family, what of them as well?",surprise
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"My father, as you know, died in Gra. I last saw my mother and sister the day the castle fell. I do not know if they still live...but I hope that they do. And if the enemy has them, I will rescue them. You can be sure of that.",sadness
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Malledus,"Sire, our preparations are complete. We are ready to march.",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,Thank you.,joy
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Alteans and friends of the League! Join me now! Help me set Altea free, and ensure today is the last battle my people must endure!",anger
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Old Man,"Listen well, because this is very important. There are two villages in the northwest of Altea. The easterly village is home to a paladin named Arran while the westerly village is home to a hero named Samson. They're both fine men and warriors, but their villages have been feudin' for years. You should probably resign yourself to the fact that you'll only get one of them to join your ranks. Give it some thought: the hero to the west, or the paladin to the east?",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Young Girl,"A VIP card will gain you entrance to secret shops. Where are the shops? Well, that’s the secret!",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Young Man,A lad named Xane has been locked up in the eastern jail. They say he’s got some sort of amazing power. Wonder what it is.,neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Middle-Aged Man,"Three orbs are enshrined at the Fane of Raman, each brimming with power. What sort of power, none can say. Well, except those who have wielded it, right?",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Old Woman,The Altean army! Welcome home. It’s good to see you. These years been nowt but dark days; it’s about time we had something bright to look forward to.,joy
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Middle-Aged Man,"Take care when usin' a devil sword. It’s a powerful blade, to be sure- but it might just claim your life instead of your foe’s.",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Young Man,"Princess Elice was prepared to die that day the castle fell. But she didn't, they say. Instead of killin' her, the Dark Pontifex Gharnef spirited her off somewhere! Oh, our poor princess... I hope she's safe.",fear
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Samson,"My name is Samson. Once, I was a swordfighter of some renown...but that was then, and this is now. I'm happy enough with my life here in the village, but if you need another man, I will fight. Unfortunately, there has always been bad blood between our village and the next one over. They'll have closed the gates to you the moment they saw you come here. Guess that means the paladin Arran won't be fightin' with you. Them's the breaks.",joy
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Arran,"Sire, my name is Arran. Once I was a captain to many knights... but, things change, and I came to live here in this village. If you need warriors for the coming struggle, I would be honored to fight. Unfortunately, there has always been bad blood between this village and our neighbors. No doubt they closed their gates to you as soon as they saw you come here. You won't be able to recruit the hero Samson now, I'm afraid.",joy
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Xane,"Hey there, princey. Thanks for settin' me free! The name's Xane. I hail from a land few have heard of an even fewer have seen. I won't trouble you with the details. Me and my folk have the power to transform into other people. We can shape-shift, you see. When Doluna caught on, they started threatenin' me. Told me to join their army or ""face my doom."" Hah! Well, I wasn't about to waste my considerable talent on those evil coots! You, on the other hand...You've got character. Say, why don't we team up? I do owe you for savin' my hide. And I think you'll find my talents are...quite considerable.",joy
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Hollstadt,"Well done, rabble. Anyone else would be dead by now. A shame you must end your campaign right here, before your own gates!",anger
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Hollstadt,Rrgh! General Camus... The rest... is in your... hands...,anger

FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Thank you, Nyna. But it's still too soon to celebrate. We haven't freed the castle yet.",joy
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Malledus,"Sire, your soldiers have assembled for the castle raid. Perhaps you could say a few words first...",neutral
FE11,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Altean warriors... Brave comrades. The road has been long, but at last we have driven Dolhr from my homeland. There are not words to express my gratitude to you all. You gave Altea back to me. Thank you... Thank you. ...An army of foes still haunt my castle. I mean to kick them out. Ready, my friends? Let's send these varlets scurrying!",joy
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Ogma,"Prince Marth, I am Ogma, a mercenary of Talys. The king has bid me and my three men join your army. Cavalry has arrived from the west, flying Grust’s standard. They mean to take your life, sire. Be careful.",neutral
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Young Man,A pirate callin’ himself Darros wants to talk to your prince. Says he’s washed his hands of pillagin’ and plunderin’ and wants to fight for the good of all. Hah! Right… And I’m a farmer who’s been sworn off rain…,anger

FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Old Man,"Oh! Mighty prince of Altea! Please, will you save Sister Lena? She’s gone up into the Ghoul’s Teeth to tend to the sick there. We warned her, I swear we did… Lena is our angel. If something befell her, I- No, I won’t think of it. Take this gold: we’ve 5000 pieces. Just promise you’ll use it to bring her home to us unharmed.",fear
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Darros,"Ahoy, Prince Marth, I be Darros, a simple man o’ the sea. I’ve had me fill o’ the piratin’ life, and now I be lookin’ t’start anew. What say ye? Make me yer matey, and I swear t’pull me load.",anger
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Caeda,"Castor?! It is you, isn’t it? Must even good men like you betray Talys now?",anger
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Castor,"Princess Caeda? Oh…I’m sorry, but me mother’s sick, and the medicine don’t buy itself, see…",sadness
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Caeda,"So you agreed to fight for the pirates in exchange for coin…All right then. If it’s gold you need, take mine. Here, this is all I have. Take it, and go to your mother’s side.",neutral

FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Caeda,I never got to thank you for coming along with us. There's no swordsman I trust more. I've seen your strength.,joy
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Ogma,"You don't need to thank me, Princess. I'm just doing my job. Speaking of which, your father would flay me if you came to any harm. Do me a favor, and leave the dangerous fighting to me and my men.",sadness
FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Caeda,"I don't need protecting, Ogma. ...I've got another job for you. Protect Marth for me.",neutral

FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Ogma,Very well. How could I say no to you?,surprise

FE11,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Villager,"You have our gratitude, sire, for finally chasin’ those pirates away. Now, as I hear it, you plan to march on to Aurelis…That’ll take you right up through the Ghoul’s Teeth. With all due respect, sire, you’re taking a great risk crossin’ those mountains that’s Soothsire territory. The Soothsires are fearsome bandits, always raidin’ the villages and harryin’ what travelers dare pass by. And the swordsman with ’em- goes by the name o’ Navarre- he’s a terror with a blade, so they say. If you go up there, keep your wits about you- or you won’t come back down.",joy
FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Jagen,Sire! You've a visitor from the castle. It's Princess Caeda!,neutral

FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Young Man,I hear you need a high weapon level to wield the strongest weapons. Another thing: Keep your fliers away from those enemy archers!,neutral
FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Young Man,"A knight belongs on the front lines, if you ask me. That thick armor can take a lot of abuse, so they should be up front protecting the other units.",neutral
FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Teenage Boy,"Galder? That's the harbor town west of Talys out beyond the water. These days, a pirate by the name of Gomer calls the shots there. The whole town's at the mercy of his crew.",neutral

FE11,01-MarthEmbarks,Talys King,"Ah, Prince Marth! You have saved us in our hour of need. Please accept my thanks. Lad, I believe you are ready. If you wish to seek out allies in Aurelis, I will give you what soldiers I can to see you arrive there safely. Captain Ogma is a fine swordsman, brave and true. I know he and his fighters will serve you well. Another thing...During your travels, you are certain to meet many who despise Dolhr. Some may be hiding in villages; other may have been captured or forced to fight against their will or better judgment. It falls upon you to find these individuals and win them over your cause. Understood, lad? Then go! The time has come! Be patient, steady, strong: I know you will do great things.",anger

FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Old Man,Why would you try to take on an entire army just for our sake?,neutral

FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"You just keep your distance. I’m not letting anyone near the villagers in here, and that includes you!",neutral
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"You wrong me, sir. I’m here to rout the last of Grust’s army. To save you.",neutral
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"Yeah? Well, they said the same thing when they led us down here. And look where that got us. I’m not fallin’ for the same lies twice!",anger
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"I speak the truth. But, if my word is not good enough, so be it. Stand aside and watch us fight. Let the battle prove I mean what I say. Agreed? Either way, you are in danger here. Take the villagers and hide until this is over.",neutral

FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Larissa,We’ll never surrender to you Akaneian rabble! Long live Grust!,anger
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Larissa,Rebel... scum...,anger
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Old Man,"Prince Marth, thank you. Those soldiers told us they’d protect us when they led us down here... but they were just using us as leverage, hostages to keep you at bay! If you hadn’t shown up, they might have just killed us outright in the end...",joy
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"Prince Marth, sorry I doubted you.",sadness
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"Well, at least we’ve cleared up the misunderstanding.",neutral

FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,You mean... join our army?,surprise
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Ymir,"I’m strongest in the land! Well, second strongest, at least. I can hold my own in battle. But if you don’t want a monster in your ranks, I understand...",anger
FE11,20x-LairOfFire,Marth,"Monster? You’re a giant among men, to be sure, but a hero as well! Any warrior who can fend of an entire army is welcome among us!",anger

FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Malledus,"Aurelis, at last…The enemy will have sent their forces to meet us.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Marth,"Grust, Dolhr, Gra..We’re up against their standing armies, and we must brace ourselves for it.",anger
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Malledus,"Sire, I believe it prudent that we start taking time to prepare our troops before each battle. We should select the warriors best suited for the situation and outfit them with the right weapons and items accordingly.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Marth,"All right, that’s sound advice- I believe I’ll take it.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Bentheon,"An unknown army to the south? That must be the Altean princeling and his band of lickspittles. If they think we’ll sit by and let them join forces with the Aurelians, then they have another think coming. With this ridersbane, I’ll litter the lea with their cavalry!",anger
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Young Man,"Weapons can be crafted of iron, steel, or silver, each metal more powerful than the last. You’’l need to raise your weapon level accordingly, though, before you can use them.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Middle-Aged Man,"When facing armored knights or generals, you’ll want to arm yourself with a sword they call an armorslayer. Then there’s the ridersbane, which makes short work of cavaliers and paladins- but only knights and cavalry can wield it. The rapier is effective against armored units AND cavalry. But you need to be a prince to wield that one! Also, keep in mind that weapons wear down with use and eventually break.",neutral
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Young Man,"General Bentheon who guards the castle was carrying a ridersbane last I saw. Keep your cavaliers away, or that weapon could spell the end of ‘em.",neutral

FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Marth,"…Huh? Merric?! Merric, is that you?",surprise

FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Matthis,Lena?! What are you doing on a battlefield?,surprise
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Lena,"I was attacked by bandits in the Teeth while tending to the sick there, and these people saved me. The real question is, what are YOU doing on a battlefield- least of all this one!",surprise
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Matthis,"I’m not here by choice, sister of mine. Since you left, Macedon has only gotten worse and worse. They forced me to enlist- you know I hate warfare, but it was into the army or onto the chopping block.",sadness
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Lena,"Shame on you, Matthis. If you’re going to fight, then at least fight for something you believe in. Medon has done terrible things: marrying their might to Doluna, helping them torment people…Brother, it’s not too late. You could join Altea’s forces. They’re good people you know. Prince Marth would welcome you. They all would.",anger
FE11,04-BattleInTheLea,Matthis,"…All right, then. If I’m gonna to die, I’d rather die as one of the dashing than one of the dastardly. You know, Lena, you always were the reliable one and now you’re all grown up…I thought for sure you’d have already settled down with your one true love.",anger

FE11,XX-Epilogue,Caeda,"Marth... um, we haven't talked much since leaving Talys. But I thought.. Do you know where you will be going?",neutral

FE11,XX-Epilogue,Marth,"Well, that's where we both belong. I don't see what my wants have to do with anything.",neutral
FE11,XX-Epilogue,Nyna,"Clearly not. Marth, if you have anything to say to Caeda, say it now. Love cannot always make the leap from heart to heart by itself; sometimes you must speak it aloud and give it wings. Surely a great leader like you can muster the courage for that?",joy

FE11,XX-Epilogue,Marth,"As you said, we have not spoken much since Talys. With you, I felt I never had to say a word. If the battle started to take its toll, you were always there... close by...

Caeda, I'm just trying to tell you I-",sadness

FE11,XX-Epilogue,Marth,"...She was the one I most wanted to keep safe. But I failed, and I have lost her forever... It occurs to me now that perhaps she was the one protecting me all along. Caeda... Why did you take up arms with a fool like me?",sadness
FE11,XX-Epilogue,Nyna,"Marth, do not blame yourself. ...Remember Anri and Artemis. We are their descendants; perhaps we were always meant to share their curse as well as their blood. And... perhaps only the curse has exacted its price could our battle with the Shadow Dragon be won. This peace we have made... We must cherish it, Marth. We have both paid so dearly for it. Let us work together to ensure none must endure a tragedy like our again.",anger

Thus rather than terrorizing humankind, they chose to live simple, peaceful lives in the quieter reaches of the world. However, a century ago, something changed. Medeus, the Shadow Dragon, surfaced in the Dolhr region and created what would be a great empire there. His forces invaded the human realm, and in the blink of an eye, he had subjected all of the land. It was then, in that darkest hour, that a young man named Anri appeared, and rose against the Shadow Dragon. In his head was a shining blade of light- Falchion- which he plunged into Medeus- and the tyrant was no more. Anri went on to found Altea- and the rest, I believe, you know.",neutral
