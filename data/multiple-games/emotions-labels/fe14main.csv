FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Azura... How is Sakura holding up?,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"Not well. She won't speak a word, and I'm told she refuses to eat.",neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,"I'm not surprised. Poor thing. For someone so young to witness the massacre of all those soldiers... We're lucky we were able to take Sakura, Yukimura, and the retainers as hostages. If Iago and Hans weren't frightened of Xander, they would be dead right now. I've heard that Sakura is being kept separate from the rest. Is that so?",surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"I'm afraid so. I believe her isolation has made all of this even harder on her. But Elise has been visiting her quite often, making sure she gets food and blankets.",fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,"Elise has been doing all that? I'm a little surprised. Back in Izumo, she seemed rather hostile toward Sakura...",surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"Perhaps she's learned to focus on what they have in common. After all, they are both princesses, and the youngest of all their siblings. ...You should know that Garon's men don't agree with our choice to keep them alive. We should keep close watch on them, or I shudder to think what might happen.",fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,You're right. I wish it weren't so... But those who still follow Father over Xander are not to be trusted.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,Indeed. As it were... The Nohrian army is split in two as of now.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,What do you mean?,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"There are those whose allegiance lies with you, Xander, Leo and the others. And those who still swear fealty only to King Garon, Iago, and Hans. Conquering Hoshido is our only option, but our methods have drawn attention. If things continue like this, we might have a rebellion of sorts to contend with. It's convenient that King Garon is already here in Hoshido... But if something happens and we lose his trust, we will all be in grave danger. Until he sits on that throne, we should all proceed with extreme caution.",fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,"You're right. We must be patient. The whole world depends on it. Once Father sits on that throne, everyone will finally know the truth. Only then can we—",neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,Lord/Lady Corrin. Lady Azura.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Iago?!,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,Am I interrupting something?,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,"No, not at all. Did you need something?",neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,King Garon orders you and your troops to prepare for battle immediately. We will be arriving at the Great Wall of Suzanoh before long.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,The Great Wall of Suzanoh?,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,"Oh, my apologies, young prince/princess. I take it you've never heard of the place before? It's the last hurdle that stands between us and the Hoshidan castle. Once we pass through, we will enter the capital city. My forces shall be leading the charge. You, on the other hand, have been tasked with conquering the enemy's core legion. That means defeating their leader, Prince Takumi.",sadness
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi...is leading Hoshido's core legion?,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,Yes. We received word of it from our scouts not too long ago.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,I see.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,"We already have Princess Sakura as a hostage, so no need to keep him alive. I'm sure you would prefer to spare him, but I doubt our dear king would agree...",neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,"*sigh* You are correct, Iago. I will deal with Takumi for the glory of Nohr. However, first things first. For now I must focus on the battle ahead. I will tell my troops to prepare for battle.",neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,Understood.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Iago,"Heh heh... Now, to joyously watch Corrin suffer! Poor prince/princess... What will you do?!",joy
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,"At long last. I'm glad you could make it. Prince/Princess Corrin of Nohr. But know that so long as there is a single breath in my body, I will not let you pass. I mean that. You shall not enter our capital under any circumstances. Are you ready, dear Brother/Sister? Today is the day you die! Even if I must give my life to achieve it, I will not fail. I WILL kill you, Corrin! Prepare to die like the coward you are!",anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Hinata,I have been practicing day and night so I could be the one to stop you! I won't back down to the likes of you no-good scoundrels! Stand back and watch as I protect Lord Takumi and all of Hoshido!,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Hinata,Lord Takumi... Stay...strong... I hope he knows...getting this blade from him...was my proudest moment...,sadness
FE14,23C-Possessed,Oboro,"You filthy Nohrians! As long as I live, I won't let you lay a finger on my dear Lord Takumi!!",anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Oboro,Aww...but I wanted to protect you...my sweet Takumi... I should have told you...how I felt... Lord Takumi... I have always...loved... ...,sadness
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,All allies of Nohr deserve nothing but the cold embrace of death!,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,NO!! This can't be...how it ends...,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,"I have waited far too long for this moment, Brother/Sister. I have dreamt of nothing but ending you, and now the time has come! I shall cherish the sound of life leaving your body for all eternity. Do you remember what I told you in Cheve? Do you?!",anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,You said you would not rest until you killed me—made me pay for my sins.,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,"That's right. There's no turning back now... Not for me. This is all I have left. For better or for worse, this will be our last meeting. It ends here. I made up my mind to kill you a long time ago, my forgotten brother/sister. I WILL have revenge for Mother and all the Hoshidan lives you've ruined!!",anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi... Brother...,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,"Your battle is over, Takumi. The Nohrian army has seized control of the Great Wall of Suzanoh. All remaining soldiers will be taken prisoner. That includes you.",anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,Dammit! Coward! I hope you rot in a pit of eternal torment for this!!,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Leo,"My, what a rude fellow. You should be grateful we are allowing you to live. You may be our prisoner, but we will not treat you cruelly. If you behave, we may even let you see your sister, Princess Sakura.",anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,WHAT?! You've captured Sakura too? You monsters!!,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,"I know how you must be feeling, Takumi, but please calm yourself. We must bind and imprison you before Father arrives. Please, just put out your hands and—",neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,Don't touch me! Don't you dare lay your filthy Nohrian hands on me!!,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi?,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,"I mean it! Don't come near me!! If it wasn't for you, none of these awful things would have happened to Hoshido! No one would have had to die! We could have been a family! Why did you go back to Nohr?! Why? TELL ME WHY!! Why didn't you choose us?! Your real family! Why?!",fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi! I...,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,"*sob* Don't you speak my name, traitor! *sob*",sadness
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,...,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,It doesn't matter. Nothing matters—not anymore.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi... Why would you say that?,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Takumi,The time is now... I can still save Hoshido even without the blade of salvation... You can't keep me prisoner... See? Do you see?! You shouldn't have left me a way...a way to escape...,sadness
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi?! TAKUMI! NOOOO!!,fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"Takumi! Please, no...",sadness
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Th-this can't be happening... I won't let it! TAKUMI!!,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,Corrin! What are you doing?!,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,I'm going after him! He might still be alive!,joy
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"No, it's too dangerous! That area isn't under Nohr's control yet! Corrin!!",fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi! Where are you?! He's not here... But how? He must have fallen somewhere nearby...,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"Wait, Corrin! You can't go that way! Hoshidan soldiers might still be afoot!",anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Azura! What do I do? I can't find Takumi anywhere.,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,What?!,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,We saw him fall... He fell down this very wall. But he's not down here!,fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"How could that be? That's simply not possible. After falling that far, it would be a miracle for him to be alive, much less still mobile.",joy
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Then where is he?,surprise
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,I...I don't know. Perhaps somebody removed his body. There must be an explanation.,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,...,neutral
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"I'm sorry, but we don't have time to figure this out right now. We need to get back to our troops. If we don't have the wall under our control when King Garon's forces arrive... There's no telling how many innocent lives will be lost.",sadness
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Dammit... You're right. OK. Let's go.,anger
FE14,23C-Possessed,Azura,"We must hurry, Corrin. There's no time to lose.",fear
FE14,23C-Possessed,Corrin,Takumi... Where are you...?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"All right, Corrin. Let’s go in there together. I’ll help as much as possible. This is our father we’re talking about. He has to forgive you, right?",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Thanks, Elise. I hope you’re right.",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"All right. Deep breath, and… here we go. Father! We have something we need to talk you about!",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,Gah hah ha!,joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Father?,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,It sound like he’s with someone… Maybe we should come back later.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,Hrmph! Who’s there?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"Oh! Sorry to bother you, Father…",sadness
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Yes, we apologize if this isn’t a good time.",sadness
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,What do you two want?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"Father, we’re here to apologize. Right, Corrin?",sadness
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Yes, that’s right. I’m sorry for questioning you.",sadness
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,You may enter.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,Corrin… You disobeyed a direct order from me. Ordinarily you would not still be alive.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,I understand…,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"No! Father, I can explain-",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,"Silence! As you are my child, Corrin, I will grant you some leeway. I have something in mind for you. A mission. If you complete this task successfully, I will pardon your crime in full.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Really?! What sort of mission?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,There is an abandoned fortress perched on the Hoshidan border. I wish to know if the building there remains serviceable. You are to travel to the site and inspect the premises. No battle will be required. Do you understand? I won’t tolerate being disappointed twice…,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Yes, Father. It shall be done.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Camilla,"Darling, are you sure you’re going to be OK out there? I don’t like this…",fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Of course! Please don’t worry. It’s just an abandoned fort.,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Leo,"You’re acting rather casual about all this, Corrin. It isn’t like Father to be so forgiving…",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Huh? What do you mean, Leo?",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"That’s enough, Leo! Don’t be so worried all the time, sheesh. And don’t even try to scare Corrin before his/her first mission!",fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Leo,Hey! That’s not necessary.,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Camilla,I suppose I’ll just have to come along. That way I know Corrin will be safe.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Iago,I’m afraid that’s not possible.,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Camilla,"Why ever not, Iago?",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Iago,"Lady Camilla, King Garon intends his expedition as a test of sorts. As his top advisor, I have been entrusted with coordinating this mission. He would like to know whether Prince/Princess Corrin is worthy… After all, he/she IS a part of the royal lineage. Therefore, your assistance would simply muddy the results.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Understood. Camilla, I need to do this all by myself. Surely you understand.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,"Not all by yourself, Corrin.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Father! I didn’t see you there.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,"Rest assured, I don’t intend to send you out there completely defenseless.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,…Milord/Milady.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Garon,This is Hans. He is a veteran warrior and will ensure no trouble befalls you.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Thank you, Father.",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Xander,Hmm…,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Xander,"I’d be wary of that man if I were you, Corrin…",fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Why do you say that?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Xander,"He’s a criminal. A murderer and scoundrel. I arrested him myself, years ago. Father seems to think he’s rehabilitated, but I’m not so sure. That said, he is a formidable soldier.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,I see.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Wow… Is this it? The Bottomless Canyon?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,Yes. It’s the natural boundary dividing Nohr and Hoshido.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"It can’t be really bottomless, can it?",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,"Let the eternal darkness below be your answer. Those who fall in never return… I truly despise this place. Something about the land around here just isn’t right. The sky here is always dark and foreboding, and lightning strikes all who fly across. This clearly a place us mortals were never meant to enter. Normally we’d go around… But the fort that King Garon wants surveyed is right over there.",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Oh, it’s not so bad. Or perhaps I’m just happy to be outside in the fresh air! Compared to the inside of that fortress, this is downright exiting.",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,"Ha! That certainly puts things in perspective, milord/milady. Come, let’s proceed.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,Blast! It looks like this fort isn’t as abandoned as we thought. Why the devil is this place crawling with Hoshidans?,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hoshidan,"Hold on! Do not advance any farther, soliders of Nohr.",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Omozu,"Crossing that bridge is a violation of our border treaty. Turn back at once, or we’ll be forced to attack!",fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Felicia,What should we do?,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,We’re not here to fight. I suppose we’ll have to turn back and report to Father.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,"Wise decision, Lord/Lady Corrin.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,"Who asked you, old man?",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,What?!,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,Gyaaah!,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hoshidan,AAAUGH!,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,"Ah ha ha! Die, scumbags!",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Omozu,You’ll pay for this!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Hans, what are you doing?! We had no reason to engage these troops!",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,Pfft.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,We should have tried diplomacy first. We weren’t sent here to fight!,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,"Speak for yourself, weakling.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,What’s that supposed to mean?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Omozu,"Soldiers of Hoshido, hear me! Do not leave a single Nohrian alive!",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hoshidan,Prepare to attack!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,"Argh! Looks like there’s no getting out of this now. Get ready to fight, Lord/Lady Corrin.",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,"Now then, Lord/Lady Corrin. There are two kinds of battle formations. You’ll need to learn both, and fast! You can take a defensive position by moving to the same space as an ally. Your ally will benefit from your support, but you won’t be able to attack. If you want to unleash the most potent attacks, stand in adjacent positions. From that alignment, allies may be able to attack simultaneously. I’d tell you more, but you’re about to receive some practical experience…",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,I’m afraid the enemy’s position across that bridge may be impenetrable. We’ve got to look for another way across. Lord/Lady Corrin! See if you can find a Dragon Vein around here.,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Omozu,Gods! Did you see what just happened to the cliff? Who are we dealing with here?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Felicia,Look! More troops are arriving from the south!,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,"More enemy reinforcements… Take caution, Lord/Lady Corrin.",fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,Gyaaah! Die!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,Bwahaha! Look like I’ve done enough damage for the time being. Time to lay low and see how this all plays out…,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Omozu,Do you even realize what you’ve done here today? Hoshido won’t stand for unprovoked attacks like this. Revenge will be ours!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Omozu,Damn you! This isn’t over…,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,This isn’t what I had in mind…but at least I’ve completed Father’s mission.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Saizo,You’re the leader of these troops? Pah. You’re nothing more than a boy/girl.,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Who are you?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Saizo,My name is Saizo. I’ve come to claim your life.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Hey! Everyone! We’re still under attack!,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Saizo,Destroy them!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,???,I won’t allow it!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Saizo,What?! This must be their real commander…,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Xander,"What’s going on here, Corrin?",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Xander! How did you know were in trouble?,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Leo,"We’ve arrived just in time. Your luck never runs out, does it, Brother/Sister?",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Camilla,Are you all right? I was so worried about you.,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"We’re all here for you, Corrin!",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Thank you, everyone! Um, but before we get too carried away… we ARE under attack.",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Camilla,Who dares attack my beloved Corrin? I’ll have their heads on a platter!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"I’m not hurt, Camilla.",fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Camilla,"But, darling…it’s the thought that counts!",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,I never knew Camilla could be so…ruthless…,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Elise,"Heehee! That’s right, you’ve never seen her on the battlefield before.",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Saizo,This is not going well…,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Kagero,Saizo! What’s wrong? What’s our status?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Saizo,"I misjudged the situation. We’re outnumbered. Kagero, do we have anyone else on the way?",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Kagero,Affirmative. Lord Ryoma is right behind me.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Saizo,Ahh… Then I think this battle is as good as won.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Xander,It looks like more Hoshidan reinforcements are on the way.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Leo,Indeed… What should we do?,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Xander,"Well, Corrin is safe, and the fort’s condition has been evaluated. There’s no reason to engage Hoshido further at this point. Corrin, you take the lead with Gunter. We’ll follow close behind.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Will do. Thank you, Xander.",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Gunter, have you seen Felicia/Jakob? She/He was here a second ago…",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,I’m sure she’s/he's right behind us. Now hurry up. I can’t stand being on this bridge a moment longer.,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,Don’t worry-you won’t have to stand there much longer.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Hans!,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Gunter,What is the meaning of this?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,Less talk. More death.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Hans, no! Why are you doing this? Your own ally…",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,"Aww, did I knock your babysitter into the ditch? Here- you can meet up with him at the bottom!",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,You’ll pay for this!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,What?! What kind of…freak…are you?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,It can’t be..,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"I want answers, Hans! Why are you doing this? Why did you provoke the Hoshians? And why did you kill Gunter? Answer me!",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Hans,Just following orders. King Garon’s orders.,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,What?! You lie!,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Come back here!,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Huh? Noooo!,anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"My kin, my gods, my blood… Dragons grant me strength! Great Moro, I beseech you!",anger
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Lilith? Is that you? What…ARE you?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"Lord/Lady Corrin… I knew this day would come eventually. This may come as a shock, but I am not a human.",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Well, I can see that. Are you a dragon?",surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"Yes, this is my true form. You’ve seen it before. Do you remember? That strange bird you rescued in the barn…",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,That… was you…?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"It was. Once I recovered, I was able to take human form. You were so kind to me that I decided to remain a human that I might serve you. But now I have used a power that goes beyond the capacity of a human body. I will not be able to return to that form. I don’t mind, though. The most important thing to me is that you’re safe…",joy
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,Eeek!,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Lilith! Be careful! Drop me if you must… I won’t have you sacrifice yourself for me!,fear
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"First Dragons, I call on you. Grant us access to the astral plane!",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,What just happened?! Where…are we?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"This is a world parallel to the one in which you live, Lord/Lady Corrin. It is known as the astral plane.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,How were you able to get us here?,surprise
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"The First Dragons have granted us the power to inhabit this dimension. Under their protection, we are safe here. Oh! Allow me to prepare a place for you to rest…",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,Did… did you just use a Dragon Vein?,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,Yes. The power of the First Dragons flows freely in this realm. You should know that space and time operate differently here as well…,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,I have so much to learn… Is there anyone else here?,neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"No, we are alone. There’s no one left here…",sadness
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to invoke any bad memories.",sadness
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"It’s OK, Corrin. I’m not lonely as long as I have you in my life. Now…you should get some rest.",sadness
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"How are you feeling, Corrin? I know this is a lot to take in.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Yes, it is. But I feel much better now. My wounds seem to have healed already. And my mind is racing! I have so many new questions about this world…",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"All in good time. For now, some business remains in the other world.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,"Yes, you’re right. I can’t relax until I know everyone made it safely home.",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Lilith,"Of course. There is just one thing you should know before you go back. When I open the portal, you will return to the same location you came from. That means you’ll arrive right on the Hoshidan border. There may be soldiers lying in wait for you…",neutral
FE14,03-JourneyBegins,Corrin,I understand. I’ll be ready for them.,neutral

The journey itself is what has strengthened you. Your minds and your bodies. If I were to ask you to climb another 5,000 vertical feet, I have no doubt you'd do it.

FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,Really? How is that possible?!,surprise
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,He sent a young pegasus rider from the Bottomless Canyon to find us. Both rider and steed appeared exhausted. Sakura is tending to them now.,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,"I see. So, what was the message?",surprise
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,"It's bad news, I'm afraid. Yukimura reports that the royal troops are still holding the line in Hoshido. But it appears that soldiers from Mokushu have joined Nohr in attacking us. It sounds like it's only a matter of time until our defenses are breached.",fear
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,No!,anger
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,It gets worse. That message is at least several weeks old. I wouldn't be surprised to find that the situation has deteriorated even further.,sadness
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,It sounds like we don't have much time left. We need to defeat Garon and end this war before our castle falls. How long until we reach our destination?,fear
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,"Another day—maybe two. According to the captain, we need to go far upstream to reach a docking point.",neutral

FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,Hmm. I'm not sure. The captain didn't indicate that we had any options.,neutral

FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,Demon's Fall? Show me!,anger
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,"He's right. It's handwritten very faintly, right there. Have you heard of the place, Ryoma?",neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,"Yes, but I believed it to be a legend. They say it's a waterfall made of fire, which seemed too fantastical to be true.",joy
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,Perhaps it's worth checking out. It could save us a few precious days.,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Takumi,"Well, we better decide quickly. We're coming up on a fork in the river!",neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,"I believe it's worth a shot. What do you say, Corrin?",neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,I agree. We must act quickly...or else there may no longer BE a Hoshido to save. I think we're ready to take on anything we might find at Demon's Fall. Who's with me?,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,"We're all with you, Corrin! I'll inform the captain.",neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,By gods...the waterfall IS on fire!,fear
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Jakob,"Yes. It is a strange phenomenon, but I can explain how it came to be. There is a massive reservoir of oil nearby that has mixed with the water. At some point, hundreds of years ago, the river was set aflame. It may have been a lightning strike, or an accident, but regardless... It has burned ever since. All of us living in Nohr have avoided the general area, for obvious reasons. So naturally, there doesn't appear to be any sort of a path for us to follow.",neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,Hmm...,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,"Corrin, do you see that statue over there? I feel the presence of a Dragon Vein nearby...maybe even two!",neutral

FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Stoneborn,None shall pass. Your life ends...here.,anger

FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,What are you two talking about? Care to enlighten the rest of us?,surprise
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Jakob,"Do you feel that breeze? It's fresh air, coming from that passageway. Unless I'm mistaken, it will take us directly to the capital of Nohr, Windmire. There were rumors of such a thing, but I never knew it actually existed...",neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,"That's...that's good news, right?",joy
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,"Yes, if what they suspect is true, this passage would be a massive shortcut.",neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Jakob,The air is unmistakable. But I don't see why the path would lead here...,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Ryoma,The Rainbow Sage must have known about this.,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Sakura,O-or maybe he built the secret path himself!,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Takumi,Yeah? Well then why didn't he just tell us about it? Sure woulda saved us a lot of trouble and guesswork...,neutral
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Hinoka,Hey! The Rainbow Sage gave us a hand-drawn map. What else do you want from the guy?,surprise
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Takumi,"Yeah, yeah. I know. Maybe he didn't tell us directly becaus he knew we still had a rat problem. I can just see the traitor now, telling the Nohrians our EXACT route...",anger
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Corrin,Takumi...do you truly believe there is still a spy among us?,surprise
FE14,21B-BurningFalls,Takumi,"I'd like to believe not, but...we haven't exactly had the best luck so far.",joy

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Corrin,"Thank you, Felicia, but I'm afraid it's not that simple. Sooner or later we all must face the consequences of our actions.

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Takumi,"Agreed. Even so, it's never a good idea to underestimate one's enemy. I refuse to lose to the Nohrians, especially while that traitor is among their ranks. We must prevail, for the sake of Hoshido and all that is good in the world!",anger

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Corrin,Traitor? Is that what Takumi told you? I might have expected as much.,surprise
FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Hinata,"Milord calls it like he sees it. He told me all about your lies and betrayal. As Lord Takumi's retainer, it's my job to punish those who cause him pain. Besides, I can't forgive you for what you did to Hoshido either. That's why I'm pleased to pieces to be the one to show you to your grave!",anger
FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Oboro,"Wait... Aren't you Corrin? Lord Takumi's brother/sister? I don't believe we've met. I'm Oboro, his retainer. Usually I'd be under orders to protect you.

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Oboro,"Huh? Ah, sorry about that. I do so despise Nohrians. So much so, in fact, that my face turns sour whenever I'm looking at one. Don't worry about it. It's nothing personal.",sadness

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Takumi,Oh? Are you still human enough to feel remorse? Fascinating. It's a fitting last emotion. I hope you feel its sting as I strike you down!,anger
FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Takumi,"Azura?! Last I heard, you were taken by Hoshidan soldiers. Ryoma worried himself sick planning your rescue. I told him it was pointless. And you proved me right, you Nohrian traitor. You should be ashamed.",anger

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Corrin,Perhaps you should take this as a lesson not to judge all Nohrians on face value. I spoke the truth. My soldiers do not harm those who do not seek to harm us.,neutral
FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Takumi,"Ha! Tell me, Corrin, how is it lies come so easily to you? Your words mean nothing in light of all the innocent Hoshidan lives you took. Including that of our dear mother, or have you forgotten your part in her murder? Yet after all that, you still have the gall to claim you aren't a savage. Pathetic.",anger

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Takumi,"Don't think this means you've won. This is only the beginning! Ryoma has already found the Rainbow Sage and received his power. You're no match for him now, even with the whole vile Nohrian army behind you! And I'm getting stronger, too! Soon I'll be unstoppable. One day you'll beg me for death, and I will happily grant you. Until then, I leave you with your guilt.",anger

FE14,10C-UnhappyReunion,Camilla,"Let him go, Corrin. He's clearly got issues. And not to brag, but Xander received the Rainbow Sage's power ages ago. If we stick together, there's no way we'll lose to the Hoshidan army.",neutral

Let's get going!",anger

FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hinoka,"Yes, I was. But I decided to try to catch up to Ryoma and Takumi on their way to Izumo.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"Ah. Well, it's good that we met up...but I have some bad news. Ryoma and Takumi are missing. We're trying to track them down.",sadness
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hinoka,"Missing? Oh gods... They are not the sort of men that simply go missing. What has happened to them, Corrin?",sadness
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,We don't know. And we've run into a few problems of our own along the way...,anger
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hinoka,"Yes, I can see that. I thought the Wind Tribe was neutral. Why are we fighting?",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"It's a long story, but I believe that we'll be able to explain ourselves to the chief. Will you join us? We could certainly use a little help.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hinoka,"Of course! Although, a LITTLE help is about all you'll get from these two...",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,What do you mean by that? Never mind... I'm just happy to have you all on our side. Let's do this!,joy
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,So. You've made it this far.,neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"You must be Chief Fuga. Please, allow me to explain—",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,No. You must earn the right to explain. Show me that you fight with honor!,anger
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,You've shown some fortitude. Now show me that you're worthy of my attention!,anger
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Bahaha! Well done. I suppose I shouldn't have underestimated one who carries the sacred Yato blade. Now, I will gladly hear an explanation for the unprovoked attack on my people.",anger
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"Yes, of course. Wait—what do you know of my blade?",surprise
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Ah, King Sumeragi and I were good friends. I learned much about the history of that weapon from him. I also shared concern for its future, which is why it was necessary for me to test you.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,Test me? How so?,surprise
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Corrin, the blade you possess has the power to link the Seal of Flames. In the wrong hands, it could unleash enough power to end the world. That's why I wanted to see for myself if you are indeed the right person to handle it.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,I see. And what of the villagers we wounded?,fear
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"I already knew that you and your associates were acting in good faith. For what reason would Hoshidan royalty attack a stranger? And then allow her party to be peacefully captured by the stranger's tribe? No, I was well aware that something was amiss.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"Well, thank you for believing in us. This is the first good news we've had in some time, I'm afraid.",joy
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Oh? Please, I would gladly hear your full story. But let us freshen up from the battle and sit down to a proper meal first.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"I appreciate the invitation—and believe me, a bit of rest and a meal are what we need... But we're in search of Lord Ryoma and Lord Takumi. We haven't a moment to spare.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,I see. Then you must be on your way. Best of luck.,neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"Well, I suppose that worked out better than it could have...",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Azura,Yes. I'm glad to know we can still count the Wind Tribe among our friends.,joy
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,I'm still puzzling a bit over what Fuga said about my blade. Do you know anything about the Seal of Flames?,anger
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Azura,"No. But I found it curious that he described ""linking"" the seal. Could there be more than one Seal of Flames? If so, could there be more than one sacred blade out there? It is a troubling idea. What if our enemies already possess a similar weapon?",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,Right. That is a troubling thought. But let's focus on the problems in front of us before inventing new ones.,neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Azura,"You're right, Corrin. I suppose I'm getting carried away.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"Perhaps we've spoken too soon. Here comes Chief Fuga, and he appears to be in a hurry.",fear
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,Corrin! Please wait a moment.,neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"How can we help you, Chief? Is everything OK?",surprise
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Yes, yes, thank you. It occurred to me that we might be able to make a mutually beneficial arrangement. You are in need of all the men and women you can get. And we have a skilled diviner who could use some real-world experience. His name is Hayato, and he would like to offer his services to your party.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hayato,Good day.,joy
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,Um...,neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hayato,Is there a problem?,surprise
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,Please! Don't judge him by his youthful appearance. Hayato has mastered a number of unique skills that make him invaluable.,neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hayato,"I don't mean to sound conceited, but... You would be lucky to have me on your team.",sadness
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,Very well! I certainly won't turn down your assistance at a time like this.,anger
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Splendid. I hope he makes a valuable addition to your team. And as for you, Hayato, I'm glad to finally be able to offer you this chance to travel.",joy
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,Travel? I hope you both realize that this isn't exactly a vacation...,surprise
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Of course. It's just that Hayato has not had much opportunity to leave the village. In addition to helping you, he will be exploring the world for the first time.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"I see. I think I understand exactly how he feels. After all, I spent most of my childhood locked in a Nohrian castle.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"Well, then I'm sure you two will have a lot to talk about. And I trust you'll take good care of our Hayato.",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hayato,Chief! Must I remind you again that I am no longer a child?,surprise
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,"You're right, you're right. I must admit that I still feel a bit protective at times...",neutral
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Hayato,"Dad! I mean...Chief! Lord/Lady Corrin, he's not my dad. He's just looked after me since I was a child.",joy
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Corrin,"It's OK. I understand. Anyway...we should get going. Welcome aboard, Hayato. And thank you for everything, Chief Fuga.",joy
FE14,08B-FierceWinds,Fuga,No need to thank me. Please feel free to come back here anytime you'd like. I'm proud to have met the one whom the sacred Yato chose. We shall meet again.,joy
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,Here we are... The Hoshidan capital. What a long journey it's been.,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Azura,"Yes, but soon this long ordeal will finally be over. If we can take control of the capital and seize the throne room, victory will be ours.",neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,Azura... Are you OK with that?,surprise
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Azura,...Why do you ask?,surprise
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,"We're about to conquer the place where you grew up...the castle you called home. If this is too much for you, I'd understand. You can leave the fighting to me. If you need to, go hide somewhere safe until our work here is done.",neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Azura,"Thank you, my friend, but I'm afraid I can't do that. I didn't side with Nohr just to lose my nerve and turn tail at the pivotal moment. I told you once, and I shall tell you again. I am with you until the bitter end. Ending this war will benefit us all, even the kingdom I grew up in. This is what I need to do, not just for you, not just for the world... But also for the Hoshidan siblings I love so dearly. That is what I believe, with all my heart. It is why I am able to bear this burden.",sadness
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,Azura...,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Azura,Speaking of our Hoshidan siblings... We never did find him.,sadness
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,You're right. I don't know what to think... It's too much to process right now.,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Azura,"Poor Takumi. Our troops made a thorough search of the area, but didn't find a thing. Nothing... Not even a single clue as to where he might have gone. It's as though Takumi just...vanished. But I know that's not possible.",neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,...,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Azura,We should probably keep this from Princess Sakura. She has enough to deal with at the moment.,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,"Yes, I agree. There will be plenty of time to further break her heart later. *sigh*",neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,"Corrin, I must speak with you.",neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,Let me guess... Is it time?,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,We have received our orders from Father. We are to invade the capital immediately. Please prepare your troops...and yourself.,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,Understood.,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Boy,"It's them! Gods, the rumors are true! The Nohrian army is headed this way!",anger

FE14,24C-Hinoka,Hans,"GWAHAHAHA!! Just try and cross us Nohrians, and watch the bodies drop!",anger
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Boy,Ahhhhhh!!,fear
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,No... Please...,sadness
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Azura,"Patience, Corrin. King Garon is close behind. There is no telling what he'll do if he sees you standing up for Hoshidans.",neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,...,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Iago,"Ah, we've finally arrived at our new castle! And no guards to stop us, heh heh. They must be in defense mode. I'd wager that all of their forces are waiting inside.",neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,"Hmm, so it would seem. This bodes well for us. Our army is large enough to surround the entire premises. We might be able to secure their surrender without raising a blade.",neutral

FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,Pardon?,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Iago,"This is our only chance to finally eliminate those pesky Hoshidan insects. They don't deserve the honor of a clean and quick surrender. Besides, so long as they live, those who follow them will never stop fighting. Now is the perfect opportunity for us to kill their royalty and stake our claim. For the glory of Nohr, every last one of the Hoshidan royals must die.",anger
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,"That's low even for you, Iago!",anger
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Iago,"Oh? Well let's ask our king, shall we? King Garon! Your Majesty! What do you think of my plan? May I proceed?",surprise
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Garon,Kill them all.,anger

FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,"... Xander, what do we—?",surprise
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,"I know. I don't like this plan any more than you do. But we must stay strong. If we falter now, the whole world will pay the price. Corrin... Camilla told me you once asked her where justice lies.",anger
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,Yes. She didn't have any more answers than I do.,neutral
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,"Little prince/princess... The sad truth is that justice is an illusion. A child's fairy tale. There is no light path that always leads to good, nor dark path that leads to evil. To believe that—to see the world in black and white—is missing half the picture. All that matters are the choices we make—especially the hard ones.",sadness
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Corrin,But this? It's too much...,surprise
FE14,24C-Hinoka,Xander,"Letting innocents die is a tragedy, but so is letting the chance for peace slip away. This is war. There is no such thing as a clean win when lives are on the line. Instead of clinging to a false sense of justice, hold strong to something true... The desire to do what you know is right and to protect the ones you love... And the ambition to see your vision of a peaceful future through to the end. If we allow evil men to let their vision take precedence over our own, we all lose. Remember that, and find solace in it.",anger

You should be pleased to know you far exceeded his expectations. Despite being a Hoshidan royal, you chose to side with our great kingdom of Nohr. You chose to remain with your Nohrian siblings and the man who raised you. Everyone at the castle was overjoyed. It greatly improved morale!

She looked an awful lot like your friend there, actually. You know—the one with the blue hair!",joy

But for this to happen, I must first ask for your cooperation.",anger

Though once enemies, our kingdoms will now strive for peace together. Since the war began, and long before, both Nohr and Hoshido were in agony. Freedoms were oppressed, possessions were plundered, the land was ravaged. Rebellions and uprisings tore our great kingdom apart. Our world was in pain. I never wish to see that happen again… Not to anyone. I won’t allow it. As such, all tribes and other peoples of Nohr shall be granted autonomy. We will not seek to expand our borders by infringing upon Hoshidan land. Instead, we shall strive to build a foundation of trust. Both kingdoms will do all we can to plant a seed of mutual respect. In the years to come, I look forward to watching that seed grow. We have a long road ahead of us. It will not be easy, but it is worth treading. On this day, as I assume my father’s throne, I vow to steady our course. The night sky is dark, but that is what allows the stars to shine so brilliantly. As king, I hope to be the light that guides Nohr out of this long night. I swear I will not rest until our beloved home awakens to a brighter tomorrow.

I always took it for granted that Ryoma would eventually be king. And after him, I suppose I expected to pass on the honor to Takumi. I never had any interest in the throne. My brothers were the born leaders…",sadness

FE14,28C-Endgame:NightBreaksThrough,Hinoka,"Corrin… No, it’s fine. It is what it is. To be honest, I still battle with feelings of hatred toward the Nohrian army. The way they violated our kingdom for so many years… I won’t soon forget it. But in time, I know even those wounds will heal. I trust you and Xander to prevent such things from ever happening again.

We sacrificed so much to arrive at this victory we’re now happily celebrating. The path I chose was difficult, but I now know it wasn’t the wrong one.

FE14,16B-PleasurePalace,Corrin,Gods... How could this have happened?,surprise

FE14,16B-PleasurePalace,Takumi,"*cough* *cough* Don't worry, Sakura. It's not what you think it is. It'll probably just go away on its own. Or...maybe Azura can try singing for me! Didn't that work before?",sadness

FE14,01-Nohr,Xander,"Yes. You should have sensed it as well. The blood of dragons flows in your veins, as it does in all royals. You must learn to harness this draconic power wherever you may find it. Heal your wounds, Corrin, then find the courage to come at me again.",neutral

FE14,01-Nohr,Corrin,"Thanks, Xander. I couldn't have done it without your, uh, tough love.",joy

FE14,01-Nohr,Corrin,Really?! Does that mean...,surprise

FE14,01-Nohr,Corrin,"It...it really is. Thanks, Elise. Wow... I'm finally leaving this place... Maybe now I can join you all as a soldier, fighting for Nohr?",joy

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,But isn't it dangerous for Father to travel to a place like this?,fear

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,The theatre? What theatre?,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"Ah, that's right. This is your first time in the fair town of Cyrkensia. This place is known for its incredible singers and dancers. They always put on a big performance whenever Father comes to visit.",neutral
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,That's interesting... Sounds exciting.,joy
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"If you're free, you should take the time to watch. It's sure to be breathtaking. Even warriors need to rest now and then. Just don't get carried away. Anyway, I really must be going. I'll catch up with you later!",neutral
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,"Bye, Leo!",anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,"It's so hard to put up a front when I'm still reeling from the tragedy in Cheve. As fun as it sounds, I'm in no mood for a show right now. Maybe Hans was lying. It's possible Father didn't really intend for us to... I'll ask him about it whenever I get the chance. I need to know. And if he did give the order, maybe I can convince him there's a better way.",anger

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,Huh?!,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Garon,"When I heard that your group destroyed Cheve, I couldn't have been prouder. Rebellions are like seeds. One must salt the earth before they sprout. I knew you'd eventually come around and learn to accept my method of ruling. I'm told you even enjoyed watching the life spark fade from the injured rebel soldiers. Hans praised you highly for displaying behavior befitting a Nohrian royal.",anger

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,So the Hoshidans are responsible for that singer's curse. I should have known.,neutral
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Kumagera,Singer? Curse? What are you rambling on about?,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,Don't play dumb. One of your underlings performed a cursed song to hurt our father!,anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Kumagera,"I have no idea what you're referring to, nor do I care. Leave it to a filthy Nohrian to fabricate a story to try and distract us.",anger

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Keaton,No! No... I mean...maybe. I'm maybe just a little lost. but mostly not lost at all. It's complicated.,sadness

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,We somehow managed to win...but it seems that singer got away. Who even has the kind of power necessary to curse Father with a song?,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"I don't know, but I intend to find out. She's most certainly with the Hoshidans. We'll all be in a world of hurt if she shows up again. She must be stopped.",sadness

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,WHAT?! Y-you can't be serious! It was the Hoshidans who attacked us. The other performers are innocent!,anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Garon,"Foolish boy/girl. This is the only way to keep our royal family safe. Perhaps if you had caught the guilty party, the others could have been spared. But we must destroy anyone who might pose a threat to the Nohrian throne. As I said, rebellions are like seeds, and we must salt the earth before they sprout. You've seen many battles by now.

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,"Wait! Both of you! Father, I tried to bring this up earlier, but now it simply can't wait. You keep ordering me to take lives of innocent people. Why? If we showed mercy and tried to talk things out instead, no one would have to die. Even if we manage to win the war this way, people will lose faith in our kingdom. That's hardly even winning...",anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Garon,"Lose faith? Are you a princess or a saint, foolish child? After what you did in Cheve, I'm shocked to hear such a moralistic complaint.",anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,"It's true... I didn't stop Hans in Cheve, as much as I wanted to. But what happened there tortures me, Father. It's no way to solve a conflict. Killing innocent people for our own benefit...for selfish glory and control... Is that really the Nohrian way? Is that really the legacy you wish to leave behind?!",anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Garon,"You finally understand, though you still fight it. I desire only to rule Hoshido. I, and those who follow me, will do whatever it takes to achieve that.

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"Of course I don't. Why do you think I helped you save Kaze and Rinkah? But just because we disagree doesn't mean we can openly disobey Father. If you do, one of these days he'll overreact a have you killed on the spot. Trust me, Brother/Sister. It's best to just stay silent and follow orders.",anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,That's what Camilla said...,neutral

I understand your perspective, but I simply can't carry out the orders Father just gave. I refuse to harm the innocent. All I want to do is protect them—to protect everyone.",neutral
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"Corrin, wait! Think about who you're talking to. You know me better than that. As I said, we must follow Father's orders...or at least appear to follow them.",neutral
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,What do you mean?,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"Listen well. We may not be able to openly disobey him, but we're not powerless. Us royal siblings have made an art of appearing to be good little soldiers... All while secretly manipulating things for the better from behind the scenes. How do you think we've survived this long with our souls intact?",neutral
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,Leo... I'm impressed. But isn't it dangerous to go behind Father's back all the time?,fear
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"Sometimes the righteous path is the most treacherous one to walk. Listen up. Start searching in unlikely places to give the performers time to escape. If our soldiers catch any of them, I'll step in and insist on killing them myself. I can't promise we'll be able to save them all, but that's the best I can do.",anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,"Leo... Thank you. I'm sorry I doubted you, even if just for a moment.",sadness
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"Heh, no worries. But don't think I'm doing this for you! You know how whiny Camilla and Elise get when you're unhappy. No one wants that. Besides, doing things like this is exciting. It's not like I'm a hero or anything.",anger
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,Huh?! My Brynhildr is...glowing! And so is your Yato... What's going on?!,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,Could it be? Is this the transformation the Rainbow Sage spoke of...? WHOA!!,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,The Yato has transformed! This must be the Grim Yato the rainbow Sage told me about.,fear
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,Grim Yato... what are you talking about?! Did I miss something?,surprise

FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,The Sage said that? Incredible. Does that mean...I'm that Nohrian hero?,surprise
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Corrin,That's the only explanation. There's some sort of otherworldly connection between our weapons. The sage also said my sword is fated to become the true Seal of Flames. That's all he was able to tell me.,neutral
FE14,14C-VoiceOfParadise,Leo,"The Seal of Flames... I wish I had time to digest all this, but time is a luxury we don't have. Iago and Hans might have already captured some of the singers.

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Camilla,"It's quite bothersome, darling. The Wind Tribe is supposed to be neutral. What's more, cutting through their village is the only safe option we have left.",fear
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Elise,"Big ol' liars! They're about as neutral as...um... Oh, you know what I mean! They weren't even remotely swayed when Camilla used her feminine wiles on them! That can only mean one thing... They hate Nohr. Or women. Or just Nohrian women.",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Camilla,"Elise, you silly thing. I did not use wiles of any kind, love. But you may have a point about them hating Nohr. Long ago, their village was attacked by Faceless, sent there by Nohrian mages. That said, I'm afraid there's probably little we can do to win them over.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Hmmm. Well, something must be done. I'm going to try reasoning with them one more time.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Camilla,"You are? Oh, little Corrin! Are you sure that's a good idea?",surprise
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"It's our only option, I'm afraid. If that attack still has them apprehensive, I'll apologize on Nohr's behalf. We must earn their trust—show them that our new way is the way of peace.",fear
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Camilla,"Aww, what a sweet little brother/sister I have! But, darling, what if they don't listen? What if they try to attack you?! The thought is just too much to bear!",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"I appreciate your concern, Camilla, but I'll be fine! We must end this war as soon as possible. We haven't a moment to lose. As wielder of the Yato, it is my duty to do whatever I can to bring peace to the world. Wait here for me, OK? This may take a while, but I'm certain we'll eventually come to an understanding.",neutral

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"I am Fuga, chief of the Wind Tribe.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Oh! Sorry, I had no idea. I am Prince/Princess Corrin of Nohr. May I request an audience with you?",sadness
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Hmm. I was informed there were outsiders at the entrance of my village. Not just any outsiders, but ones claiming to be Nohrian royalty. I am intrigued.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,It must have taken great courage for a Nohrian prince/princess to face me like this. I will hear what you have to say.,joy
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,You will?! Thank you!,joy
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Yes, but not here. The winds cry out with a ferocity no mortal could hope to rival. We shall venture to my castle, Reppu. There, your story will be heard. ...Corrin, is it? In time I will require some information. It's about that blade you grasp. Come.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,My sword? Hmm...,surprise
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"That's quite a tale you just told. I believe I understand your aim. Just this once, I will allow your army to pass through this village. I will alert my people that you are welcomed guests who are not to be disturbed.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Thank you so much, sir! Oh, but before I depart... You said there was something you wanted to ask me?",joy
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Yes. It is about that golden blade of yours. That is the legendary Yato, is it not?",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Yes, it is. How did you know?",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"I used to be close friends with Sumeragi, the former king of Hoshido. I was always enthralled by the various Hoshidan legends he shared with me. The legend behind that blade of yours particularly captured my imagination...",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,You were friends with the Hoshidan king?! But wouldn't that make you...our enemy?,surprise
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Calm yourself, young prince/princess. That was many years ago. My tribe has since adopted a policy of neutrality in regard to this war. Though Sumeragi was a friend of mine, we are not allied with Hoshido. However...",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,What's wrong?,surprise
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"That divine Yato is the key to the Seal of Flames. Sumeragi once warned me...that if it fell into the wrong hands, it would lead to our world's destruction.",neutral

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"But are you truly worthy? I believe a test is in order. If you are unworthy of wielding the Yato, I will pry it from your dead hands!",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,What?! But you just said that we could pass through here safely!,fear
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"You may—if what you say is true, and you truly mean to bring about peace. If not, the blade will fail you, and I shall take up its noble cause in your stead.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Please, wait! I don't want to fight you!",sadness

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Ho ho, what have we here? Two more wielders of legendary weapons! The glistening metal of Siegfried working alongside the ancient pages of Brynhildr... This fight will be the stuff of legends! Let me witness the power of those who align themselves with the Yato wielder. I will gather my best soldiers, including one nearly as skilled as myself... Hayato!",neutral

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,A child? You expect me to clash blades with a cute little boy?!,anger

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Um, right. OK then. He sure is confident for someone so...diminutive. He looks shorter than Elise.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,What?! What does height have to do with anything? Foul beast! Fuga! We're not gonna let him/her get away with insulting our honor are we?!,anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Ho ho ho. If you're that angry, then exact your revenge on the battlefield. You are the most talented mage in the entire village, young one. Unleash your power, and show these outsiders the Wind Tribe's might!",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,"Hmph, like I'm even capable of holding back.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Prince/Princess Corrin, the time has come. We will be waiting outside the castle. Come find us when you are ready to meet your fate head-on.",neutral

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,Let's get this over with. I have better things to do.,neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,Hmph! You're stronger...than you appear...,neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Are you worthy to follow he/she who wields the legendary Yato? If so, prove it!",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,"So you're the one the divine Yato chose? Pfft. Laughable. I thought the chosen hero would be a warrior, but you're more bark than bite.",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,I'm being ridiculed...by a child. *sigh*. When Fuga told me I'd be battling someone as strong as he was...you're not exactly what I had in mind.,sadness
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,"I TOLD you I'm no child! Do not underestimate me, fool! Prepare to crumble beneath the weight of my magic!",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Do your worst, kid!",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"The time has come, Corrin. Show me what you're made of. Prove to me and to yourself that you are worthy to wield the divine Yato!",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,I used to wonder myself if I was worthy. But now that I stand before you... All of my doubts have fallen away upon the wind. Behold my power!,anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"You fought well, Corrin. As did your loyal allies. I see now you truly are worthy of wielding the Yato. The divine blade chose well.",anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,Do you truly believe that? ... Thank you. I'm...I'm so happy!,joy
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,Wah? Why are you smiling like that?! You look ridiculous!,anger
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"I'm just so grateful to finally put my own doubts to rest. All this time, I've struggled with the question of whether or not I'm worthy... Whether or not I chose the right path... Whether I can truly use this divine blade to bring peace to the world...",sadness
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,"For our fated hero, he/she's so...humble. It's odd!",sadness
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Fuga,"Worry not, young prince/princess. Your power is beyond question, and your aim is true. No matter what path you walk or which kingdom you fight for... I am certain you will always make the right choice and use that blade for good.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Thank you, Fuga.",joy
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,"Hmph, fine. If Fuga accepts you as a hero, I suppose I must do the same.",neutral
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Corrin,"Thanks, Hayato. Glad to hear it.",joy
FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Hayato,"But know that the next time we meet on the battlefield, I won't lose. Divine blade or no divine blade, I won't tolerate a defeat!

FE14,20C-WindsOfChange,Azura,"Are you ready for this, Corrin? We'll arrive at the Hoshidan capital soon. The battles ahead will be our most difficult yet. Prepare yourself.",neutral

FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Well, it took some doing, but we've finally arrived at Notre Sagesse. The ferry ride over was rather smooth too. Perhaps our luck is improving.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Silas,"Perhaps. Although, I must admit, I can't shake this strange feeling I have...",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Oh? Is something the matter?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Silas,"Well, King Garon said this place would be overflowing with Hoshidans. And yet we were able to disembark from the ferry without so much as a scuffle.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"That's a good point. I was so happy that we arrived safely, it hadn't occurred to me.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Silas,"As a matter of fact, I don't see any soldiers around here either. Not a single one. I can't help thinking this is either a trap or some big misunderstanding.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"We'll keep our eyes open. In the meantime, I must learn more about the Rainbow Sage. Let's talk to the locals. Maybe they can help solve these mysteries. Oi! You there! Pardon me, ma'am, but may I speak with you a moment?",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Old Woman,Hm? Are you talking to me?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I am. So sorry to bother you, but I was hoping you might be able to help me. To start, we had heard that the Hoshidan army was stationed here, but it seems...",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Old Woman,"Hoshidans? Yeah, there was a whole group of 'em around here not too long ago. They were armed up to their teeth. Didn't do us no harm, but they were a bit forceful. They took the Rainbow Sage, though. Said they was his new guards. Most of us thought that was a load o' horse dung, but who are we to argue?",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,They kidnapped the Rainbow Sage?! Dastards! Do you happen to know where they took him?,anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Old Woman,"Surely. They carted him up Mount Sagesse. It's right over there - ya can't miss it. You fellas ain't plannin' on goin' up there, are you? Cuz that's a fool's errand. There ain't nothin' but heartache up there. If ya like livin', you'd best stay down here.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,What do you mean?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Old Woman,"Climbing that mountain is like the ultimate test o' grit and the like. Every now and then some kook tries to scale it. Most never make it back. Rumor has it, if you reach the summit and enter the Sevenfold Sanctuary... you die.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Sevenfold Sanctuary... How mysterious.,fear
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azura,"What do you want to do, Corrin? It sounds like a trap.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"It does, but that can't be helped. There's no turning back now. If we fail this mission, I truly believe Father will have me killed. He's using these missions to test me, maybe even torment me. I mustn't falter. I must end this war at all costs, but I can't do that if I'm dead. If I'm to be tested here, so be it. I shall not fail.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azura,"I understand. If you insist on going, I won't try to stop you. I will follow you to the end.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Thank you, Azura.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Old Woman,"I don't know why you came here or why you wanna climb that thing, but good luck. Just try yer best not to croak, ya hear? It pains me every time some young wannabe hero dies tryin' to scale that mountain.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I promise I shall return safely. Thank you for the valuable information, ma'am. You have our gratitude.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"*pant* *pant*  Phew! Climbing this thing really is a test. A test of endurance. Good gods, this is taking forever.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"Aww, my poor widdle Corrin. You look so exhausted! Why don't you have a little rest? You can ride my dragon for a bit.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"That's very sweet of you, Camilla. But I'll survive. Surely someone else could use the break more then myself.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"Oh, Corrin. Why are you so cute?! I want to hug you and never let you go! I'll never forgive those pesky Hoshidans for making you suffer like this. When we get to the top, I'll make sure they pay tenfold for the pain they've caused you!  ... Hmm? What might that be? I think I see something.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Could it be... the Sevenfold Sanctuary?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azura,It would appear so. This is where the battle truly begins. Stay on your guard. The place is likely filled with Hoshidan soldiers waiting to ambush.,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"Don't worry, Corrin. This is nothing to fret over. I'm with you all the way, and so are the rest of us. And if your evil fake Hoshidan sisters are in there, all the better. I will not lose.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"You're right - we must win no matter what, no matter who we find inside.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"Pardon the interruption, Lady Hinoka, but the Nohrian army has arrived.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"What?! They actually climbed the mountain and lived to tell the tale? Their little ragtag team is more skilled then I gave them credit for. Still, there's no way they can best our troops after such an exhausting climb. We must keep the Rainbow Sage out of their grasp no matter what. Prepare for battle, everyone! This is NOT a drill!",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azama,Why must you resort to violence? I really do despise savages...,anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azama,"You have much strength... I am loath to do so, but I must retreat...",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Setsuna,You made it all the way up here... Surprising...,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Setsuna,"I lost. Oh, well. Guess I'll retreat for now...",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rinkah,"I am Rinkah, proud daughter of the Flame Tribe's chief. I will not allow you to capture the Rainbow Sage!",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rinkah,"Why didn't... you kill me? Perhaps we were wrong about Nohr... No, it can't be! This way of peace must be... Corrin's path...",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"I am Kaze, a ninja in the service of the Hoshidan royal family. But enough pleasantries... to battle!",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,Such power... and determination... you are truly a worthy opponent. Perhaps the royal family was wrong about Nohrians...,anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"I applaud you for making it this far, but your journey ends here. I will not allow you to take this territory OR the Rainbow Sage!",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"Forgive me, Hoshido... I just wasn't ... strong enough...",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azama,"Lord/Lady Corrin, I presume? Lady Hinoka speaks of you often.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Sh-she does?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azama,"She does. She said you are her ""sweet little brother/sister"". But I'm confused... Given her praises, I never expected to see you attacking a defenseless monk. You must have given in to the savagery so abundant in the Kingdom of Nohr. But if fate would have you cut me down, so be it. Do as you will, I am not afraid.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Setsuna,"You're Lord/Lady Corrin, yes? I'm Setsuna... I'm Lady Hinoka's retainer... Nice to meet you.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Polite even to the enemy... I'd expect nothing less from Hinoka's guardian.,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Setsuna,"Oh, are you the enemy? Even though you're her brother/sister? Huh.",surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Um... yes. I mean, it's complicated. Did you really not know that?",surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Setsuna,Hm? No... Maybe? It doesn't really matter... Guess it's time for you to die now.,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rinkah,"I don't wish to fight you, Corrin. But it seems I have no choice.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I don't want to fight you either. After all, I owe you my life. You took me back to Hoshido during my hour of need.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rinkah,"Well, you saved my life as well. If you hadn't intervened, King Garon would have killed me.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I wish it didn't have to be this way, but I can't afford to back down. It's difficult to explain, but it's for the good of all. Please forgive me.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rinkah,"We understand each-other perfectly. Enough talk. Prepare yourself. I may owe you my life, but I don't have it in me to hold back!",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"So we meet again, Lord/Lady Corrin. After our last encounter, I did not think we would battle again. But as an enemy of Hoshido, it is my duty to take you down. I respect you too much to hold back. I shall do all I can to vanquish you.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I understand, and I shall do the same. Let's do this!",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,Corrin! We meet at last!,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Hinoka...so you're the one who took the Rainbow Sage.,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"You really are fighting for Nohr eh? I had to see it with my own eyes. You know, I spent so many years wishing that I could be near you. Now you're right in front of me, but we couldn't be further apart.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,I'm sorry it had to be this way. I know you wanted me to return to Hoshido and for us to be a family. It kills me to have caused you so much pain. It is a burden I shall always bear. However I... I...,sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"I know. You needn't say another word. I also know you won't hold back. I can read your sad eyes like an open book. After all, though we hardly know each other, you're still my little brother/sister.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Hinoka....,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"If you're that determined to fight, then so be it. Let's see if all that resolve is enough to take down your own sister!",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,Azura?! Is that really you?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Azura,"Hello, Hinoka.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"Thank goodness you’re safe! I was so upset when I heard you were missing. I’m sorry we couldn’t stop those rogue soldiers from taking you away.

FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,So you’re to betray us too? …So be it.,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"Heh heh, I finally found you...",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,You! Aren't you Princess Camilla of Nohr?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"I am. And you are Princess Hinoka of Hoshido. Corrin's ""real"" sister.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"Yes, I am. All I've wanted for as long as I can remember is to bring him/her home. I still feel the same way. The last thing I want is to fight him/her. Corrin belongs with us! Can't you see that?!",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"Oh my, how wrong you are. My sweet brother/sister will never return to you. He/She knows who his/her true family is, and it's not the one he/she left in Hoshido. He/She chose Nohr. More specifically, he/she chose me over you. Deal with it.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,You! Y-you'll pay for that!,anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"Now prepare to beg, Princess. My dear Corrin only needs one big sister! That's why you're the one person I simply can't lose to!",anger

FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,What?! How is that possible? I don't understand... Corrin! What is the meaning of this? Was this your doing?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Run, Hinoka. Why are you hesitating? GO!",surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Hinoka,"... Fine I'll retreat, for now. Before that devil you call a sister stabs me in the back. ... good-bye, my brother/sister.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Camilla,"Aww, my little Corrin. You really are too kind for your own good. Telling us all not to kill any Hoshidans before we even entered the building... You certainly made things difficult on us, but it was a fun challenge at least! Are you certain we shouldn't chase after them? It's not too late to kill them all...",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"No, Camilla. Let them go. We're blazing a new path for Nohr, one of mercy. There will be no pointless killing. That is the only way to end this war. OK, now that we've seized Notre Sagesse, all that's left is to find the Rainbow Sage.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"Is that true, Lord/Lady Corrin? Do you really mean to bring peace to this world?",surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Kaze?! What are you doing here? Why didn't you retreat with Hinoka and the others?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"I asked my question first. You said your path is one of peace, and that you seek to end the war. Is that true? if so, why did you choose to return to Nohr?",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Yes, I spoke the truth. At first I returned because I couldn't bring myself to betray my Nohrian siblings. But I soon realized that being a Nohrian prince/princess granted me certain opportunities. As a Nohrian, I can change things from the inside, stop the death and destruction. Without me, the Nohrian army would keep slaughtering the Hoshidan army... and the Hoshidans would keep retaliating. A never-ending cycle of hate and death. Since I chose to side with Nohr, it's my responsibility to end that cycle.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,...,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I'm sorry, Kaze. But if your intention is to take me to Hoshido, you're out of luck. I won't let anything come between me and my goal of bringing peace to this world.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"I see. I have only to look in your eyes to witness how determined you are. Yours is an admirable goal, milord/milady. As such, I request permission to join your ranks.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Huh?!,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"Please forgive me for my past brashness. I should not have judged you so quickly. When you left Hoshido, I thought you had betrayed us. Like the others, I was certain that you meant to destroy Hoshido. I see now that I was horribly mistaken. Your reasons for siding with Nohr aren't just sound. They're actually quite pure. You have inspired me to hope for a peace I had long ago dismissed. Please allow me to lend my strength to your noble cause.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Thank you for your kind words, Kaze. I would be happy to have you, but... You know the others will call you a traitor, right? Can you live with that?",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"Words do not harm me, so long as I act with honor. I do not regret my decision.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"That's all I needed to hear. From now on, you're one of us. Welcome to the team, Kaze!",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,"Thank you, Lord/Lady Corrin. I shall serve you to the best of my ability.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,I don't doubt it. Now to find the Rainbow Sage. He should be somewhere in this building...,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Kaze,Of course. Allow me to show you the way to his quarters.,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,Hmmmm...,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Um... pardon me, but are you the Rainbow Sage.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"I am the one you seek. You fought a trying battle to get here, young warrior with a heavy heart.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I did... I heard you have the power to make me stronger than I am. Please, oh wise sage, would you consider blessing me with your strength?",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"Hoo hoo hoo... Oh, you're a funny little dragon, aren't you? You have already gone through my trial, and so have already received my power. Does not your body feel lighter and stronger than when it first arrived?",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,I was so distracted I hadn't really... but you're right. I suppose it does!,joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"All who seek to find me must struggle through various trials to do so. It is amid that struggle that I witness and unlock their true power and potential. You did well, hero of darkness.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Thank you so much! I can't wait to show Xander my new power.,joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"There is one matter we must discuss, brave Corrin. You have in your possession the legendary Yato blade, do you not?",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,How do you know that? And wait... How do you know my name?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"Hoo hoo hoo, how humorous. I know all that there is to know! I know all that you have done and all that you are still to do. But I won't spoil the ending. That's for you to discover. However, the fates will allow me to divulge one little tidbit to set you on your path... As wielder of the divine blade, it is you who will solve the mystery of the Seal of Flames. The Seal is the key to bringing an end to the hatred and war that soil these lands. Solve the mystery, and you will bring peace to this world at long last. So it shall pass.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,The Seal of Flames... Where do I start?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"Your Yato is the key... that is your first clue. Unfortunately, it seems the Nohrian hero who would aid you is not present. That will change in the not-too-distant future. When the time comes, this will help you lead the way. Lift up your blade, Corrin.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"As you wish, Sage...",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage," I, who forged the sacred blade... I, who committed the great sin... I, who wove the divine colors... I call on you now, Seal of Flames!",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,What... just happened?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"Nothing, yet. I merely awakened a seed that was already sown. When you enlist the help of another hero of Nohr, your blade will evolve. A blade fierce enough to guide us through the night... the Grim Yato.",fear
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"The Grim Yato... Once I've unlocked it, will I be able to find the Seal?",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"The Grim Yato is a part of the Seal of Flames, though it is not it's final form. Perhaps one day you will meet your fate head-on and unlock the Seal's power. Perhaps... That is all I can say. Your path is an arduous one, but I believe in you. You'd better get going, young hero. The King is awaiting your return.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,What a success! We secured the territory and even found the Rainbow Sage. Let's hurry back to the castle and tell Father we completed his mission.,fear
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Iago,"Heh heh, not so fast, Lord/Lady Corrin.",joy
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Iago?! What are you doing here?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Iago,"I am still at the castle, foolish prince/princess. What you see is merely an illusion. King Garon has tasked me with informing you of his latest command.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Another command? Already?,neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Iago,"Aren't you lucky? If it were up to me, you would be dead and buried. King Garon doesn't wish for our enemies to obtain the Rainbow Sage's strength. So it is now your illustrious privilege to carry out his will by killing the sage.",neutral
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Are you insane?! I can't do that! I won't! The Rainbow Sage is a force for good. I will not repay his kindness with death. And the Hoshidan high prince, Ryoma, has already received his power. It's too late to prevent it. To kill the Sage now would not only be cruel but pointless.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Iago,"I'm afraid an order is an order, Lord/Lady Corrin. As you well know by now, to disobey a direct order from the King is treason. Not even your meddling siblings could save you if you disobey once more. If you value your life, I would rethink your refusal.",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,You dastard! I won't do it! I won't...,anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"Worry not, young hero. All things must pass.",neutral

FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Sage! You heard all that?,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"Hoo hoo, you never cease to amuse. As I said, I know all there is to know. I am grateful that you chose to protect me, even at the risk of your own life. But now it is my turn to protect you. My time has finally come. I am ready.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,Wh-what are you saying? You can't mean...,surprise
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"I am older than you can fathom. My time to pass into the next world is long overdue. When higher beings like myself stay in this realm too long, we eventually go insane. My power is too great to allow that, as I might even destroy this world I so love. I've known for some time now I must die soon. But not until I gave you my strength. Now that my work is done, so too is my time here.",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"Please, no! You don't have to do this! I'll find a way to convince Father that...",sadness
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Rainbow Sage,"Thank you for your kindness, Corrin. That kindness may just save this world. Never forget that life is the most precious gift of all. Protect it. Cherish it. And weather your path is bathed in light... or in the gentle veil of darkness... Allow yourself to be happy. This is such a lovely world... Don't take it for granted. Do this, and your soul shall give hope to the future, brave prince/princess... Do this, and it will shine brightly with all the colors... of the... ... ...",joy

FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Iago,"Hmph. You and your loopholes. Well, I suppose dead is dead. You technically fulfilled King Garon’s order. You sneaky little rat…",anger
FE14,11C-RainbowSage,Corrin,"I'm so sorry, Sage... I should have found a way to stop this. I chose this path to bring peace to the world. To stop the senseless death... Yet here I am again, powerless to save an innocent life. I failed you, Rainbow Sage... Forgive me...",sadness
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,The road ahead seems heavily forested. Is that where we're going?,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Azura,"Yes. It is dense, but there's a path that leads to the Bottomless Canyon. This whole area is the domain of Mokushu, another independent nation. If we encounter any of its citizens, they should be friendly, but... We would be wise to remember how Nohr compromised Izumo before we arrived.",neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Kaze,"I wouldn't worry about Nohr strong-arming Mokushu, milady. The locals are well known for their proficiency in the martial arts. Many great ninja have sharpened their craft here. No, it's likely that Nohr's strategists would have tried to avoid this area. Even if it meant taking the long route.",neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Azura,And we haven't heard about any battles in the area—another good sign.,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,Very well. Let's proceed.,neutral

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,No! Please! I'm defeated. I did not show up here to challenge all of you by myself. I came here to surrender...and to seek amnesty.,sadness
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,And why should we trust you?,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,"Well, to be honest...you shouldn't. I tried to kill you. But you saw what Lord Leo was about to do to me. I can no longer return to Nohr. I am exiled. Without the backing of an army, I am of little danger to you. But maybe I could be of some assistance...",fear
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,Hmm...,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Azura,Corrin! Surely you can't be considering his proposal?,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Hinoka,Can I cut him yet?,anger
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,"Eeeek! Stay away from me, please!",fear
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,I think we should bring him with us.,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,"Wait, really?",surprise
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Azura,"Yes, really, Corrin?",surprise
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,"Yes. As he said, he's of little danger to us by himself. And he may prove to have some value. Lastly, it is not the Hoshidan way to turn one's back on the helpless.",fear

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,"Oh, thank you, Prince/Princess Corrin! I can't believe I let King Garon convince me that you deserved to die. What you've done here today shows your true character—that of a brave leader!",joy

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,"Yes, milady!",neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,"Ahh. This forest air is refreshing. And I have to say. I'm enjoying this path a fair bit more than the Eternal Stairway... Are we getting anywhere close to the Bottomless Canyon, Sakura?",joy

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Azura,I'm not sure we're dealing with Nohr...,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,I think she's right. I know that Nohr wants no fight with the kingdom of Mokushu.,neutral

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Zola,Gah! Your guess is as good as mine! Perhaps Nohr has made an alliance with Mokushu.,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Kotaro,The deformed one is correct. Our kingdom has made an arrangement with Nohr.,neutral

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,"And what is your quarrel with us, Daimyo Kotaro? We merely seek passage through your territory.",neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Azura,Yes. Our understanding was that Mokushu is an independent nation. Yet you are now beholden to Nohr?,joy
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Kotaro,"Beholden? Pah! Mokushu is beholden to no nation. Our interests simply happen to line up with those of Nohr for the time being. Once Hoshido is defeated, King Garon will grant us considerable new territory. We've long been waiting for the chance to expand. And this war is the perfect opportunity.",joy
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Corrin,So you're a war profiteer. How noble.,neutral
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Kaze,Gods. The famous daimyo of Mokushu turns out to be a scheming politician. I don't even have words for how disappointing that is.,anger
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Kotaro,"And even if you did, it wouldn't make a difference. Grow up, foolish Hoshidans. Only the ambitious prosper in this world.",anger

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Takumi,Tell me! What did I do?,surprise

FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Hinoka,Cheve...so he's on his way to Nohr right now!,anger
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Kagero,I can only assume so. I was given the order to return to Hoshido and report this information... But I was careless while traveling through Mokushu and ended up being caught. I must apologize to everyone for such shameful conduct.,sadness
FE14,10B-NinjaVillage,Hinoka,It's OK. We're just glad to see you alive. And knowing that Ryoma is still out there is valuable information to have.,joy

FE14,04-Hoshido,Ryoma,"Are those the Nohrian royals? They’re not your real family. I still remember the day you were taken. In those days, there was tension between Hoshido and Nohr, but no full-blown war. Not until King Garon lured King Sumeragi-our father-to Cheve under false pretenses. He said it was for a peace conference. Ha! His real plan was to murder our father in cold blood. And to make matters even worse…he kidnapped you.",anger

FE14,04-Hoshido,Hinoka,"Yeah, we’re fine. Who are you? I thought I knew most of my brother’s troops. Anyway, I appreciate the help, but it’s really not necessary. It takes more than a few dozen 800-pound monsters to bring me down!",anger

FE14,04-Hoshido,Corrin,Oh! Um…,surprise
FE14,04-Hoshido,Ryoma,"Hinoka was so attached to you when you were little, Corrin. When you were taken from us, she cried for months. One day she stopped crying and pick up the naginata.

She vowed to bring you back to us someday… And now here you are.",sadness

FE14,04-Hoshido,Ryoma,That’s why Nohr sends those…things. They have no souls-no will of their own.That’s why they are able to penetrate the barrier and terrorize our borders.,anger
FE14,04-Hoshido,Corrin,But…the Nohrians wouldn’t send monsters to terrorize innocent people…,anger
FE14,04-Hoshido,Hinoka,"Of course they would. They’re pure evil. Sometimes the Faceless even turn on the mages who created them. But the Nohrians don’t care. They’re willing to sacrifice their own just to hurt others. I’ll never forgive them for that, or for stealing you away. They’ll pay for all the suffering they’ve caused!",anger
FE14,04-Hoshido,Corrin,I can’t believe it…,surprise

FE14,04-Hoshido,Mikoto,"We couldn’t bear to touch a thing in this room after you were taken. If we put your things away, it would have felt like giving up. You’ve grown so much. I can’t believe how handsome/beautiful you are!",joy

FE14,04-Hoshido,Mikoto,Oh?,surprise

FE14,04-Hoshido,Corrin,"I’m so sorry. Here you are, maybe my real mother, and I don’t feel anything…",sadness
FE14,04-Hoshido,Mikoto,Please. It makes sense. You spent your whole childhood in Nohr. I’m sure you were quite sheltered. You will need time to think all of this through and search your soul. But I hope that someday we can be a family again.,neutral

They tried desperately to get you back, but they failed again and again. However, I wasn’t as heavily guarded. Hoshidan ninja easily kidnapped me.

FE14,04-Hoshido,Azura,"No, it’s OK. I may technically be a hostage, but I’ve lived a happy life. The people of Hoshido have accepted me as one of their own. Even Queen Mikoto herself treats me as if I were her daughter.",joy

FE14,04-Hoshido,Azura,Did something happen between you and Queen Mikoto?,neutral

FE14,25B-TraitorRevealed,Iago,"Oh, please. Of course he's possessed. But the spell wouldn't work without a kernel of dissatisfaction in his soul. He's always felt like an afterthought in the royal family. He has quite the inferiority complex. He desperately wants to prove himself. That's how he survived. His hatred kept him going so he could deceive you all! Now it's his turn to shine. Mwahahaha! He's deliciously evil, is he not? Better hurry up and kill him... before he kills Azura!",anger

I'm the only one who has a chance of making them drop their guard and listen. I can't just sit by and do nothing while everyone I love tries to kill each other! I couldn't live with myself...",anger

FE14,25B-TraitorRevealed,Niles,"He's trying to say that he was worried about you, milord. You went off to the Bottomless Canyon with that strange crystal all alone... I was worried about you, too. That's why we're here.",fear

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Sakura,We all missed you so much!,joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Takumi,I knew you'd be fine. But I'm still glad to have you back.,joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Hinoka,"Now that we're all reunited, nothing can stop us!",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"Thank you, everyone. It's great to see you all again. And I must apologize for making you all worry so much. To think of all you've overcome to track me down... I've never been prouder to be your older brother.",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"So, what's next? Now that we're all back together, it seems like anything is possible.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,"I like the sound of that. So you all must be Ryoma's siblings, right?",surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"Ah, yes. It seems introductions are in order.",neutral

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,Wait...those names are awfully familiar. Are you named after the Hoshidan royal family?,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,Er. You could say that. We ARE the Hoshidan royal family.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,"Urk! Please forgive me, Your Highness! I had no idea you were THE Ryoma!",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"Please, Scarlet. You may simply call me Lord Ryoma. I apologize for not revealing my true identity earlier, but it was necessary. I wanted to get a true feel for your group without my royalty muddying the waters.",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,You needn't have worried. We have a common enemy. And many of us have strong ties to Hoshido. My own grandfather was one of the king's servants many years ago.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,Is that so?,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,"Yes! I've always wanted to be a knight because of him. I fact, if it wouldn't be out of place...I'd really like to join your party. You've seen what I can do in battle. What do you say?",joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,I say we'd be lucky to have you. Welcome aboard.,joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,"Yes! Thank you so much, Lord Ryoma.",joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Ryoma, can you tell us more about the resistance?",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"Yes. The group here in Cheve is one of the most well organized. In the early stages of battle, I learned of this group and decided to investigate. I made my way to this region and joined the resistance under false pretenses. Of course, you must realize that there are underground anti-Hoshido groups as well. That's why it's important for us to have a presence in regions controlled by Nohr. In case the conflict spreads.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,I can't believe I didn't recognize him. Oh well. I'm just glad we're on the same side. All of us in the Cheve resistance simply wish to be free of Nohr's oppressive rule.,joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,Yes. It's important to remember that we're not just fighting for Hoshido. Garon's mania for conquest must not be allowed to claim one nation more!,anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,What was that? I thought this was a safe house.,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,It is! Nobody outside the resistance knows about this place. Let's see what's going on.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,What's going on? What was that blast?,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Resistance,"Milady, we're surrounded by Nohrian troops. Our men have engaged the enemy, but we're severely outnumbered.",fear
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,No! How did they know that we were here?,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,We may still have a traitor among us...,anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,What are you suggesting? You saw what happened to Zola.,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,"I don't know, Corrin. How else could this have happened?",surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,I refuse to believe...,anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"No matter. We must evacuate immediately. There's a secret path nearby. Come, everyone!",fear
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,But what then? That path leads right to Nohr's doorstep.,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,Indeed. And that is exactly where I intend to go.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,Are you serious? We're not ready for that kind of mission.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"Running from the enemy won't bring this war to an end. We need to confront King Garon directly. And I believe that a swift counterattack would be the last thing he expects now. What do you think, Corrin?",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,I think you're right. Moving forward quickly with a small force could actually work.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,I don't know...,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Scarlet, if you're not on board with this plan, please don't feel obligated to join. I understand it must be hard to leave your troops here to fend for themselves.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,"No...I'll go with you. The resistance here is strong. We may be outnumbered, but we'll win the day. I can see the conviction in your eyes. Let's do this!",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"Excellent. Now that we're in agreement, we should get moving. The sooner we make our move, the greater our advantage!",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,So this path leads all the way to Nohr? Are you sure we'll be safe?,fear
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,"We should be. Then again, I thought that our safe house was actually SAFE. We built the path for this exact purpose, but I had no idea we'd use it this soon...",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"I'm sorry, Scarlet. Our arrival has certainly set things in motion.",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Scarlet,"It's all right. Maybe it's just the spark we needed to finally make a move. So please, wipe that sad look of your face. We're going to kick some butt!",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Whoa! Thanks, I guess I needed that. If we're going to invade Nohr all by ourselves, I'd better be confident.",joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"We're close, everyone. Time to get serious.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Well, that's a formidable wall. And there's no shortage of troops... Everyone, please listen up. Once we cross the border, there's no turning back. If anyone wants to retreat, now's your chance. You will not be judged.",anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Hinoka,"I'll follow you to the end of the world, Corrin. You have my support.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Takumi,"And leave you here to take on these jerks all by yourself? Forget about it. I'll bend my bow to your will, Corrin!",anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Sakura,I wouldn't think of staying behind after all you've done for us.,neutral

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,"You know this already, but you have my support as well, Corrin.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Thank you, everyone. Your support means the world to me. Now, let's head into Nohr and show King Garon we mean business!",joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Benny,Nothing personal. I'll make it quick...,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Benny,I did my best. That's all I can say...,joy

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Charlotte,You're such a pain...,sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Daniela,How sad for you to make it all the way here only to be butchered by me!,sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,We made it! Did that really just happen?,joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,"Yes, Corrin. We won this battle. But remember, we're in Nohrian territory now. We've got a long way to go.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,Can't I just be happy for a minute?,joy
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,Of course. But time is of the essence. Garon will hear about this soon. It won't be long before more Nohrian troops are on our trail.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Takumi,"He's right. We've got to find someplace to rest. It'll be dark soon. There's cover in the forest nearby. What do you think, Ryoma?",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Ryoma,I think that's a good idea. Let's move toward the forest. I've been studying maps of the area in preparation for this scenario. Follow me!,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,Ugh...I can't get any sleep. If only I could shut off my brain for a few hours... What's that?,anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,Ugh...,anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Ah, it's Azura. I wonder what she's doing up at this hour. I hope everything's OK. It almost seemed like she was going to faint back in Nestra. Well, there's only one way to find out.",fear
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,Where'd she go? I can hear her voice... It sounds like she's singing that song again.,surprise

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,Yes? What is it?,surprise
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Well, it's about the song you were singing just now.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,I see.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"What can you tell me about it? It seems to have a different effect on everyone. For example, when you sang to Takumi, it seemed to break the spell he was under. But when you sang to the Nohrian soldiers, it was almost like they were in a trance. And Izana knew some of the words—even though he'd never heard it sung before! How is that possible?",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,"I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about it.",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Really? Azura, it's me. You can tell me anything.",neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,You should try and get some sleep. We're going to be up early tomorrow.,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Please don't change the subject. You won't talk about the song, and I feel as though I hardly know anything about you. Doesn't that make you lonely? You know that we're all friends—we're here for you!",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,Corrin...it's not that simple... Ugh...,anger

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,"Please, don't apologize. I'll go get someone. Can Sakura help?",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,"I'm afraid not. What you've seen is the result of a curse. Like you, I carry special blood in my veins. But this comes at a price... I can sing for fun, or even to help someone in battle, and I'll be OK. But when I sing THAT song, in combination with my pendant... I'm able to generate a special kind of power.",anger
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,The power to exorcise demons?,neutral

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,But...,neutral
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,"But nothing. Each time I have sung that song, it was required. And it will be required again in the near future. We will eventually need the song's power to defeat King Garon.",neutral

FE14,14B-LightScatters,Azura,"Please don't worry. Although it is excruciating, the pain always subsides. If my song can help us end the war, I'll sing it as many times as necessary.",sadness
FE14,14B-LightScatters,Corrin,OK. But you must promise that you won't ever put yourself in danger. I don't know how you can willingly inflict such suffering upon yourself...,sadness

FE14,09C-AnotherTrial,Corrin,"Elise! Don't say that, dear sister. I'm not worth dying for.",sadness
FE14,09C-AnotherTrial,Xander,"Quiet, both of you. Father, if you must punish someone, punish me. It was I who told the others to tag along and help Corrin with his/her mission. If death is the price for this indiscretion, it is I, and I alone, who will pay it.",anger

FE14,09C-AnotherTrial,Xander,It is true. Father and I each visited the sage and were each gifted with his power.,neutral
FE14,09C-AnotherTrial,Corrin,Th-that's incredible.,joy

FE14,09C-AnotherTrial,Corrin,Amazing. It kind of looks like a gigantic sleeping dragon.,joy

I knew if and when the war began, I would be among the first casualties. At least in the end... Hm? Is that... a Dragon Vein I sense?

FE14,09C-AnotherTrial,Azura,"As did I. But when the war started, everything changed. After you, A prince/princess of Hoshido, sided with Nohr, the Hoshidans wished to banish me. The general consensus was that nobody with ties to the enemy could be trusted. Since I was taken from Nohr as a child, I bore the brunt of these wild suspicions.",anger

FE14,09C-AnotherTrial,Azura,"Ryoma and the others stood up for me. They tried their best to protect me. But one day a group of Hoshidan soldiers captured me and took me here. If you hadn't come along, I can't imagine what would have become of me. So thank you, Corrin. I owe you my life.",joy

FE14,20B-FortDragonfall,Corrin,Very well...,neutral
FE14,20B-FortDragonfall,Azura,There is just one thing. I'll need you and the others to defeat the Faceless before I begin. My song can be disrupted by the sounds they're making... I'm afraid it won't be powerful enough to break Iago's spell until they're gone.,anger

FE14,16C-Invasion,Xander,"Azura is the child of Father's second wife, the late Queen Arete. When they married, many Nohrians were still distraught over my mother's death. Those who loved Queen Katerina were not happy about Queen Arete or her daughter. Camilla and I...and later Leo...were told not to associate with Azura because of this. I suppose Father wanted to protect the strength of his legacy or some nonsense. However, we always wished we could be close with her, as siblings should be.

FE14,16C-Invasion,Corrin,OK!,neutral
FE14,16C-Invasion,Xander,"Hmm... To make it this far, they must be quite skilled and highly organized. Somebody is clearly leading the charge. If we take down the leader, the rest will fall.",neutral

FE14,16C-Invasion,Xander,Then perhaps... Their leader is not among them.,neutral
FE14,16C-Invasion,Leo,"Hm? Ah! I see.. Nice thinking, Xander. After all, Hoshidan ninja are masters of disguise. Their leader must be masquerading as a Nohrian soldier, giving orders on the sly. That means we'll have to speak to each of our soldiers directly to smoke him out.",anger

FE14,16C-Invasion,Nohrian,"Still no sign of the enemy commander. I'm afraid. Um, do I have something in my teeth? I suppose I did eat not too long ago... Huh?! You need to inspect my face? Erm. OK. V-very well. that was...strange. If you're finished, I shall return to my post!",surprise
FE14,16C-Invasion,Nohrian,"No sign of our enemy yet. Am I wearing...a disguise? Not a chance! Test me all you want. My face and my Nohrian pride are both the real deal. If you're satisfied, please allow me to return to the task at hand.",anger

FE14,16C-Invasion,Shura,Bah! I must be getting sloppy if you were able to see through my disguise.,anger
FE14,16C-Invasion,Xander,"Wait...that's a Nohrian pirate! But he leads his men just like ninja... And how did a common pirate manage to sneak aboard? This doesn't add up. I'll get to the bottom of this later. For now, all that matters is stopping him!",anger
FE14,16C-Invasion,Leo,Drat... We took too long trying to find their commander. They've stolen all the money Iago gave to us. How will I explain this to Father...,neutral

FE14,16C-Invasion,Azura,You must know you deserve to be punished after what you did. You may be dressed as a Nohrian pirate but...I don't understand. Why would you board a ship for Hoshido when our country is at war with them? It doesn't make any sense. Can you explain?,neutral
FE14,16C-Invasion,Shura,...,neutral
FE14,16C-Invasion,Leo,"Hmph. Like a dirty thief needs a reason to do what he does best. He and his men likely just hopped aboard without thinking things through. Trying to reason with him is a waste of time, Azura.",anger

FE14,16C-Invasion,Azura,Wh-what?!,surprise
FE14,16C-Invasion,Shura,I was commissioned by a Hoshidan strategist named Yukimura. I led him through the secret tunnel that runs beneath Castle Krakenburg.,neutral

FE14,16C-Invasion,Shura,"I am no Nohrian, but a ninja from Kohga, a land that exists only in memory now. Long ago, my clan proudly served the Hoshidan royalty. Those days were long past, but I still felt I should help avenge their loss. Besides, I figured if war broke out, I could use the chaos to take down Mokushu. Heh, I don't think Yukimura even realized he had enlisted a genuine ninja from Kohga.",sadness
FE14,16C-Invasion,Azura,I recall learning of the destruction of Kohga by the neighboring Mokushu. Rumor has it all who lived there were brutally killed... I'm surprised you were able to escape. Is that why you became a thief?,surprise
FE14,16C-Invasion,Shura,"After Kohga fell, I was chased from home and separated from the other survivors. I...had no choice. I was a child at the time. It was either steal or die. I chose to steal. I eventually found myself in Nohr, where I carved out a life for myself as a pirate.",sadness

FE14,16C-Invasion,Shura,"Yeah, sorry about that stealing business. Think of it as a showcase of my skills! Come on, whaddya say? Wouldn't hurt to have somebody like me around, right?!",anger
FE14,16C-Invasion,Leo,"Don't listen to him, Corrin. He could be lying through his teeth. For all we know, he's a Hoshidan spy. He could warn them we're coming. Hate to say it, but if we don't kill him now, it could endanger us all.",anger

FE14,17B-LostInTheIce,Flora,I know...but it was that or risk certain destruction. He gave me 30 seconds to make a decision before killing me on the spot. Being weak and afraid of death...I shamefully decided to betray you.,sadness

And then I heard, like, a big explosion or something outside. I went to see what was going on, and they captured me. I was still wearing my silk pj's! Anyway, we're all about love, peace, and chicken grease here in Izumo... So we don't exactly have a world-class military force. I don't know what happened after that. I was in my own jail.

FE14,15B-WolfskinPeak,Ryoma,I am aware of the downside... and so is Nohr. That must be why they're forcing us in that direction.,neutral
FE14,15B-WolfskinPeak,Kaze,Right. I didn't see any troops blocking the entrance to the peak... But that is surely intentional.,neutral

FE14,15B-WolfskinPeak,Corrin,Yes...I suppose I can.,neutral

FE14,15B-WolfskinPeak,Jakob,"Lord Corrin, it's truly splendid to see you are doing well! When word reached us that you had gone missing, I could not rest.

But still, we've treated you as kin since the very day you arrived in Nohr. No matter what anyone says, you are my brother/sister, Corrin. I know that Camilla, Leo, and Elise feel the same way. And Father will forgive you. I know it. You are of Nohr! Return to us, Corrin!",anger
FE14,06B-InTheWhiteLight,Corrin,I'm sorry. I can't go back. King Garon is a coward and a liar. I've witnessed enough of his destruction. Causing an explosion in a crowded city center with no regard for innocent life. That's the action of a madman.,anger
FE14,06B-InTheWhiteLight,Corrin,"Tell me. If King Garon thinks of me as family... how could he have orchestrated this attack? I could have easily been killed along with Queen Mikoto. The truth is that I was just a pawn. Collateral damage. King Garon was willing to sacrifice my life in pursuit of his agenda. Face it, Xander---Garon is no longer human. He's pure evil.",anger

FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"This is bad... We need to get out of here, Corrin! That thing attacking you may look human, but it's only a monster now. It feels no emotion. It can't love or even communicate. A soulless killing machine. If you get to close, it will surely destroy you.",anger

FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,You know Azura?!,neutral
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"He does. When I felt lost and lonely in Hoshido, I often found my way here. In this abyss I tried to derive some clue as to how I could achieve peace for the world. During one of my visits, I found Gunter here, on the brink of death.",sadness
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Gunter,Lady Azura taught me how to hide here—where I could go to stay safe. I would be dead right now if it weren't for her kindness. I am forever in her debt.,neutral

FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"It is. We are no longer in Nohr, but we are not in Hoshido either. It is a land separate from both. Ever near, but hidden to all.",neutral
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,A hidden land.,neutral
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"Yes. Time flows differently here than it does in the world we came from. There's something else... You must never speak of this place in the outside world. There exists a curse...if you speak of this land outside of it, you'll vanish.",neutral
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,Vanish?!,anger

FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"Hm? Oh no, it's actually not. I always travel through water.",neutral
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,Oh. Then why don't we just go back the same way we came?,surprise
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,We can't. You and I are the only ones who can use water to travel between worlds. This is the only way to bring Gunter back with us. I realized that last time I was here. I tried to take Gunter with me but was unable to.,neutral
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,Just the two of us can travel through water? But why? Why us?,neutral
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"That's... ... I'm sorry, but that's not something I can talk about right now. We need to get back to the other world now, before those things attack again.",sadness
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,Huh? Azura?! Wow! She didn't even hesitate...,surprise

FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,Oh? What's that?,surprise
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"I've heard you say numerous times that you'd stop at nothing to end this war. If that's true, there's something you must do. It won't be easy though... I'm afraid if we're ever to obtain peace, you must...dethrone King Garon.",fear
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,Dethrone Father? Are you mad?!,anger

FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,What...is it?,surprise
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,"This is a crystal from the other world we just returned from. It has the power to reveal the truth.

FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Corrin,So it was you...,surprise
FE14,15C-TheBlackPillar,Azura,It was. That song I sang has a mysterious power. I thought perhaps I could use it to turn Garon back to normal. ...It didn't work. That's when I realized he was too far gone to save. Worse than my failure is the fact that I endangered all those innocent singers. It's my fault they're being hunted. I'll never forgive myself for that.,anger

I will do what I must to awaken my brother/sister from the spell that binds him/her. You vile Nohrians have brainwashed him/her, and I will not rest until he/she is free!",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Xander,"More false accusations. You know very well he/she chose this of his/her own free will. No matter the blood that courses through his/her veins, we are his/her true family. That will never change.",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Ryoma,I will not stand here and listen to your lies! Your heart knows only deceit and betrayal. Nohrians are notorious for their cruel and cowardly methods. This is no different. But enough of your foolish words. We must resolve this with blades.,anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Xander,So be it. I always knew it would come to this. The crown prince of Nohr clashing blades with Hoshido’s heir. It’s almost poetic.,anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,"Please, stop this madness! Both of you! Xander, I beg of you. Let it go for now. We must return to Nohr right away. There has been enough senseless death on this day...",fear

FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,Leo? Why would you say that?,surprise
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Leo,"If we retreat, they'll think we fear them. Or worse, that we coerced you into joining us. This is our chance to prove beyond a doubt that you chose us of your own volition. We have no choice but to stand our ground and fight!",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Camilla,"I agree with Leo. After all, we've done nothing wrong. Why should we flee? You're one of us, Corrin. that's worth fighting for!",fear

FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Ryoma,"If you mean to fight, then FIGHT! Nohrian pawns. Soon you shall be a mere stain on my sacred blade, Raijinto. Hinoka! Takumi! Sakura! Are you ready?",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Hinoka,Ready and waiting! Like I'd ever let them take Corrin away from us again.,neutral

FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Xander,"Fools, all of you. You have my pity. Sadly for you, my sacred blade, Siegfried, knows nothing of pity—only triumph. Camilla! Leo! Elise! prepare for battle!",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Camilla,I swear to protect our dear Corrin no matter what!,anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Leo,Failure is no option. Let's show those scoundrels what it means to be a family!,anger

FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Hinoka,I won't rest until Corrin returns home. I've been training for this day!,anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Hinoka,How could this happen?! What have I been fighting for all this time...?,surprise
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Takumi,Prepare to pay for what you monsters have done. This is for Mother!,anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Takumi,"Gah! You may not have honor, but you certainly have skill. This isn't over...",joy
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Ryoma,I will not allow a filthy Nohrian to sully my honor!,anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Ryoma,"Damn! I'll have to withdraw for now... This isn't over, Corrin!",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Yukimura,This battle is truly lamentable. It would have broken Lady Mikoto's heart to watch these events unfold...,sadness

FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Hinoka,"What exactly do you think you're doing, Corrin?! Betraying us for Nohr... It just can't be true! They must have tricked you somehow, right?",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,"I'm sorry, Hinoka. I just... I can't abandon the ones I loved all these years. It's as simple as that.",sadness
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Hinoka,Corrin... Say it isn't so...,neutral
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Takumi,"Hmph. I knew it would come to this. From the moment we met, I knew you couldn't be trusted. And I was right.",neutral
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,"Takumi... Please, let me explain.",neutral
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Takumi,"I have no time for your empty words. Ryoma and the others were fools. I knew trusting a Nohrian would only lead to death and heartbreak. But I am not Ryoma, nor my siblings. I won't make that same mistake. I shall take great joy in slaying you here and now like the traitor you are!",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Ryoma,"Corrin! Do not allow them to fool you a moment longer. There's still time... Come back to your true family, where you belong!",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,"I'm sorry, Ryoma. I'm afraid that's not possible. I've made up my mind. I'm staying with Xander and my Nohrian siblings.",sadness

FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,Ryoma! Don't do this!!,fear
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Yukimura,"So, here we are. You have come back to us, but with a blade in hand. I suppose it's safe to surmise you have no intention of returning to Hoshido?",neutral
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,You are correct. Nohr is my home. It's where I belong.,neutral
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Yukimura,"How very upsetting. If Lady Mikoto were here to see this, it would break her heart. Then again, she may just have smiled and said, ""It's his/her path to choose.""",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,Yukimura...,neutral
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Yukimura,"But such talk is pointless, for our dear queen has left this realm. As for myself, I am above all a tactician for the honorable Hoshidan army. As such, I am obligated to prevent you from returning to Nohr!",anger
FE14,06B-EmbraceTheDark,Corrin,"Ryoma… Everyone… Please find it in your hearts to forgive me. I know that a prince/princess of Hoshido siding with Nohr seems like the ultimate betrayal. But I swear on my honor…I will end this war, for all of us. For Nohr and Hoshido—for you and me. I promise you that. Until then…farewell.",sadness
