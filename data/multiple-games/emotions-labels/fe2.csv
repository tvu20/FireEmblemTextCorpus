FE2,01-Zofia'sCall,Clive,"So, you're Alm? Thank you for saving my sister. Well, I've got a favor to ask of you. Starting today, will you lead our forces? That's why we sought Sir Mycen, Zofia's hero, but for some reason, he's refused us. Therefore, I'd like you to command our units in his place. So, Alm. I'm counting on you to save Zofia.",joy
FE2,01-Zofia'sCall,Forsyth,"Desaix requested aid from Rigel, up north. If Rigel complies, we won't stand a chance!",neutral
FE2,01-Zofia'sCall,Alm,"But the 'Gods' Pact' upheld by Zofia and Rigel... It means we won't war, right? Our guardian, Lady Mila, would never allow it.",fear
FE2,01-Zofia'sCall,Forsyth,"Yeah, well... There's a rumor that Lady Mila has disappeared. Hey, hey! Don't look so surprised! After all, it's been strange lately, hasn't it? Crops failing, odd demons emerging... Only Mila's Temple knows what's goin on, I guess.",sadness

FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Celica,"Well, Bishop Nomah, I'll be off.",neutral
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Nomah,"Celica... Must you go? The road to Mila's Temple is long. Between Geyse's pirates and the evil fiends rising, you'll surely be attacked. It's too risky...",fear
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Celica,"But Father, it's been three years since we last grew crops. What in the world befell the Earth Goddess Mila? I want to find out for myself.",neutral
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Nomah,"I see... If you insist, then I shall not stop you, Celica. You know why Sir Mycen placed you in my care, right? You are the last of the Zofian royal family. Zofia's people depend on you. Don't try to do the impossible.",neutral

FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Alm,"But why? Why would Desaix want to kill you, Celica?",surprise
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Celica,"That... I'm sorry. I'd rather not say right now. In any case, Alm, I have a request. Can war be avoided with the Kingdom of Rigel?",sadness
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Alm,"That's impossible. King Rudolf of Rigel decided to attack while Zofia is weak. At this rate, Zofia will be destroyed.",anger
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Celica,But aren't we all the same? We should be able to coexist.,sadness
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Alm,There's no way. Zofians won't tolerate Rigel's barbaric rule. We must retaliate!,anger
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Celica,"How sad... I'm sure if we talked, we could come to an understanding... Unless, Alm, now that the Zofians call you their hero, you want to become their king as well?",sadness
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Alm,"What! That's mean, Celica. I just want to protect the people of Zofia, that's all. Besides, Zofia's only remaining princess is still alive. I'm planning to search for her. After I find her, I'm returning to Ram.",anger
FE2,02-ThePilgrimage,Celica,"That's not true! Zofia's royal family is gone! But I get it, Alm. You go ahead to Rigel. My companions and I are going to Mila's Temple.",anger

FE2,04-LandOfSorrow,Alm,But why... Why couldn't I avoid fighting my own father?,sadness
FE2,04-LandOfSorrow,Mycen,"Don't cry, Alm... Let me clarify your father's actions. Valentia became divided because of the gods. They have involved themsleves too deeply with mankind's affairs. As a result, the people have lost balance and head for ruin. After some consideration, Rudolf posed as a destroyer to investigate the advent of true heroes in Valentia. I was told this when he placed his newborn child into my hands: ""This child will consign himself to hell's fire!"" I couldn't refuse him. And so, I left all to fate. Alm.

He will certainly become the savior of all of Valentia..."" If this is His Majesty's will, then so be it! Al, I shall fight with you!",joy
