FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Marth,"What!? But, we can't see anything like this. How should we fight back?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Kris,"We've no choice but to directly engage the enemy. It will probably be a dangerous battle, unlike any we've faced previously.",fear
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Marth,Indeed. We should select those who'll fight with prudence.,neutral
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Marth,Athena! What brings you here!?,surprise

FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Clarisse,You want to escape from this darkness? I'm afraid I won't let you. You won't see the sunlight ever again.,fear

FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Clarisse,Wha...?,surprise
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Katarina,You can't walk around wounded like this. And you'll freeze to death if you don't find shelter soon.,fear
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Clarisse,Why...? Why would you... go so far to help me...! I've always treated... you like dirt and yet you...,anger
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Katarina,Because you're my little sister.,neutral
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Clarisse,"...Pfft. You know I'm not your sister. We're both orphans, remember...? We've always been alone...",sadness
FE12BookTwo,13x-WithinTheWhiteDarkness,Katarina,"But, we were raised together by Lady Eremiya... I don't mind if you hate me. But, I don't want to lose you... If I were to lose this one bond... I'd be alone in the dark, again... And the same goes for you.",sadness

FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Jagen,Gra's army is renowned for its mighty armor knights and generals. The late king Jiol--our enemy in the last war--was a general himself.,neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Kris,I see. An army with strong defenses...,neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Jagen,"In the past, yes. I hear that Gra's army now consists of new recruits. Hardly worthy enemies. Speaking of strong defenses, Kris...",neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Jagen,Your defense is truly overwhelming. Only a fool would dare approach you. Even Gra at it's prime could not compete with your defense. This battle has already been decided.,anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Jagen,Your defense is quite impressive. No man in Gra could match your defense. This battle has already been decided.,neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Jagen,"Erm, your defense... could do with a little more work. This is quite worrisome. Kris, the enemies may be new recruits, but don't underestimate them.",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,"Princess Sheena, it seems the Altean army has arrived.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,"Really...? It's already the end. Samson, I have brought you much trouble. I need to watch the final days of my Kingdom of Gra. You may leave now.",fear
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,"Princess, isn't it already enough? Shouldn't you despise King Jiol for forcefully taking your mother? Isn't that why you hid at Millennium Court and stayed away from this country? Right now you are just being tricked by Hardin, and being used by him.",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,"Perhaps. I heard that the people of Gra wished for the restoration of the country, and that's why I agreed to help him. However Hardin is only interested in using us. He would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him. Still, I will not leave! How can I just abandon those fighting for my sake!?",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,"Impossible... How can our fresh recruits resist Altea's elites...? Fine, if you're staying, I will also stay to the end. This could be interesting.",surprise
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,Samson... Why are you doing this? Aren't you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold? I no longer have money to give you...,sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,"I don't know why either. It's just... Sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do. Also, I want to see how that kid fights this battle. If he truly is a hero, perhaps your mind may be changed...",neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheema,"What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,Prince Marth... How unfortunate. I thought you a better man.,sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheema,"What...?! What have you done...? I believed you, Altea; I trusted you... How dare you... I'll kill all of you!",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Old Man,Hardin sent troops here to prevent Gra from rebelling. The Archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight.,anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Woman,"Princess Sheena is the child of King Jiol's second wife. But, she is different from the king. She is a very kind person. The princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers. Is there no way to save her?",sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Woman,"The soldiers here are all foreigners. There's nobody else to protect this country, because the knights of this country all died. Right now, the actions of the Archanea soldiers are deplorable. Their just the same as thieves... Those lowlifes!",sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Young Woman,Ah... Please leave me. I already have nothing to give you.,sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Marth,"Ah, please don't get us wrong. We aren't here to steal.",sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Young Woman,"But, didn't you all come here from Altea for revenge?",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Marth,"No, we don't want to fight Gra, because Gra and Altea were originally like one family.",sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Young Woman,"Is that true...? Then, I will give my most important treasure... to... you",surprise
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Marth,"You are Princess Sheena? It's great to see you safe. I don't view Gra as an enemy. Gra and my country were originally one country. The country may have divided after Anri's death, but we always got on well as allies. But, in the previous war, I felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did. Princess Sheena, please allow us to be friends once again. I don't want to fight Gra.",sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,"Prince Marth... Once I heard that you didn't attack my fleeing soldiers, I was really surprised. You truly are the second coming of King Anri. I trust you. Please... Treat the citizens of Gra... as if they were your citizens. I will hand my whole country to your care... Prince Marth.",surprise
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,That's great Sheena. Now I can finally leave without worry.,joy
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,Samson... Can you not leave...?,sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,You don't need me anymore. From now on Prince Marth will protect you.,sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,Don't leave! I don't want you to leave...,sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,"Huh, what? Why keep me? It doesn't seem like you. ...Fine. If you say you need me, I won't go anywhere else. I will protect you wherever you may go. Is that fine with you?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,Yes...,neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Tomas,"Prince Marth, I've been waiting for you. I'm Tomas, an Archanean soldier--or was. I've since retired from the army. The Archaneans here just want to sacrifice the defenceless Gra soldiers. This act of brutality by my former homeland... I cannot tolerate. Please, Prince Marth. Let me fight with you in some way.",sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,You... You dare treat my citizens like that... Die!,anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Sheena,"Forgive me, citizens of Gra.",sadness
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,"Prince Marth... I thought you were a noble person, but you're just a murderer... You disappoint me.*",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Samson,Sheena...,neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Jagen,"Sire, to keep fighting like this is pointless. All we are accomplishing is buying Hardin more time.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Marth,"My thoughts exactly. If we continue like this, more blood will be spilt for naught. Kris, do you have any sort of plan?",anger
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Kris,"According to our information, the enemy's primary force is concentrated along the highway. I wonder if we can avoid that route, by passing through the mountains?",neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Jagen,"Hmph, we'd have to cross Adria Pass... But the steep mountains make it dangerous for an army of our size.",fear
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Kris,"That's true, and I fear the enemy may have prepared an ambush as well. Our bravery could be our undoing. But it is the fastest possible route. If we could just break through there, we'd be in walking distance of the palace.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Marth,"I am prepared for the danger. We managed to conquer the same perilous road that Anri walked. Compared to that... Jagen, Kris. We can overcome this challenge. Order the advance!",neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Frost,Oof... Seems I've finally caught up.,neutral
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Kris,"Hmm, and you are?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Frost,"My name is Frost. I am a priest of Macedon. When Macedon was taken over by those warmonging rebels... You came and saved our country. Thanks to you, my family's now safe. I have come to return the favor.",joy
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Kris,I see. But hasn't it been some time since Prince Marth freed Macedon...?,surprise
FE12BookTwo,17-Gra'sSunSets,Frost,"Your army marched at speed and this old geezer just couldn't keep up. Eventually I lost sight of you... But then I heard that Marth had freed Altea as well, and I finally managed to catch up with you here, in Gra. I am old now, but I can still fight. Please, allow me to to join you.",sadness
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,"Huh? Kris, what's with the hat?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Kris,This? Lord Wendell gave it to me so that my cold wouldn't get any worse.,neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,"From Lord Wendell, I see... Chiasmir Bridge has a strong sea wind, so it's good to have a hat to keep warm. It suits you, Kris.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Kris,"Really? Thank you, sire.",joy
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Cain,"Sire, you're safe! Kris! you too! You've guarded Prince Marth well.",joy

FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Cain,"Yeah, somehow I managed to shake off the enemy and escape here. But the enemy is already approaching from the north.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,Don't worry. We will crush them.,anger
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Cain,"No, not this time. Hardin is being protected by a mysterious power: we can't lay a finger on him. So even if we fight him now, we haven't a chance of winning. Please, head to the northwestern fortress. There's a boat across the river, which we can use to escape to the Khadein desert.",fear
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Jagen,"Sire, the free company to the south will probably make their move soon. Indeed, now's not the time to fight. For the time being, let's do as Cain suggests and make our escape. After that, we'll think of something...",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,"I see... I don't like it, but we haven't a choice... Everyone, hurry to the northwest fortress!",fear
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Villager,"If ya ask me, archers'll always get along well with archers.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Bantu,"Oh look, if it isn't Prince Marth. Long time no see, Lad. It seems so noisy out; I wonder what's happened?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,"Ah, Bantu! Fancy meeting you in a place like this. How is Tiki?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Bantu,"Oh, she is no longer by my side. Lord Gotoh took her to the Ice Dragon's Temple again.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,The Ice Dragon's temple? Where's that? I've never heard of such a place...,surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Bantu,"It's in the icy lands, far north of here. But it's no place for humans. Besides the hero Anri, no man has been there yet.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,"Anri?! Are you, perchance, referring to the ""Realm of the Gods"" from Anri's legends?",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Bantu,"I'm not at liberty to say anything more. If you want to know more, you should ask Lord Gotoh. Anyhow, I have a favor to ask of you. My precious firestone was stolen by thieves. If you can get it back for me, I'll show you how it works. Thank you, Prince Marth.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Hardin,...Hasten the preparations of the troops within the fortress. I want Marth cornered like a rat...,neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Hardin,"Heh heh heh... Prince, your struggle is in vain. But let us continue this game for a while. Just know that you're fast running out of time. Soon, I will kill you myself...",anger
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Hardin,"Heh heh heh... Prince Marth, it's been far too long.",joy
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Marth,Hardin... Why did you attack our country? What would compel you to do such an act? I... I can't believe this. Have you really changed this much?,surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Hardin,"Prince, I am the ruler of this continent and the Emperor of Archanea. I will show no quarter to anyone who opposes me. That includes you, Prince... I must destroy this foul world... It is beyond salvation. Traitors, playtime is over. You will all die here. All soldiers, attack! Do not leave a single traitor standing!",anger

FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Roger,"Uh... Uhm, you should know, I've no plans to betray Archanea. I was just thinking about that time when you asked me ""do you believe in love?"" But I'm different from who I was back then.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Caeda,Really? But you still seem like a nice man. That's why I wanted to speak with you again.,joy
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Roger,Uhh...,neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Caeda,"May I just ask, why are you fighting for Archanea?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Roger,"Be-because Archanea has already taken over the world. Resistance is futile: no one can win. My life is precious to me. If I side with whoever's stronger, then I'm guaranteed to live longer...",anger
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Caeda,I see.,neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Roger,A-are you disappointed with me?,surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Caeda,"No, never. As I thought, you're fighting for what you believe in. You're not different. You're the same, kind man as when I first met you and I'm happy for that.",joy
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Roger,Uhhh... Wait- you're leaving?!,surprise
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Caeda,"Yes. I too must fight for what I believe in. But I'll make a request to Marth so that we don't have to fight you. I'm happy that we could talk again, Roger.",joy
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Roger,"W-wait! ...As I thought, you're still very kind. Dare I say, we don't have girls quite like you back in Grust or Archanea. Um, perhaps... I suppose I could... Aw heck, I'm going with you again!",sadness

FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Gordin,"Master! Please, wait!",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Jeorge,"Hm...? Gordin? Long time no see. You seem to have gotten a little sturdier, but has your bow arm improved any?",neutral
FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Gordin,"Yes, at the moment, I... They call me Altea's master of bows. It's thanks to you, Master, that I've been able to progress this far.",joy

FE12BookTwo,08-SoulfulBridge,Jeorge,"I pledged allegiance to Princess Nyna, but as for Hardin... I've had it with him. Taking other countries by force, executing ""rebels"" without reason. The Archanean army I see now is just a collection of hired thugs. There's not even a shred of chivalry left. To return the kingdom of Archanea to what it was once before... I must take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland. Gordin. Convey that to Prince Marth.",anger

Taking advantage of his broken heart, Gharnef appeared. He took on the guise of a merchant to approach Hardin, and showed him the Darksphere. The distraught Hardin was quickly consumed by the orb.

FE12BookTwo,20-DarkEmperor,Gotoh,"Hmm... I understand how you feel... However, we have a far greater task to accomplish--we must seal away the earth dragons. Soon they will awaken from their slumber.

FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Xane,"Ah... When the Divine Dragons fought the Earth Dragons they over-exhausted their dragonstones, and so practically became extinct. Aside from Naga, only Gotoh, me and the just born Tiki survived. However, after the war we discarded our dragonstones, so we could no longer become dragons again. Even so, I still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans. Gotoh followed Naga's orders to protect humans, but that's got nothing to do with me. I don't like humans. They scorned the Manaketes, even though they had lost their power, and treated them like filth. I can fully understand why Medeus and the others hated humans so much. The Earth Dragon King, Medeus, tricked his own tribe and became a Manakete by himself. He used to follow Naga's orders and guarded the Dragons' Altar. However the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive. They even started to attack the Manaketes that lived in peace. The Manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans, and gathered at the Dolhr region. They formed their own kingdom of Manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans. To save the humans, Gotoh handed the Falchion to Anri and he created an academy of magic at Khadein. But whoever won wasn't any of my concern.",sadness

FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Xane,"Gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didn't say anything. I will tell you. However, after I've told you, you'll probably think it was better off not knowing. The orbs rest on the shield that seals the Earth Dragons... Basically they are part of the Shield of Seals. Since ancient times, the Divine Dragons have passed down these sacred jewels, each possessing different powers. To put it simply, the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal. So if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Marth,"Hmm, is that so? But, how come the orbs were scattered?",surprise
FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Xane,"Because the shield was broken. The Shield of Seals was displayed at the Fane of Raman, and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it...",neutral
FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Marth,When did that happen?,surprise
FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Xane,"Around 600 years ago. To recover the shield, Gotoh spend many years searching the lands. In the end, he only found the five orbs, with the shield nowhere to be seen. Not only that, but the five orbs, which he painfully collected, were scattered again after Raman was attacked in the previous war.",neutral
FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Marth,Really? ...So that was why Gotoh was looking for the lost jewels... the orbs?,surprise
FE12BookTwo,13-FrozenLand,Xane,"Yep, the Starsphere, Lightsphere and Geosphere... as well as the Darksphere and Lifesphere. The Lightsphere is in Gotoh's possession, that Starsphere was shattered and the Darksphere was given to Hardin by Gharnef.",neutral
