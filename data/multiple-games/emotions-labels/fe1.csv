FE1,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Yes. Dolhr has occupied it for two years now. I escaped to Talys only thanks to my sister Elice's help. And in my place, she was captured by Dolhr. I have no idea where she is now. I vow that I will do whatever I can to rescue her! All right, everyone! It is time to take back Altea! Let us begin!",anger
FE1,16-TheBattleForAltea,Old Man,"I have something very important to tell you. Listen well! In the northwest of this land, you will find two villages. A paladin named Arran dwells in the western village. In the easterly one, there is a hero named Samson. Both of them are fine men. The problem is the feud between their villages... Due to this rivalry, you can only add one of them to your ranks. Think hard about this before visiting either village.",neutral
FE1,16-TheBattleForAltea,Man,I heard a rumor that the prison to the east holds a young man called Xane. He isn't from around here... That's not all... I hear he holds a wondrous power.,neutral

FE1,16-TheBattleForAltea,Arran,"I am Arran. Once, I was a knight captain. I left that life behind me, but if you have true need of my strength, I will join you. The feud between these two villages is bitter. If our neighbors hear you visited us, they will bar their gates. If you had hoped to recruit the hero Samson, I am sorry.",neutral
FE1,16-TheBattleForAltea,Samson,"I'm Samson. I used to be famous as a gladiator. That's behind me now. I'm just living my life here. If you need me, though, I'll head out with you.

FE1,16-TheBattleForAltea,Xane,"Hey there, Prince! Thanks for saving me. The name's Xane. I come from a faraway land. My people can transform into anybody. Dolhr found out and demanded I join them! I refused. I'd never help those villains! I'd be happy to help you fight them though!",joy
FE1,16-TheBattleForAltea,Marth,"Soldiers of Altea, and everyone who has lent us your strength…you have my gratitude. Thanks to you, we have finally taken our country back from Dolhr. Many enemies still remain inside the castle, however! Do not drop your guard!",joy
FE1,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Ogma,"Prince Marth, I'm Ogma, a mercenary of Talys. The king ordered me to join your forces. I brought along my three most trusted men. Welcome to Galder, the port town that's been overrun by pirates. Pirates aren't all you will have to worry about. We've spotted soldiers from Grust too. Keep your wits about you.",neutral
FE1,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Woman,There's a pirate who goes by the name of Darros. He's looking to meet the prince! Word is he wants to turn over a new leaf and fight for the people. You should seek him out and listen to what he has to say.,neutral

She set out toward the Ghoul's Teeth some time ago and has yet to return. I can't tell you how much Lena's help meant to us. She's like an angel. It isn't much, but...we can offer you 5,000G to aid in your efforts to rescue her. Please, do what you can to save her!",fear
FE1,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Darros,"Prince Marth, I am Darros, a simple man of the sea. I want to leave the life of a sea dog behind. If you need my help, I'll give it gladly! Please, let me fight alongside you.",neutral

FE1,02-ThePiratesOfGalder,Villager,"Thank you for taking care of those ruffians, Prince Marth. Thanks to you, peace has returned to Galder. In order to reach Aurelis, you must cross the Ghoul's Teeth. It is a dangerous road. You will find fearsome bandits called the Soothsires there. They prey on travelers and raid nearby villages.

FE1,01-MarthEmbarks,Old Man,"Villagers have their gates open so that the prince can visit. Don't make them wait! Once a thief attacks a village, that's it. There's no saving it.",neutral
FE1,01-MarthEmbarks,Young Man,You can't use strong weapons if you don't have a high enough weapon level. That's just common sense. And don't forget that your fliers need to be careful around foes with bows!,neutral
FE1,01-MarthEmbarks,Woman,There is a village south of the castle. A priest named Wrys awaits the prince there.,neutral
FE1,01-MarthEmbarks,Man,Galder? It's a port town south of the isle of Talys. A man by the name of Gomer has taken control of the city. It's lousy with pirate scum!,anger

FE1,04-BattleInTheLea,Old Man,"A sword known as an armorslayer can make quick work of knights and generals. Ridersbane is effective against cavaliers, but remember that not all units can use lances.

FE1,04-BattleInTheLea,Young Man,"Weapons can be made of iron, steel, and silver. In that order, they are weak, stronger, and strongest. To use stronger weapons, you need a higher weapon level. Don't forget!",neutral

FE1,04-BattleInTheLea,Lena,"Don't be a coward! You must stand up and choose the path you believe in. Macedon has joined forces with Dolhr, and the people suffer for it. It's mortifying.

FE1,04-BattleInTheLea,Matthis,"...I understand. If I am to die, I should do it honorably, and with style. I suppose it won't be any less strict here though... After all, I have a sister who can say no to a prince! On that topic...have you found a man that you do like?",neutral

FE1,XX-Epilogue,Nyna,"It is as I suspected. Do not blame yourself... Perhaps for us, this victory could only come at the cost of those we loved. Sad as it may be, it is the fate the Fire Emblem has borne across generations...",sadness

FE1,25-Endgame:ChosenByFate,Marth,Sage Gotoh! Why have you come to this place?,surprise
FE1,25-Endgame:ChosenByFate,Gotoh,"Men are foolish... and I had sworn to let the affairs of the world proceed without me. But watching your struggles, I came to think perhaps I was too hasty in my judgment. I cannot defeat Medeus on my own. But I will happily lay his minions to rest. Go forth, he who has been chosen by the goddess... Altea's prince of light! Cast the Shadow Dragon back into the darkness! Bury him in the earth he crawled out from!",anger
FE1,25-Endgame:ChosenByFate,Medeus,Rebels that dare disturb my repose... be consumed by the flames of hell!,anger
FE1,25-Endgame:ChosenByFate,Medeus,"Me? Defeated? By humans... Mere humans... Take this to heart, Altean prince, inheritor of the light... One day... I will rise anew... Never forget... As long as there is light... the darkness can never be extinguished!",anger
FE1,07-LefcandithGauntlet,Minerva,"I do not agree with your strategy, General Harmein. As a knight of Macedon, I have my pride. I wish to fight them head-on. A fair battle.",anger
FE1,07-LefcandithGauntlet,Harmein,"Many of the soldiers of Macedon were lost in Aurelis. Surely you understand this? We must regroup in the castle and stall for time. The king has put his faith in me. I would ask that you do the same. After all, if you do not trust the empire...your little sister, Maria, is the one who will suffer the consequences.",anger
FE1,07-LefcandithGauntlet,Minerva,"... I understand. I will leave this matter in your hands. I doubt you can defeat Altea's knights with your schemes, however... I expect that you will end up regretting this. Though she is feared by all, I have heard that she is very beautiful and kind. I wonder if anyone can help her.",anger
FE1,07-LefcandithGauntlet,Old Man,The warrior Minerva is actually a princess from Macedon! It is said that she fights for the Dolhr Empire because they are holding her sister hostage.,neutral
FE1,07-LefcandithGauntlet,Bantu,"Excuse me... Have you met a young girl by the name of Tiki? She is the last of the Naga, the Divine Dragon clan. There is no one but she who can defeat the manaketes serving Medeus. I'm so old that I don't have much fight left in me, but without my stone, I can't become a dragon at all. I'll come along with you, so please help me find Tiki.",fear
FE1,07-LefcandithGauntlet,Minerva,"This fighting is more than I can stomach. Palla, Catria, Est... Let's get out of here.",sadness
FE1,07-LefcandithGauntlet,Malledus,"Prince Marth. It is time I tell you the legend of the manaketes. A long, long time ago...the manaketes arrived in Archanea. They were of three clans. The divine Dragons of Naga, the Mage Dragons of Basilisk, and the Fire Dragons of Salamander. The Divine Dragons were the most powerful. They stopped the others from conquering mankind. They carried stones that allowed them to conceal their true selves by taking human form. The dragonkin lived in peace with humans until the arrival of Medeus, an earth dragon. Medeus used his great power to destroy the Divine Dragons and found the Dolhr Empire. He launched attacks on the human lands and conquered them. Though the humans fought bravely, there was nothing they could do against Medeus. But the young warrior Anri faced Medeus! He gripped a sword that shone brightly: the blade of light, Falchion! After a fierce battle, he at last defeated Medeus. Yes, my prince. You do recognize this young man's name. He is indeed Anri, the first king of Altea. It has been 100 years since thos dark days. And now Medeus has appeared once again. Prince Marth! You are the chosen one. The last of Anri's line... Your father, King Cornelius, was defeated before he could accomplish his task. It is up to you now!",fear
FE1,08-PortWarren,Caesar,"Prince Marth, we are mercenaries hired to protect Port Warren. Grust has gathered its forces in the northern fortresses. They have put the port to siege.

FE1,08-PortWarren,Roger,Wh-What? What kind of question is that?,surprise
FE1,08-PortWarren,Caeda,"I apologize. You look very kind, and I thought we might have a chat. Would you mind telling me your name?",neutral
FE1,08-PortWarren,Roger,"Er, well... The name's Roger. Roger of Grust.",neutral

FE1,08-PortWarren,Malledus,"Prince, if we stay here, we'd be putting ourselves in danger. We must head to Pyrathi with haste. There are rumors that the Pyrathi king, Mannu, is a descendant of the dragonkin, however. This is also reason for concern. But we have no choice. Please, be cautious.",fear
FE1,11-KnordaMarket,Man,This here is Knorda. You're in Archanea now! Don't forget to drop by the armories and the shops. You should find some good stuff if you look around!,neutral

I do not think you can defeat Gharnef... If you cannot claim Falchion from Gharnef, you have little hope of defeating Medeus. If you still wish to try, you must gain much in experience and reach the pinnacle of your strength. That is not all... You must also gather mighty blades like Gradivus, Mercurius, and the Devil Axe. Unless you make these preparations, Medeus's defeat is scarcely possible. This is the harshest road to victory. Are you truly willing to walk this path? Think long and hard on this decision.

Gharnef and Miloah were both my students. But Gharnef stole Imhullu from me and disappeared. I believe he has Falchion as well… With both Falchion and Imhullu, he fears nothing, not even Dolhr. He aims to rule the world! As long as he wields Imhullu, he cannot be challenged. However, there is one way to defeat him. Bring me the Lightsphere and the Starsphere.
