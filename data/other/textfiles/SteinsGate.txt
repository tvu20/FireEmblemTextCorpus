About 3 minutes ago, Daru picked a banana from the banana bunch that Mayuri asked me to buy and put it in the Microwave Ophone (Temp).

Or so it should've been. But now, there's not even a trace of a banana ever being picked... and instead of it, there's a gelified banana, perfectly connected to the rest of the bunch.



Looks like Daru noticed, as well. In a state of confusion, I try to touch it, but restrain myself.

"Daru, how many bananas are there in the lab right now?"

 "P-Probably only these..."

"Is the place where the gelbana is right now the same as the place you took the banana from?"

 "I, I dunno... This gelbana is perfectly connected..."

Yes, perfectly connected. I don't see any damage. Besides being gelified, it looks perfectly natural. It doesn't seem like someone took a banana, gelified it, and then put the banana back.

"H-Hey, Daru... Could this..."



Now, I have trouble even whispering them again. However, no matter how unbelievable this is, I saw it with my own eyes...!

"...be actual... Teleportation?!"



I hear a woman's voice from the lounge.

 "That's an interesting experiment you're doing there."

"W-Who's that?!"

I just felt my heart skip a beat. Overwhelmed by surprise, I quickly face the direction of the voice... and I get pierced by a sharp glance aimed right at me.

"I-Impossible...! Why are you here...?!"





"Makise Kurisu!"

 "Nice explanation, bro..."

 "Who are you calling a zombie?!"

"What's the meaning of this?! With what purpose did you come here...?"

 "I came here to meet you, Okabe Rintarou. No, Hououin Kyouma, right?"

What?! Why does she know my real name? I'm sure that I never told her...!

"I get it... So you're an agent of The Organization, and a superhuman, as well...! You are one of the undying!"

 "I never died. Please don't kill me off, okay? Hashida, can you do something about this person?"

 "He's only panicking because you appeared at a time like this."

Daru doesn't seem to be perplexed by the appearance of this woman. Why, exactly?

"Daru, did you betray me?!"



"Did she get a hold of your weakness? Were you deceived by her charms?"

I glare at Makise Kurisu. Damn you for doing this to my right hand man!

"I won't forgive you, you biiiiitch!"

 "Calm down."

I think I just saw Makise Kurisu's eyes light up a bit. Intensity which you wouldn't expect of an 18 year old.



I guess I should calm down for now.

 "I found out about this place from Hashida after the lecture ended. Your name, as well."

What a boring truth. I am disappointed.

"You said that you came here to talk to me, right?"

 "Yes. I wanted to find out if what you said about me dying was the truth or an excuse for sexual harassment."

Now that she mentions it, she treated me as a pervert yesterday... Looking back at it, it's kind of amazing that she didn't call the cops on me.

But it can't be helped. I think that anyone would react similarly to seeing a dead person appear right in front of them.

 "I can tell from your current behavior that it was nothing but sexual harassment, which means I was right."

"I'd prefer it if you didn't jump to conclusions so quickly. You're misunderstanding me."

If this keeps up, I'll be marked as a pervert! I was clear up the misunderstanding!

 "Well, I'll leave that aside for now."

"Eh, you will?"



Even though she's only 18, she's got quite a nice figure. The way she walks also looks good. There's not much around the chest area, though!

In this cramped space, Dari and I falter and try to stay some distance away from her. Damn you, the development room is off limits for unauthorized people!

 "By the way, I don't think I properly introduced myself yet. I am Makise Kurisu. It's nice to meet you."

After saying that, she extends her hand towards me with a sour look on her face. What is this gesture?



 "You can't even do a handshake? Japanese men sure lack common sense..."

A handshake? This genius girl who I met only yesterday and who marked me as a pervert is asking me for a handshake?

"Are you a westerner?!"

 "I lived in America for 7 years."

Thin, supple, lovely fingers. Healthy, elegant and real fingernails with no unnecessary manicures. I fix my gaze on that beauty. While standing in a ready-to-run position, I slowly extend my hand.



 "You're shaking too much."

"I can feel your killing intent. This is commonly referred to as martial arts."

 "No it isn't."

"Then it's ninja--"

 "I'm telling you, it isn't."

Kuh, this woman is too cool-headed. Her way of speaking becomes scary sometimes.



"No, a hug would be more American!"

Or is that impossible for man-made machine soldiers?

 "Just how narrow-minded are you?"

She already turned her eyes away from me. Now, her gaze is aimed at the banana bunch next to the Microwave Ophone. Specifically, the banana which was part of a ridiculous phenomenon that happened just now. The only one in the bunch which is gelified.

 "This is truly interesting."

Bringing her face close to it, Kurisu is thoroughly observing the banana.






Mayuri posted:

Subject: It's interesting

RaiNet Kakeru is really interesting. You should try watching it, Okarin. There's plenty of deep details that I don't think are aimed at children.

"No!"

 "Right."

Kurisu pierces the gelatinous banana with her index finger. She buries it deep inside the soft and flabby banana.

"What are you doing?! That's valuable experimental data!"

 "It's mushy."

Kurisu quickly pulls out the finger. Some of the gelatinous substance is left on the tip. Without any hesitation, she puts it into her mouth.

 "No taste, huh? Eww."



 "No thanks."

 "Also, those bananas belong to Mayushi."

"No need to restrain yourself. I am telling you that I'll give you one!"

 "As if I'd eat a pervert's banana."



Daru's body shakes as if he just got an electric shock. What? What's with him?

 "Eating, a pervert's banana... Mushy.... finger..."

Looks like his intracranial pervert processor started working at maximum speed.

 "Miss Makise. Could you say that one more time? With a scowl, if possible."

 "What?"

 ""Come on, say 'As if I'd eat a pervert's banana.', and it'd be good if you can add 'Aah, but...' afterwards."

 "...Hm? Hmm?"
 "...!"





"Fwahahaha, Daru, you may be hopeless garbage and a disgusting pervert, but what you did just now is awesome!"

This is my first win against her! I must continue and make a nice combo attack! Let's show this conceited little girl how adults fight!

"So, Makise Kurisu. What did you imagine just now? Please, don't hesitate in telling us! Fwahahahaha!"



 "You idiot!"

Perking up her shoulders, Kurisu faces away from us. Looks like she does have human-like emotions. I guess that rules out her being a man-made machine soldier.

Right now, I feel very refreshed. This is probably the best I've felt these past few years. As expected of my right hand man Daru. He's done an excellent job.

 "So both of you are perverts..."

 "Well, I..."

Don't blush, you idiot.

"I don't want to have you calling me that."

 "Okay. I apologize for my upstart behavior."

Kurisu sighs deeply and faces us again. Her facial expression is calm and collected.



Will you stop saying 'for now'? It worries me that you might call the cops on me later.

 "I want you to explain it to me in detail. About this banana, and about this..."

Kurisu throws a glance at the Microwave Ophone (Temp).

 "...Microwave oven."

"It's top secret. Though, if I were to tell an outsider like you just one thing, I would tell you that the name of this thing is the Microwave Ophone (Temp)."

 "(Temp)?"

"The name is still temporary."

 "I don't care about the name."

"But the name is the only thing I can tell you."

 "But Okarin, Miss Makise might be able to explain this weird function, you know?"

"Hm, that's..."

Well, Kurisu IS a genius... a genius to the extent of being able to beat me in an argument. But, I really can't stomach her impudent attitude. This girl is too dangerous.

I thought of a good idea just now.



"You said your name was Cristina, right?"

 "Who are you calling Cristina? I never said that!"

It sounds like something from a Hollywood movie, so I thought it fits the atmosphere.

"If you want to know the secrets behind this microwave oven, there are conditions which you must meet."

 "What are they?"

"Condition #1: You must become a lab mem."

 "Ramen?"

"Lab mem, you fool! Laboratory member!"



"I will have you write an oath in which you will promise to never expose our secrets to outsiders. If you break that promise, I will report to SCIENCE magazine that you're a lewd pervert."

 "Kuh..."

 "You're a demon, Okarin. I'd buy 5 copies of that magazine if it came out."

"From the moment you become a lab mem, I will use your brain until you go back to your country."

 "...That pride is annoying. Okay, then, show me the contract."

"There is no such thing! This is a circle, not a company."



"There aren't any, so calm down."

 "Sexual harassment, then?"

"I'm not gonna do that!"

 "You said Condition #1', right? Then there must be other conditions as well. It's fully possible that itâ€™s something perverted--"

"Condition #2 is that you will ignore all of the sexual harassment that I did up until now."

 "..."



"I don't want you to tell me that. By the way, Daru's sexual harassment is not included in condition #2. You talk that out amongst yourselves."

 "What? Are you fucking kidding me?!"

"Those are the only 2 conditions! If you don't accept them, then I politely ask you to leave! Heh heh, what is your answer? I think the conditions are pretty good."

 "Good for you, that is."

Putting a finger against her temple, she exaggeratedly swings her head from side to side.

 "Jeez... It feels like you're making my brain produce excess noradrenaline. What a jaw-dropping feeling."

"I don't care if you get some jaw-joint illness! Just answer whether you do or don't accept the conditions, Cristina!"

 "Stop adding 'tina'! I am Kurisu!"

As if to make herself calm down, she looks up at the ceiling. Does Kurisu react like that because she grew up in America? It looks like she's about to say 'DAMN!' or 'OH MY GOD!' or 'MOTHERFUCK!'

Part 8: The Braun Tube Workshop gets a new employee


Rukako is getting nervous. Right after I think about how unreliable he is, chills suddenly run down my spine.



"Ugh, an evil spirit... has possessed... me..."

While violently shaking, I grab my own wrist.



 "No, no way...! Okabe, please get a hold of yourself!"

"I am not Okabe!"

 "I apologize, Kyouma! Aah, but what should I do...?"

"The exorcism... hurry...! Do it the same way... that I taught you!"

 "Y-Yes!"



His posture and expression give off a powerful atmosphere.

 "Um... I... err..."

The embarrassment is making him panic... kuh, damn this novice!



 "Uuh..."

Rukako starts crying. Looks like he's really worrying.

I am completely aware that he's a guy, but his actions and appearance make me feel guilt as if I just made a frail girl cry. However, as his eyes fill with tears, it looks like he finally built up the resolve.

 "E... Evil spirit...!"

He raises the Shide wand high above his head, then swings it left and right.

 "Please leave Okabe... no, Kyouma's body...!"

"That's good, now hit my arm with the tufty stuff!"

 "Eii!"



In manga and such, this would be the cue for some dramatic shockwave, but nothing like that happened. The only thing I hear are the cries of cicadas.

 "H, How... was it?"

I deeply sigh. The shaking of my hand has stopped.



After a sigh of relief, Rukako blushes.

 "I'm happy to be of service..."

That bashful appearance makes him look too feminine...





Daru and Mayuri already went home, so bringing this TV alone through a steep, narrow stairway is back-breaking work. Opening the door with a hit of my hips, I enter the workshop.



That's a 42" CRT TV. With LCD TVs becoming the standard, I doubt someone would want to come to this shop and buy a CRT.



(Text on the apron reads "Braun Tube Moe".)

In front of the huge CRT sits a middle-aged muscular delinquent. This man is the owner of the building and the shopkeeper of this establishment, Tennouji Yuugo (Mister Braun). I call him "Mister Braun" because he's a weirdo who loves Braun tubes.

"Don't you give me a 'what's up?'. Your damn TV broke on me."

 "You brat, did you treat my CRT violently?"



 "These need to be handled with love, you know. LOVE."

"I request that you fix it and prioritize it over all your other works."

 "As usual, you're talking in a stupid way..."

Subject: Don't trade it for funds ><

Upa is super popular, you know? Even more popular than the protagonist, Kakeru-kun. It's such a cute mascot character it makes me wanna buy them all. It's a very Mayshii-like obsession. I mean, Okarin, when you were in high school, you collected a lot of black fingerless gloves, didn't you? It's like that.

Subject: Re: Don't trade it for funds ><

I don't know who is Kakeru-kun is at all, because I don't watch that sort of worthless anime.

Anyway, the shop is filled with CRTs.



There are remnants of the Showa era, flat types, and even HD CRTs which came out just before LCD TVs became popular.

"Today you're open 'till late, huh? Normally, you close up just before 7 PM."

 "A guest is coming over today."

"Guest? The usual little beast?"



After glaring at me, the shopkeeper takes out a single photo from his breast pocket and gazes at it with affection. On the photo, there's a grade school girl doing a peace sign.

People who don't know the details might think that this muscleheaded middle-aged man is a perverted lolicon, but the girl in the photo is his real daughter. I think she's in the 6th grade now. She's the second thing that this old man loves. I forgot her name, though.

 "If you touch Nae, I'm going to kill you."

Nae, that was it.

"But have there really been any guests here besides your daughter?"

 "A 'guest', or a client, or how should I put it..."

Putting back the photo and giving me an unclear answer, he returns to checking out the TV.



"Really? Then please, do so."

 "Wait. I didn't give you the price yet."

"Wha-?! You're charging money?"

 "Obviously. Did you think you wouldn't have to pay?"

"You're the one who gave us this TV!"

 "So what? I never told you that you'd get free after-sales service."

"Damn you... Saying that after giving me a half-broken product...!"

 "Oh, shut up. If you don't want it, then I'll take it. I think I can get some money for it from recycling."



 "Huh? Who are you talkin' bout?"

"Myself, of course!"

 "You sure have some guts, saying that to ME, who's letting you live on the 2nd floor here..."

"Uh, I'll pay the repair fees, Mr. Braun."

At the end of the day, I am no match for him as I am right now. At that moment, I hear the sound of the door opening.



It's a woman with long, slender limbs which make her look like an athlete.

 "O-haaaa!"



 "...Huh?"

This greeting had tremendous amounts of popularity when some male idol was using it when I was a kid. Personally, I believe that the originator of this was some veteran voice actor from some morning program, but it's still very old...

Is this woman the 'guest' that was supposed to come? Maybe she's just an acquaintance of his.

 "Umm... I'm Amane, the one who called you earlier."

And so, time begins to move again.



"Part-time job interview?! This young lady?! You're telling me that the depressing, unfashionable and unprofitable CCRT Workshop owned by a filthy old man actually has a chance of having a part-time worker?"

 "Brat, do you want to pay 1000 extra yen starting next month?"

"I had no idea that this shop takes part-time applications, and with all the free time they'd get, I honestly don't see the need for them, either..."

 "Actually, I'm the one who asked for this job over the phone. He refused at first, but after some pleading, he let me."

Now that is truly surprising.

 Looks like we have some weird youth nowadays. Well, sit down on that chair, young lady.

 "Oh, thank you."



The woman has a stiff facial expression. Looks like she's nervous. Just because of an interview? She isn't showing much passion.

 "So, your name is?

 "Amane Suzuha."

 "Age?"

 "18."

 "Student?"

 "No."

 "Why do you want to work here?"

 "Because I love CRTs."

"What about the database using IBN 5100s?"



 "To begin with, it's a database using a special program, so there's a limit on who can access it. Doesn't look like even chief executive class can access it."

"There are positions beyond chief executive class?"

 "It seems like SERN has a council."

"Hmm... They call it a council, huh."

 "What do you mean by 'it'?"

"That is the name of their last boss, obviously."

Kurisu looks at me coldly. Whatever. Let's leave the IBN 5100 database for another day.



 "Okey dokey. That Z Program we saw last time was suspicious, wasn't it?"

"That, and the 'Jellyman's Report'."

Kurisu stares holes into the monitor. The earlier atmosphere of anger on her face has disappeared.

"Look at it carefully, and burn it into your eyes: The proof of SERN's actions, its deceit upon the world."

 "Uho, found it! The person in charge of the LHC plan for the win."

"The person in charge... that's a pretty important post, huh."

 "Right now, were peeking at his computer. Z Program, Z Program... hmm..."

"I have no doubt that Z stands for jelly!"

 "Jelly starts with J. J-E-L-L-Y."

 "Pfft, careless mistake, so uncool."



Daru stops searching the log.

 "Oh, it's here, its here."

He displays an image file on the monitor. It looks like a very old scanned paper document. 'Z Program' and 'TOP SECRET' are written on it.

"The program draft date... is 1973. When was SERN formed?"

 "1954."

I asked Daru, but Kurisu answers indifferently instead. I thought that SERN might've been made for the Z Program, but '54 means my guess was off.

"When was the IBN 5100 put on the market?"

 "1975."

So maybe SERN used the IBN 5100 as its backbone. The years match.



I deny my own thoughts. There's no way it can be such a foolish reason. This most likely involves a worldwide conspiracy. Or perhaps, IBN only hid their proprietary programming language in the IBN 5100 for the purposes of SERN's Z Program! IBN and SERN are co-conspirators. And both of them are being manipulated from the shadows by an even larger organization...

Isn't this truly interesting?

 "Ugh, a jpg? Don't screw with me. I can't copy paste this."

Daru mutters some complaint.

 "Hmmm, the text isn't in French..."

What's being displayed right now looks like English.

 "No, it's written in French, Dutch, and German too. The contents look the same way."

 "...The control of space-time and the destruction of history based upon it, in other words, to implement a perfect utopia by means of the 'Committee' existing from past to future, shall become the meaning of SERN's existence for the 21st century'."

Kurisu suddenly starts talking with a stifled tone.

 "Ah, I see! Makise can do English!"



 "Of course not. Don't just go deciding fate on your own."

Daru turns over the chair, allowing Kurisu to sit in front of the computer.





 "'Z, as in Omega or Ya. Putting a meaning or passion into that name is prohibited, presumably to put those in the program at a disadvantage.
The Z Program is strictly confidential project spanning international borders, and, like electromagnetic wave study, has received recognition from the Council of 300 as top priority research material. Henceforth, it has been decided that all other experiments carried out by SERN shall function to hide this Z Program.'"

It seems like what Kurisu's reading is the preface to a document. It's getting rather dull.

"Is there anything specific about what the Z Program is?"

Daru types on the keyboard from the side, bringing up a different window.

 "Hmm... ah... here. This is...!"

Kurisu leans forward, staring at the monitor with her eyes wide open.

"What is it?"

 "...'The purpose of the Z Program is to perform time-space displacement experiments through use of high-energy proton-proton collisions.'"



"Time travel experiments!"

I frantically stop myself from shouting. I rush over to the window and close it. It might make it hotter inside, ut it would be worse if people outside overheard us.

 "No way... it was true...! And you're even telling me that they've deceived scientists the world over for nearly 40 years?"

"Just as I suspected: A huge shadow lurks underneath SERN. Perhaps The Organization, or maybe some related structure."

 "What 'Organization', you pretentious hipster? At least try to be serious sometimes."

("Pretentious hipster" = "chuunibyou", literally "8th-grader syndrome".)

"Hmph, don't be foolish. My words always indicate the truth."

 "Anyway, shouldn't it be The Committee instead of The Organization? It's written there."

 "The Council of 300, huh. I think it refers to something other than SERN's council, but what?

"The world is full of deception. Itâ€™s not as beautiful as you guys think it is."

 "Listen, Okarin..."

"I'm listening. The Council of 300 is the large darkness placed at the very top of every secret society, every government, every financial clique."

 "Still saying vague things..."

"It's the truth. If you think it's a lie, then just google it. Humanity's time of prosperity until now has reached the wall called time. The technology of the time machine which can break through that wall can repaint human history on a grand scale. Literally. Similar to nuclear weaponry, it is the forbidden fruit that will make you like God. No human exists who can resist its temptation. Naturally, all those with power will use any means at their disposal to obtain it. Human morality is naught but a joke to those who aim for divinity. Understand, Cristina?"

 "Thanks for your opinion. If you're going to talk that much, does that mean you're aiming for divinity too?"



 "I'm not asking Hououin, I'm asking Okabe."

"I-I am Hououin."

 "So basically, you don't have the desire."

Tch, damn Assistant. Such a tricky girl. Trying to make me sway...

 "More importantly, Makise, the rest of the Z Program, please."

"Daru! What do you mean by that?"

 "I'm more interested in the Z Program than in Okarin's delusions."

I told you, they're not delusions, nor conspiracy theories... but Daru does have a point. The top priority now is to disclose the dark side of the international research organization named SERN.

"Assistant, continue."

 "At least show respect when you're asking a favor..."

While huffing out complaints, Kurisu obediently goes back to translation work.



 "'Obtain standardized results for the accelerator through the know-how accumulated in the past half century, starting with the proton synchronization completed in 1959.
Program Stage 2: Practical use of the lifter, and its adjustment. With this, the formation of more than two artificial localized singular points, as well as the formation of Kerr black holes can become possible. Furthermore, intentionally leaked misinterpreted information on the formation of black holes and hiding the program's original goal are necessary.
Program Stage 3: Animal experimentation.
Program Stage 4--"

Kurisu stops talking. She takes a deep breath, and finally mutters angrily.



 "...Seriously?"

Are you... serious...

Crap, chills just ran through my spine. Frankly speaking, I've been out of it for a while. A research institution like SERN is actually doing time travel experiments. And by chance, or by inevitability, we too successfully created a time-travel-like phenomenon. If things go well, maybe we could outwit SERN. I had that expectation. But...

Just like I said, the world is full of deceit, and honest ethics are neglected... Was it okay for us to get involved with this?

 "H-Hey, Okarin. Remember when we hacked earlier? I'm pretty sure that this was written in that mail we read... 'Results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch. The details were enclosed in the Jellyman's Report or something..."

...Human is dead. 'A person has died.'

 "Was that human experimentation... or something related?"

My throat goes dry. Kurisu and Daru await my words. Does that mean they're entrusting the decision to me?

I ask myself:



We can never turn back, you know. Though that may be true, pretending not to see this conspiracy would leave a bad taste.

"Daru... look up the Jellyman's Report."

 "Seriously?"

"Seriously. However, Cristina. You, go home."

 "Why now all of--"

"The Jellyman's Report... gives me a bad feeling. Once we see it, we can no longer return to our normal lives. You're such a genius that at your age, you got a thesis published in 'Science'. There's no need to throw away your promising future."

 "Are you worried about me?"

"Of course. You're my assistant, after all."

 "I keep telling you, I'm not your assistant. Thanks for your concern, but I won't go home. We need to expose this truth to the world--"

"No! That's too dangerous."

 "Are you afraid?"

"We're too powerless against this conspiracy. If we make the wrong move, they'll erase us immediately."

 "But still--"

"This isn't a game. I'm not joking here."

 "...I understand. Let's not expose it."

Though her expression shows she still doesn't agree, she finally submits.

 "But I'm not going home. It'll keep me awake at night."

"You won't regret it?"

 "I won't."



It doesn't look like I can persuade her any further.

"What about you, Daru? Prepared?"

 "Well, I am a super hacker."

He's comfortable even in this situation.

 "I wouldn't make such a mistake that we'd get found out in the first place."

That settles it. It's great that Mayuriâ€™s not here. I can't get her involved. I look Daru and Kurisu in the eye.

"Alright... let's begin."



 "Why Norse mythology?"

 "Probably because it's cool?"

 "To begin with, men who say things like 'operation name'..."

"Daru, begin operations!"

He soon finds the Jellyman's Report. It required a second password authentication, but Daru broke through it easily.

 "Okay, I'm opening it."

I gently lick my lips and nod. A gloomy atmosphere drifts about the lab. Since the window's closed, the strange heat accumulates. Daru wipes the sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief, and timidly presses the enter key.

At first glance, it looks like a resume. There's a photograph on the top right. The top left has name, age, weight, height, origin, and other information. Written in the center is a long string of English text. Underneath that is something like a scan of a newspaper clipping with a black and white picture attached.

And then I know, exactly what the 'Jellyman' in 'Jellyman's Report' meant.



 "Subject: James McCarthy, Age: 31, Origin: America. Z Program 4, Experiment Date: 2005-01-28 T 13:05."

Kurisu bends over Daru's shoulder, reading what's written out loud.

 "Results: Error. Human is dead, mismatch..."

 "That again...?"

 "It is believed that due to infinite compression by supergravity, the subject could not endure passage though the singular point inside the Kerr black hole.
April 3, 1921. The right half of a dead man was discovered buried into the surface of a wall in New York's 14th district.""

It looks like Kurisu's reading the newspaper article at the end with the black and white photo attached.

 "The unidentified man's corpse..."
