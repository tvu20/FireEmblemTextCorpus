On the granite steps outside the Hall of Justice, Brooklyn. It is cold and sunny. A Sabrett wagon is selling hot dogs. Louis, in a shabby overcoat, is sitting on the steps contemplatively eating one. Joe enters with three hot dogs and a can of Coke.

Joe: Can I . . .?

Louis: Oh sure. Sure. Crazy cold sun.

JOE (Sitting): Have to make the best of it. How's your friend?

Louis: My . . .? Oh. He's worse. My friend is worse.

Joe: I'm sorry.

Louis: Yeah, well. Thanks for asking. It's nice. Your's nice. I can't believe you voted for Reagan.

Joe: I hope he gets better.

Louis: Reagan?

Joe: Your friend.

Louis: He won't. Neither will Reagan.

Joe: Let's not talk politics, OK?

Louis (Pointing to Joe's luch): You're eating three of those?

Joe: Well . . . I'm . . . hungry.

Louis: They're really terrible for you. Full of rat.poo and beetle legs and wood shavings |n' shit.

Joe: Huh.

Louis: And . . . um . . . irridium, I think. Something toxic.

Joe: You're eating one.

Louis: Yeah, well, the shape, I can't help myself, plus I'm trying to commit suicide, what's your excuse?

Joe: I don't have an excuse. I just have Pepto-Bismol. Joe takes a bottle a Pepto-Bismol and chus it. Louis shudders audibly.

Joe: Yeah I know but then I wash it down with Coke. He does this. Louis mimes barfing in Joe's lap. Joe pushes Loui's head away.

Joe: Are you always like this?

Louis: I've been worrying a lot about his kids.

Joe: Whose?

Louis: Reagan's. Maureen and Mike and little orphan Patti and Miss Ron Reagan Jr., the you-should-pardon-the expression heterosexual.

Joe: Ron Reagan Jr. is. . . . You shouldn't just make these assumptions about people. How do you know? About him? What he is? You don't know.

Louis (Doing Tallulah): Well darling he never sucked my cock but . . .

Joe: Look, if you're going to get vulgar . . .

Louis: No no really I mean. . . . What's it like to be the chi$d of the Zeitgeist? To have the American Animus as your dad? It's not really a family, the Reagans, I read People, there aren't any connections there, no love, they don't ever even speak to each other except through their agents. So what's it like to be Reagan's kid? Enguiring minds want to know.

Joe: You can't believe everything you . . .

Louis: (Looking away): But . . . I think we all know what that's like. Nowadays. No connections. No responsibilities. All of us . . . falling through the cracks that separate what we owe to our selves and . . . and what we owe to love. Little pause. Louis looks at Joe. Joe looks at Louis looks away.

Joe: You just. . . . Whatever you feel like doing, or saving, you just say it, you don't even give thinking or regrets or morality or anything a chance, you do it.

Louis: Do what?

Joe: It. Whatever. Whatever it is you want to do.

Louis: Are you trying to tell me something? Little pause, sexual. They stare at each other. Joe looks away.

Joe: No, I'm just observing that you . . .

Louis: Impulsive.

Joe: Yes, I mean it must be scary, you . . .

Louis: (Shrugs): Land of the free. Home of the brave. Call me irresposible.

Joe: It's kind of terrifying.

Louis: Yeah, well, freedom is. Heartless, too.

Joe: Oh you're not heartless.

Louis: You don't know.

Finish you weenie.

He pats Joe on the knee, starts to leave.

Joe: Um . . . Louis turns, looks at him. Joe searches for something to say.

Joe: Yesterday was Sunday but I've been a little unfocused recently and I though it was Monday. So I came here like I was going to work. And the whole place was empty. And at first I couldn't figure out why, and I had this moment of incredible . . . fear and also. . . . It just flashed through my mind: The whole Hall of Justice, it's empty, it's deserted, it's gone out of business. Forever. The people that make it run have up and abandoned it.

Louis: (Looking at the building): Creepy.

Joe: Well yes but. I felt that I was going to scream. Not because it was creepy, but because the emptiness felt so fast.

And . . . well, good. A . . . happy scream.

I just wondered what a thing it would be . . . if overnight everything you owe anything to, justice, or love, had really gone away. Free.

It would be . . . heartless terror. Yes Terrible, and . . .

Very great. To shed your skin, every old skin, one by one and then walk away, unencumbered, into the morning.

(Little pause. He looks at the building)

I can't go in there today.

Louis: Then don't.

Joe (Not really hearing Louis): I can't go in, I need . . .

(He looks for what he needs. He takes a swig of Pepto-Bismol)

I can't be this anymore. I need . . . a change, I should just . . .

Louis (Not a come-on, necessarily; he doesn't want to be alone): Want some company? For whatever? Pause. Joe looks at Louis and looks away, afraid. Louis shrugs.

Louis: Sometimes, even if it scares you to death, you have to be willing to break the law. Know what I mean? Another little pause.

Joe: Yes. Another little pause.

Louis: I moved out. I moved out on my . . .

I haven't been sleeping well.

Joe: Me neither. Louis goes up to Joe, licks his napkin and dabs at Joe's mouth.

Louis: Antacid moustache.

(Points to the building) Maybe the court won't convene. Ever again. Maybe we are free. To do whatever.

Children of the new morning, criminal minds. Selfish and greedy and loveless and blind. Reagan's children.

You're scared. So am I. Everybody is in the land of the free. God help us all.

Scene 8

Joe at a payphone phoning Hannah at home in Salt Lake City. It is late at night.

Joe: Mom?

Hannah: Joe?

Joe: Hi.

Hannah: You're calling from the street. It's . . . it must be four in the morning. What's happened?

Joe: Nothing, nothing, I . . .

Hannah: It's Harper. Is Harper. . . . Joe? Joe?

Joe: Yeah, hi. No, Harper's fine. Well, no, she's . . . not fine. How are you Mom?

Hannah: What's happened?

Joe: I just wanted to talk to you. I, uh, wanted to try something out on you.

Hannah: Joe, you haven't . . . have you been drinking, Joe?

Joe: Yes ma'am. I'm drunk.

Hannah: That isn't like you.

Joe: No, I mean, who's to say?

Hannah: Why are you out on the street at four a.m.? In that crazy city. It's dangerous.

Joe: Actually, Mom, I'm not on the street. I'm near the boathouse in the park.

Hannah: What park?

Joe: Central Park.

Hannah: CENTRAL PARK! Oh my Lord. What on earth are you doing in Central Park at this time of night? Are you . . .

Joe, I think you ought to go home right now. Call me from home.

(Little pause)

Joe?

Joe: I come here to watch, Mom. Sometimes. Just to watch.

Hannah: Watch what? What's there to watch at four in the . . .

Joe: Mom, did Dad love me?

Hannah: What?

Joe: Did he?

Hannah: You ought to go home and call from there.

Joe: Answer.

Hannah: Oh now really. This is maudlin. I don't like this conversation.

Joe: Yeah, well, it gets worse from here on. Pause.

Hannah: Joe?

Joe: Mom. Momma. I'm a homosexual, Momma.

Boy, did that come out awkward.

(Pause)

Hello? Hello?

I'm a homosexual.

(Pause)

Please, Momma, Say something.

Hannah: You're old enough to understand that your father didn't love you without being ridiculous about it.

Joe: What?

Hannah: You're ridiculous. You're being ridiculous.

Joe: I'm . . .

What?

Hannah: You really ought to go home now to your wife. I need to go to bed. This phone call. . . . We will just forget this phone call.

Joe: Mom.

Hannah: No more talk. Tonight. This . . .

(Suddenly very angry) Drinking is a sin! A sin! I raised you better than that. (She hangs up)

Scene 9

Split scene: Harper and Joe at home; Louis and Prior in Prior's hospital room. Joe and Louis have just entered. This should be fast and obviously furious; overlapping is fine; the proceedings may be a little confusing but not the final results.

Harper: Oh God. Home. The moment of truth has arrived.

Joe: Harper.

Louis: I'm going to move out.

Prior: The fuck you are.

Joe: Harper. Please listen. I still love you very much. You're still my best buddy; I'm not going to leave you.

Harper: No, I don't like the sound of this. I'm leaving.

Louis: I'm leaving.

I already have.

Joe: Please listen. Stay. This is really hard. We have to talk.

Harper: We are talking. Aren't we. Now please shut up. OK?

Prior: Bastard. Sneaking off while I'm flat out here, that's low. If I could get up now I'd beat the holy shit out of you.

Joe: Did you take pills? How many?

Harper: No pills. Bad for the . . . (Pats stomach)

Joe: You aren't pregnant. I called your gynecologist.

Harper: I'm seeing a new gynecologist.

Prior: You have no right to do this.

Louis: Oh, that's ridiculous.

Prior: No right. It's criminal.

Joe: Forget about that. Just listen. You want the truth. This is the truth.

I knew this when I married you. I've known this I guess for as long as I've known anything, but . . . I don't know, I thought maybe that with enough effort and will I could change myself . . . but I can't . . .

Prior: Criminal.

Louis: There oughta be a law.

Prior: There is a law. You'll see.

Joe: I'm losing ground here, I go walking, you want to know where I walk, I . . . go to the park, or up and down 53rd Street, or places where. . . . And I keep swearing I won't go walking again, but I just can't.

Louis: I need some privacy.

Prior: That's new.

Louis: Everything's new, Prior.

Joe: I try to tighten my heart into a know, a snarl, I try to learn to live dead, just numb, but then I see someone I want, and it's like a nail, like a hot spike right through my chest, and I know I'm losing.

Prior: Apartment too small for three? Louis and Prior comfy but not Louis and Prior and Prior's disease?

Louis: Something like that.

I won't be judged by you. This isn't a crime, just--the inevitable consequence of people who run out of--whose limitations . . .

Prior: Bang bang bang. The court will come to order.

Louis: I mean let's talk practicalities, schedules; I'll come over if you want, spend nights with you when I can, I can . . .

Prior: Has the jury reached a verdict?

Louis: I'm doing the best I can.

Prior: Pathetic. Who cares?

Joe: My whole life has conspired to bring me to this place, and I can't despise my whole life. I think I believed when I met you I could save you, you at least if not myself, but . . .

I don't have any sexual feelings for you, Harper. And I don't think I ever did. Little pause.

Harper: I think you should go.

Joe: Where?

Harper: Washington. Doesn't matter.

Joe: What are you talking about?

Harper: Without me.

Without me, Joe. Isn't that what you want to hear? Little pause.

Joe: Yes.

Louis: You can love someone and fail them. You can love someone and not be able to . . .

Prior: You can, theoretically, yes. A person can, maybe an editorial "you" can love, Louis, but not you, specifically you, I don't know, I think you are excluded from that general category.

Harper: You were goint to save me, but the whole time you were spinning a lie. I just don't understand that.

Prior: A person could theoretically love and maybe many do but we both know now you can't.

Louis: I do.

Prior: You can't even say it.

Louis: I love you, Prior.

Prior: I repeat. Who cares?

Harper: This is so scary, I want this to stop, to go back . . .

Prior: We have reached a verdict, your honor. This man's heart is deficient. He loves, but his love is worth nothing.

Joe: Harper . . .

Harper: Mr. Lies, I want to get away from here. Far away. Right now. Before he starts talking again. Please, please . . .

Joe: As long as I've known you Harper you've been afraid of . . . of men hiding under the bed, men hiding under the sofa, men with knives. Prior (Shattered; almost pleading; trying to reach him): I'm dying! You stupid fuck! Do you know what that is! Love! Do you know what love means? We lived together four-and-a-half years, you animal, you idiot.

Louis: I have to find some way to save myself.

Joe: Who are these men? I never understood it. Now I know.

Harper: What?

Joe: It's me.

Harper: It is?

Prior: GET OUT OF MY ROOM!

Joe: I'm the man with the knives.

Harper: You are?

Prior: If I could get up now I'd kill you. I would. Go away. Go away or I'll scream.

Harper: Oh God . . .

Joe: I'm sorry . . .

Harper: It is you.

Louis: Please don't scream.

Prior: Go.

Joe: I tried to hide the knives but they're too sharp, and now they're cutting me open.

Harper: I recognize you now.

Louis: Please . . .

Joe: Oh. Wait, I. . . . Oh!

(He covers his mouth with his hand, gags, and removes his hand, red with blood)

I'm bleeding. Prior screams.

Harper: Mr. Lies. Mr. Lies (Appearing, dressed in antarctic explorer's apparel): Right here.

Harper: I want to go away. I can't see him anymore.

Mr. Lies: Where?

Harper: Anywhere. Far away.

Mr. Lies: Absolutamento. Harper and Mr. Lies vanish. Joe looks up, sees that she's gone. Prior (Closing his eyes): When I open my eyes you'll be gone. Louis leaves.

Joe: Harper? Prior (Opening his eyes): Huh. It worked. Joe (Calling): Harper?

Prior: I hurt all over. I wish I was dead.

Scene 10

Hannah and Sister Ella Chapter, a real-estate saleswoman, Hannah Pitt's closest friend, in front of Hannah's house in Salt Lake City.

Sister Ella Chapter: Look at the view! A view of heaven. Like the living city of heaven, isn't it, it just fairly glimmers in the sun.

Hannah: Glimmers.

Sister Ella Chapter: Even the stone and brick it just glimmers and glitters like heaven in the sunshine. Such a nice view you get, perched up on a canyon rim. Some kind of beautiful place.

Hannah: It's just Salt Lake, and it's hot, and you're selling the house for me, not to me.

Sister Ella Chapter: I like to work up an enthusiasm for my properties.

Hannah: Just get me a good price.

Sister Ella Chapter: Well, the market's off.

Hannah: At least fifty.

Sister Ella Chapter: Forty'd be more. like it.

Hannah: Fifthy.

Sister Ella Chapter: Wish you'd wait a bit.

Hannah: Well I can't.

Sister Ella Chapter: Wish you would. You're about the only friend I got.

Hannah: Oh well now.

Sister Ella Chapter: Know why I decided to like you? I decided to like you 'cause you're the only unfriendly Mormon I ever met.

Hannah: Your wig is crooked.

Sister Ella Chapter: Fix it. Hannah straightens Sister Ella's wig.

Sister Ella Chapter: New York City. All they got there is tiny rooms.

I always thought: people ought to stay put. That's why I got my license to sell real estate. It's a way of saying: Have a house! Stay put! It's way of saying traveling's no good. Plus I needed the cash. (She takes out a pack of cigarettes from her purse, lights one, offers pack to Hannah)

Hannah: Not out here, anyone could come by.

Nothing that came out of this house ever worked righ anyway. I won't be sorry to leave.

Oh, my life. God . . . hasn't spared me much.

It's a hard place, Salt Lake: baked dry. Abundant energy; not much intelligence. That's a combination that can wear a body out. No harm looking someplace else. I don't need much room.

My sister-in-law Libby thinks there's radon gas in the basement.

Sister Ella Chapter: Is there gas in the . . .

Hannah: Of course not. Libby's a fool.

Sister Ella Chapter: 'Cause I'd have to include that in the description.

Hannah: There's no gas, Ella. (Little pause) Give a puff. (She takes a furtive drag of Ella's cigarette) Put it away now.

Sister Ella Chapter: So I guess it's goodbye.

Hannah: You'll be all right, Ella, I wans't ever much of a friend.

Sister Ella Chapter: I'll say something but don't laugh, OK?

This is the home of saints, the godliest place on earth, they say, and I think they're right. That mean there's no evil here? No. Evil's everywhere. Sin's everywhere. But this . . . is the spring of sweet water in the desert, the desert flower. Every step a Believer takes away from here is a step fraught with peril. I fear for you, Hannah Pitt, because you are my friend. Stay put. This is the right home of saints.

Hannah: Latter-day saints.

Sister Ella Chapter: Only kind left.

Hannah: But still. Late in the day . . . for saints and everyone. That's all. That's all.

Fifty thousand dollars for the house, Sister Ella Chapter, don't undersell. It's an impressive view.

ACT THREE: NOT-YET-CONSCIOUS, FORWARD DAWNING Late Winter 1985-86

Scene 1

The state is completely dark. Prior is in bed in his apartment, having a nightmare. He wakes up, sits up and switches on a nightlight. He looks at his clock. Seated by the table near the bed in a man dressed in the clothing of a 13th-century British squire.

Prior: Who are you?

Prior 1: My name is Prior Walter. Pause.

Prior: My name is Prior Walter.

Prior 1: I know that.

Prior: Explain.

Prior 1: You're alive. I'm not. We have the same name. What do you want me to explain?

Prior: A ghost?

Prior 1: An ancestor.

Prior: Not the Prior Walter? The Bayeux tapestry Prior Walter?

Prior 1: His great-great grandson. The fifth of the name.

Prior: I'm the thirty-fourth, I think.

Prior 1: Actually the thirty-second.

Prior: Not according to Mother.

Prior 1: She's including the two bastards, then; I say leave them out. I say no room for bastards. The little things you swallow . . .

Prior: Pills.

Prior 1: Pills. For the pestilence. I too . . .

Prior: Pestilence. . . . You too what?

Prior 1: The pestilence in my time was much worse than now. Whole villages of empty houses. You could look outdoors and see Death walking in the morning, dew dampening the ragged hem of his black robe. Plain as I see you now.

Prior: You died of the plague.

Prior 1: The spotty monster. Like you, alone.

Prior: I'm not alone.

Prior 1: You have no wife, no children.

Prior: I'm gay.

Prior 1: So? Be gay, dance in your altogether for all I care, what's that to do with not having children?

Prior: Gay homosexual, not bonny, blithe and . . . never mind.

Prior 1: I had twelve. When I died. The second ghost appears, this one dressed in the clothing of an elegant 18th-century Londoner.

Prior 1 (To Prior 2): And I was three years younger than him. Prior sees the new ghost, screams.

Prior: Oh god another one.

Prior 2: Prior Walter. Prior to you by some seventeen others.

Prior 1: He's counting the bastards.

Prior: Are we having a convention?

Prior 2: We've been sent to declare her fabulouis incipience. They love a well-paved entrance with lots of heralds, and . . .

Prior 1: The messenger come. Prepare the way. The infinite descent, a breath in air . . .

Prior 2: They chose us, I suspect, because of the mortal affinities. In a family as long-descended as the Walters there are bound to be a few carried off by plague.

Prior 1: The spotty monster.

Prior 2: Black Jack. Came from a water pump, half the city of London, can you imagine? His came from fleas. Yours, I understand, is the lamentable consequence of venery . . .

Prior 1: Fleas on rats, but who knew that?

Prior: Am I going to die?

Prior 2: We aren't allowed to discuss . . .

Prior 1: When you do, you don't get ancestors to help you through it. You may be surrounded by children but you die alone.

Prior: I'm afraid.

Prior 1: You should be. There aren't even torches, and the path's rocky, dark and steep.

Prior 2: Don't alarm him. There's good news before there's bad.

We two come to strew rose petal and palm leaf before the triumphal procession. Prophet. Seer. Revelator. It's a great honor for the family.

Prior 1: He hasn't got a family.

Prior 2: I meant for the Walters, for the family in the larger sense.

Prior (Singing): All I want is a room somewhere, Far away from the cold night air . . .

Prior 2 (Putting a hand on Prior's forehead): Calm, calm, this is no brain fever . . . Prior calms down, but keeps his eyes closed. The lights begin to change. Distant Glorious Music.

Prior 1 (Low chant): Adonai, Adonai, Olam ha-yichud, Zefirot, Zazahot, Ha-adam, ha-gadol Daughter of Light, Daughter of Splendors, Flour! Phosphor! Lumen! Candle! Prior 2 (Simultaneously): Even now, From the mirror-bright halls of heaven, Across the cold and lifeless infinity of space, The Messenger comes Trailing orbs of light, Fabulous, incipient, Oh Prophet, To you . . . Prior 1 and Prior 2: Prepare, prepare, The Infinite Descent A breath, a feather, Glory to . . . (They vanish)

Scene 2

Split scene: Louis and Belize in a coffee shop. Prior is at the outpatient clinic at the hospital with Emily, the nurse; she has him on a pentamidine IV drip.

Louis: Why has democracy succeeded in America? Of course by succeeded I mean comparatively, not literally, not in the present, but what makes for the prospect of some sort of radical democracy spreading outward and growing up? Why does the power that was once so carefully preserved at the top of the pyramid by the original framers of the Constitution seem drawn inexorably downward and outward in spite of the best effort of the Right to stop this? I mean it's the really hard thing about being Left in this country, the American Left can't help but trip over all these petrified little fetishes: freedom, that's the worst; you know, Jeane Kirkpatrick for God's sake will go on and on about freedom and so what does that mean, the word freedom, when she talks about it, or human rights; you have Bush talking about human rights, and so what are these people talking about, they might as well be talking about the mating habits of Venusians, these people don't begin to know what, onto-logically, freedom is or human rights, like they see these property-based Rights-of-Man-type rights bu that's not enfranchisement, not democracy, not what's implicit, what's potential within the idea, not the idea with blood in it. That's just liberalism, the worst kind of liberalism, really, bourgeois tolerance, and what I think is that what AIDS shows us is the limits of tolerance, that it's not enough to be tolerated, because when the shit hits the fan you find out how much tolerance is worth. Nothing. And underneath all the tolerance is intense, passionate hatred.

Belize: Uh huh.

Louis: Well don't you think that's true?

Belize: Uh huh. It is.

Louis: Power is the object, not being tolerated. Fuck assimilation. But I mean in spite of all this the thing about America, I think, is that ultimately we're different from every other nation on earth, in that, with people here of every race, we can't. . . . Ultimately what defines us isn't race, but politics. Not like any European country where there's an insurmountable fact of a kind of racial, or ethnic, monopoly, or monolith, like all Dutchmen, I mean Dutch people, are well, Dutch, and the Jews of Europe were never Europeans, just a small problem. Facing the monolith. But here there are so many small problems, it's really just a collection of small problems, the monolith is missing. Oh, I mean, of course I suppose there's the monolith of White America. White Straight Male America.

Belize: Which is not unimpressive, even among monoliths.

Louis: Well, no, but when the race thing gets taken care of, and I don't mean to minimalize how major it is, I mean I know it is, this is a really, really incredibly racist country but it's like, well, the British. I mean, all these blue-eyed pink people. And it's just weird, you know, I mean I'm not all that Jewish-looking, or . . . well, maybe I am but, you know, in New York, everyone is . . . well, not everyone, but so many are but so but in England, in London I walk into bars and I feel like Sid the Yid, you know I mean like Woody Allen in Annie Hall, with the payess and the gabardine coat, like never, never anywhere so much--I mean, not actively despired, not like they're Germans, who I think are still terribly anti-Semitic, and racist too, I mean black-racist, they pretent otherwise but, anyway, in London, there' just . . . and at one point I met this black gay guy from Jamaica who talked with a lilt but he said his family'd been living in London since before the Civil War--the American one--and how the English never let him forget for a minute that he wasn't blue-eyed and pink and I said yeah, me too, these people are anti-Semites and he said yeah but the British Jews have the clothing business all sewed up and blacks there can't get a foothold. And it was an incredibly awkward moment of just. . . . I mean here we were, in this bar that was gay but it was a pub, you know, the beams and the plaster and those horrible little, like, two-day-old fish and egg sandwiches--and just so British, so old, and I felt, well, there's no way out of this because both of us are, right now, too much immersed in this history, hope is dissolved in the sheer age of this place, where race is what counts and there's no real hope of change--it's the racial destiny of the Brits that matters to them, not their political destiny, whereas in America . . .

Belize: Here in America race doesn't count.

Louis: No, no, that's not. . . . I mean you can't be hearing that . . .

Belize: I . . .

Louis: It's--look, race, yes, but ultimately race here is a political question, right? Racists just try to use race here as a tool in a political struggle. It's not really about race. Like the spiritualists try to use that stuff, are you enlightened, are you centered, channeled, whatever, this reaching out for a spiritual past in a country where no indigenous spirit exist--only the Indians, I mean Native American spirits and we killed them off so now, there are no gods here, no ghosts and spirits in America, there are no angels in America, no spiritual past, no racial past, there's only the political, and the decoys and the ploys o maneuver around the inescapable battle of politics, the shifting downwards and outwards of political power to the people . . .

Belize: POWER to the People! AMEN! (Looking at his watch) OH MY GOODNESS! Will you look at the time, I gotta . . .

Louis: Do you. . . . You think this is, what, racist or naive or something?

Belize: Well it's certainly something. Look, I just remembered I have an appointment . . .

Louis: What? I mean I really don't want to, like, speak from some position of privilege and . . .

Belize: I'm sitting here, thinking, eventually he's got to run out of steam, so I let you rattle on and on saying abou maybe seven or eight things I find really offensive . . .

Louis: What?

Belize: But I know you, Louis, and I know the guilt fueling this peculiar tirade is obviously already swollen bigger than you hemorrhoids . . .

Louis: I don't have hemorrhoids.

Belize: I hear different. May I finish?

Louis: Yes, but I don't have hemorrhoids.

Belize: So finally, when I . . .

Louis: Prior told you, he's an asshole, he shouldn't have . . .

Belize: You promised, Louis. Prior is not a subject.

Louis: You brought him up.

Belize: I brought up hemorrhoids.

Louis: So it's indirect. Passive-aggressive.

Belize: Unlike, I suppose, banging me over the head with your theory that America doesn't have a race problem.

Louis: Oh be fair I never said that.

Belize: Not exactly, but . . .

Louis: I said . . .

Belize: . . . but it was close enough, because if it'd been that blunt I'd've just walked out and . . .

Louis: You deliberately misinterpreted! I . . .

Belize: Stop interrupting! I haven't been able to . . .

Louis: Just let me . . .

Belize: NO! What, talk? You've been talking nonstop since I got here, yaddadda yaddadda blah blah blah, up the hill, down the hill, playing with your MONOLITH . . .

Louis (Overlapping): Well, you could have joined in at any time instead of . . .

Belize (Continuing over Louis): . . . and girlfriend it is truly an awesome spectacle but I got better things to do with my time than sit here listening to this racist bullshit just because I feel sorry for you that . . .

Louis: I am not a racist!

Belize: Oh come on . . .

Louis: So maybe I am a racist but . . .

Belize: Oh I really hate that! It's no fun picking on you Louis; you're so guilty, it's like throwing darts at a glob of jello, there's no satisfying hits, just quivering, the darts just blop in and vanish.

Louis: I just thin when you are discussing lines of oppression it gets very complicated and . . .

Belize: Oh is that a fact? You know, we black drag queens have a rather intimate knowledge of the complexity of the lines of . . .

Louis: Ex-black drag queen.

Belize: Actually ex-ex.

Louis: You're doing drag again?

Belize: I don't. . . . Maybe. I don't have to tell you. Maybe.

Louis: I think it's sexist.

Belize: I didn't ask you.

Louis: Well it is. The gay community, I think, has to adopt the same attitude towards drag as black women have to take towards black women blues singers.

Belize: Oh my we are walking dangerous tonight . . .

Louis: Well, it's all internalized oppression, right, I mean the masochism, the stereotypes, the . . .

Belize: Louis, are you deliberately trying to make me hate you?

Louis: No, I . . .

Belize: I mean, are you deliberately transforming yourself into an arrogant, sexual-political Stalinist-slash-racist flag-waving thug for my benefit? Pause.

Louis: You know what I think?

Belize: What?

Louis: You hate me because I'm a Jew.

Belize: I'm leaving.

Louis: It's true.

Belize: You have no basis except your . . .

Louis, it's good to know you haven't changed; you are still an honorary citizen of the Twilight Zone, and after your pale, pale white polemics on behalf of racial insensitivity you have a flaming fuck of a lot of nerve calling me an anti-Semite. Now I really gotta . . .

Louis: You called me Lou the Jew.

Belize: That was a joke.

Louis: I didn't think it was funny. It was hostile.

Belize: It was three years ago.

Louis: So?

Belize: You just called yourself Sid the Yid.

Louis: That's not the same thing.

Belize: Sid the Yid is different from Lou the Jew.

Louis: Yes.

Belize: Someday you'll have to explain that to me, but right now . . .

You hate me because you hate black people.

Louis: I do not. But I do think most black people are anti-Semitic.

Belize: "Most black people." That's racist, Louis, and I think most Jews . . .

Louis: Louis Farrankhan.

Belize: Ed Koch.

Louis: Jesse Jackson.

Belize: Jackson. Oh really, Louis, this is . . .

Louis: Hymietown! Hymietown!

Belize: Louis, you voted for Jesse Jackson. You send checks to the Rainbow Coalition.

Louis: I'm ambivalent. The checks bounced.

Belize: All your checks bounce, Louis; you're ambivalent about everything.

Louis: What's that supposed to mean?

Belize: You may be dumber than shit but I refuse to believe you can't figure it out. Try.

Louis: I was never ambivalent about Prior. I love him. I do. I really do.

Belize: Nobody said different.

Louis: Love and ambivalence are. . . . Real love isn't ambivalent.

Belize: "Real love isn't ambivalent." I'd swear that's a line from my favorite bestselling paper-back novel, In Love with the Night Mysterious, except I don't think you ever read it. Pause.

Louis: I never read it, no.

Belize: You ought to. Instead of spending the rest of you life trying to get through Democracy in America. It's about this white woman whose Daddy owns a plantation in the Deep South in the years before the Civil War--the American one--and her name is Margaret, and she's in love with her daddy's number-one slave, and his name is Thaddeus, and she's married but her white slave-owner husband has AIDS: Antebellum Insufficiently Developed Sexorgans. And there's a lot of hot stuff going down when Margaret and Thaddeus can catch a spare torrid ten under the cotton-picking moon, and then of course the Yankees come, and they set the slaves free, and the slaves string up old Daddy, and so on. Historical fiction. Somewhere in there I recall Margaret and Thaddeus find the time to discuss the nature of love; her face is reflecting the flames of the burning plantation--you know, the way white people do--and his black face is dark in the night and she says to him, "Thaddeus, real love isn't ever ambivalent." Little pause. Emily enters and turns off IV drip.

Belize: Thaddeus looks at her; he considers her thesis; and he isn't sure he agrees.

Emily (Removing IV drip from Prior's arm): Treatment number . . . (Consulting chart) four.

Prior: Pharmaceutical miracle. Lazarus breathes again.

Louis: Is he. . . . How bad is he?

Belize: You want the laundry list?

Emily: Shirt off, let's check the . . . Prior takes his shirt off. She examines his lesions.

Belize: There's the weight problem and the shit problem and the morale problem.

Emily: Only six. That's good. Pants. He drops his pants. He's naked. She examines.

Belize: And. He thinks he's going crazy.

Emily: Looking good. What else?

Prior: Ankles sore and swollen, but the leg's better. The nausea's mostly gone with the little orange pills. BM's pure liquid but not bloody anymore, for now, my eye doctor says everything's OK, for now, my dentist says "yuck!" when he sees my fuzzy tongue, and now he wears little condoms on his thumb and forefinger. And a mask. So what? My dermatologist is in Hawaii and my mother . . . well leave my mother out of it. Which is usually where my mother is, out of it. My glands are like walnuts, my weight's holding steady for week two, and a friend died two days ago of bird tuberculosis; bird tuberculosis; that scared me and I didn't go to the funeral today because he was an Irish Catholic and it's probably open casket and I'm afraid of . . . something, the bird TB or seeing him or. . . . So I guess I'm doing OK. Except for of course I'm going nuts.

Emily: We ran the toxoplasmosis series and there's no indication . . .

Prior: I know, I know, but I feel like something terrifying is on its way, you know, like a missile from outer space, and it's plummeting down towards the earth, and I'm ground zero, and . . . I am generally know where I am known as one cool, collected queen. And I am ruffled.

Emily: There's really nothing to worry about. I think that shochen bamromim hamtzeh menucho nechono al kanfey haschino.

Prior: What?

Emily: Everything's fine. Bemaalos k'doshim ut'horim kezohar horokeea mazhirim . . .

Prior: Oh I don't understand what you're . . .

Emily: Es nishmas Prior sheholoch leolomoh, baavur shenodvoo z'dokoh b'ad hazkoras nishmosoh.

Prior: Why are you doing that! Stop it! Stop it!

Emily: Stop what?

Prior: You were just . . . weren't you just speaking in Hebrew or something.

Emily: Hebrew? (Laughs) I'm basically Italian-American. No. I didn't speak in Hebrew.

Prior: Oh no, oh god please I really think I . . .

Emily: Look, I'm sorry, I have a waiting room full of. . . . I think you're one of he lucky ones, you'll live for years, probably--you're pretty healthy for someone with to immune system. Are you seeing someone? Loneliness is a danger. A therapist?

Prior: No, I don't need to see anyone, I just . . .

Emily: Well think about it. You aren't going crazy. You're just under a lot of stress. No wonder . . . (Shee starts to write in his chart) Suddenly there is an astonishing blaze of light, a huge chord sounded by a gigantic choir, and a great book with steel pages mounted atop a molten-red pillar pops up from the stage floor. The book opens; there is a large Aleph inscribed on its pages, which bursts into flames. Immediately the book slams shut and disappears instantly under the floor as the light become normal again. Emily notices none of this, writing. Prior is agog.

Emily (Laughing, exiting): Hebrew . . . Prior flees.

Louis: Help me.

Belize: I beg you pardon?

Louis: You're a nurse, give me something, I . . . don't know what to do anymore, I. . . . Last week at work I screwed up the Xerox machine like permanently and so I . . . then I tripped on the subway steps and my glasses broke and I cut my forehead, here, see, and now I can't see much and my forehead . . . It's like the Mark of Cain, stupid, right, but it won't heal and every morning I see it and I think, Biblical things, Mark of Cain, Judas Iscariot and his silver and his noose, people who . . . in betraying what they love betray what's truest in themselves, I feel . . . nothing but cold for myself, just cold, and every night I miss him, I miss him so much but then . . . those sores, and the smell and . . . where I thought it was going. . . . I could be . . . I could be sick too, maybe I'm sick too. I don't know.

Belize. Tell him I love him. Can you do that?

Belize: I've thought about it for a very long time, and I still don't understand what love is. Justice is simple. Democracy is simple. Those things are unambivalent. But love is very hard. And it goes bad for you if you violate the hard law of love.

Louis: I'm dying.

Belize: He's dying. You just wish you were.

Oh cheer up, Louis. Look at that heavy sky out there.

Louis: Purple.

Belize: Purple? Boy, what kind of a homosexual are your, anyway? That's not purple, Mary, that color up there is (Very grand) mauve.

All day today it's felt like Thanksgiving. Soon, this . . . ruination will be blanketed white. You can smell it--can you smell it?

Louis: Smell what?

Belize: Softness, compliance, forgiveness, grace.

Louis: No . . .

Belize: I can't help you learn that. I can't help you, Louis. You're not my business. (He exits) Louis puts his head in his hands, inadvertently touching his cut forehead.

Louis: Ow FUCK! (He stands slowly, looks towards where Belize exited) Smell what?

(He looks both ways to be sure no one is watching, then inhales deeply, and is surprised) Huh. Snow.

Scene 3

Harper in a very white, cold place, with a brilliant blue sky above; a delicate snowfall. She is dressed, for warmth, in layers upon layers of mismatched clothing. The sound of the sea, faint.

Harper: Snow! Ice! Mountains of ice! Where am I? I . . .

I feel better, I do, I . . . feel better. There are ice crystals in my lungs, wonderful and sharp. And the snow smells like cold, crushed peaches. And there's something . . . some curren of blood in the wind, how strange, it has that iron taste.

Mr. Lies: Ozone.

Harper: Ozone! Wow! Where am I?

Mr. Lies: The Kingdom of Ice, the bottom-most part of the world.

Harper (Looking around, then realizing): Antarctica. This is Antarctica!

Mr. Lies: Cold shelter for the shattered. No sorrow here, tears freeze.

Harper: Antarctica, Antarctica, oh boy oh boy, LOOK at this, I. . . . Wow, I must've really snapped the tether, huh?

Mr. Lies: Apparently . . .

Harper: That's great. I want to stay here forever. Set up camp. Build things. Build a city, an enourmous city made up of frontier forts, dark wood and grean roofs and high gates made of pointed logs and bonfires burning on every street corner. I should build by a river. Where are the forests?

Mr. Lies: No timber here. Too cold. Ice, no trees.

Harper: Oh details! I'm sick of details! I'll plant them and grow them. I'll live off caribou fat, I'll melt it over the bonfires and drink it from long, curved goat-horn cups. It'll be great. I want to make a new world here. So that I never have to go home again.

Mr. Lies: As long as it lasts. Ice has a way of melting . . .

Harper: No. Forever. I can have anything I want here--maybe even companionship, someone who has . . . desire for me. You, maybe.

Mr. Lies: It's against the by-laws of the International Order of Travel Agents to get involved with clients. Rules are rules. Anyway, I'm not the one you really want.

Harper: There isn't anyone . . . maybe an Eskimo. Who could ice-fish for food. And help me build a nest for when the baby comes.

Mr. Lies: There are no Eskimo in Antarctica. And you're not really pregnant. You made that up.

Harper: Well all of this is made up. So if the snow feels cold I'm pregnant. Right! Here, I can be pregnant. And I can have any kind of a baby I want.

Mr. Lies: This is a retreat, a vacuum, its virtue is that it lacks everything; deep-freeze for feelings. You can be numb and safe here, that's what you came for. Respect the delicate ecology of you delusions.

Harper: You mean like no Eskimo in Antarctica.

Mr. Lies: Correcto. Ice and snow, no Eskimo. Even hallucinations have laws.

Harper: Well then who's that? The Eskimo appears.

Mr. Lies: An Eskimo.

Harper: An antarctic Eskimo. A fisher of the polar deep.

Mr. Lies: There's something wrong with this picture. The Eskimo beckons. Harper approaches. The Eskimo lowers his hood. It's Joe.

Harper: I'm going to like this place. It's my own National Geographic Special! Oh! Oh! (She holds her stomach) I think . . . I think I felt her kicking. Maybe I'll give birth to a baby covered with thick white fur, and that way she won't be cold. My breasts will be full of hot cocoa so she doesn't get chilly. And if it gets really cold, she'll have a pouch I can crawl into. Like a marsupial. We'll mend together. That's what we'll do; we'll mend.

Scene 4

As abandoned lot in the South Bronx. A homeless Woman is standing near an oil drum in which a fire is burning. Snowfall. Trash around. Hannah enters dragging two heavy suitcases.

Hannah: Excuse me? I said excuse me? Can you tell me where I am? Is this Brooklyn? Do you know a Pineapple Street? Is there some sort of bus or train or . . . ?

I'm lost, I just arrived from Salt Lake. City. Utah? I took the bush that I was told to take and I got off--well it was the very last stop, so I had to get off, and I asked the driver was this Brooklyn, and he nodded yes but he was from one of those foreign countries where they think it's good manners to nod at everything even if you have no idea what it is you're nodding at, and in truth I think he spoke no English at all, which I think would make him ineligible for employment on public transportation. The public being English-speaking, mostly. Do you speak English? The Woman nods.

Hannah: I was supposed to be met at the airport by my son. He didn't show and I don't wait more than three and three-quarters hours for anyone. I should have been patient, I guess, I. . . . Is his . . .

Woman: Bronx.

Hannah: Is that. . . . The Bronx? Well how in the name of Heaven did I get to the Bronx when the bus driver said . . .

Woman (Talking to herself): Slurp slurp slurp will you STOP that disgusting slurping! YOU DISGUSTING SLURPING FEEDING ANIMAL! Feeding yourself, just feeding yourself, what would it matter, to you or to ANYONE, if you just stopped. Feeding. And DIED? Pause.

Hannah: Can you just tell me where I . . .

Woman: Why was the Koskiusko Bridge named after a Polack?

Hannah: I don' know wha you're . . .

Woman: That was a joke.

Hannah: Well what's the punchline?

Woman: I don't know.

Hannah: Oh for pete's sake, is here anyone else who . . . (She looks around) No one anywhere.

Woman (Again, to herself): Stand further off you fat loathsome whore, you can't have anymore of this soup, slurp slurp slurp you animal, and the--I know you'll just go pee it all away and where will you do that? Behind what bush? It's FUCKING COLD out here and I . . .

Oh that's right, because it was supposed to have been a tunnel!

That's not very funny.

Have you read the prophecies of Nostradamus?

Hannah: Who?

Woman: Some guy I went out with once somewhere, Nostradamus. Prophet, outcast, eyes like. . . . Scary shit, he . . .

Hannah: Shut up. Please. Now I want you to stop jabbering for a minute and pull you wits together and tell me how to get to Brooklyn. Because you know! And you are going to tell me! Because there is no one else around to tell me and I am wet and cold and I am very angry! So I am sorry you're psychotic but just make the effort--take a deep breath--DO IT! Hannah and the Woman breathe together.

Hannah: That's good. Now exhale.

They do.

Hannah: Good. Now how do I get to Brooklyn?

Woman: Don't know. Never been. Sorry. Want some soup?

Hannah: Manhattan? Maybe you know . . . I don't suppose you know the location of the Mormon Visitor's . . .

Woman: 65th and Broadway.

Hannah: How do you . . .

Woman: Go there all the time. Free movies. Boring, but you can stay all day.

Hannah: Well. . . . So how do I . . .

Woman: Take the D Train. Next block make a right.

Hnah: Thank you.

Woman: Oh yeah. In the new century I think we will all be insane.

Scene 5

Joe and Roy in the study of Roy's brownstone. Roy is wearing an elegant bathrobe. He has made a considerable effort to look well. He isn't well, and he hasn't succeeded much in looking it.

Joe: I can't. The answer's no. I'm sorry.

Roy: Oh, well, apologies . . .

I can't see that there's anyone asking for apologies. Pause.

Joe: I'm sorry, Roy.

Roy: Oh, well, apologies.

Joe: My wife is missing, Roy. My mother's coming from Salt Lake to . . . to help look, I guess. I'm supposed to be at the airpor now, picking her up but. . . . I just spent two days in a hospital, Roy, with a bleading ulcer, I was spitting up blood.

Roy: Blood, huh? Look, I'm very busy here and . . .

Joe: It's just a job.

Roy: A job? A job? Washington! Dumb Utah Mormon hick shi!

Joe: Roy . . .

Roy: WASHINGTON! When Washington called me I was younger than you, you think I said "Aw fuck no I can't go I got two fingers up my asshole and a little moral nosebleed to boot!" When Washington calls you my pretty young punk friend you go or you can go fuck yourself sideways 'cause the train has pulled out of the station, and you are out, nowhere, out in the cold. Fuck you, Mary Jane, get outta here.

Joe: Just let me . . .

Roy: Explain? Ephemera. You broke my heart. Explain that. Explain that.

Joe: I love you. Roy.

There's so much that I want, to be . . . what you see in me, I want to be a participant in the world, in your world, Roy, I want to be capable of that, I've tried, really I have but . . . I can't do this. Not because I don't believe in you, but because I believe in you so much, in what you stand for, at heart, the order, the decency. I would give anything to protect you, but. . . . There are laws I can't break. It's too ingrained. It's not me. There's enough damage I've already done.

Maybe you were right, maybe I'm dead.

Roy: You're not dead, boy, you're a sissy.

You love me; that's moving, I'm moved. It's nice to be loved. I warned you about her, didn't I, Joe? But you don't listen to me, why, because you say Roy is smart and Roy's a friend but Roy . . . well, he isn' nice, and you wanna be nice. Right? A nice, nice man!

(Little pause)

You know what my greatest accomplishment, was, Joe, in my life, what I am able to look back on and be proudest of? And I have helped make Presidents and unmmake them and mayors and more goddam judges than anyone in NYC ever--AND several million dollars, tax-free--and what do you think means the most to me?

You ever hear of Ethel Rosenberg? Huh, Joe, huh?

Joe: Well, yeah, I guess I. . . . Yes.

Roy: Yes. Yes. You have heard of Ethel Rosenberg. Yes. Maybe you even read about her in the history books.

If it wasn't for me, Joe, Ethel Rosenberg would be alive today, writing some personal-advice column for Ms. magazine. She isn't. Because during the trial, Joe, I was on the phone every day, talking with the judge . . .

Joe: Roy . . .

Roy: Every day, doing what I do best, talking on the telephone, making sure that timid Yid nebbish on the bench did his duty to America, to history. That sweet unprepossessing woman, two kis, boo-hoo-hoo, reminded us all of our litle Jewish mamas--she came this close to geting life; I pleaded till I wept to put her in the chair. Me. I did that. I would have fucking pulled the switch if they'd have let me. Why? Because I fucking hate traitors. Because I fucking hate communists. Was it legal? Fuck legal. Am I a nice man? Fuck nice. They say terrible things about me in the Nation. Fuck the Nation. You want to be Nice, or you want to be Effective? Make the law, or subject to it. Choose. Your wife chose. A week from today, she'll be back. SHE knows how to get what SHE wants. Maybe I ought to send her to Washington.

Joe: I don't believe you.

Roy: Gospel.

Joe: You can't possibly mean what you're saying.

Roy, you were the Assistant District Attorney on the Rosenberg case, ex-parte communication with the judge during the trial would be . . . censurable, at least, probably conspiracy and . . . in a case that resulted in execution, it's

Roy: What? Murder?

Joe: You're not well is all.

Roy: What do you mean, not well? Who's not well? Pause.

Joe: You said . . .

Roy: No I didn't. I said what?

Joe: Roy, you have cancer.

Roy: No I don't. Pause.

Joe: You told me you were dying.

Roy: What the fuck are you talking about, Joe? I never saidd that. I'm in perfect health. There's not a goddam thing wrong with me.

(He smiles)

Shake? Joe hesitates. He holds out his hand to Roy. Roy pulls Joe into a close, strong clinch.

Roy (More to himself than to Joe): It's OK that you hurt me because I love you, baby Joe. That's why I'm so rough on you. Roy releases Joe. Joe backs away a step or two.

Roy: Prodigal son. The world will wipe its dirty hands all over you.

Joe: It already has, Roy.

Roy: Now go. Roy shoves Joe, hard. Joe turns to leave. Roy stops him, turns him around.

Roy (Smoothing Joe's lapels, tenderly): I'll always be here, waiting for you . . .

(Then again, with sudden violence, he pulls Joe close, violently)

What did you want from me, what was all this, what do you want, treacherous ungrateful little . . . Joe, very close to belting Roy, grabs him by the front of his robe, and propels him across the length of the room. He holds Roy at arm's length, the other arm ready to hit.

Roy (Laughing softly, almost pleading to be hit): Transgress a little, Joseph. Joe releases Roy.

Roy: There are so many laws; find one you can break. Joe hesitates, then leaves, backing out. When Joe has gone, Roy doubles over in great pain, which he's been hiding throughout he scene with Joe.

Roy: Ah, Christ . . .

Andy! Andy! Get in here! Andy! The door opens, but it isn't Andy. A small Jewish Woman dressed modestly in a fifties hat and coat stands in the doorway. The room darkens.

Roy: Who the fuck are you? The new nurse? The figure in the doorway says nothing. She stares at Roy. A pause. Roy looks at her carefully, gets up, crosses to her. He crosses back to the chair, sits heavily.

Roy: Aw, fuck. Ethel.

Ethel Rosenberg (Her manner is friendly, her voice is ice-cold): You don't look good, Roy.

Roy: Well, Ethel. I don't feel good.

Ethel Rosenberg: But you lost a lot of weight. That suits you. You were heavy back then. Zaftig, mit hips.

Roy: I haven't been that heavy since 1960. We were all heavier back then, before the body thing started. Now I look like a skeleton. They stare.

Ethel Rosenberg: The shit's really hit the fan, huh, Roy? Little pause. Roy nods.

Ethel Rosenberg: Well the fun's just started.

Roy: What is this, Ethel, Halloween? You trying to scare me? Ethel says nothing.

Roy: Well you're wasting your time! I'm scarier than you any day of the week! So beat it, Ethel! BOOO! BETTER DEAD THAN RED! Somebody trying to shake me up? HAH HAH! From the throne of god in heaven to the belly of hell, you can all fuck yourselves and then go jump in the lake because I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU OR DEATH OR HELL OR ANYTHING!

Ethel Rosenberg: Be seeing you soon, Roy. Julius sends his regards.

Roy: Yeah, well send his to Julius! He flips the bird in her direction, stands and moves towards her, intending to slam the door in her face. Halfway across the room he slumps to the floor, breathing laboriously, in pain.

Ethel Rosenberg: You're a very sick man, Roy.

Roy: Oh God . . . ANDY!

Ethel Rosenberg: Hmmm. He doesn't hear you, I guess. We should call the ambulance.

(She goes to the phone)

Hah! Buttons! Such things they got now.

What do I dial, Roy? Pause. Roy looks at her, then:

Roy: 911..

Ethel Rosenberg (Dials the phone): It sings!

(Imitating dial tones) La la la . . .

Huh.

Yes, you should please send an ambulance to the home of Mister Roy Cohn, the famous lawyer.

What's the address, Roy?

Roy (A beat, then): 244 East 87th.

Ethel Rosenberg: 244 East 87th Street. No apartment number, he's got the whole building. Me? An old friend.

(She hangs up)

They said a minute.

Roy: I have all the time in the world.

Ethel Rosenberg: You're immortal.

Roy: I'm immortal. Ethel. (He forces himself to stand)

I have forced my way into history. I ain't never gonna die.

Ethel Rosenberg (A little laugh, then): History is about to crack wide open. Millennium approaches.

Scene 6

Prior's bedroom. Prior 1 watching Prior in bed, who is staring back at him, terrified. Tonight Prior 1 is dressed in weird alchemical robes and hat over his historical clothing and he carries a long palm-leaf bundle.

Prior 1: Tonight's the night! Aren't you excited? Tonight she arrives! Right through the roof! Ha-adam, Ha-gadol . . .

Prior 2 (Appearing, similarly attired): Lumen! Phosphor! Fluor! Candle ! An unending billowing of scarlet and . . .

Prior: Loock. Garlic. A mirror. Holly water. A crucifix. FUCK OFF! Get the fuck out of my room! GO!

Prior 1 (To Prior 2): Hard as a hickory knob, I'll bet.

Prior 2: We all tumesce when they approach. We wax full, like moons.

Prior 1: Dance.

Prior: Dance?

Prior 1: Stand up, dammit, give us your hands, dance!

Prior 2: Listen . . . Alone aboe begins to play a little dance tune.

Prior 2: Delightful soun. Care to dance?

Prior: Please leave me alone, please just let me sleep . . .

Prior 2: Ah, he wants someone familiar. A partner who knows his steps. (To Prior) Close your eyes. Imagine . . .

Prior: I don't . . .

Prior 2: Hush. Close your eyes. Prior does.

Prior 2: Now open them. Prior does. Louis appears. He looks gorgeous. The music segues into "Moon River," the orchestral version.

Prior: Lou.

Louis: Dance with me.

Prior: I can't, my leg, it hurts at night . . .

Are you . . . a ghost Lou?

Louis: No. Just spectral. Lost to my self. Sitting all day on cold park benches. Wishing I could be with you. Dance with me, babe . . . Prior stands up. The leg stops hurting. They begin to dance. The music is beautiful.

Prior 1 (To Prior 2): Hah. Now I see why he's got no children. He's a sodomite.

Prior 2: Oh be quiet, you medieval gnome, and let them dance.

Prior 1: I'm not interfering I've done my bit. Hooray, hooray, the messenger's come, now I'm blowing off. I don't like it here. Prior I vanishes.

Prior 2: The twentieth century. Oh dear, the world has gotten so terribly, terribly old. Prior 2 vanishes. Louis and Prior waltz happily. Lights fade back to normal. Louis vanishes.

Prior dances alone.

Then suddenly, the sound of wings fills the room.

Scene 7

Split scene: Prior alone in his apartment; Louis alone in the park.

Again, a soundd of beating wings.

Prior: Oh don't come in here don't come in . . . LOUIS!!

No. My name is Prior Walter, I am . . . the scion of an ancient line, I am . . . abandoned I . . . no, my name is . . . is . . . Prior and I live . . . here and now, and . . . in the dark, in the dark, the Recording Angel opens its hundred eyes and snaps the spine of the Book of Life and . . . hush! Hush!

I'm talking nonsense, I . . .

No more mad scene, hush, hush . . . Louis in the park on a bench. Joe approaches, stands at a distance. They stare at each other, then Louis turns away.

Louis: Do you know the story of Lazarus?

Joe: Lazarus?

Louis: Lazarus. I can't remember what happens, exactly.

Joe: I don't. . . . Well, he was dead, Lazarus, and Jesus breathed life into him. He brought him back from death.

Louis: Come here often?

Joe: No. Yes. Yes.

Louis: Back from the dead. You believe that really happened?

Joe: I don't know anymore what I believe.

Louis: This is quite a coincidence. Us meeting.

Joe: I followed you.

From work. I . . . followed you here. Pause.

Louis: You followed me.

You probably saw me that day in the washroom and thought: there's a sweet guy, sensitive, cries for friends in trouble.

Joe: Yes.

Louis: You thought maybe I'll cry for you.

Joe: Yes.

Louis: Well fooled you. Crocodile tears. Nothing . . . (He touches his heart, shrugs) Joe reaches tentatively to touch Louis's face.

Louis (Pulling back): What are you doing? Don't do that.

Joe (Withdrawing his hand): Sorry, I'm sorry.

Louis: I'm . . . just not . . . I think, if you touch me, your hand might fall off or something. Worse things have happened to people who have touched me.

Joe: Please.

Oh, boy . . .

Can I . . .

I . . . want . . . to touch you. Can I please just touch you . . . um, here?

(He puts his hand on one side of Louis's face. He holds it there)

I'm going to hell for doing this.

Louis: Big deal. You think it could be any worse than New York City?

(He puts his hand on Joe's hand. He takes Joe's hand away from his face, holds it for a moment, then) Come on.

Joe: Where?

Louis: Home. With me.

Joe: This makes no sense. I mean I don't know you.

Louis: Likewise.

Joe: And what you do know about me you don't like.

Louis: The Republican stuff?

Joe: Yeah, well for starters.

Louis: I don't not like that. I hate that.

Joe: So why on earth should we . . . Louis goes to Joe and kisses him.

Louis: Strange bedfellows. I don't know. I never made it with one of the damned before.

I would really rather not have to spend tonight alone.

Joe: I'm a pretty terrible person,, Louis.

Louis: Lou.

Joe: No, I really really am. I don't think I deserve being loved.

Louis: There? See? We already have a lot in common. Louis stands, begins to walk away. He turns, looks back at Joe. Joe follows. They exit. Prior listens. At first no sound, then once again, the sound of beating wings, frighteningly near.

Prior: That sound, that sound it. . . . What is that, like birds or something, like a really big bird. I'm frightened, I . . . no, no fear, find the anger, find the . . . anger, my blood is clean, my brain is fine, I can handle pressure, I am a gay man and I am used to pressure, to trouble, I am tough and strong and. . . . Oh. Oh my goodness. I . . . (Looks down at his crotch. He is washed over by an intense sexual feeling) Ooohhh. . . . I'm hot, I'm . . . so . . . aw Jeez what is going on here I . . . must have a fever I. . . . OH! PLEASE, OH PLEASE! Something's coming in here, I'm scared, I don't like this at all, something's approaching and I. . . . OH! There is a creaking and a groaning from the bedroom ceiling, which rains plaster dust. The bedside light flickers wildly. Then there is a great blaze of triumphal music, heralding. The light turns an extraordinary harsh, cold, pale blue, then a rich, brilliant warm golden color, then a hot, bilious green, and then finally a spectacular royal purple.

Prior (An awestruck whisper): God almighty . . . Very Stephen Spielberg. A sound, like a plummeting meteor, tears down from very, very far above the earth, hurtling at an incredible velocity towards the bedroom; the light seems to be sucked out of the room as the projectile approaches; as the room reaches darkness, we hear a terrifying CRASH as something immense strikes earth; the whole building shudders and a part of the bedroom ceiling, lots of plaster ad lathe and wiring, crashes to the floor. And then in a shower of unearthly white light: Spreading great opalescent gray-silver wings, the angel descends into the room and floats above the bed.

Angel: Greetings, Prophet; The Great Work begins: The Messenger has arrived. Blackout.
