 GADGET Written by Christopher Nolan Based on the novel: "American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer" © 2022 SYNCOPY By Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 1. A VAST SPHERE OF FIRE, the fire of a thousand suns, slowly eats the night-time desert. A line of black type appears: PROMETHEUS STOLE FIRE FROM THE GODS AND GAVE IT TO MAN. And the sound of DOZENS OF FEET STAMPING RHYTHMICALLY... FOR THIS HE WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK AND TORTURED FOR ETERNITY. ROILING PLASMA expands, the sound of STAMPING GROWS OPPRESSIVE, the STAMPING FASTER and FASTER OVER- A FACE. Gaunt, tense, EYES TIGHTLY SHUT. The face SHUDDERS- the sound CEASES AS MY EYES OPEN, STARING INTO THE CAMERA: Peer into my soul- J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, aged fifty, close- cropped greying hair. The gentle sounds of bureaucracy... SUPER TITLE: "1. FISSION" VOICE (O.S.) Dr Oppenheimer, as we begin, I believe you have a statement to read into the record? I glance down at my notes. OPPENHEIMER Yes, your honour- SECOND VOICE (O.S.) We’re not judges, doctor. OPPENHEIMER No. Of course. (I start reading) Members of the Security Board, the so-called derogatory information in your indictment of me cannot be fairly understood except in the context of my life and work. This answer is a summary of relevant aspects of my life in more or less chronological order... SENATE AIDE (V.O.) How long did he testify? CUT TO: Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 2. INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (BLACK-AND-WHITE SEQUENCE) CLOSE: on a prosperous sixty-three-year-old man, LEWIS STRAUSS, as he takes a cup of coffee from a SENATE AIDE... SUPER TITLE: "2. FUSION" STRAUSS I forget. Three days, or so. The whole hearing took a month. SENATE AIDE An ordeal. STRAUSS I’ve only read the transcripts, but who’d want to justify their whole life? SENATE AIDE You weren’t there? STRAUSS As Chairman, I wasn’t allowed to be. Are they really going to ask about it? It was years ago. SENATE AIDE Four years ago. Oppenheimer still divides America- the committee will want to know where you stood. (checks his watch) Ready? INT. CORRIDOR, SENATE BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W) The Senate Aide leads Strauss along the corridor. SENATE AIDE Senator Thurmond asked me to say not to feel you’re on trial. STRAUSS I didn’t, till you said that. SENATE AIDE Really, Mr Strauss- Admiral. STRAUSS (CONT’D) SENATE AIDE (CONT’D) Admiral Strauss, this is a formality. (MORE) (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 3. SENATE AIDE (CONT’D) President Eisenhower’s asked you to be in his cabinet, the Senate has no choice but to confirm you. They arrive at the door. STRAUSS And if they bring up Oppenheimer? SENATE AIDE When they bring up Oppenheimer, answer honestly and no senator can deny that you did your duty. It’ll be uncomfortable... (smiles) Who’d want to justify their whole life? The door to the VAST committee room opens- they enter, FLASHBULBS POPPING as PRESS and PUBLIC see Strauss. ROBB (V.O.) Why did you leave the United States? INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR) The room is SMALL, SHABBY. Surprised, I look up from my statement at the prosecutor, Roger ROBB. Then turn to the THREE BOARD MEMBERS (GRAY, EVANS, MORGAN). OPPENHEIMER I wanted to learn the new physics. GRAY Was there nowhere here? I thought Berkeley had the leading theoretical physics department- OPPENHEIMER Sure. Once I built it. First I had to go to Europe. I went to Cambridge to work under Patrick Blackett. ROBB Were you happier there than in America? CUT TO: (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 4. INSERT CUT: A YOUNG ME (TWENTY-ONE) LIES IN BED STARING UP, CRYING... PARTICLES WITH THE VASTNESS OF THE STARS MOVE LIKE FIREFLIES... OPPENHEIMER No. I was homesick. Emotionally immature... troubled by visions of a hidden universe... INT. LABORATORY, CAMBRIDGE -- DAY The young ME, frazzled demeanor, STRUGGLES with equipment. OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...useless in the lab. I drop a beaker, it SHATTERS. PATRICK BLACKETT looks over, FROWNING. He picks up an APPLE and takes a LARGE BITE. BLACKETT (through apple) Christ, Oppenheimer, have you had any sleep? Start again. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER I need to go to the lecture. BLACKETT Why? It’s Niels Bohr. Blackett checks his watch- starts packing up- BLACKETT Damn, completely forgot. Let’s go. I start to pack up with the other students. BLACKETT (CONT’D) Not you. Finish coating those plates. I clean up as Blackett and the other students leave- one leaves an APPLE for Blackett- GREEN WITH STEM AND TINY LEAF. I pause at a bottle: "Potassium Cyanide"... CLUMSY HANDS SHAKING, I draw CYANIDE into a syringe. I INJECT the apple... YOUNG OPPENHEIMER (pleading) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 5. EXT. QUADRANGLE, CAMBRIDGE -- EVENING I HURRY across the quad. A lonely figure. BOHR (V.O.) Quantum physics isn’t a step forward... INT. LECTURE HALL, CAMBRIDGE -- CONTINUOUS I sneak into the back of the auditorium. Standing, SPELLBOUND, as NIELS BOHR, a charismatic Dane, lectures. BOHR ...It’s a new way to understand reality. Einstein’s opened a door, now we’re peering through, seeing a world inside our world... a world of energy and paradox that not everyone can accept. I RAISE my hand to ask a question... INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) CUT TO: Strauss sits facing the Committee, COUNSEL beside him, PRESS, CAMERAS and PUBLIC behind... SENATOR MCGEE Admiral Strauss, I’m interested in your relationship with Dr J. Robert Oppenheimer. You met in 1947? STRAUSS Correct. SENATOR MCGEE You were a commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission? STRAUSS I was, but I met Robert in my capacity as board member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. After the war he was world-renowned- the great man of physics... Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 6. EXT. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, PRINCETON -- DAY (B&W) Strauss, younger, fifty-one, bustles out of the Institute- STRAUSS (V.O.) ...I was determined to get him to run the Institute. -to welcome the rail-thin figure of Oppenheimer (forty- three), emerging from a TAXI in HAT and coat, PIPE in mouth. ICONIC. STRAUSS Dr Oppenheimer, an honour. OPPENHEIMER Mr Strauss. STRAUSS It’s pronounced 'straws'. OPPENHEIMER 'Oh-ppenheimer', 'aw-ppenheimer'- any way you say it they know I’m Jewish. STRAUSS I’m a proud member of Temple Emmanuel- 'straws' is the Southern pronunciation. Welcome to the Institute. I think you could be very happy here. Oh? OPPENHEIMER STRAUSS Well, you’ll love the commute- the position comes with that house for you and your wife. Strauss points along an avenue of trees to Olden Manor... STRAUSS (CONT’D) And your two children... Oppenheimer nods as he follows Strauss into the Institute. INT. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, PRINCETON -- CONTINUOUS (B&W) Strauss leads Oppenheimer through the Institute. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 7. STRAUSS I’m a great admirer of your work. OPPENHEIMER You’re a physicist by training, Mr Strauss? STRAUSS No, I’m not trained in physics, or anything else. I’m a self-made man. OPPENHEIMER I can relate to that... STRAUSS Really? OPPENHEIMER (dry) My father was one. INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE, INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W) Strauss shows Oppenheimer into the well-appointed office. STRAUSS This would be your office. Oppenheimer drifts to the windows- a LAWN rolls down to a POND. He spots a FIGURE- long grey hair poking from under his hat- STRAUSS (CONT’D) I’m told he’s there most afternoons. The figure gently tosses a stone into the water. STRAUSS (CONT’D) I’ve always wondered why you didn’t involved him in the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer turns to Strauss, interested. STRAUSS (CONT’D) The greatest scientific mind of our time? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 8. OPPENHEIMER Of his time. Einstein published his Theory of Relativity more than forty years ago, but never embraced the quantum world it revealed. STRAUSS 'God doesn’t play dice.' OPPENHEIMER Precisely. You never thought of studying physics formally? STRAUSS I had offers. But I chose to sell shoes. OPPENHEIMER Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe salesman? STRAUSS No. Just a shoe salesman. (opens the door) I’ll introduce you- OPPENHEIMER No need. I’ve known him for years. Strauss, awkward, stays in the doorway and WATCHES... FROM AFAR: as Oppenheimer approaches, Einstein’s HAT BLOWS off his head, unleashing a MESS OF GREY HAIR, hat rolling across the grass to where Oppenheimer SCOOPS it up, and we... CUT TO: INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR) I flip a page. Continue reading my statement. OPPENHEIMER I struggled badly trying to visualize this new world... INT. ROOMS AT CAMBRIDGE -- DAY The Young Me lies on the floor, STARING UP. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 9. OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...you had to retool your mind to see things hovering just out of site... INSERT CUT: POINTS OF LIGHT MOVE LIKE SPARKS, BUT IN A WAVE. OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...then you could unlock forces never before imagined... I wipe TEARS from my eyes. INSERT CUT: STARS. SPARKS FROM A CAMPFIRE. I PAT THE NOSE OF A HORSE IN THE DARKNESS AS I FEED IT AN APPLE. I grow calm, my eyelids lowering... INSERT CUT: AN APPLE- GREEN WITH STEM AND A TINY LEAF... I open MY EYES- JUMP out of bed- SCRAMBLE to dress- EXT. QUADRANGLE, CAMBRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER I RUN, DESPERATE, AGAINST the crowd- INT. LABORATORY, CAMBRIDGE -- DAY I BURST in- Blackett LOOKS UP. ANOTHER MAN has his back to me. Between them on the workbench- the POISONED APPLE... BLACKETT You alright? I nod awkward, trying to control my BREATHING... BLACKETT (CONT’D) Niels, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer. The other man TURNS, offers his hand- Niels Bohr. BOHR What does the 'J' stand for? BLACKETT Nothing, apparently. Bohr takes me in- this strange, BREATHLESS young man... (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 10. BOHR You were at my lecture. You asked the only good question. BLACKETT Nobody’s denying his insight. It’s his labouratory skills that leave a little to be desired. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER I heard you give the same BOHR lecture- At Harvard. And you asked the same question. Why ask again? YOUNG OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) I hadn’t liked your answer. BOHR Did you like it better yesterday? A lot. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER BOHR You can lift the rock without being ready for the snake that’s revealed. Now, it seems, you’re ready. Bohr picks up the POISONED APPLE from Blackett’s desk... BOHR (CONT’D) You don’t enjoy the lab? I shake my head. Bohr GESTICULATES with the apple as he talks- I watch it bob around- a kitten following a ball of string... BOHR (CONT’D) Get out of Cambridge, with its beakers and potions. Go somewhere they’ll let you think... (assesses me) Gottingen. Born? BLACKETT BOHR Born. Get to Germany. Study under Max Born. Learn the ways of theory. I’ll send word. Bohr raises the apple to take a bite- I GRAB it. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 11. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Wormhole. -DROP it into the wastebasket. Blackett peers at it, curious. BOHR How’s your mathematics? BLACKETT Not good enough for the physicist he wants to be. BOHR Algebra’s like sheet music. The important thing isn’t can you read music, it’s can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert? I can. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER SPARKS explode in WAVES, WAVES of FIRE CRASHING on a SHORE of GLASS, FLYING OVER the MEDIEVAL SPIRES of Gottingen, I watch BORN and BOHR and DIRAC, GALAXIES of PARTICLES DISPERSE and REFORM, a CUBIST PAINTING transfixes the Young Me, an ORCHESTRA plays STRAVINSKY, I read THE WASTE LAND, I WRITE FURIOUSLY at a desk, I WRITE FURIOUSLY on a chalkboard, I SMASH a glass, and ANOTHER, and ANOTHER, WATCHING the SHARDS skid across the floor, CATCHING and REFRACTING LIGHT, I watch RAINDROPS scintillate a PUDDLE, STREAM down a windowpane, I disturb the surface of a sink full of WATER, watching RIPPLES propagate and INTERFERE, I BOUNCE a ball against a corner of my room, studying its trajectory... CUT TO: EXT. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, PRINCETON -- DAY (B&W) Strauss watches Oppenheimer hand the HAT to Einstein. Strauss checks his watch, then starts down the hill towards them. As he approaches, Einstein TURNS, walking towards Strauss with a GRIM EXPRESSION. STRAUSS (friendly) Albert... Einstein PASSES without acknowledging Strauss. Strauss reaches Oppenheimer- STRAUSS (CONT’D) What did you say to him? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 12. OPPENHEIMER He’s fine. Mr Strauss, there are things in my past you need to be aware of. STRAUSS As Chairman of the AEC I have access to your security file. I’ve read it. The job is yours. OPPENHEIMER You’re not worried? STRAUSS After all you’ve done for your country? OPPENHEIMER Times change, Mr Strauss. STRAUSS The purpose of this Institute is to provide a haven for independent minds. You’re the man for the job. OPPENHEIMER Then I’ll consider it. And I’ll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow. Oppenheimer turns, heads back up the hill. STRAUSS (taken aback) This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country... Oppenheimer looks back at Strauss, GRINS- OPPENHEIMER With a great commute. That’s why I’m considering it. Strauss watches him go, shaking his head. SENATOR MCGEE (V.O.) So, Dr Oppenheimer brought your attention to his past associations before you appointed him? INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) Yes. STRAUSS (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 13. SENATOR MCGEE And they didn’t concern you? STRAUSS Just then I was more concerned about what he’d said to Einstein to sour him on me. A few CHUCKLES from the room. SENATOR MCGEE But later? STRAUSS Well, we all know what happened later. INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR) The board members listen as I continue reading... OPPENHEIMER After Gottingen I moved on to Leiden in Holland... INT. LECTURE HALL, LEIDEN -- DAY A packed hall. The Young Me nervously checks my notes. OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...where I first met Isidor Rabi... A stocky young man, ISIDOR RABI (thirty), plonks down next to a DUTCH STUDENT who reluctantly shifts, giving him room. RABI A Yank lecturing on new physics? This I have to hear- I’m an American myself. DUTCH STUDENT How surprising. RABI Let me know if you need help with the English. I start lecturing... IN DUTCH. Ravi, confused, leans in. CUT TO: (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 14. RABI (CONT’D) Wait, what’s he saying? INT. TRAIN, LEIDEN TO ZURICH -- NIGHT I stare out the window at dark trees, steam and shadows, Rabi dumps his bags down, slumps opposite, sizes me up. Offers me an orange- YOUNG OPPENHEIMER No, thank you. RABI It’s a long way to Zurich. You get any skinnier we might lose you between the seat cushions. I’m Rabi. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Oppenheimer. Rabi starts peeling his orange. RABI I caught your lecture on molecules. Caught some if it- we’re a couple of New York Jews- how do you know Dutch? YOUNG OPPENHEIMER I thought I’d better learn it when I got here this semester. Rabi STOPS peeling his orange to STARE at me- RABI You learned Dutch in six weeks to give a lecture on quantum mechanics? YOUNG OPPENHEIMER I wanted to challenge myself. RABI Quantum physics isn’t challenging enough? Schvitzer. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Schvitzer? RABI 'Show-off.' Dutch in six weeks but you never learned Yiddish? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 15. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER (smile) They don’t speak it so much my side of the park. RABI Screw you. Homesick? YOUNG OPPENHEIMER You know it. Rabi peels his orange. He turns serious... RABI Ever get the feeling our kind isn’t entirely welcome here? YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Physicists? RABI Funny. YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Sometimes. Not in the department. RABI They’re all Jewish, too. Rabi tosses me a slice of orange. RABI (CONT’D) Eat. I take the orange, 'sipping' at it. RABI (CONT’D) In Zurich there’s a German you have to seek out- YOUNG OPPENHEIMER Heisenberg. INT. LECTURE HALL, ZURICH -- DAY A tall man of twenty-six turns from the blackboard- HEISENBERG. I study his every move. Rabi NUDGES me 'See?'... INT. SAME -- LATER Rabi introduces me to Heisenberg. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 16. HEISENBERG Oppenheimer, yes. I liked your paper on molecules. OPPENHEIMER Probably because you inspired it. HEISENBERG If I inspire anything else, let me know. We could publish together. OPPENHEIMER I have to get back to America. HEISENBERG Why? There’s no one there taking quantum mechanics seriously. OPPENHEIMER That’s exactly why. RABI He’s pining for the canyons of Manhattan. OPPENHEIMER The canyons of New Mexico. HEISENBERG You’re from New Mexico? OPPENHEIMER New York, but my brother and I have a ranch outside of Santa Fe. That’s the America I miss right now. HEISENBERG Then you best go home, cowboys. RABI That’s his thing- me and horses? I don’t think so. GRAY (V.O.) Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again? INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY I smile to myself. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 17. OPPENHEIMER Not in person. But you might say our paths crossed. ROBB Doctor, during your time in Europe, you seem to have met a wide range of other countries’ physicists... (consulting notes) Born, Bohr, Pauli, Dirac, Einstein, Heisenberg...? OPPENHEIMER That’s right. Robb looks up at me... ROBB Any Russians? OPPENHEIMER Not that spring to mind. (from notes) Returning to America I accepted appointments at both Caltech... EXT. BERKELEY -- DAY I walk across campus to the physics department... OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) ...and up at Berkeley. INT. CORRIDOR, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS I struggle to unlock a door... it opens- INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS A DUSTY storage space. Scattered tables and chairs. A piano. EXT. CORRIDOR, BERKELEY -- MOMENTS LATER I step out of the classroom. Look NEXT DOOR... Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 18. INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY I enter. A handsome young scientist, ERNEST LAWRENCE, works on an assemblage of curved pipes and wiring with students, including Luis ALVAREZ. OPPENHEIMER Dr. Lawrence, I presume. LAWRENCE You must be Oppenheimer. I hear you want to start a school of quantum theory. OPPENHEIMER I am starting it. Next door. LAWRENCE They put you in there? OPPENHEIMER I asked for it. I wanted to be close to you experimentalists. LAWRENCE Theory will get you only so far. (gestures) We’re building a machine to accelerate electrons. OPPENHEIMER Magnificent. LAWRENCE Would you like to help? OPPENHEIMER Build it? No. But I’m working on theories I’d like to test with it. LAWRENCE When do you start teaching? OPPENHEIMER I’ve got my first in an hour. LAWRENCE Seminar? Pupil. OPPENHEIMER LAWRENCE One student? That’s it? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 19. OPPENHEIMER I’m teaching something no one here’s dreamt of. But once people start hearing what you can do with it... LAWRENCE (CONT’D) (grins) There’s no going back. INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- LATER I stand there, expectant. A student opens the door, looks around, embarrassed- STUDENT I’m sorry, I must have missed- OPPENHEIMER No, this is it. Mr Lomanitz, right? LOMANITZ (twenty-one) nods, takes a seat. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) What do you know about quantum mechanics? LOMANITZ I have a grasp on the basics- OPPENHEIMER Then you’re doing it wrong. (rapid-fire) Is light made up of particles or waves? Lomanitz opens his mouth to speak- too slow- It can’t. how can it be both? LOMANITZ OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) It can’t. But it is. It’s paradoxical and yet... it OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Quantum mechanics says it’s both- works. Lomanitz is hooked. I turn to the board, chalk out an equation... when I turn back- There are now FIVE students (including SERBER and SNYDER) listening intently... I move to Lomanitz to hand him his paper. I pat his shoulder. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 20. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) You’re gonna be okay. A PACKED CLASSROOM, hanging on my every word as I- now thirty- two, slim, well-dressed, confident- teach in the round. Lawrence listens at the edge, fascinated. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Consider a star... a vast furnace burning in outer space... INSERT CUT: A STAR. A SUN. BURNING, ROILING. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Fire pushing outwards against its own gravity- balanced. But if its furnace cools, gravity starts winning. It contracts... I look around. Make eye contact with Hartland SNYDER. SNYDER Density increases... OPPENHEIMER Increasing gravity... INSERT CUT: THE SUN IS SHRINKING, MORE AND MORE RAPIDLY... SNYDER Increasing density. A vicious cycle. Until... What’s the limit here? OPPENHEIMER I don’t know. See where the math takes us. I guarantee it’s somewhere no one’s been before. SNYDER Me? Your math’s better than mine. OPPENHEIMER DISSOLVE TO: Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 21. EXT. BERKELEY -- DAY Energetic, dashing, I STRIDE across campus, a group of students, including Snyder and Lomanitz, following me, hanging on my every word... OPPENHEIMER Einstein can’t accept the Copenhagen interpretation- LOMANITZ 'God doesn’t play dice.' OPPENHEIMER Except he does. Bohr showed us how... INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- DAY I mark up a paper. Lawrence comes in, frowns at the board. LAWRENCE You shouldn’t let them bring their politics into the classroom... I follow his look: "SATURDAY 2:00pm, RALLY FOR LOYALIST SPAIN". OPPENHEIMER I wrote that. Lawrence, you embrace the revolution in physics, can’t you see it everywhere else? Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx... LAWRENCE This is America, Oppie. We had our revolution. Seriously, keep it out of the lab. OPPENHEIMER Well, out of the lab, my landlady’s having a discussion group tonight. LAWRENCE I’ve sampled the Berkeley political scene- it’s all philosophy postgrads and Communists talking integration. OPPENHEIMER You don’t care about integration? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 22. LAWRENCE I want to vote for it, not talk about it. Let’s get dinner. OPPENHEIMER I’m meeting my brother there. SENATOR BARTLETT (V.O.) Dr Oppenheimer’s file contained details of FBI surveillance on his activities at Berkeley... INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) Strauss looks at the senator, cautious... STRAUSS Yes, as I recall. SENATOR BARTLETT Why would they have started a file on Dr Oppenheimer before the war? STRAUSS You’d have to ask Mr Hoover. SENATOR BARTLETT I’m asking you, Admiral Strauss. STRAUSS My assumption is that it was connected to his left-wing political activities. SENATOR BARTLETT How would these activities have come to the attention of the FBI? STRAUSS Well, if I remember correctly... EXT. HOUSE PARTY, SHASTA ROAD, BERKELEY -- NIGHT (COLOUR) STRAUSS (V.O.) The FBI was taking license plates outside suspected Communist gatherings and his name popped up. As I get out of my car, I spot TWO MEN checking the license plates of cars on the street... I am GRABBED- CUT TO: (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 23. FRANK (O.S.) My younger brother FRANK (twenty-five) and his date, JACKIE. INT. LIVING ROOM, HOUSE PARTY, SHASTA ROAD, BERKELEY -- NIGHT We ENTER the bustling room- I spot a beguiling young woman- VOICE (O.S.) Robert! Come meet Chevalier. Mary WASHBURN grabs my tie and leads us to Haakon CHEVALIER. WASHBURN Dr Haakon Chevalier, Dr Robert Oppenheimer, and vice versa. OPPENHEIMER This is my little brother, Frank. Oh, and... uh... JACKIE Still Jackie. CHEVALIER Hello, Still Jackie. OPPENHEIMER Chevalier. You’re in languages? CHEVALIER And your reputation precedes you. OPPENHEIMER I’m blushing- what’ve you heard? CHEVALIER You’re teaching a radical new approach to physics that I have no chance of understanding. But I hadn’t heard you were a party member- Gotcha! I’m not. OPPENHEIMER FRANK Not yet. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 24. JACKIE Frank and I are thinking of OPPENHEIMER joining- (ignoring Jackie) I support of range of causes. Jackie, put out, leads Frank away. CHEVALIER The Spanish Civil War? OPPENHEIMER A democratic republic being overthrown by fascist thugs? Who wouldn’t be? CHEVALIER Our government- they think socialism’s a bigger threat than fascism. OPPENHEIMER Not for long- look at what the Nazis are doing to the Jews. I send funds to colleagues in Germany to emigrate. I have to do something. My own work is so... abstract. CHEVALIER What’re you working on? OPPENHEIMER What happens to stars when they die. CHEVALIER Do stars die? OPPENHEIMER If they do they’d cool, then collapse. And the bigger the star, the more violent its demise. Their gravity gets so concentrated... INSERT CUT: THE SUN SHRINKS. THE LIGHT OF THE DISTANT STARS BEHIND IS TUGGED TOWARDS THE DYING STAR, BENDING, STRETCHING. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) ...it swallows everything. Even light. Good God. Can that really happen? CHEVALIER (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 25. OPPENHEIMER The math says it can. If we can get published, maybe one day an astronomer finds one. But all I have is theory. Which can’t impact people’s lives. CHEVALIER If you’re sending money to Spain, do it through the Communist Party- they can get it to the front lines. The beguiling young woman is there with a tray of martinis. This is Jean TATLOCK... TATLOCK Mary sent me with these. I’m Jean. Robert. OPPENHEIMER CHEVALIER Haakon Chevalier. The union meeting at Serber’s last month? Tatlock nods. I take a glass. CHEVALIER (CONT’D) Robert here says he’s not a Communist. TATLOCK Then he doesn’t know enough about it. OPPENHEIMER I’ve read Das Kapital. All three volumes. Does that count? CHEVALIER That would make you better read than most Party members. OPPENHEIMER It’s turgid stuff, but there’s some thinking... 'Ownership is theft.' TATLOCK 'Property', not 'Ownership'. OPPENHEIMER Sorry, I read it in the original German. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 26. Chevalier laughs, delighted, as he leaves us alone. TATLOCK It’s not about the book, it’s about the ideas. You sound uncommitted. OPPENHEIMER I’m committed to thinking freely about how to improve our world. Why limit yourself to one dogma? TATLOCK You’re a physicist- do you pick and choose rules? Or do you use the discipline to channel your energies into progress? OPPENHEIMER I like a little wiggle room. Do you always toe the party line? Tatlock considers this. Sizes me up. TATLOCK I like my wiggle room, too. INT. BEDROOM -- LATER We are FUCKING. Hot, sweaty, a little brutal. Tatlock GIVES UP, climbs off me- OPPENHEIMER Wait, wait- I catch my breath, watching her STUDY my shelves. TATLOCK Unexpected. What? OPPENHEIMER TATLOCK For a physicist. OPPENHEIMER You’ve only got a shelf full of Freud? TATLOCK Actually my background’s more- Jungian. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 27. TATLOCK (CONT’D) You know analysis. OPPENHEIMER When I was a postgrad at Cambridge I had some trouble. She turns to me. TATLOCK I’ll bite. OPPENHEIMER I tried to poison my tutor. TATLOCK Did you hate him? OPPENHEIMER I liked him very much. Tatlock turns back to the books. TATLOCK You just needed to get laid. OPPENHEIMER Wow. Took my analysts two years, and I’m not sure they ever put it that succinctly. TATLOCK You had them convinced you’re more complicated than you really are. OPPENHEIMER We’re all simple souls, I guess. TATLOCK Not me. She pulls a book from the shelf: THE BHAGAVAD GITA. She opens the book to find INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHARACTERS. TATLOCK (CONT’D) What’s this? OPPENHEIMER Sanskrit. TATLOCK You can read this? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 28. OPPENHEIMER I’m learning- She climbs on top of me, opens the book in my face. TATLOCK Go on then. I study the page as Tatlock starts to move. OPPENHEIMER In this part, Vishnu reveals TATLOCK (CONT’D) his multi-armed self- Read the words. She points to each word as I translate... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) 'And now I am become Death... She nods, impressed, starts moving again... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) ...destroyer of worlds.' EXT. NEW MEXICO -- DAY Moving over the VAST landscape to find three tiny figures. I lead Lawrence and Frank on horseback up a mountain trail. EXT. CAMPSITE -- EVENING THUNDER. Lawrence climbs off his horse. The wind WHIPS as we set up our tent... OPPENHEIMER It’ll break before dawn. The air cools overnight. Just before dawn, the storm dies. INT./EXT. TENT -- NIGHT Lawrence, Frank and I huddle in the BUFFETING TENT, trying to keep a fire going in the WIND and RAIN outside the tent. FRANK I’m getting married. LAWRENCE Congratulations, Frank. I look at Frank, sardonic with drink. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 29. OPPENHEIMER To Jackie? Frank stares at me... the tent stops buffeting... FRANK Yeah, to Jackie. The waitress. LAWRENCE (sensing tension) Oppie, you’re right- it’s letting up. I’ll see if there’s any stars. Frank watches Lawrence go, then pounces- FRANK All your talk about the common man but Jackie’s not good enough? We join the Party- you can’t hide your disapproval- why? Because that’s supposed to be your thing? OPPENHEIMER I haven’t joined the Party, Frank. And I don’t think she should’ve convinced you to, either- FRANK Half the faculty’s Communist- OPPENHEIMER Not that half. I point in the direction Lawrence wondered off. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) I’m your brother and I want you to be cautious. FRANK And I want to wring your neck. I giggle at this. Frank shakes his head, then starts laughing, too. I grab Frank’s shoulder. Frank looks up... FRANK (CONT’D) Robert, I won’t live my life afraid to make a mistake. I hold up my hands in defeat- OPPENHEIMER You’re happy, I’m happy.

LAWRENCE It’s so clear I feel like I could see one of those dark stars you’re working on... OPPENHEIMER You can’t, that’s the whole point. INSERT CUT: AN EXPANDING DARKNESS EATS THE STARS... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Their gravity swallows light. It’s like a kind of... hole in space. LAWRENCE Is Frank okay? OPPENHEIMER Yeah. He just has a shitty brother. Lawrence smiles at this. Looks around, then- LAWRENCE It’s special here. OPPENHEIMER As a kid I thought if I could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico, my life would be perfect. LAWRENCE It’s a little remote for that. Let’s get some sleep. I turn, heading to the tent. Lawrence follows. OPPENHEIMER That mesa we saw today? One of my favorite places in the world. Tomorrow we’ll climb it. LAWRENCE What’s it called? My response is so soft it is almost swallowed by the dark... (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 31. OPPENHEIMER Los Alamos. EXT.

Hahn and Strassman in Germany... Alvarez tosses the paper at me- ALVAREZ (CONT’D) They split the uranium nucleus. Alvarez! LAWRENCE How? Bombarded it with neutrons. ALVAREZ Lawrence, it’s fission. Nuclear fission. They’ve split the atom... OPPENHEIMER (reading) (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 32. OPPENHEIMER It’s not possible. I put down the paper, take up my chalk like it’s a weapon, move to the board. Alvarez grabs the paper- ALVAREZ I’m going to try to reproduce it. Alvarez and Lawrence leave. I write and write... INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- LATER Lawrence enters. I turn. Point at the board. OPPENHEIMER See. It can’t be done. LAWRENCE Very elegant. Quite clear. Just one problem... Where? OPPENHEIMER LAWRENCE Next door. Alvarez did it. INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- MOMENTS LATER I peer at Alvarez’s oscilloscope... LAWRENCE Theory will take you only so far. I stand, moving away... thinking... OPPENHEIMER During the process extra neutrons boil off. Which could be used to split other uranium atoms... LAWRENCE A chain reaction. You’re thinking what I’m thinking. OPPENHEIMER You, me and every physicist around the world who’s seen the news. ALVAREZ What? What’re we all thinking?

TATLOCK HOUSE, BERKELEY -- NIGHT Tatlock GRABS a bouquet out of my hands- TATLOCK I told you, Robert, no more fucking flowers. She dumps them in the trash. I just stare. OPPENHEIMER I don’t understand what you TATLOCK (CONT’D) want from me- I don’t want anything from you. I pause. Then, gently... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) You say that. Then you call. Tatlock kicks at the dirt. TATLOCK Don’t answer. OPPENHEIMER I’ll always answer. She looks up at me. TATLOCK Fine. But no more flowers. She goes inside- OPPENHEIMER Aren’t you coming? Slams the door shut behind her. I stand there. CHEVALIER (O.S.) You have to know when you’re beaten, Robert. I turn. Chevalier and his wife, BARBARA, wait in the car.

A BANNER: "FEDERATION OF ARCHITECTS, ENGINEERS, CHEMISTS AND TECHNICIANS". A man with a British accent greets us. This is ELTENTON. ELTENTON Chevalier, good to see you. And the illustrious Dr Oppenheimer. I’m Eltenton. Might you say a word about organized labour on campuses? OPPENHEIMER I’ll try to think of something. Eltenton guides me towards the stage... ELTENTON I work at Shell, we’ve signed up chemists and engineers... OPPENHEIMER That’s excellent. I spot Lomanitz, who grins and waves... ELTENTON So why not scientists in academia? OPPENHEIMER Sure. When do we- Eltenton pushes me onto the stage. People start APPLAUDING at the very sight of me. I can’t quite not smile about this. INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY I watch Lawrence examine his cyclotron. OPPENHEIMER Teachers are unionized, Lawrence. Why not professors? LAWRENCE Don’t you have somewhere to be? OPPENHEIMER Academics have rights, too- (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 35. LAWRENCE that. I have a group OPPENHEIMER in. OPPENHEIMER Richard. Dr Bush. What brings you two up north? They exchange glances with Lawrence. Awkward SILENCE. I rise, letting them off the hook- OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Richard, tell Ruth I’ll be down to Pasadena Thursday. INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS As I enter, a magazine FLAPS into my hands from across the room. Students are all reading copies... SERBER Your paper on black holes- it’s in! I open the magazine as I turn to a STUDENT- OPPENHEIMER Get Hartland. LOMANITZ September 1st, 1939- the world’s gonna remember this day... Snyder comes in with a newspaper. Glum. OPPENHEIMER Hartland, our paper, it’s in print! SNYDER We’ve been upstaged. He holds up the paper: "HITLER INVADES POLAND". OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) During the Battle of France and the Battle of Britain... It’s not coming. I’ll sit LAWRENCE one. Not this The door opens. Richard TOLMAN and Vannevar BUSH enter- Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 36. INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY Robb looks on intently as I turn the page on my statement... OPPENHEIMER ...I found myself increasingly out of sympathy with the policy of neutrality that Communists advocated. ROBB And after Hitler invaded Russia, did these Communist sympathies return? OPPENHEIMER No. If you’ll just allow me GRAY to- Mr Robb, you’ll have ample opportunity to cross-examine. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) I need to make clear that my changing opinion of Russia did not mean a sharp break with those who held different views. For a year or two during a previous marriage my wife, Kitty, had been a Communist Party member. Behind me, on a couch, is KITTY (forty-six), listening intently... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) But when I first met her, in Pasadena in 1939, she had already disengaged from politics... INT. HOUSE PARTY, TOLMAN HOUSE, PASADENA -- NIGHT Kitty (thirty-one) watches as I EXPERTLY open the liquor cabinet- OPPENHEIMER This is where I keep the good stuff. KITTY I thought this was the Tolmans’ house. OPPENHEIMER I live with them when I’m at Caltech. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 37. RUTH (O.S.) You two need anything? I turn to see RUTH TOLMAN (forty-five) looking at me, mischievous. OPPENHEIMER We’re fine, Ruthie. (to Kitty) You’re a biologist? KITTY Somehow I graduated to housewife. Can you explain quantum mechanics to me? It seems baffling. OPPENHEIMER It is. This glass- I thump a glass onto the cabinet- pour a drink- OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) This drink- I hand her the glass- fingers touching... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Our bodies... are mostly empty space- groupings of tiny energy waves bound together. KITTY By what? OPPENHEIMER Forces of attraction strong enough to convince us that matter is solid... I push the palm of my hand up against hers. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) And stop my body passing through yours. Kitty pushes her fingers through mine, interlacing our hands. I look at a GREY-HAIRED MAN in conversation with Tolman... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) You’re married to Dr Harrison. KITTY Not very. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 38. OPPENHEIMER Well, there’s someone that I... KITTY Does she feel the same way? OPPENHEIMER Sometimes. Not often enough. As Ruth looks our way I let Kitty’s hand go. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) I’m going to New Mexico, to my ranch. With friends. You should come. Kitty looks meaningfully over her glass at me. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) I meant with your husband. KITTY Yes, you did. Because you know it won’t make a bit of difference. EXT. PERRO CALIENTE -- DAY Kitty and I THUNDER along on horseback, climbing a ridge. I shout ahead to Kitty- OPPENHEIMER Why did you marry him?! Kitty pulls up. I come alongside. KITTY I was lost. He was kind. Lost? OPPENHEIMER KITTY My previous husband died. At twenty- eight I wasn’t ready to be a widow. Kitty DISMOUNTS. I follow. OPPENHEIMER Who was your first husband? KITTY Nobody. But my second husband was Joe Dallet. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 39. KITTY (CONT’D) From money, like me, but he was a union organizer in Youngstown, Ohio. I fell hard. OPPENHEIMER How hard? KITTY Hard enough to spend four years living off beans and pancakes, handing out the Daily Worker at factory gates. Kitty takes out a hip flask. SWIGS. KITTY (CONT’D) By ’36 I told Joe I couldn’t take it anymore, quit the Party and joined my parents swanning around Europe. A year later I said I wanted him back. Him, not the Daily Worker. He said 'Swell, I’ll meet you on my way to Spain.' She hands me the flask. I take a drink. OPPENHEIMER He went to fight for the loyalists? KITTY On his way we reconciled. One beautiful week in Paris. Then he went to the brigades and I waited. One day Steve Nelson turns up in the lobby of the hotel to tell me Joe got himself killed first time he popped out of his trench. OPPENHEIMER Who’s Steve Nelson? KITTY Head of the Communist Party in San Francisco. You don’t know him? OPPENHEIMER I’m not a Communist. KITTY You seem to know a lot of ’em. OPPENHEIMER Including you. Gadget (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 40. KITTY (shakes head) Ideology got Joe killed. For nothing. OPPENHEIMER The Spanish Republic isn’t nothing. KITTY My husband offered both our futures to stop one fascist bullet embedding itself in a mudbank. That’s the definition of nothing. OPPENHEIMER That seems a little reductive- KITTY Pragmatic. Steve and his wife brought me home with them to Chicago, then set me up with husband number three. Now here I am... She looks around at the wilderness... KITTY (CONT’D) Wherever the hell this is- I grab her. Kiss her, hard. INT. TATLOCK’S BEDROOM -- DAY Tatlock and I sit on the floor, backs to the bed like kids. Tatlock has been crying. OPPENHEIMER I didn’t want you to hear it from someone else. TATLOCK You didn’t bring flowers. That’s something. I reach into my pocket- she GRABS the small posy from me, TOSSING it aside. OPPENHEIMER Jean, we both know I’m not what you want. TATLOCK Yeah. But it’s a door closing. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 41. OPPENHEIMER Not as far as I’m concerned. Tatlock looks at me. Appreciating the sentiment. TATLOCK You knocked her up. Fast work. OPPENHEIMER Can’t keep a good man down. TATLOCK I meant her. She knew what she wanted. What about the husband? OPPENHEIMER We spoke. He’s divorcing her so we can get married before she’s showing. TATLOCK How civilized, you idiot. This is your community- you think rules don’t apply to the golden boy? OPPENHEIMER Brilliance makes up for a lot. TATLOCK Don’t alienate the only people in the world who understand what you do. One day you might need them. INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY I write "F.A.E.C.T." on the board, Lomanitz hands out FLIERS. Lawrence enters, GRABBING a flyer from the nearest student: "UNIONIZE THE RADIATION LAB". LAWRENCE Lomanitz? What do you make a month? LOMANITZ (sheepish) A hundred and fifty dollars. Lawrence turns to another student- LAWRENCE How are the working conditions? OPPENHEIMER That’s not the point, Lawrence. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 42. LAWRENCE What do you have in common with dock workers and farm labourers? LOMANITZ Plenty- LAWRENCE Right. Everybody out. Now! (to me) Not you. The students file out. Lawrence SLAMS the door- turns on me- LAWRENCE (CONT’D) What’re you doing?! OPPENHEIMER It’s a trade union- LAWRENCE Full of Communists! OPPENHEIMER So? I haven’t joined the Party- LAWRENCE They won’t let me bring you onto the project because of this shit! They won’t even let me tell you what the project is- OPPENHEIMER I know what the fucking project is, Lawrence! We all heard about Einstein and Szilard’s letter to Roosevelt. Warning him the Germans could make a bomb. And I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bomb. LAWRENCE I don’t? OPPENHEIMER It’s not your people they’re herding into camps! It’s mine! LAWRENCE You think I tell them about your politics? Next time you’re coming home from a meeting, take a look in the rear-view mirror. (MORE) (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 43. LAWRENCE (CONT’D) Listen for sounds on your phone line. And stop being so goddamn naïve. I’m taken aback by this... OPPENHEIMER Why would they care what I do? LAWRENCE Because you’re not just self- important, you’re actually important. I see the reality. Shift gears- OPPENHEIMER I get it. You don’t have to worry. I get it. LAWRENCE You just need to be more- OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Pragmatic. It’s done, Lawrence. I’ll talk to Lomanitz and the others. You don’t have to worry. Lawrence looks at me. Sees this is real. LAWRENCE (CONT’D) Then welcome to the war. OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) I filled out my first security questionnaire... INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY I glance up from my notes. OPPENHEIMER ...and was informed that my involvement in left-wing groups would not prove a bar to my work on the atomic programme. SENATOR PASTORE (V.O.) Why were his Communist associations not seen as a security risk during the war? CUT TO: Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 44. INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) Strauss suppresses his irritation at the line of questioning. STRAUSS Senator, I can’t possibly answer for a security clearance granted years before I even met the man. SENATOR PASTORE Fine. What about after? STRAUSS After the war, Dr Oppenheimer was the most respected scientific voice in the world. That’s why I asked him to run the Institute, that’s why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission. Simple as that. INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (B&W) Strauss paces- STRAUSS What are they accusing me of? SENATE AIDE I think they just want to know what happened between 1947 and 1954 to change your mind on Oppenheimer’s security clearance. STRAUSS I didn’t. I was the AEC Chairman, but it wasn’t me who brought the charges against Robert. Who did? SENATE AIDE STRAUSS Some former staff member of the Joint Congressional Committee- INSERT CUT: A YOUNG MAN LEAFS THROUGH A FILE, COLLECTING HIS THOUGHTS... THIS IS WILLIAM BORDEN... HE STARTS TYPING... STRAUSS (CONT’D) A rabid anti-Communist named Borden. He wrote to the FBI demanding they take action. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 45. SENATE AIDE The FBI? Why not come to the AEC direct? STRAUSS Why get caught holding the knife yourself? SENATE AIDE What did Borden have against Oppenheimer? STRAUSS This was the McCarthy era- people hounded out of jobs for any hint of red... reading Oppenheimer’s security file- his Communist brother, sister-in-law, fiancée, best friend, wife... that’s before you even get to the Chevalier incident. SENATE AIDE But how would Borden have access to Oppenheimer’s security file? STRAUSS Someone gave it to him. Someone who wanted Oppenheimer silenced. Who? SENATE AIDE STRAUSS Who knows? Robert didn’t take care not to upset the power brokers in Washington. His opinions on the atom became definitive and he wasn’t always patient with us mere mortals. I came in for plenty of harsh treatment. There was an AEC vote on the export of isotopes to Norway... INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) Oppenheimer sits at the witness table with Joe VOLPE, the AEC lawyer. Strauss is in the audience. STRAUSS (V.O.) They drafted in Robert to make me look like a fool... (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 46. CONGRESSMAN But, Dr Oppenheimer, one member of the AEC board thinks these isotopes could be useful to our enemies in the production of atomic weapons. OPPENHEIMER Congressman, you could use a shovel in making atomic weapons, in fact, you do. You could use a bottle of beer in making atomic weapons. In fact, you do. LAUGHTER. Strauss squirms, embarrassed. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Isotopes aren’t as useful as electronic components, but more useful than a sandwich. I’d put them somewhere in between. Volpe looks at Strauss, who SMILES, GOOD-HUMOURED... STRAUSS (V.O.) Genius is no guarantee of wisdom. How could this man who saw so much be so blind? INT. OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, BERKELEY -- NIGHT (COLOUR) I come in. The lights are off. A BABY’S CRIES echo... OPPENHEIMER Kitty? She is in the dining room, in the dark, drink in hand.

CHEVALIER OPPENHEIMER No, for a while, Hoke. A while. CHEVALIER Does Kitty know you’re here? OPPENHEIMER (I laugh) Of course she fucking knows! We’re awful. Selfish, awful people... (I down drink) Forget I asked- Chevalier puts out a hand to stop me rising... CHEVALIER Robert, you see beyond the world we live in. There’s a price to be paid for that. Of course we’ll help.

KITTY (CONT’D) 'We' shouldn’t be doing anything. You should. Lawrence won’t get this done. Or Tolman, or Rabi. You will. INT. PRESIDENT’S DINING HALL, BERKELEY -- DAY A crowded and lavish lunch. I notice a large man in ARMY UNIFORM, Colonel GROVES, sitting next to another soldier (NICHOLS) with Bush and Tolman. I sidle up to Lawrence at the buffet. OPPENHEIMER Who’s the uniform? The husky GROVES spills sauce on his tunic, wipes at it. LAWRENCE I thought you might know. INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- AFTERNOON I am working. Groves and Lieutenant Colonel NICHOLS enter.

GROVES If I ever meet one I’ll let you know. Ouch. OPPENHEIMER GROVES Theatres of combat all over the world- but I have to stay in Washington. Why? OPPENHEIMER GROVES I built the Pentagon. The brass likes it so much they made me take over the Manhattan Engineer District. OPPENHEIMER Which is? GROVES Don’t be a smart-ass. You know damn well what it is- you and half of every physics department across America. That’s problem number one. OPPENHEIMER I thought problem number one would be securing enough uranium ore. GROVES Twelve hundred tons. Bought the day I took charge. OPPENHEIMER Processing? GROVES Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Now I’m looking for a project director. OPPENHEIMER And my name came up. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 50. GROVES Nope. Even though you brought quantum physics to America. That made me curious. OPPENHEIMER What have you found out? GROVES You’re a dilettante, womanizer, suspected Communist- OPPENHEIMER I’m a New Deal Democrat- GROVES I said 'suspected'. Unstable, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic. OPPENHEIMER Nothing good? Not even 'he’s brilliant, but'...? GROVES Brilliance is taken for granted in your circles. So, no. Only one person said anything good- Richard Tolman. He thinks you’ve got integrity. But Tolman strikes me as someone who knows science better than people. OPPENHEIMER Yet here you are. You don’t take much on trust. GROVES I don’t take anything on trust. Why don’t you have a Nobel Prize? OPPENHEIMER Why aren’t you a general? GROVES They’re making me one for this. OPPENHEIMER Maybe I’ll have the same luck. GROVES A Nobel Prize for making a bomb? OPPENHEIMER Alfred Nobel invented dynamite. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 51. GROVES So how would you proceed? OPPENHEIMER You’re talking about turning theory into a practical weapons system faster than the Nazis. GROVES Who have a twelve-month head start. OPPENHEIMER Eighteen. GROVES How could you possibly know that? OPPENHEIMER Our fast neutron research took six months- the man they’ve undoubtedly put in charge will have made that leap instantly. GROVES Who do you think they put in charge? OPPENHEIMER Werner Heisenberg. He has the most intuitive understanding of atomic structure I’ve ever seen. GROVES You know his work? OPPENHEIMER I know him. Just like I know Walther Bothe. Von Weizsäcker. Diebner. In a straight race, the Germans win. We’ve got one hope. GROVES Which is? OPPENHEIMER Anti-Semitism. GROVES What? OPPENHEIMER Hitler called quantum physics 'Jewish science'. Said it right to Einstein’s face. (MORE) (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 52. OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Our one hope is that Hitler’s so blinded by hate he’s denied Heisenberg proper resources. Because it’ll take vast resources. Our nation’s best scientists, working together- right now they’re scattered. GROVES Which gives us compartmentalization. OPPENHEIMER All minds have to see the whole task to contribute efficiently. Poor security may cost us the race, inefficiency will. The Germans know more than us, anyway. GROVES The Russians don’t. OPPENHEIMER Remind me- who are we at war with? GROVES Someone with your past doesn’t want to be seen downplaying the importance of security from our Communist allies. OPPENHEIMER Point taken. But no. GROVES You don’t get to say 'no' to me- OPPENHEIMER It’s my job to say 'no' to you when you’re wrong- GROVES So you’ve got the job, now? OPPENHEIMER I’m considering it. GROVES I’m starting to see how you got your reputation. My favorite response? 'Oppenheimer couldn’t run a hamburger stand.' (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 53.

And south- east, hundreds of miles of desert. Enough to find the perfect spot. GROVES For? OPPENHEIMER Success. Groves scans the horizon. Sniffs the air... turns to Nichols. GROVES Build him a town. Fast. (to Oppenheimer) Let’s go recruit some scientists. INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO BOSTON -- NIGHT I watch Groves go over a file. OPPENHEIMER How much can I tell them?

LECTURE HALL, HARVARD -- DAY Groves and I sit talking to BAINBRIDGE and DONALD. BAINBRIDGE I’m not a soldier, Oppie. OPPENHEIMER Soldier? He’s a general- (jab my thumb at Groves) I got all the soldier I need. Maybe too much. I’m here because you know isotopes, and you- (to Donald) know explosives better than anyone. DONALD But you can’t tell us what you’re doing? I glance at Groves. Then CROSS my legs. OPPENHEIMER It’s about unleashing the strong force before the Nazis do. BAINBRIDGE Oh my God. INT. CORRIDOR, MIT -- DAY Groves and I walk with CONDON. CONDON Why? Why would I leave my family? OPPENHEIMER I told you, bring your family. CONDON Why would we go to the middle of nowhere for who knows how long? OPPENHEIMER A year or two. Or three. CONDON Why would you think I’d do that? Groves SNAPS like a bulldog- (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 56. GROVES Why? Why? How about because this is the most important fucking thing that’s ever happened in the history of the world? How about that? I look at Groves, then SHRUG at Condon. INT.

Concerned Scientist GLANCES at Groves then DROPS his gaze. OPPENHEIMER General, could you give us a minute? Groves looks at me. Gets up and goes. CONCERNED SCIENTIST They’re not gonna let someone like me onto this project. And failing a security check isn’t gonna be good for a career even after the war. OPPENHEIMER So you’re a fellow traveler, so what? This is a national emergency. I’ve got some skeletons, and they’ve put me in charge. They need us. CONCERNED SCIENTIST Until they don’t. INT.

OPPENHEIMER RABI That’s what I was afraid of. You’re spread too thin. OPPENHEIMER So you take Theoretical. RABI I’m not coming here, Robert. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 59. OPPENHEIMER Why not? Rabi, seldom at a loss for words, is lost for words... RABI You drop a bomb and it falls on the just and the unjust. I don’t wish the culmination of three centuries of physics to be a weapon of mass destruction. OPPENHEIMER Izzy, I don’t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon, but I know the Nazis can’t. We have no choice. RABI Well, the second thing you have to do is appoint Hans Bethe to head the Theoretical division. OPPENHEIMER Wait, what was the first? RABI Take off that ridiculous uniform- you’re a scientist. OPPENHEIMER General Groves is insisting we join. RABI Tell Groves to shit in his hat. They need us for who we are. So be yourself, only... better. INT. OPPENHEIMER’S OFFICE, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY I pull on a jacket. Run a hand through newly shorn close- cropped dark hair. Put on a PORK PIE HAT. Pick up my pipe...

Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 60. INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY I look down onto the bustle of students. Lomanitz looks up and waves- then is ERASED by WHITEWASH as workers COVER the windows... Serber hands me a key. SERBER This is the only key. Teller’s here already. Shall I show him in? OPPENHEIMER No, wait for the others- The door BURSTS OPEN and a stooped, slightly heavy young man shuffles in. This is EDWARD TELLER. TELLER Let’s get started. OPPENHEIMER Hello, Edward. INT. SAME -- DAY I sit at the front, one long leg tucked under my ass. The scientists include Lawrence, Serber, Teller, BETHE, Condon, Tolman, Feynman, Donald, Bainbridge, NEDDERMEYER and Alvarez. OPPENHEIMER We’ll work here until the T-section at Los Alamos is finished- I see Teller waving a piece of paper- OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) Edward, can I get through my summary? TELLER This is more important. Teller’s paper is passed around the room, scientists PALING... TELLER (CONT’D) Calculating chain reactions... I found a rather troubling possibility. Hans Bethe hands me the paper, turns to Teller. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 61. BETHE That can’t be right. Show me how you did your calculations. TELLER Of course. I look up from the paper, grave. Teller watches the ruckus he’s caused with evident satisfaction. Bethe approaches. BETHE Oppie, this is fantasy. Teller’s calculations cannot be right. OPPENHEIMER Do them yourself while I go to Princeton. BETHE What for? OPPENHEIMER To talk to Einstein. BETHE There’s not much common ground between you two. OPPENHEIMER That’s why I should get his view. EXT. WOODS, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY -- DAY I walk through the trees, gaining on two figures. The two men turn. One of them is Einstein. EINSTEIN Dr Oppenheimer. Have you met Kurt Gödel? We walk here most days. GÖDEL Trees are the most inspiring structures. OPPENHEIMER Albert, might I have a word? Einstein senses the gravity. Nods. We leave Gödel staring up at the bare trees. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 62. EINSTEIN Some days Kurt refuses to eat. Even in Princeton, he’s convinced the Nazis can poison his food. EXT. LAKE, INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY -- MOMENTS LATER Einstein and I emerge from the trees. I pull a piece of paper from my breast pocket. Einstein takes it. EINSTEIN Whose work is this? OPPENHEIMER Teller’s. EINSTEIN And what do you take it to mean? OPPENHEIMER Neutron smashes into nucleus releasing neutrons to smash into other nuclei... INSERT CUT: DARKNESS SPLIT BY GLOWING PARTICLES FIRING INTO EACH OTHER IN AN INCREASINGLY VIOLENT DISPLAY... OPPENHEIMER Criticality- the point of no return- massive explosive force... but the chain reaction doesn’t stop... Einstein studies the paper... he nods. EINSTEIN It would ignite the atmosphere. The air around us CATCHES FIRE... THE PLANET EARTH, LONELY IN VAST DARKNESS, IS SUDDENLY ENGULFED IN FIRE. OPPENHEIMER When we detonate an atomic device, we might start a chain reaction that destroys the world. EINSTEIN And here we are, lost in your quantum world of probabilities, but needing certainty. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 63. I turn to leave. OPPENHEIMER Can you run the calculations yourself? EINSTEIN About the only thing you and I share is a disdain for mathematics. Who’s working on it at Berkeley? OPPENHEIMER Hans Bethe. EINSTEIN He’ll get to the truth. OPPENHEIMER And if the truth is catastrophic? EINSTEIN Then you stop. And share your findings with the Nazis, so neither side destroys the world. EINSTEIN (CONT’D) Robert? (holding out paper) This is yours. Not mine. INT. CORRIDOR, BERKELEY -- DAY I come past the secretaries. Bethe is there, excited. BETHE Teller’s wrong- I gesture SILENCE as I unlock the Rad Lab- INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS Bethe runs to the cabinet- takes out some papers- hands them to me, excited. I start to scan them, GRINNING- BETHE When you narrow Teller’s critical assumptions the real picture emerges- OPPENHEIMER Bottom line? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 64. BETHE The chances of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction are near zero. OPPENHEIMER Near zero? BETHE Oppie, this is good news- OPPENHEIMER Can you run more calculations? BETHE You’ll get the same answer. Until we actually detonate one of these things, the best assurance you’re going to get is this- (jabs paper) Near zero. OPPENHEIMER Theory will take you only so far. INT. OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, BERKELEY -- NIGHT Kitty opens the door to the Chevaliers, finger to her lips - I am holding the sleeping Peter. BARBARA (whispering) So beautiful. We miss him. KITTY Want to adopt? OPPENHEIMER She’s kidding. Kitty shakes her head, 'not kidding'. Barbara takes Peter. I lead Chevalier to the kitchen... OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) We wanted to see you before we left. CHEVALIER For parts unknown... INT. KITCHEN, OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS I mix a tray of martinis. Chevalier watches, distracted. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 65. CHEVALIER You know who I ran into the other day? Eltenton. OPPENHEIMER The chemist from Shell? Union guy? CHEVALIER Yeah. He was moaning about the way we’re handling the war. How so? OPPENHEIMER CHEVALIER Lack of cooperation with our allies. Apparently, our government isn’t sharing any research with the Russians. He said a lot of scientists think the policy’s stupid. My hands SLOW... OPPENHEIMER Oh, yeah? CHEVALIER Yeah. He mentioned that if anyone had information they wanted to pass on, going around official channels, he could help... I look up at Chevalier. Grave. OPPENHEIMER That would be treason. CHEVALIER Yes, of course. I just thought you should know. We STARE at each other... BANG- Kitty barges in. KITTY Brat’s down- where are the martinis? She sees us having a moment... OPPENHEIMER (V.O.) The discussion ended there. I pick up the tray. Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 66. INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY OPPENHEIMER Nothing in our long-standing friendship would have led me to believe that Chevalier was actually seeking information; and I was certain he had no idea of the work on which I was engaged. I steal a glance at Robb, then look directly at the board- OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) It has long been clear to me that I should have reported this incident at once. SENATOR MCGEE (V.O.) The Oppenheimer situation highlights the tension between scientists and the security apparatus... INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) Strauss is at the witness table facing the Senate Committee. SENATOR MCGEE In hopes of learning how the nominee handled such issues during his time at the AEC, we’ll have a scientist appearing before the Committee. STRAUSS (private) Who’re they bringing in? COUNSEL (private) They haven’t said. STRAUSS Mr Chairman, if I may? I’m nominated for Commerce Secretary. Why seek the opinion of scientists- CHAIRMAN This is a Cabinet post, Admiral. We seek a wide range of opinion. CUT TO: (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 67. STRAUSS I’d like to know the name of the scientist testifying. And I’d like the chance to cross-examine. CHAIRMAN (irritated) This is not a court. INT. SENATE OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W) The Senate Aide shows Strauss and Counsel in. COUNSEL Lewis, you’re not on trial- STRAUSS So everyone keeps saying. COUNSEL You act like a defence attorney, the Committee’s gonna act like a prosecutor. STRAUSS (to Senate Aide) A formality, huh? SENATE AIDE No Presidential Cabinet nominee has failed to be confirmed since 1925. This is just how the game is played. COUNSEL It’s in the bag, Lewis, so play nice. They bring in a scientist, so what? Strauss gives a wry smile. Remembers- INSERT CUT: STRAUSS APPROACHES EINSTEIN AND OPPENHEIMER- EINSTEIN BLOWS PAST WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING STRAUSS... STRAUSS You don’t know scientists like I do, counselor. They resent anyone who questions their judgement- especially if you’re not one of them... (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 68. INSERT CUT: STRAUSS STARES- THE CROWD AT THE ISOTOPES HEARING LAUGHS... STRAUSS (CONT’D) I was chair of the AEC- I’m easy to blame for what happened to Robert. SENATE AIDE We can’t let the Senate think that the scientific community doesn’t support you. STRAUSS Should we pivot? To what? SENATE AIDE STRAUSS Embrace it. 'I fought Oppenheimer and the US won'? SENATE AIDE I don’t think we need to go there. Isn’t there anyone we can call who knows what really happened? STRAUSS Teller. SENATE AIDE He’ll make an impression. STRAUSS Can you find out the name of the scientist they’ve called? SENATE AIDE Probably. STRAUSS (to Counsel) We get that name- you call the AEC, find out if he was based in Chicago or Los Alamos during the war. SENATE AIDE Why’s that matter? STRAUSS If he was in Chicago he worked under Szilard and Fermi, not the cult of Oppie at Los Alamos. (MORE) (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 69.

SERBER (CONT’D) Sorry- the gadget will need a thirty-three-pound sphere, about this size... Serber reaches below the table, brings up a GOLDFISH BOWL- SERBER (CONT’D) Or using plutonium, a ten-pound sphere... He puts a large BRANDY GLASS next to the aquarium. SERBER (CONT’D) Here’s the amount of uranium Oak Ridge refined all of last month. Serber drops THREE MARBLES into the bowl. The scientists stare at the almost-empty goldfish bowl. SERBER (CONT’D) The Hanford plant made this much plutonium... (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 71. He drops TWO MARBLES into the brandy glass. SERBER (CONT’D) If we can enrich these amounts... we need a way to detonate them. Teller is at the back folding a paper plane. OPPENHEIMER Are we boring you, Edward? TELLER (without looking up) Yes. OPPENHEIMER May I ask why? TELLER We came into this room knowing a fission bomb was possible. Let’s leave it with something new. Such as? OPPENHEIMER TELLER A 'super' atomic bomb. Instead of uranium, or plutonium, we use hydrogen. MURMURS of dissent- TELLER (CONT’D) (shutting them down) Heavy hydrogen- deuterium. We compact the atoms together under great force and induce a fusion reaction. Not kilotons... megatons. A HUBBUB develops- I process quickly, then- OPPENHEIMER Hang on. How do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms? Teller smiles a self-satisfied smile. TELLER A small fission bomb. GROANS all around...

CUT TO: (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 73. STRAUSS Do you have the filter papers? OPPENHEIMER There’s no doubt what this is. STRAUSS The White House says there’s doubt. Oppenheimer begrudgingly slides them over to Strauss. BUSH Wishful thinking, I’m afraid. OPPENHEIMER It’s an atomic test. STRAUSS The Soviets have a bomb? We’re supposed to be years ahead of them. What were you guys doing at Los Alamos? Wasn’t the security tight? OPPENHEIMER Of course it was- you weren’t NICHOLS (O.S.) there, Lewis. Forgive me, doctor... Strauss leans around the FLOWERS in the centre of the table to see who is speaking- Nichols, now a civilian. NICHOLS (CONT’D) But I was there. CUT TO: EXT.

OPPENHEIMER Mrs Serber. I’ve offered jobs to all the wives. Admin, librarians, computation. We cut down on staff and keep families together. GROVES Are these women qualified? OPPENHEIMER Don’t be absurd. These are some of the brightest minds in our community. CONDON And they’re already security cleared. NICHOLS I’ve informed General Groves you’ve been holding cross-divisional open discussions- GROVES Shut ’em down. Compartmentalization is the key to maintaining security- CONDON It’s only the top men. NICHOLS Who, presumably, communicate with subordinates.

You’d have to deliver by ox-cart not airplane. STRAUSS If it could put us ahead again, Truman needs to know about it. And if there’s a possibility that the Russians know about it from a spy at Los Alamos... we’ve gotta get going. OPPENHEIMER There’s no proof there was a spy at Los Alamos.

OPPENHEIMER INT. ROOM 805, HOTEL, SAN FRANCISCO -- NIGHT Tatlock studies me from across the room. TATLOCK You drop in and out of my life and don’t have to tell me why. That’s power.

I just wanted to check whether I should talk to Lomanitz while I’m here- given your concerns. JOHNSON That’s up to you, really, professor. But I’d be cautious. OPPENHEIMER Understood. Oh, and as far as the union goes, I wanted to give you a heads up on a man named Eltenton.

PASH Not then, but soon after... INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY OPPENHEIMER He’s head of security for the project, shouldn’t I know him? GROVES No, he should know you. I’d never put you in a room with Pash. 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 Why not? OPPENHEIMER GROVES When Pash first learned about Lomanitz- he told the FBI he was going to kidnap him, take him out on a boat, interrogate him 'in the Russian manner'... INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY Pash sits down next to me, opposite Johnson. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 93. PASH Dr Oppenheimer, this is a pleasure. General Groves has placed a certain responsibility in me, and it’s like having a child, that you can’t see, by remote control, so to actually meet you... I don’t mean to take much of your time... The disarming friendliness of the truly dangerous. OPPENHEIMER Not at all. Whatever time you choose. PASH Mr Johnson told me of your conversation yesterday, in which I’m very interested. It had me worried all day... OPPENHEIMER I didn’t want to talk to Lomanitz without authorization- PASH That’s not the particular interest I have. It’s something a little more, in my opinion, more serious... INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY GROVES When the FBI pointed out that such information couldn’t be used in court Pash made it clear that he didn’t intend to have anyone left to prosecute. The FBI talked him down, but that’s the man you’re dancing with. INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY PASH I gather you’ve heard there are other parties interested in the work of the Radiation Lab... (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 94. OPPENHEIMER Well, a man attached to the Soviet Consul indicated, through intermediate people, to people on this project that he was in a position to transmit information they might supply. PASH Why would anyone on the project want that? OPPENHEIMER Frankly, I can see there might be arguments for the commander-in- chief informing the Russians- they’re our allies. But I don’t like the idea of it going out the back door- it might not hurt to be on the lookout for it. INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY GROVES You said that to Pash? OPPENHEIMER I was trying to put it in the context of... Russia’s not Germany. GROVES Boris Pash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop. Born here but in 1918 he went back to Russia to fight the Bolsheviks. This is a man who’s killed Communists with his own hands. INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY Pash spreads his palms... PASH I’m not the judge of who should or should not get information. My business is to stop it going through illegally. Could you be a little more specific? 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 95. OPPENHEIMER There’s a man whose name was mentioned to me a couple of times- Eltenton. I think he’s a chemist employed by Shell. He talked to a friend of his who’s an acquaintance of someone on the project. To go beyond that would be to put names down of people who are not only innocent but were one hundred percent cooperative. INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY Groves is staring at me like I just crapped my pants. GROVES You thought Pash would be satisfied with that? OPPENHEIMER I was trying to give them Eltenton without opening a can of worms. I told him a cock-and-bull story. INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY I am up front. Robb questioning- ROBB Did you lie to General Groves, too? OPPENHEIMER No, I told him I’d lied to Pash. INT. SAME -- DAY Groves is on the stand, in civilian clothes- GARRISON Do you recall your conversation with him about the Chevalier incident? GROVES I’ve seen so many versions of it, I wasn’t confused before, but I’m certainly getting there now. GARRISON What was your conclusion? (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 96. GROVES That he was under the influence of the typical American schoolboy attitude that there’s something wicked about telling on a friend. He did what he thought was essential- disclosing Eltenton. INT. SAME -- DAY Pash is testifying. PASH The memo I wrote at the time states 'Dr Oppenheimer sought to provide information to burnish his image as loyal, clearly having heard of our investigation at Berkeley. He is not to be trusted on matters of security.' INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY Pash gazes, unblinking, into my eyes... PASH These other people you mentioned, were they contacted by Eltenton direct? 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 No. OPPENHEIMER PASH Well now, could we know through whom that contact was made? OPPENHEIMER It would involve people who ought not be involved in this. PASH Is this person a member of the project? OPPENHEIMER A member of the faculty, but not on the project. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 97. PASH Eltenton made the approach through a member of the faculty here at Berkeley? OPPENHEIMER As far as I know- there may have been more than one person involved. If I seem uncooperative I think you can understand that it’s because of my insistence in not getting innocent people into trouble. Pash stares at me. I finally keep my mouth shut. PASH You see me as persistent- OPPENHEIMER You are persistent, and that is your job. But my job is protecting the people who work for me. PASH Instead of us going on certain steps which may come to your attention and be a little bit... disturbing to you... I’d rather discuss those with you first. I’m not formulating any plans, I’m just going to have to digest the whole thing. I nod at Pash. Get to my feet. INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY Groves takes in the story. GROVES You’re protecting a friend. But who’s protecting you? OPPENHEIMER You could. GROVES If you gave me the name. OPPENHEIMER If you order me to, I’ll do it. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 98. GROVES You’re making a mistake, Robert. A mistake that may haunt you. You need to volunteer this name. I turn to watch the scenery trundle past. ROBB (V.O.) And did he give you the name? INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY GROVES He did. ROBB But not at that time. 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 No. GROVES ROBB In fact, it was some months later, wasn’t it? Groves nods. INT. SAME -- DAY I study the back of Boris Pash’s head... ROBB And in the months between your interview with Dr Oppenheimer and his eventual naming of Chevalier, did you expend resources trying to find the identity of the intermediary? PASH Considerable resources. Without the name our job was extremely difficult. ROBB When did you receive the name? PASH I was gone by the time Oppenheimer offered it up. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 99. ROBB Gone? PASH They felt my time would be better spent in Europe determining the status of the Nazi bomb project. ROBB Who did?

OPPENHEIMER That’s not how weapons manufacture works, Szilard. SZILARD Oppie, you have to help. OPPENHEIMER Fermi’s in the meeting. And Lawrence- SZILARD (CONT’D) They’re not you. You’re the great salesman of science- you can convince anyone of anything. Even yourself. INT. SECRETARY OF WAR’S OFFICE -- DAY I sit on a couch next to Fermi- Lawrence, Groves and Bush in chairs. Secretary of War STIMSON presides. Military, scientists and officials are scattered through the room. STIMSON The firestorm in Tokyo killed one hundred thousand people. Mostly civilians. I worry about an America where we do these things and no one protests. MARSHALL Pearl Harbor and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific buys a lot of latitude with the American public. STIMSON Enough to unleash the atomic bomb? FERMI In truth, the A-bomb might not cause as much damage as the Tokyo bombings. STIMSON What are we estimating? BUSH In a medium-sized city, twenty or thirty thousand dead. 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 117. OPPENHEIMER Don’t underestimate the psychological impact of an atomic explosion... a pillar of fire ten thousand feet tall, deadly neutron effects for a mile in all directions... from one. Single. Device. Dropped from a barely noticed B-29... the atomic bomb will be a terrible revelation of divine power. Groves carefully monitors my effect on the room... MARSHALL If that’s true it would be definitive. World War II would be over. Our boys would come home. STIMSON This could end the war. OPPENHEIMER This could end all war. If we retain moral advantage. Groves registers the pivot... STIMSON How so? OPPENHEIMER If we use this weapon without informing our allies, they’ll see It as a threat and we’ll be in an arms race. MARSHALL How open can we be with the Soviets? BUSH Secrecy won’t stop the Soviets becoming part of the atomic world. A politician, BYRNES, clears his throat politely- BYRNES We’ve been told they have no uranium. BUSH You’ve been misinformed. A Russian bomb is a matter of time. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 118. LAWRENCE To stay ahead, our programme has to continue at full pace after the war. OPPENHEIMER Secretary Stimson, if I may. Not all the scientists on the project agree. In fact, this might be a moment to consider other opinions- GROVES The Manhattan Project’s been plagued from the start by certain scientists of doubtful discretion and uncertain loyalty. One of them just tried to get a meeting with the President. I say nothing. Groves looks directly at me. GROVES (CONT’D) We need them for now, but as soon as is practical, we should sever any such scientists from the programme. Wouldn’t you agree, doctor? I meet Groves’ gaze. Stay silent... Nod. MARSHALL If a Russian bomb is inevitable, perhaps we should invite their top scientists to Trinity. BYRNES President Truman has no intention of raising expectations that Stalin be included in the atomic project. STIMSON Informing him of our breakthrough, and presenting it as the means to win the war need not make unkeepable promises. But the Potsdam peace conference in July is the last chance for Truman to have that conversation. Can you give us a working bomb by then? GROVES Absolutely. We’ll test-fire before the conference. 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 119. STIMSON And Japan? OPPENHEIMER If the test works you’ll have two bombs for August. STIMSON Military targets? OPPENHEIMER There aren’t any big enough. CONANT Perhaps a vital war plant, with workers housed nearby. FERMI Could we issue a warning? To reduce civilian casualties. AIR FORCE OFFICER They’d send up everything they have against us, and I’d be in that plane. BUSH If we announce it and it fails to go off we’d scupper any chance of Japanese surrender. LAWRENCE Is there no way to demonstrate the bomb to Japan to provoke surrender? GROVES We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms. Twice. Once to show the weapon’s power. A second to show that we can keep going until they surrender. STIMSON We have a list of twelve cities to choose from. Sorry, eleven, I’ve taken Kyoto off the list because of its cultural significance to the Japanese people. Stimson senses the unease in the room... STIMSON (CONT’D) Let me make this simple for you, gentlemen. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 120. STIMSON (CONT’D) The Japanese will not surrender short of a successful invasion of the home islands. Many lives, American and Japanese, will be lost in that invasion. The use of the atomic bomb against Japanese cities will save lives. EXT. BASE OF STEEL TOWER, TRINITY TEST SITE -- DAY Frank shows Groves and me the site plan... FRANK Ground Zero. Observation posts at ten thousand yards north, south and west. OPPENHEIMER Where do we trigger from? FRANK South ten thousand. Base camp is ten miles south, here. And a further observation point on this hill twenty miles away. I point to a crew digging a trench from the base of the tower. OPPENHEIMER What’s that? The trigger lines went in already. FRANK The air force requested a line of lights for their B-29. GROVES What B-29? Our bomb’s on the tower. FRANK They want to use the test to confirm the safe operating distance. Gadget 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 Risky. OPPENHEIMER FRANK Not as risky as dropping one over Japan and hoping we were right about the blast radius. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 121. OPPENHEIMER Don’t let them slow us down- we’re firing on the 15th. FRANK The 15th?! That’s not- GROVES The 15th! The 15th. FRANK (CO NT’D) INT. LECTURE HALL, T-SECTION, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY I show the plan to the division heads. OPPENHEIMER I’ll be at the south observation point with Frank and Kistiakowsky. You’ll all be assigned to base camp, far observation, or west observation. INSERT CUT: I ENTER A TENT AT THE BASE OF THE TOWER- THE SILVER SPHERE OF THE BOMB IS SURROUNDED BY THE TEAM... BETHE Are those safe distances? OPPENHEIMER They’re based on your calculations. RABI Time to stand behind your science, Hans. Literally. INSERT CUT: THE BOMB IS HOISTED UP IN TO THE TOWER... TELLER What about the radiation cloud? OPPENHEIMER Without high winds it should settle within two to three miles. Evacuation measures will be in place, but we need good weather for visibility so it should be fine. We go on the night of the 15th. Frank sees my expression- (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 122. The team exchange looks- OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D) That’s a hard deadline, so if anyone has anything... speak now. BETHE We need a final implosion test. KISTIAKOWSKY Couldn’t hurt. OPPENHEIMER Do it. Is there anything else that might stop us? A THUNDERCLAP takes us into- EXT.

She comes out to grab a sheet that has come loose from the line... notices a JEEP idling at the gate, ARMED GUARDS patiently waiting. I emerge from the house carrying an overnight bag. Kitty, one hand on the washing line, turns to look at me, curious. KITTY It’s happening, isn’t it? I watch the sheets flapping. Glance at the guards... OPPENHEIMER I’ll send a message. If it’s gone our way... 'Take in the sheets.' She nods. I head towards the waiting jeep. KITTY Robert? I turn, looking at Kitty amongst the FLAPPING SHEETS... KITTY (CONT’D) Break a leg. EXT.

BASE CAMP, TRINITY TEST SITE -- EVENING Army tents. A WINDMILL SPINS FURIOUSLY... INT. BASE CAMP, TRINITY TEST SITE -- EVENING Fermi moves through the team, taking bets... FERMI Oppie’s taken a very modest three kilotons... Teller’s in for forty- five... Rabi pulls out some bills- RABI Twenty. FERMI Twenty thousand tons of TNT... and does anyone want the side action on total atmospheric ignition? The scientists groan and laugh. Soldiers look at each other: 'What the hell?' Groves corners the army WEATHERMAN. GROVES Are you saying we’ll have to delay? WEATHERMAN I’m saying it would be prudent. OPPENHEIMER Has this weather reached the site? The weatherman gets on his radio. Kistiakowsky BURSTS in- Oppie- The phone rings - KISTIAKOWSKY (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 124. KISTIAKOWSKY (CONT’D) Bethe’s calling you to tell you the implosion test failed, but- I have the phone to my ear - OPPENHEIMER Hans. Yes, he’s here. Yes. (I hang up) Is he wrong? KISTIAKOWSKY No. Explain. KISTIAKOWSKY I can’t. I just know the implosion lenses will work. OPPENHEIMER If we fire those detonators and they don’t trigger the reaction, two years’ worth of plutonium will be scattered across white sands. KISTIAKOWSKY (holds out his hand) A month of my salary against ten bucks says it lights. I study Kistiakowsky. Take the bet. WEATHERMAN The wind’s picking up at Zero, not the rain. Lightning circling. THUNDER. Rabi calls over- RABI Hey, weatherman, you think it might be time to get your men away from the steel tower with the atomic bomb primed to detonate via electrical charge? The weatherman laughs. Then GRABS the radio - 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 No. So we’re about to fire a dud? OPPENHEIMER KISTIAKOWSKY GROVES (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 125. WEATHERMAN Pull ’em out. OPPENHEIMER (to Groves) Let’s get to south observation. Make our determination there.

SOUTH OBSERVATION POST, TRINITY TEST SITE -- NIGHT Groves, the weatherman and I watch rain LASH the desert... OPPENHEIMER The team hasn’t slept for two nights. We stand down, make the bomb safe, it’s weeks before we get back here. GROVES Then we miss Potsdam. (checks watch) I need to get word to Truman by seven. (to the weatherman) Our window’s closing. What’s it doing? WEATHERMAN Raining. Blowing. Lightning. GROVES For how long, dammit?! WEATHERMAN It’s holding strong. OPPENHEIMER It’ll break before dawn. GROVES How could you know that? OPPENHEIMER I know this desert. The air cools overnight. Just before dawn, the storm breaks. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 126. WEATHERMAN He could be right. But schedule it as late as possible. OPPENHEIMER Five thirty? Groves considers this. Turns to the weatherman. GROVES Sign your forecast. If you’re wrong, I’ll hang you. INT. BUNKER, SOUTH OBSERVATION POST -- NIGHT Groves and me, alone. Rain pelting down outside. GROVES Three years. Four thousand people. Two billion dollars. If it doesn’t go off we’re both finished. OPPENHEIMER I put my money on three kilotons. Any less, they won’t get what it is. GROVES What did Fermi mean by 'atmospheric ignition'? OPPENHEIMER We had a moment where it looked like the chain reaction from an atomic device might never stop. Setting fire to the atmosphere. GROVES Why’s Fermi still taking side bets on it? OPPENHEIMER Call it gallows humour. Groves takes this in. Picks the scab- GROVES Are we saying there’s a chance that when we push that button... we destroy the world? 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 127. OPPENHEIMER Nothing in our research over the last three years supports that conclusion except as the most remote possibility. GROVES How remote? OPPENHEIMER The chances are near zero. GROVES Near zero? OPPENHEIMER (smiling) What do you want from theory alone? GROVES Zero would be nice. I check my watch. OPPENHEIMER Well, in an hour and fifty-eight minutes, we’ll know.

OPPENHEIMER Well, it’s that... now is our chance to secure international cooperation on atomic energy, and I’m concerned- TRUMAN You know when the Soviets are gonna have a bomb?

But I’m not joking. Truman looks to Byrnes for help. BYRNES Dr Oppenheimer, if what you say about the Soviets is true, we have to build up Los Alamos, not shut it down. I WRING my hands, deeply uncomfortable... OPPENHEIMER Mr President, I feel that I have blood on my hands. Truman looks at me differently. Pulls the crisp white handkerchief from his breast pocket and offers it- TRUMAN You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit who built the bomb? They care who dropped it. I did. Hiroshima isn’t about you. Truman gestures to Byrnes, they both RISE. I get to my feet. Awkward. As I leave I hear - TRUMAN (CONT’D) Don’t let that crybaby back in here.

CORPORATE AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT (B&W) Oppenheimer is lecturing... Strauss is in the crowd... OPPENHEIMER America and Russia may be likened to two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life. There are various aspects of this policy which I would like to discuss but can’t. Follies that can occur only when even the men who know the facts can find no one to talk about them, when the facts are too secret for discussion, and thus for thought. Candor is the only remedy. Officials in Washington have to start levelling with the American people, and telling them what the enemy already know about the atomic armaments race.

SENATE AIDE But how could Borden get access to Oppenheimer’s FBI file? Could it have been Nichols? STRAUSS I can’t imagine he’d do that. But whoever did unleashed a firestorm that burned a path from the White House right to my desk at the AEC. You see them in there trying to hang Oppenheimer around my neck. I’ve worked my whole life to get here- the Cabinet of the United States of America- and now, in front of the entire country, they want to put me back in my place... a lowly shoe salesman.

I LOOK AWAY from the screen. I hear the sound of FEET STAMPING as Morrison continues... MORRISON There were many who thought themselves lucky, who crawled out of the ruins of their homes only slightly injured. But they died anyway.

RABI Dr Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding character, loyal to the United States, to his friends and to the institutions of which he is a part.

We all felt that after the Russian explosion we had to do something to regain our position. ROBB So you agreed with those who felt we should launch a programme for the Super at that time? RABI No. There were all kinds of legitimate concerns about the allocation of our resources. GRAY Would you say Dr Oppenheimer was LATER 8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904 unalterably opposed to the H-bomb? RABI No. He thought a fusion programme would come at the expense of our awfully good fission programme. ROBB But that proved not to be the case? RABI In the event, both could be done.

ROBB Mr Garrison, I don’t think I should be subject to cross-examination by you. GRAY Mr Garrison, given that we on the board have all read the letter, isn’t it better to have it in the record? Garrison says nothing. He looks at me, frustrated. GRAY (CONT’D) Let’s proceed. BORDEN 'Dear Mr Hoover, the purpose of this letter is to state my opinion, based upon years of study of the available classified evidence, that more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.' I turn the letter face down, staring at its blank whiteness... BORDEN (CONT’D) 'The following conclusions are justified. One: Between 1929 and 1942, more probably than not, J. Robert Oppenheimer was a sufficiently hardened Communist that he volunteered information to the Soviets. Two: More probably than not, he has since been functioning as an espionage agent.' I watch the STENOGRAPHER calmly type this into the record...

CHAIRMAN (CONT’D) Dr Hill, would you care to make a statement? HILL Thank you. I have been asked to testify about Lewis Strauss, a man who has given years of service in high positions of government and who is known to be earnest, hard- working and intelligent. Strauss glances at Counsel, satisfied. (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 172. HILL (CONT’D) The views I have to express are my own, but I believe that much I have to say will help indicate why most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr Strauss completely out of the government. Strauss narrows his eyes... SENATOR PASTORE (friendly lob) You’re referring to the hostility of certain scientists directed at Mr Strauss because of his commitment to security, as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair? HILL No. Hill takes a sip of water before continuing... HILL (CONT’D) Because of the personal vindictiveness he demonstrated against Dr Oppenheimer, and against all those who have disagreed with his official positions. Counsel turns to Strauss, who is FIXATED on Hill. The Senate Aide REACTS, surprised. MURMURS echo through the chamber... HILL (CONT’D) In my ten years observation of Mr Strauss I have seen his incapacity to change a position, the subordination of his integrity to the attainment of political goals and an obsessive quest for popular and professional approval...

ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR) Vannevar Bush is sworn in. BUSH It appears to most scientists around the country that Oppenheimer is now being pilloried and put through an ordeal because he expressed his honest opinions. The written charges against him are in a poorly written indictment which the board should have rejected from the outset. EVANS Dr Bush, I thought I was performing a service to my country in hearing this case. BUSH No board in this country should sit in judgement of a man because he expressed strong opinions. If you want to try that case, you can try me- I have expressed strong opinions, often unpopular, many times. I’m doing so right now. When a man is pilloried for doing that, this country is in a severe state... excuse me, gentlemen, if I become stirred, but I am. INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) Strauss fumes as Hill reads his statement. HILL From the standpoint of public welfare, the most injurious exercise of personal vindictiveness in which Lewis Straus has engaged was in the personnel security prosecution of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had not hesitated to disagree with Mr Strauss on certain questions of fundamental policy. (MORE) CUT TO: (CONTINUED) Gadget 2023-04-21 FINAL Shooting Script 174. HILL (CONT’D) Oppenheimer made mincemeat out of Strauss’ position on the shipments of isotopes to Norway, and Strauss never forgave him this public humiliation. Another controversy between them centreed around their differences in judgement on how the H-bomb would contribute to national security. Oppenheimer had considerable influence and prestige, and Strauss was able to find a few ambitious men who also disagreed with Oppenheimer’s position, and envied him his prestige in government circles. Teller, in the audience, stares at Hill... HILL (CONT’D) Strauss turned to the personnel security system in order to destroy Oppenheimer’s effectiveness- SENATOR PASTORE But, Dr Hill, we’ve already heard that Mr Strauss did not bring the charges, or participate in the hearings against Dr Oppenheimer. HILL I realize that Mr Strauss didn’t sign the letter of charges, but I think when all of the evidence is viewed, it becomes highly plausible that the Oppenheimer matter was initiated and carried through largely through the animus of Lewis Strauss.

ROBB Thank you, General. GROVES But I’m not sure I could’ve cleared any of those guys. ROBB That’s all. GARRISON General, Dr Oppenheimer had no responsibility for the selection or clearance of Klaus Fuchs, did he? GROVES No, not at all. GARRISON You wouldn’t want to leave with this board even the remotest suggestion that you’re here questioning Dr Oppenheimer’s basic loyalty to the United States in the operation of Los Alamos? GROVES By no means. I hope I didn’t lead anybody to think otherwise for an instant. GARRISON Would you say that the revocation of Dr Oppenheimer’s position would be in the public interest? GROVES The revocation under such extreme publicity I think would be most unfortunate, not because of the effect on Dr Oppenheimer- that I leave to one side- but because of the disastrous effect upon the attitude of the scientists of this country toward doing government research.

The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer was not interrogated by impartial and disinterested counsel for the Gray Board... Robb gets up to cross-examine... INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W) Strauss watches Hill continue to answer questions... HILL ...he was interrogated by a prosecutor who used all the tricks of a rather ingenious legal background to try to trick Oppenheimer into erroneous statements, and he did succeed in a few instances. SENATOR SCOTT You are charging now that the Gray Board permitted a prosecution of Dr Oppenheimer. Do you think, then, that the members of the Gray Board were unfair? Hill takes a beat to consider this. HILL I can only say if I’d been on the Gray Board, I would’ve protested against the tactics of the man who served in fact as a prosecuting counsel- a man appointed not by the board but by Lewis Strauss.
