<text id="1000">The Tarnished will soon return.</text>
<text id="1001">Guided by Grace once lost.</text>
<text id="1002">The Golden Order is broken to its core.</text>
<text id="1003">They will fight. And they will die. In an unending curse.</text>
<text id="1004">For how else is a champion, or a lord, to be born?</text>
<text id="1005">Brandish the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="1006">...for all of us.</text>
<text id="1100">The fallen leaves have spoken.</text>
<text id="1101">Of the return of the Tarnished. To the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="10000000">Elden Ring, O, Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="10000100">Shaper of life, arbiter of fate.</text>
<text id="10000200">Lord of the very stars above.</text>
<text id="10000300">Tarnished warrior, spurned by the grace of gold.</text>
<text id="10000400">Seek that which hath been lost to thee.</text>
<text id="10000500">Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="10000600">Seek the Elden Ring!</text>
<text id="11000000">Brave Tarnished. Mighty warriors, who fought at my side.</text>
<text id="11000100">Await the summons. It will call to thee one day.</text>
<text id="11000200">Heed the fading grace. Listen to the Fingers.</text>
<text id="11000300">Gold commandeth the very stars,</text>
<text id="11000400">giving life its fullest brilliance.</text>
<text id="11000500">Elden Ring, O, Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="11000600">Be ready, once it is shattered.</text>
<text id="11000700">Seek the Elden Ring, O Tarnished.</text>
<text id="11000800">Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="11000900">Become Lord. Enact thy will!</text>
<text id="11001000">Seek the Elden Ring!</text>
<text id="12000000">Long ago, ye Tarnished lost something most dear.</text>
<text id="12000100">The Elden Ring. O Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="12000200">Its gold commanded the very stars,</text>
<text id="12000300">giving life its fullest brilliance.</text>
<text id="12000400">Though shattered, it yet guides thy kin.</text>
<text id="12000410">Though fractured, it yet guides thy kin.</text>
<text id="12000500">Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="12000600">Hoarah Roux, the Gold Mask.</text>
<text id="12000700">Lady Yuliya, the Deathbed Companion.</text>
<text id="12000800">The hideous Dung Eater.</text>
<text id="12000900">And Sir Gideon Orphnier, the All-knowing.</text>
<text id="12001000">Each coveteth the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="12001100">But their ambitions are yet unmet.</text>
<text id="12001200">Surely thou hast thine own design?</text>
<text id="12001300">Then implore the Two Fingers, for guidance.</text>
<text id="12001400">Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="12001500">To face the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="12001510">To stand before the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="12001600">Face the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="12001610">And reclaim what was thine.</text>
<text id="13000000">Elden Ring, O Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="13000100">Its gold commanded the very stars,</text>
<text id="13000200">giving life its fullest brilliance.</text>
<text id="13000300">Shattered, by someone, or something.</text>
<text id="13000310">Fractured, by someone, or something.</text>
<text id="13000400">Godrick, the feeble.</text>
<text id="13000500">Malenia, decayed from birth.</text>
<text id="13000600">General Radahn, slayer of giants.</text>
<text id="13000700">Rykard, the tyrannical serpent.</text>
<text id="13000800">And Morgott, Prince of the Omen.</text>
<text id="13000900">Each, inheriting their own shard, played a part in the Shattering,</text>
<text id="13001000">a war with no end, and no victor.</text>
<text id="13001100">And so the Two Fingers call upon ye, the Tarnished.</text>
<text id="13001200">To cross the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="13001300">To seek the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="13001400">Seek the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="14000000">The fallen leaves tell a story.</text>
<text id="14000100">The great Elden Ring was shattered.</text>
<text id="14000200">In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="14000300">Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found,</text>
<text id="14000400">and in the Night of the Black Knives, Godwyn the Golden was first to perish.</text>
<text id="14000500">Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="14000600">The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.</text>
<text id="14000800">A war from which no lord arose.</text>
<text id="14000900">A war leading to abandonment by the Greater Will.</text>
<text id="15000000">Arise now, ye Tarnished.</text>
<text id="15000100">Ye dead, who yet live.</text>
<text id="15000200">The call of long-lost grace speaks to us all.</text>
<text id="15000300">Hoarah Loux, chieftain of the badlands.</text>
<text id="15000400">The ever-brilliant Goldmask.</text>
<text id="15000500">Fia, the Deathbed Companion.</text>
<text id="15000600">The loathsome Dung Eater.</text>
<text id="15000700">And Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.</text>
<text id="16000000">It happened an age ago.</text>
<text id="16000100">But when I recall, I see it true.</text>
<text id="16000200">On a night of wint'ry fog.</text>
<text id="16000300">The Rune of Death was stolen,</text>
<text id="16000400">And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.</text>
<text id="16000500">Queen Marika was driven to the brink.</text>
<text id="16000600">The Elden Ring was broken,</text>
<text id="16000700">triggering the Shattering, an internecine war between demigods.</text>
<text id="16000800">The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn.</text>
<text id="16000900">And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.</text>
<text id="16001000">These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.</text>
<text id="16001100">But there would be no victor.</text>
<text id="16001200">And so, we inhabit a fractured world.</text>
<text id="16001300">Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="16001400">Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?</text>
<text id="16500000">It happened an age ago.</text>
<text id="16500100">But when I recall, I see it true.</text>
<text id="16500200">On a night of wint'ry fog.</text>
<text id="16500300">Bearers of Black Knives stole into the dark.</text>
<text id="16500400">And the demigods began to fall, starting with Godwyn the Golden.</text>
<text id="16500500">Queen Marika was driven to the brink.</text>
<text id="16500600">The Shattering ensued; a war that wrought only darkness.</text>
<text id="16500700">The Elden Ring was broken, but by whom? And why?</text>
<text id="16500800">What could the Demigods ever hope to win by warring?</text>
<text id="16500900">The conqueror of the stars, General Radahn.</text>
<text id="16501000">And the Blade of Miquella, Malenia the Severed.</text>
<text id="16501100">These two were the mightiest to remain, and locked horns in combat.</text>
<text id="16501200">But why was there no victor?</text>
<text id="16501300">And so, we inhabit a fractured world.</text>
<text id="16501400">Awaiting the arrival of the Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="16501500">Unless of course, thou shouldst take the crown?</text>
<text id="20010000">You think this is the one, Torrent?</text>
<text id="20010010">Is that him, Torrent?</text>
<text id="20010011">Is that her, Torrent?</text>
<text id="20010100">Don't worry, it's not too late.</text>
<text id="20010200">He is sure to seek the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="20010201">She is sure to seek the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="20010300">...For that is their curse.</text>
<text id="20015000">Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on his side.</text>
<text id="20015001">Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on her side.</text>
<text id="20015100">We found him here, after all.</text>
<text id="20015101">We found her here, after all.</text>
<text id="20015200">One of his kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="20015201">One of her kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="20015300">...Even if it does violate the Golden Order...</text>
<text id="20030000">Foul Tarnished,</text>
<text id="20030100">In search of the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="20030200">Emboldened by the flame of ambition.</text>
<text id="20030300">Hrah!</text>
<text id="20030400">Someone must extinguish thy flame.</text>
<text id="20030500">Let it be Margit the Fell!</text>
<text id="20040000">Mighty dragon, thou'rt a trueborn heir.</text>
<text id="20040100">Lend me thy strength, o kindred.</text>
<text id="20040200">Deliver me unto greater heights.</text>
<text id="20040300">...Well.</text>
<text id="20040400">A lowly Tarnished,</text>
<text id="20040410">playing as a lord.</text>
<text id="20040500">I command thee, kneel!</text>

<text id="20070100">Long and hard didst thou fight.</text>
<text id="20070200">Tarnished Warrior.</text>
<text id="20070210">Spurned by the grace of gold.</text>

<text id="20140000">Dearest Miquella.</text>
<text id="20140100">You must abide alone a while.</text>
<text id="20140200">No one else will take you.</text>
<text id="20140300">Never again, I swear!</text>
<text id="20145200">Welcome, honoured guest.</text>
<text id="20145300">To the birthplace of our dynasty!</text>
<text id="20210000">Foul Tarnished.</text>
<text id="20210100">Graceless Tarnished.</text>
<text id="20210200">What is thy business with these thrones?</text>
<text id="20210300">Ahh...</text>
<text id="20210400">Godrick the Golden.</text>
<text id="20210500">The twin prodigies, Miquella and Malenia.</text>
<text id="20210600">General Radahn.</text>

<text id="20211000">Thy kind are all of a piece.</text>
<text id="20211100">Pillagers, come seeking vengeance upon the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="20211110">Pillagers. Emboldened by the flame of ambition.</text>
<text id="20211200">Ngh!</text>
<text id="20211300">Have it writ upon thy meagre grave:</text>
<text id="20211400">Felled by King Morgott! Last of all kings.</text>

<text id="20255800">And the majesty of the night she conjureth.</text>
<text id="20260000">I dreamt for so long.</text>
<text id="20260100">My flesh was dull gold...and my blood, rotted.</text>
<text id="20260200">Corpse after corpse, left in my wake...</text>
<text id="20260300">As I awaited...his return.</text>
<text id="20260400">...Heed my words.</text>
<text id="20260500">I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella.</text>

<text id="20265010">Dearest companion...</text>
<text id="20265100">Did you not heed my warning?</text>
<text id="20265200">Your greed knows no end.</text>
<text id="20265300">You would steal the last drop of warmth from his empty frame?</text>
<text id="20265310">After all you've taken, you still want more?</text>
<text id="20265400">Then you will have to kill me.</text>
<text id="20265500">I am Malenia, Sword of Miquella.</text>
<text id="20265600">And I have never known defeat.</text>
<text id="20270000">My dear twin, accept this gift.</text>
<text id="20270100">A gift of abundance, my last drop of dew.</text>

<text id="20270300">whether graceful, or malign.</text>
<text id="20275000">Wait.</text>
<text id="20275100">The scarlet bloom flowers once more.</text>
<text id="20275200">You will witness true horror.</text>
<text id="20275300">Now, rot!</text>
<text id="20290000">Farewell, then.</text>
<text id="20290100">May your visit be fruitful.</text>
<text id="20300000">Hmm...</text>
<text id="20300100">Very well.</text>
<text id="20300200">You...</text>
<text id="20300300">A fitting sacrifice you shall be, for the Serpent King.</text>
<text id="20300310">Join the Serpent King, as family...</text>
<text id="20300400">And devour the gods with me!</text>
<text id="20300410">Together, we will devour the very gods!</text>

<text id="20391010">Before we begin, allow me to paint you the full picture.</text>
<text id="20391100">Eaten from the inside, by Malenia's scarlet rot, his wits are long gone.</text>
<text id="20391200">Now he gathers the corpses of former friends and foes alike, gorging on them, like a dog.</text>
<text id="20391300">Howling at the sky.</text>
<text id="20430000">O Erdtree, you shall burn.</text>
<text id="20430100">Burn, for the sake of the new Lord.</text>
<text id="20430200">Thank you. For guiding me here.</text>
<text id="20430300">The one who walks alongside flame,</text>
<text id="20430400">Shall one day meet the road of Destined Death.</text>
<text id="20430500">Good-bye.</text>
<text id="20430600">I hope you will become Lord. Lord of each and all.</text>

<text id="20450400"><great howl></text>
<text id="20480000">Now wilt ye serve, each and all.</text>
<text id="20480010">The Elden Lord is crowned.</text>
<text id="20480100">The new Elden Lord, steward of a fracturing world.</text>
<text id="20480110">And so beginneth the age of fracture...</text>
<text id="20481000">The fallen leaves tell a story.</text>
<text id="20481100">Of how a Tarnished, of no renown, became Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="20482000">The fallen leaves tell a story.</text>
<text id="20482100">Of how a Tarnished became Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="20482200">In our home, across the fog, the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="20483000">Our seed will look back upon us, and recall.</text>
<text id="20483100">An Age of Fracture.</text>

<text id="20484100">The Age of Order.</text>
<text id="20484150">The Age Absolute.</text>

<text id="20486100">The reviled curse that defined our age.</text>
<text id="20486200">The Blessing of Despair.</text>
<text id="20490000">...The battle is over, I see.</text>
<text id="20490100">I do solemnly swear.</text>
<text id="20490200">To every living being, and every living soul.</text>
<text id="20490300">Now cometh the age of the stars.</text>
<text id="20490400">A thousand year voyage under the wisdom of the Moon.</text>
<text id="20490500">Here beginneth the chill night that encompasses all, reaching the great beyond.</text>
<text id="20490600">Into fear, doubt, and loneliness...</text>

<text id="20495300">Now comes the age of the mind.</text>
<text id="20495400">A thousand year voyage, governed by the wisdom of the Moon.</text>

<text id="20540200">But remember well,</text>
<text id="20540300">Thou'rt mine.</text>
<text id="20540400">So shall I give of myself. This is for thee.</text>
<text id="20540500">Mine abundance, my drop of dew.</text>
<text id="20540600">Quench thy thirst, throughout thy frame.</text>
<text id="20540700">Blossom and burgeon, time and again.</text>
<text id="20540800">Grow larger, stronger.</text>
<text id="20540900">Until the day cometh.</text>
<text id="20541000">When thou canst share in my dream.</text>
<text id="20541100">Elden Ring, O Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="20541200">Beget Order most elegant, from my tender reverie.</text>
<text id="20560000">If thou covetest the throne,</text>
<text id="20560100">Impress my vision upon thine heart.</text>
<text id="20560200">In the new world of thy making,</text>
<text id="20560300">all things will flourish,</text>
<text id="20560400">whether graceful, or malign.</text>
<text id="20580000">Greetings.</text>
<text id="20580100">Traveller from beyond the Fog.</text>
<text id="20580200">I am Melina.</text>
<text id="20580300">I offer you an accord.</text>
<text id="20640000">And one other. Whom grace would again bless.</text>
<text id="20640100">A Tarnished of no renown.</text>
<text id="20640200">Cross the fog, to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="20640300">to stand before the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="20640400">And become the Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="20700000">The Rune of Death is unbound.</text>
<text id="20700100">Black flames have devoured the Erdtree,</text>
<text id="20700110">and the Lands Between are shrouded by Death's dark fate.</text>
<text id="20700200">But the flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns.</text>
<text id="20700300">Farewell it is, then.</text>
<text id="20700400">You'll be Elden Lord, yet.</text>
<text id="20730000">Well, if you really are that gullible...</text>
<text id="20730010">Ngh!</text>
<text id="20730100">then stay away from the Volcano Manor!</text>
<text id="20730200">Bye now!</text>
<text id="20730300">Take care!</text>
<text id="20750100">Lord host, I could not be more content.</text>
<text id="20750200">I found knowledge, and then found someone. That someone was you.</text>
<text id="20750300">And now, inside you, here I am...</text>
<text id="20770000">Well well well?</text>
<text id="20770100">I should have known, you scheming little thief.</text>
<text id="20770200">The gods demand vengeance. Vengeance!</text>
<text id="20780000">He he he he he...</text>
<text id="20780100">My sincerest gratitude. I thought I'd never wrench that thing open.</text>
<text id="20780200">You're the finest customer a man ever had!</text>
<text id="20830000"> </text>
<text id="20830100">This is how you die, you disgusting Tarnished.</text>
<text id="20830200">Don't worry, I've got big plans for you. After you snuff it...</text>
<text id="20840000"> </text>
<text id="20840100"> </text>
<text id="20840200"> </text>
<text id="20850000"><screaming></text>
<text id="20850100"> </text>
<text id="20850200"> </text>
<text id="20860000"><screaming></text>
<text id="20860100"> </text>
<text id="20860200">(explained above)</text>
<text id="20860300">Unleash it upon them! A cursed blessing to all!</text>
<text id="20860400">(scream of pain)</text>
<text id="100010000">Have you heard of the Finger Maidens?</text>
<text id="100010010">They serve the Two Fingers, offering guidance, and aid, to the Tarnished.</text>
<text id="100010020">But you, I am afraid, are maidenless.</text>
<text id="100010030">I can play the role of maiden.</text>
<text id="100010040">Turning runes into strength.</text>
<text id="100010050">To aid you in your search for the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="100010060">You need only take me with you.</text>
<text id="100010070">To the foot of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="100011000">Then it's settled.</text>
<text id="100011010">Summon me by grace to turn runes into strength.</text>
<text id="100011020">Ahh, another matter.</text>
<text id="100011030">I bequeath to you this ring.</text>
<text id="100011040">Use it to traverse great distances.</text>
<text id="100011050">It will summon a spectral steed named Torrent.</text>
<text id="100011060">Torrent has chosen you.</text>
<text id="100011070">Treat him with respect.</text>
<text id="100012000">I understand. I'm asking you to put faith in but a stranger.</text>
<text id="100012010">Yet I'm certain that we can reach an understanding.</text>
<text id="100012020">Summon me by grace if you should reconsider.</text>
<text id="100013000">Have you reconsidered my offer?</text>
<text id="100020000">Shall I turn your runes to strength?</text>
<text id="100020010">Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.</text>
<text id="100021000"> </text>
<text id="100022000">Phew. It is done.</text>
<text id="100030000">This tiny golden aura is the grace of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="100030010">This light once shone in the eyes of your Tarnished brethren.</text>
<text id="100030020">But now it is all that guides you. Or so I hear.</text>
<text id="100030030">You can see them, can't you?</text>
<text id="100030040">The rays of grace, that guide you through your burden.</text>
<text id="100031000">Me?</text>
<text id="100031010">I'm searching.</text>
<text id="100031020">For my purpose, given to me by my mother inside the Erdtree, long ago.</text>
<text id="100031030">For the reason that I yet live, burned and bodiless.</text>
<text id="100031040">There is something for which I must apologise.</text>
<text id="100031050">I've acted the Finger Maiden, yet can offer no guidance.</text>
<text id="100031060">I am no maiden. My purpose…was long ago lost.</text>
<text id="100032000">Upon the cliff, in Castle Stormveil, is a shardbearer.</text>
<text id="100032010">A demigod who inherited a fragment of the shattered Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="100032020">If the rays of grace signal the castle,</text>
<text id="100032030">then the Elden Ring beckons you.</text>
<text id="100032040">As an ally by pact,</text>
<text id="100032050">...I pray that you are fit...</text>
<text id="100032060">To face the challenge presented by the Ring.</text>
<text id="100040000">Spoken echoes linger here.</text>
<text id="100040010">Words of Queen Marika, who vanished long ago.</text>
<text id="100040020">If you wish, I will share them with you.</text>
<text id="100041000">Very well. In Marika's own words.</text>
<text id="100041010">My Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.</text>
<text id="100041020">With thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="100041030">Ye will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.</text>
<text id="100041040">Well? Perhaps that might serve you in lieu of a maiden's guidance.</text>
<text id="100042000">Of course. Perhaps there is no need.</text>
<text id="100042010">Tell me if you should change your mind.</text>
<text id="100043000">Spoken echoes of Queen Marika linger here, as well.</text>
<text id="100043010">Shall I share them with you?</text>
<text id="100044000">In Marika's own words.</text>
<text id="100044010">Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.</text>
<text id="100044020">Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="100044030">Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey.</text>
<text id="100045000">In Marika's own words.</text>
<text id="100045010">The Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.</text>
<text id="100045020">Become one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.</text>
<text id="100045030">To wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.</text>
<text id="100101000">In Marika's own words.</text>
<text id="100101010">Hear me, Demigods. My children beloved.</text>
<text id="100101020">Make of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord. Be it a God.</text>
<text id="100101030">But should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.</text>
<text id="100101040">Amounting only to sacrifices...</text>
<text id="100102000">In Marika's own words.</text>
<text id="100102010">O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="100102020">Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.</text>
<text id="100102030">Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.</text>
<text id="100103000">In Marika's own words.</text>
<text id="100103010">I declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="100103020">Through understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.</text>
<text id="100103030">Those blissful early days of blind belief are long past.</text>
<text id="100103040">My comrades; why must ye falter?</text>
<text id="100104000">In Marika's own words.</text>
<text id="100104010">Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.</text>
<text id="100104020">Guidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.</text>
<text id="100104030">Put the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.</text>
<text id="100104040">Let a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.</text>
<text id="100104050">Brandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!</text>
<text id="100105000">Forgive me. I've been...testing you.</text>
<text id="100105010">To see whether or not grace truly does guide you.</text>
<text id="100105020">And...whether you are fit to face the challenge that entails.</text>
<text id="100105030">It seems my worries were unfounded.</text>
<text id="100105040">Torrent had your measure from the very start.</text>
<text id="100105050">Whereas I merely pretended.</text>
<text id="100105060">There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.</text>
<text id="100105070">I can take you to the Roundtable Hold...</text>
<text id="100105080">Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...</text>
<text id="100106000">Very well.</text>
<text id="100106010">Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.</text>
<text id="100107000">Forgive me. I've been...testing you.</text>
<text id="100107010">To determine if the Elden Ring would truly have you.</text>
<text id="100107020">If you had the mettle to endure this long and arduous path.</text>
<text id="100107030">It seems my worries were unfounded.</text>
<text id="100107040">Torrent had your measure from the very start.</text>
<text id="100107050">Whereas I merely pretended.</text>
<text id="100107060">There is but one other thing I can do to offer you guidance.</text>
<text id="100107070">I can take you to the Roundtable Hold...</text>
<text id="100107080">Gathering place of Tarnished champions, guided by Grace...</text>
<text id="100110000">Your seamster, Boc...</text>
<text id="100110010">He is always eager to see your return.</text>
<text id="100110020">Please, will you talk to him, when you can?</text>
<text id="100110030">I'm sure he would be much contented.</text>
<text id="100111000">Your seamster, Boc...</text>
<text id="100111010">I see him crying, from time to time.</text>
<text id="100111020">I think he misses his mother.</text>
<text id="100111030">He wants someone to tell him he's beautiful.</text>
<text id="100111040">Does being born of a mother...</text>
<text id="100111050">Mean one behaves in such a manner?</text>
<text id="100120000">...</text>
<text id="100120010">Is there...another person inside of you?</text>
<text id="100120020">Did you...want that to happen?</text>
<text id="100120030">I sense no malice. Do as you think best.</text>
<text id="100120040">Hello, other you.</text>
<text id="100120050">I am Melina, and I have an accord with this person.</text>
<text id="100120060">We might be together for some time.</text>
<text id="100120070">Pleased to meet you.</text>
<text id="100121000">...</text>
<text id="100121010">Is there...another person inside of you?</text>
<text id="100121020">Did you...want that to happen?</text>
<text id="100121030">I sense no malice. Do as you think best.</text>
<text id="100121040">Hello, other you.</text>
<text id="100121050">I am Melina, and I am travelling with this person.</text>
<text id="100121060">We might be together for some time.</text>
<text id="100121070">Pleased to meet you.</text>
<text id="100130000">The Erdtree...is close.</text>
<text id="100130010">Only a little further till the foot of the Erdtree, and the accord is fulfilled.</text>
<text id="100130020">It takes me back.</text>
<text id="100130030">I was born at the foot of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="100130040">Where mother gave me my purpose.</text>
<text id="100130050">Though now, everything is lost to me.</text>
<text id="100130060">I...have to ascertain for myself.</text>
<text id="100130070">The reason for which I live, burned and bodiless.</text>
<text id="100131000">My utmost thanks.</text>
<text id="100131010">For bringing me to the base of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="100131020">Here, I can govern my own movement.</text>
<text id="100131030">And thus, the accord is fulfilled.</text>
<text id="100131040">I shall depart to ascertain the purpose I was given.</text>
<text id="100131050">Farewell.</text>
<text id="100131060">I shall leave Torrent, and the power to turn runes into strength, here with you.</text>
<text id="100131070">I wish you luck, in realising your ambition.</text>
<text id="100131080">You have fought long and hard.</text>
<text id="100131090">I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne.</text>
<text id="100140000">Hello again, old friend.</text>
<text id="100140010">It's me, Melina. Your travelling companion.</text>
<text id="100140020">Allow me a moment to converse with you.</text>
<text id="100140030">You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no?</text>
<text id="100140040">Prevented by the mantle of barbs.</text>
<text id="100140050">The thorns are impenetrable.</text>
<text id="100140060">A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without.</text>
<text id="100140070">The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...</text>
<text id="100140080">and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns.</text>
<text id="100140090">My purpose serves to aid in that very act.</text>
<text id="100140100">So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me.</text>
<text id="100140110">To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.</text>
<text id="100140120">Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.</text>
<text id="100140130">And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="100141000">I wish to journey with you once more.</text>
<text id="100141010">To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.</text>
<text id="100141020">Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.</text>
<text id="100141030">And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="100150000">Think not, of the kindling.</text>
<text id="100150010">I shall see to that.</text>
<text id="100150020">All I ask of you is to make the journey.</text>
<text id="100150030">To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.</text>
<text id="100150040">I know...</text>
<text id="100150050">I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.</text>
<text id="100150060">But it must be done to reach the path beyond.</text>
<text id="100150070">And that is the path I wish to travel.</text>
<text id="100150080">What is your mind?</text>
<text id="100160000">There is something I'd like to say.</text>
<text id="100160010">My purpose was given to me by my mother.</text>
<text id="100160020">But now, I act of my own volition.</text>
<text id="100160030">I have set my heart upon the world that I would have.</text>
<text id="100160040">Regardless of my mother's designs.</text>
<text id="100160050">I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that.</text>
<text id="100160060">Not even you.</text>
<text id="100170000">We're almost there.</text>
<text id="100170010">The flame of ruin lies just ahead.</text>
<text id="100170020">I'm glad it was you I travelled with.</text>
<text id="100170030">I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too.</text>
<text id="100170040">Thank you, Torrent.</text>
<text id="100170050">Please continue to lend your aid. Till the end.</text>
<text id="100171000">I have long observed the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="100171010">This world is in dire need of repair...</text>
<text id="100171020">and Death...indiscriminate...</text>
<text id="100171030">Are you prepared...</text>
<text id="100171040">To commit a cardinal sin?</text>
<text id="100172000">Very well.</text>
<text id="100172010">Let my hand rest upon you, for but a moment.</text>
<text id="100173000">Very well.</text>
<text id="100173010">Tell me, when you are fully prepared.</text>
<text id="100174000">Are you ready to commit a cardinal sin?</text>
<text id="100180000">If you intend to claim the frenzied flame,</text>
<text id="100180010">I ask that you cease.</text>
<text id="100180020">It is not to be meddled with.</text>
<text id="100180030">It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.</text>
<text id="100180040">However ruined this world has become, however mired in torment and despair...</text>
<text id="100180050">Life endures. Births continue.</text>
<text id="100180060">There is beauty in that, is there not?</text>
<text id="100180070">If you would become Lord, do not deny this notion.</text>
<text id="100180080">Please, leave the frenzied flame alone.</text>
<text id="100181000">I shall see to the kindling.</text>
<text id="100181010">It is a purpose which I choose to fulfil.</text>
<text id="100181020">So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.</text>
<text id="100182000">The frenzied flame is not to be meddled with.</text>
<text id="100182010">It is chaos, devouring life and thought unending.</text>
<text id="100182020">So, please... Leave the frenzied flame alone.</text>
<text id="100185000">I ask you, one more time.</text>
<text id="100185010">Please, seek not the frenzied flame.</text>
<text id="100185020">As one who strives to become a Lord,</text>
<text id="100185030">deny not the lives, the new births of this world.</text>
<text id="100185040">Those who would are not fit to be called Lord.</text>
<text id="100185050">When the land they preside over is lifeless.</text>
<text id="100186000">Please, put a stop to this madness.</text>
<text id="100186010">The Lord of Frenzied Flame is no lord at all.</text>
<text id="100186020">When the land they preside over is lifeless.</text>
<text id="100190000">You...have inherited the frenzied flame.</text>
<text id="100190010">A pity. You are no longer fit.</text>
<text id="100190020">Our accord ends here.</text>
<text id="100190030">But remember...</text>
<text id="100190040">Should you rise, as the Lord of Chaos,</text>
<text id="100190050">I will kill you, as sure as night follows day.</text>
<text id="100190060">Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes.</text>
<text id="100190070">Goodbye, my companion.</text>
<text id="100190080">Goodbye, Torrent...</text>
<text id="100191000">You...have inherited the frenzied flame.</text>
<text id="100191010">A pity. You are no longer fit.</text>
<text id="100191020">Our journey together ends here.</text>
<text id="100191030">And remember...</text>
<text id="100191040">Should you rise as the Lord of Chaos,</text>
<text id="100191050">I will kill you, as sure as night follows day.</text>
<text id="100191060">Such is my duty, for allowing you the strength of runes.</text>

<text id="101001000">You, please, I can read them.</text>
<text id="101001010">Your fingers, please, your fingers...</text>
<text id="101002000">Oh, bless you.</text>
<text id="101002010">Oh..ohh!</text>
<text id="101002020">Within the fog, a gaping hole. Beyond the fog, one cursed by blood.</text>
<text id="101002030">Below the surface, traces of those who lurk in the shadows.</text>
<text id="101002040">In the east, the east. Should you desire…</text>
<text id="101003000">Oh, bless you.</text>
<text id="101003010">Oh..ohh!</text>
<text id="101003020">...</text>
<text id="101003030">Heavens, how can this be!</text>
<text id="101003040">A dreadful sign! Truly dreadful!</text>
<text id="101003050">You will face wrath, then madness, and finally, chaos.</text>
<text id="101003060">Turn back.</text>
<text id="101003070">This is a path you must forsake.</text>
<text id="101003080">Dread awaits you in the south. Blackest dread!</text>
<text id="101010000">Dragon slayer...</text>
<text id="101010010">Ohhh, dragon slayer...</text>
<text id="101010020">You unfeeling barbarian.</text>
<text id="101010030">Planning to feast? On dragon?</text>
<text id="101010040">At an abandoned church on that wee isle.</text>
<text id="101010050">You would devour the heart of an ancient?</text>
<text id="101010060">You wretched, undeserving brute!</text>
<text id="101050000">Oh, bless you.</text>
<text id="101050010">Oh..ohh!</text>
<text id="101050020">Head to the foundation of gold, Tarnished...</text>
<text id="101050030">Traverse Raya Lucaria; "Glintstone Eventide"…</text>
<text id="101050040">…and reunite the half crescents, at the Grand Lift.</text>
<text id="101050050">Oh, but the bridge is collapsed, and cannot be crossed.</text>
<text id="101050060">Only, why should that matter!</text>
<text id="101050070">Stormveil Castle still stands tall!</text>
<text id="101060000">Oh, bless you.</text>
<text id="101060010">Oh..ohh!</text>
<text id="101060020">...</text>
<text id="101060030">Miquella's favour can be yours…</text>
<text id="101060040">Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter... The all-hearing slaughtered, but alas, it was for naught.</text>
<text id="101060050">But all you need do, is snatch it from the big pot.</text>
<text id="101060060">...</text>
<text id="101060070">Pity the poor, poor fool!</text>
<text id="101070000">Oh, bless you.</text>
<text id="101070010">Oh..ohh!</text>
<text id="101070020">...</text>
<text id="101070030">…Are you one for festivals? Or flowers?</text>
<text id="101070040">To the South, a grand festival to make the stars turn.</text>
<text id="101070050">To the East, the hardened bud of a flower to be.</text>
<text id="101070060">But dare you enter?</text>
<text id="101070070">Into the heart of the scarlet rot?</text>
<text id="101070080">Ah...ahhh...</text>
<text id="101080000">What a pity it is, to be without the right.</text>
<text id="101080010">All you can do is stand, at a loss.</text>
<text id="101080020">Without even the half crescents that wish to be whole.</text>
<text id="101080030">Before the unmoving, unfeeling Grand Lift ahead.</text>
<text id="101080040">...</text>
<text id="101080050">Or, are you planning to throw yourself to the waters?</text>
<text id="101080060">To find the coward's passage, through the dim cavern?</text>
<text id="101080070">What a pity it is, to be without the right.</text>
<text id="101081000">Oh, bless you...</text>
<text id="101081010">Bless you...</text>
<text id="101081020">...</text>
<text id="101081030">You. The one who holds both half crescents.</text>
<text id="101081040">Take the path to the Grand Lift ahead.</text>
<text id="101081050">For you...are the one who will be Lord.</text>
<text id="101081060">...</text>
<text id="101081070">Bear witness, one and all! The Lord is returned!</text>
<text id="101081080">The Elden Lord is come again!</text>
<text id="101090000">Oh, bless you...</text>
<text id="101090010">Oh..ohh!</text>
<text id="101090020">...</text>
<text id="101090030">To the east...ruins of gold. To the west...the serpent's sacrilege.</text>
<text id="101090040">Wherever the path leads, so shall you follow.</text>
<text id="101090050">Wherever the path leads, only more sorrow.</text>
<text id="101090060">Tis a curse! A curse! The curse of Queen Marika!</text>
<text id="101090070">Ah...ahh... Ha...ha...</text>
<text id="101100000">The Fingers I served once prophesied...</text>
<text id="101100010">A Tarnished would one day become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="101100020">...</text>
<text id="101100030">Surely you see it, too?</text>
<text id="101100040">The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light.</text>
<text id="101100050">O Tarnished, hasten to the foot of the tree.</text>
<text id="101100060">...</text>
<text id="101100070">And whatever you might face...</text>
<text id="101100080">The Fingers will surely guide you...</text>
<text id="101110000">Turn back.</text>
<text id="101110010">Ahead lies the Land of the Giants' Flame.</text>
<text id="101110020">And the way forth is forbidden.</text>
<text id="101110030">...</text>
<text id="101110040">Hear me. The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin.</text>
<text id="101110050">Doing so will unbind Destined Death, and slay the world itself.</text>
<text id="101110060">...</text>
<text id="101110070">Who would dare put you up to such a task?</text>
<text id="101110080">Most certainly not the Fingers!</text>
<text id="101120000">Ohh...</text>
<text id="101120010">Oh, Lord Godwyn...</text>
<text id="101120020">Such cruelty, such humiliation...</text>
<text id="101120030">My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.</text>
<text id="101120040">As the first of the demigods to die.</text>
<text id="101120050">As a martyr to Destined Death.</text>
<text id="101120060">But why must it yet bring such disgrace?</text>
<text id="101120070">A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...</text>
<text id="101120080">How could such a thing come to be...</text>
<text id="101120090"><sobbing></text>
<text id="101121000">Ohh...</text>
<text id="101121010">Oh, Lord Godwyn...</text>
<text id="101121020">My poor, sweet lordling should have died a true death.</text>
<text id="101121030">A scion of the golden bough, sentenced to live in Death...</text>
<text id="101121040">How could such a thing come to be...</text>
<text id="101121050"><sobbing></text>
<text id="101800000">Ha, ha, ha!</text>
<text id="101801000">A curse! A curse upon you!</text>
<text id="101801010">Your path leads only to death!</text>
<text id="101802000">You godless brute.</text>
<text id="101802010">You'll soil your hands soon enough.</text>
<text id="101802020">With mortal sin!</text>
<text id="102001000">Are you that new Tarnished?</text>
<text id="102001010">You've done well. I am Enia, the Finger Reader.</text>
<text id="102001020">I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will.</text>
<text id="102001030">Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer.</text>
<text id="102001040">Let their wisdom wash over you.</text>
<text id="102001050">"Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order."</text>
<text id="102001060">"Anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all joy."</text>
<text id="102001070">"Until it was shattered."</text>
<text id="102001080">"The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll."</text>
<text id="102001090">"Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces."</text>
<text id="102001100">"Foul curses and misery spread, unabating."</text>
<text id="102001110">"But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it."</text>
<text id="102001120">"So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act."</text>
<text id="102001130">"Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome shard of the Elden Ring."</text>
<text id="102001140">"Seek another of its kind."</text>
<text id="102001150">"To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."</text>
<text id="102001170">Let the words of the Fingers guide you.</text>
<text id="102002000">Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods;</text>
<text id="102002010">the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="102002020">Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="102002030">And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished.</text>
<text id="102002040">Listen, the Fingers speak.</text>
<text id="102002050">"The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods."</text>
<text id="102002060">"Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left."</text>
<text id="102002070">"The Fingers have willed it so."</text>
<text id="102002080">...Indeed. But remember one thing.</text>
<text id="102002090">The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika.</text>
<text id="102002100">Godrick the Grafted was but a distant relation...</text>
<text id="102002110">The runt of the litter, his divine blood sorely diluted.</text>
<text id="102003000">Well, well… I see…</text>
<text id="102003010">A remembrance of gold has found its way into your possession.</text>
<text id="102003020">Demigods, and even the greater of the champions,</text>
<text id="102003030">are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances.</text>
<text id="102003040">They are…valuable indeed.</text>
<text id="102003050">These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters.</text>
<text id="102003060">And should you wish to wield that same power, well…</text>
<text id="102003070">I will lend you the strength of the Fingers.</text>
<text id="102003080">Heh… Do not recoil from my offer.</text>
<text id="102003090">The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not?</text>
<text id="102004000">Ah. You have returned. What is it?</text>
<text id="102005000">Now, go forth.</text>
<text id="102005010">Let the words of the Fingers guide you.</text>
<text id="102010000">I had my doubts, but...my, look at you.</text>
<text id="102010010">Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together.</text>
<text id="102010020">Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance.</text>
<text id="102010030">"Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased."</text>
<text id="102010040">"You have earned the right to become Elden Lord."</text>
<text id="102010050">"Now, seek the Erdtree, and an audience with Queen Marika."</text>
<text id="102010060">"To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."</text>
<text id="102010070">The Fingers expect...</text>
<text id="102010080">As much from you as they do young Gideon.</text>
<text id="102010090">Take this. A token of farewell.</text>
<text id="102011000">Now, go forth.</text>
<text id="102011010">Become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="102012000">Queen Marika is the vessel of the Elden Ring, carrier of its vision.</text>
<text id="102012010">A god, in truth.</text>
<text id="102012020">But after the Elden Ring's shattering, she was imprisoned in the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="102012030">A grim punishment for shattering the Order, despite her godhood.</text>
<text id="102012040">The Fingers speak...</text>
<text id="102012050">"Marika's trespass demanded a heavy sentence."</text>
<text id="102012060">"But even in shackles, she remains a god, and the vision's vessel."</text>
<text id="102012070">"Confer Great Runes to become Elden Lord, and join Queen Marika as her consort."</text>
<text id="102012080">"The Fingers have willed it so."</text>
<text id="102012090">Now, you may go.</text>
<text id="102020000">Well, you managed to return.</text>
<text id="102020010">You know what this means. The Erdtree has spurned you.</text>
<text id="102020020">The Fingers remain still.</text>
<text id="102020030">Shaken by this turn of events, they are busy consulting the Greater Will.</text>
<text id="102020040">When they are finished, the Fingers will again offer their guidance.</text>
<text id="102020050">But thousands, if not tens of thousands, of moons must first pass.</text>
<text id="102020060">No matter for me. But you? How will you ever manage the wait...</text>
<text id="102020070">My, oh, my...</text>
<text id="102021000">It may be thousands upon thousands of moons before the fingers again offer their guidance.</text>
<text id="102021010">My, oh, my. Whatever will you do…</text>
<text id="102030000">Heavens forbid...</text>
<text id="102030010">That is not the domain of mere men.</text>
<text id="102030020">The burning of the Erdtree is the first cardinal sin. And you say you seek the power of the Rune of Death, too?</text>
<text id="102030030">The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death.</text>
<text id="102030040">The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation…</text>
<text id="102030050">Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable...</text>
<text id="102030060">The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will.</text>
<text id="102030070">...</text>
<text id="102030080">...</text>
<text id="102030090">But here we are...</text>
<text id="102030100">The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.</text>
<text id="102030110">The realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers.</text>
<text id="102030120">Who is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?</text>
<text id="102030130">Go on. Finish the job.</text>
<text id="102030140">Take the course you deem most worthy.</text>
<text id="102031000">You must find kindling.</text>
<text id="102031010">Only the smoldering flame in the Great Forge of the Giants, on the highest peak in the Lands Between, can burn the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="102031020">But special kindling is required to reignite the flame.</text>
<text id="102031030">For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame.</text>
<text id="102031040">And can lead you to the Rune of Death.</text>
<text id="102040000">You've done it, I see.</text>
<text id="102040010">What use do you have for me, now?</text>
<text id="102040020">I am a Finger Reader. I will remain here, until their dialogue ends, and the Fingers speak again.</text>
<text id="102040030">Do as you please. Take whatever course seems most worthy to you.</text>
<text id="102040040">Now, you may go.</text>
<text id="102041000">Heh, heh, heh.</text>
<text id="102041010">You'd force this tired old crone to work, even now?</text>
<text id="102041020">A harder taskmaster have I never met.</text>
<text id="102042000">Don't worry, my dear.</text>
<text id="102042010">I'll see it to the end with you, if it please.</text>
<text id="102043000">Now, go forth.</text>
<text id="102043010">Do what you believe is right.</text>
<text id="102100000">Oh, such a fine gift, I will gladly accept.</text>
<text id="102100010">But don't raise your hopes;</text>
<text id="102100020">I have no secrets for you to plunder.</text>
<text id="102100030">I lost my appetite for them a lifetime ago, or more.</text>
<text id="102101000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="106001000">A pleasure to meet thee, Tarnished.</text>
<text id="106001010">I am the witch Renna.</text>
<text id="106001020">I'd heard tell of a Tarnished hurtling about atop a spectral steed.</text>
<text id="106001030">And upon looking into the matter,</text>
<text id="106001040">the talk, I surmise, is of thee.</text>
<text id="106001050">Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?</text>
<text id="106001060">To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.</text>
<text id="106002000">Ah. As I had hoped.</text>
<text id="106002010">I was entrusted this, for thee.</text>
<text id="106002020">By Torrent's former master.</text>
<text id="106002030">Tis a bell for calling forth spirits.</text>
<text id="106002040">Summon them with it, from ash unreturned to the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="106002050">The spirits will obey thine command but briefly, as they recall battles past.</text>
<text id="106002060">Now it is thine. To do with as thou wishest.</text>
<text id="106003000">Forgive mine intrusion, Tarnished.</text>
<text id="106003010">I doubt we shall again meet. But all the same, learn well the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="106003020">How long will it be, I wonder...</text>
<text id="106003030">Before the Tarnished tire of obeisance to the Two Fingers?</text>
<text id="106003040">...</text>
<text id="106004000">This way, Tarnished.</text>
<text id="106004010">May I have a word?</text>
<text id="106010000">Trifle not with me, Tarnished.</text>
<text id="106010010">Or didst thou merely forget?</text>
<text id="106010020">The name of the spectral steed thou callest?</text>
<text id="106011000">I will ask thee again.</text>
<text id="106011010">Thou'rt possessed of the power, no?</text>
<text id="106011020">To call forth the spectral steed named Torrent.</text>
<text id="106012000">Quite the stubborn one, aren't we?</text>
<text id="106012010">Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty.</text>
<text id="106012020">Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit.</text>
<text id="106012030">I shall leave this for thee, at the behest of Torrent's former master.</text>
<text id="106012040">Take it, shouldst thou overcome thy suspicion.</text>
<text id="106012050">...</text>
<text id="106020000">What hopest thou to profit?</text>
<text id="106020010">...</text>
<text id="106020020">No sense in arguing, I see.</text>
<text id="106020030">Thou'rt a wild one, indeed.</text>
<text id="106020040">Torrent hath quite the ruffian chosen...</text>
<text id="106020050">...</text>
<text id="106030000">Let us speak of the past, a while.</text>
<text id="106030010">I was once an Empyrean.</text>
<text id="106030020">Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.</text>
<text id="106030030">Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.</text>
<text id="106030040">But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="106030050">I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.</text>
<text id="106030060">I would not be controlled by that thing.</text>
<text id="106030070">The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...</text>
<text id="106030080">And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.</text>
<text id="106101000">Oh, again we cross paths.</text>
<text id="106101010">I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met.</text>
<text id="106101020">It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty...</text>
<text id="106101030">But Tarnished, what business hast thou here?</text>
<text id="106101040">I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.</text>
<text id="106102000">Mm? a Tarnished, here?</text>
<text id="106102010">Thou must have some business in mind, to come all this way.</text>
<text id="106102020">Though I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.</text>
<text id="106110000">I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we.</text>
<text id="106110010">Indeed, I am the witch Ranni.</text>
<text id="106110020">I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite.</text>
<text id="106110030">I did it all.</text>
<text id="106110040">But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here.</text>
<text id="106110050">I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away.</text>
<text id="106110060">And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved.</text>
<text id="106111000">Hah!</text>
<text id="106111010">And why should I reveal that to thee?</text>
<text id="106111020">I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,</text>
<text id="106111030">but all the same, thy begging compels me not a jot.</text>
<text id="106111040">The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.</text>
<text id="106111050">Now, begone.</text>
<text id="106112000">The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say.</text>
<text id="106112010">Now, begone.</text>
<text id="106113000">Oh, is that so?</text>
<text id="106113010">Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal?</text>
<text id="106113020">Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt?</text>
<text id="106113030">...</text>
<text id="106113040">Very well...</text>
<text id="106113050">There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme.</text>
<text id="106113060">What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee,</text>
<text id="106113070">I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends...</text>
<text id="106113080">I'll allow it. Enter my service.</text>
<text id="106113090">And good hunting to thee.</text>
<text id="106120000">Hah!</text>
<text id="106120010">No reason in particular, thou claimest?</text>
<text id="106120020">Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion.</text>
<text id="106120030">Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this encounter.</text>
<text id="106120040">...</text>
<text id="106120050">Wilt thou enter into my service?</text>
<text id="106120060">I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.</text>
<text id="106120070">That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.</text>
<text id="106120080">Well? Has that roused thy interest?</text>
<text id="106121000">I see. A choice well made.</text>
<text id="106121010">Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer.</text>
<text id="106121020">But I require as much of those under my command.</text>
<text id="106121030">I anticipate good work from thee.</text>
<text id="106122000">I see. More's the pity.</text>
<text id="106122010">Come to me again, shouldst thou change thy heart.</text>
<text id="106122020">Surrendering thyself into the service of a doll-witch...</text>
<text id="106122030">Is not as frightful as thou fearest...</text>
<text id="106123000">Ah, art thou persuaded to my cause?</text>
<text id="106123010">Then, again I shall ask, wilt thou enter into my service?</text>
<text id="106130000">Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.</text>
<text id="106130010">There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd.</text>
<text id="106130020">I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City.</text>
<text id="106130030">I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars.</text>
<text id="106130040">Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also.</text>
<text id="106130050">Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.</text>
<text id="106130060">I am sure the others will be doing just the same.</text>
<text id="106131000">Speak with the three who await thee below.</text>
<text id="106131010">Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.</text>
<text id="106131020">It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.</text>
<text id="106135000">Good, then I ask we proceed with haste.</text>
<text id="106135010">Art thou aware of the star that struck Limgrave?</text>
<text id="106135020">It left a vast crater, and through it lieth the Eternal City of Nokron.</text>
<text id="106135030">Go there to find the city's hidden treasure.</text>
<text id="106136000">Ah, yes. Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, can be found below.</text>
<text id="106136010">Like thee, they are in my service.</text>
<text id="106136020">Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst.</text>
<text id="106136030">I am sure the others will be doing just the same.</text>
<text id="106137000">Speak with the three who await thee below.</text>
<text id="106137010">Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth.</text>
<text id="106137020">It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.</text>
<text id="106140000">Ah, allow me to forewarn thee.</text>
<text id="106140010">I shall soon enter my slumber.</text>
<text id="106140020">And it will be some time before I wake.</text>
<text id="106140030">This doll's body is not without its hindrances...</text>
<text id="106140040">Still, I have high hopes for thee.</text>
<text id="106140050">I look forward to the good news when I arise.</text>
<text id="106141000">I shall soon enter my slumber.</text>
<text id="106141010">And it will be some time before I wake.</text>
<text id="106141020">I have high hopes for thee.</text>
<text id="106141030">I look forward to the good news when I arise.</text>
<text id="106145000">...</text>
<text id="106170000">Ahh...It was thee.</text>
<text id="106170010">Not Blaidd, it seemeth.</text>
<text id="106170020">Even in my slumber, I sensed it.</text>
<text id="106170030">It is in thy possession, is it not? The hidden treasure of Nokron?</text>
<text id="106170040">My thanks. Finally, all the pieces are in place.</text>
<text id="106170050">Soon must I begin my journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.</text>
<text id="106171000">Ah, but before I leave, I must entrust thee with this.</text>
<text id="106171010">Take it.</text>
<text id="106171020">My discarded flesh lieth beyond the seal unlocked by it.</text>
<text id="106171030">Upon which is carved the cursemark of thy desire.</text>
<text id="106171040">I can fathom what thy purpose might be.</text>
<text id="106171050">Neither of us is welcomed by the brighter path, I see.</text>
<text id="106171060">You may leave now.</text>
<text id="106171070">It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.</text>
<text id="106172000">What is it?</text>
<text id="106172010">Thy purpose in approaching me was to obtain the cursemark, was it not?</text>
<text id="106172020">You may leave now.</text>
<text id="106172030">I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.</text>
<text id="106175000">Ah, but before I leave, I shall entrust thee with this.</text>
<text id="106175010">My thanks, for thy sterling efforts.</text>
<text id="106175020">A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure.</text>
<text id="106175030">I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion.</text>
<text id="106175040">I am certain now, fate steered us to our first encounter.</text>
<text id="106175050">I must thank Torrent too, for his part.</text>
<text id="106175060">You may leave now.</text>
<text id="106175070">It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.</text>
<text id="106176000">What is it? You may go.</text>
<text id="106176010">I, too, am to depart on a journey. Upon the dark path only I may tread.</text>
<text id="106190000">...</text>
<text id="106191000">...</text>
<text id="106192000">...</text>
<text id="106192010">Oh? A dogged fellow, aren't we?</text>
<text id="106192020">Or is it merely thy habit, to talk to dolls?</text>
<text id="106192030">Fine...fine.</text>
<text id="106192040">I hadn't expected any soul to recognise me in this guise.</text>
<text id="106192050">But now the cat is out the bag, I cannot allow thee thy freedoms.</text>
<text id="106192060">Perform for me a service, as recompense.</text>
<text id="106192070">Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.</text>
<text id="106192080">The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.</text>
<text id="106192090">I will not brook disobedience in this matter.</text>
<text id="106193000">Perform for me a service, as recompense.</text>
<text id="106193010">Eliminate the Baleful Shadows which prowl these lands.</text>
<text id="106193020">The name of Ranni the Witch is already sullied by thee.</text>
<text id="106193030">I will not brook disobedience in this matter.</text>
<text id="106200000">Let us speak of the past, a while.</text>
<text id="106200010">I was once an Empyrean.</text>
<text id="106200020">Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title.</text>
<text id="106200030">Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age.</text>
<text id="106200040">Which is when I received Blaidd. In the form of a vassal tailored for an Empyrean.</text>
<text id="106200050">But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="106200060">I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away.</text>
<text id="106200070">I would not be controlled by that thing.</text>
<text id="106200080">The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since...</text>
<text id="106200090">And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.</text>
<text id="106201000">I turned my back on the Two Fingers and we have each been cursing the other since.</text>
<text id="106201010">The Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.</text>
<text id="106210000">Even when I turned my back upon the Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="106210010">Blaidd remained my loyal ally.</text>
<text id="106210020">Heh.</text>
<text id="106210030">Though he was created a vassal for an Empyrean,</text>
<text id="106210040">He was a colossal failure, on the part of the Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="106210050">Blaidd, and Iji both... Art willing to give too much to me.</text>
<text id="106210060">Yet they both understand. What lieth beyond the dark path...</text>
<text id="106210070">That I must betray everything, and rid the world of what came before.</text>
<text id="106210080">Ah, should I add thee to the list?</text>
<text id="106210090">Another one, kind of heart. As kind of heart as they.</text>
<text id="106211000">Ach, this form hath loosened my tongue.</text>
<text id="106211010">I've let slip too much.</text>
<text id="106211020">Forget what thou'st heard. Forget.</text>
<text id="106220000">O Shadow, thou'rt the last.</text>
<text id="106220010">Tell the Two Fingers,</text>
<text id="106220020">That Ranni the Witch cometh, to rend thy flesh.</text>
<text id="106220030">With a fateful wound, ne'er to heal.</text>
<text id="106230000">Beautifully fought.</text>
<text id="106230010">My thanks. 'Twas more of a challenge than I envisioned.</text>
<text id="106230020">Now I can finally stand before them.</text>
<text id="106230030">This is farewell, my dear.</text>
<text id="106230040">Tell Blaidd, and Iji...</text>
<text id="106230050">I love them.</text>
<text id="106240000">So, it was thee, who would become my Lord.</text>
<text id="106240010">Perhaps I needn't have warned thee.</text>
<text id="106240020">I am pleased, however. Thou'rt a fitting choice.</text>
<text id="106240030">I go now, to the night sky. It is there I shall find mine order.</text>
<text id="106240040">I bid thee travel the path of the Lord.</text>
<text id="106240050">And once all is done, we shall see each other, once more.</text>
<text id="106250000">...</text>
<text id="106250010">I take it thou'st noticed? I shouldn't be surprised.</text>
<text id="106250020">I thought I might expound a little further...</text>
<text id="106250030">Upon the order I envision.</text>
<text id="106250040">Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.</text>
<text id="106250050">I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet.</text>
<text id="106250060">As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove.</text>
<text id="106250070">And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch...</text>
<text id="106250080">All become impossibilities.</text>
<text id="106250090">Which is why I would abandon this soil, with mine order.</text>
<text id="106250100">Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?</text>
<text id="106251000">Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.</text>
<text id="106251010">And I would abandon this soil, with mine Order.</text>
<text id="106251020">Wouldst thou come to me, even now, my one and only Lord?</text>
<text id="106260000">Well, this is a most unpleasant awakening.</text>
<text id="106260010">The depths of wickedness never fail to surprise me.</text>
<text id="106260020">I am saddened. That thou wouldst succumb to such depravity.</text>
<text id="106260030">Led astray by Seluvis, with devious tonic in hand,</text>
<text id="106260040">Didst thou think to have thy way with me?</text>
<text id="106260050">Be gone. Hapless scum.</text>
<text id="106260060">I won't have another whiff of thy rotten breath.</text>
<text id="106261000">I have spoken. Away from my sight.</text>
<text id="106262000">This is the third time, fiend.</text>
<text id="106262010">Enough of thy unbearable breath.</text>
<text id="106300000">What hopest thou to profit?</text>
<text id="106300010">...</text>
<text id="106300020">To think such was thy plot.</text>
<text id="106300030">Well, I refuse to indulge thy fantasies.</text>
<text id="106300040">I relinquished a natural death long, long ago.</text>
<text id="106300050">...</text>
<text id="106301000">What hopest thou to profit?</text>
<text id="106301010">...</text>
<text id="106301020">Hmph.</text>
<text id="106301030">So, this is the measure of my Lord?</text>
<text id="106301040">Perhaps it is precisely what I deserve.</text>
<text id="106301050">…For surrendering myself to delusion.</text>
<text id="106301060">...</text>
<text id="112001000">...</text>
<text id="112002000">...</text>

<text id="200001000">Come, sweetings, become what ye desire.</text>
<text id="200001900">Come, sweetings, time to be born, anew.</text>
<text id="200002000">Be not afeard, little culver.</text>
<text id="200002900">Hush, little culver.</text>
<text id="200002901">Hush, fair maid.</text>
<text id="200002910">I'll soon birth thee anew, a sweeting fresh and pure...</text>

<text id="200004030">Come, Blaidd, my child!</text>
<text id="200005000">Fair child, Hermes!</text>
<text id="200006000">Thy fate lieth under my moon.</text>
<text id="200007000">Guide thy moon as thou wishest.</text>
<text id="200007010">Ranni, my little baby...</text>
<text id="200007020">I thank thee...</text>
<text id="200007900">Oh little Ranni, my dear daughter.</text>
<text id="200007910">Weave thy night into being...</text>
<text id="200008000"> </text>
<text id="200008100"> </text>
<text id="200009000">Where did ye flee, my sweetings?</text>
<text id="200009010">Come out, from whence ye hide. There are books and light aplenty.</text>
<text id="200009020">Dither not; come out say I!</text>
<text id="200009030">Or will ye be gravestones? To be better born anew?</text>
<text id="200010000">Ah...thou...</text>
<text id="200010010">Is it thy wish to be born anew?</text>
<text id="200010020">To become a sweeting, reborn of my beloved egg?</text>
<text id="200011000">Ah...thou...</text>
<text id="200011010">Is it thy wish to yet again be born anew?</text>
<text id="200012000">Now, bear this sweeting into life anew.</text>
<text id="200013000">Be not alarmed, nor afeard.</text>
<text id="200013010">I would birth thee as a sweeting, fair and fine.</text>
<text id="200014000">Ah...thou...</text>
<text id="200014010">Art thou now assured of thy want, to be born anew?</text>
<text id="200015000">Ah, it seemeth thou'rt a sweeting rather fair.</text>
<text id="200015010">And if thou wert born anew once more, thou wouldst be fairer still.</text>
<text id="200015020">Ye will be countless born, forever.</text>
<text id="200016000">Ah, thou'rt now a sweeting full fine and fair.</text>
<text id="200016010">My thanks. For being born of my beloved egg, time and time again.</text>
<text id="200020000">Oh...my thanks to thee.</text>
<text id="200021000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="200030000">Where did ye flee, my sweetings?</text>
<text id="200030010">Come out, from whence ye hide. Of the dark, be not afeard.</text>

<text id="213001010">No matter, it's all the same.</text>
<text id="213001020">Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.</text>
<text id="213002000">Back already?</text>
<text id="213002010">No matter. Lay out your arms.</text>
<text id="213003000">Back already? Can't get enough, eh.</text>
<text id="213010000">Well, where've you been hiding?</text>
<text id="213010010">I took you for dead.</text>
<text id="213010020">No matter. It's all the same.</text>
<text id="213010030">Lay out your arms, then.</text>
<text id="213020000">I see you've noticed the chains.</text>
<text id="213020010">Nothing special. I'm a prisoner, and these are my chains.</text>
<text id="213020020">I'm trapped by the Hold, undying, smithing for you fools.</text>
<text id="213020030">That's all there is to it.</text>
<text id="213021000">Nah, don't read too much into it.</text>
<text id="213021010">I've no grudge against you.</text>
<text id="213021020">My being a prisoner is no fault of yours.</text>
<text id="213021030">Besides, I don't mind smithing.</text>
<text id="213021040">Despite my differences, the weapons get stronger, all the same. Given time, technique never fails.</text>
<text id="213021050">Besides, it helps me forget. The sheer terror of her...</text>
<text id="213022000">Like the look of that whetstone knife, do you?</text>
<text id="213022010">I've no need for it.</text>
<text id="213022020">You're welcome to take it. Go ahead.</text>
<text id="213030000">Now, look at you.</text>
<text id="213030010">Those eyes tell a story.</text>
<text id="213030020">Of a challenger, who's felled his mark.</text>
<text id="213030021">Of a challenger, who's felled her mark.</text>
<text id="213030030">Fine and well. Now, lay out your arms.</text>
<text id="213040000">Your divinity, have mercy, and grant me forgiveness.</text>
<text id="213040010">The road is yet long. A god is not easily felled.</text>
<text id="213040020">But one day, without fail, you will have your wish.</text>
<text id="213040030">So please, grant me forgiveness, Queen Marika...</text>
<text id="213041000">Those words were not meant for you.</text>
<text id="213041010">I may be prisoner to you Tarnished lot.</text>
<text id="213041020">But my prayers are mine and mine alone.</text>
<text id="213041030">Good. I'll be more careful too.</text>
<text id="213041040">Well, I've had my say. I'll be more careful, too.</text>
<text id="213042000">Ah. You, is it?</text>
<text id="213042010">I...didn't notice you there.</text>
<text id="213042020">I'll be doing my job, same as ever.</text>
<text id="213042030">Just lay out your arms.</text>
<text id="213050000">The girl you brought here...</text>
<text id="213050010">She's crestfallen, and can scarcely swing a blade,</text>
<text id="213050020">but she has a gift for spirit tuning.</text>
<text id="213050030">I saw another one like her, long ago.</text>
<text id="213050040">Their eyes share the same hue.</text>
<text id="213051000">The girl? What about her?</text>
<text id="213052000">Are you out of your mind?</text>
<text id="213052010">Who'd stay with an ugly brute who only knows how to smith?</text>
<text id="213052020">Absurd. And besides, she'd never agree to it.</text>
<text id="213053000">I refuse to believe it.</text>
<text id="213053010">I don't doubt you, but I know when something's too good to be true.</text>
<text id="213060000">I spoke with the girl.</text>
<text id="213060010">She has a gift for spirit tuning.</text>
<text id="213060020">So I told her everything I know.</text>
<text id="213060030">I'm indebted to a spirit tuner I met long ago.</text>
<text id="213060040">It was all I could do to honour her.</text>
<text id="213060050">I'm sorry I doubted you.</text>
<text id="213070000">The girl has come a long way.</text>
<text id="213070010">As ever, time and technique have made her stronger.</text>
<text id="213070020">Tis good to see.</text>
<text id="213070030">An imprisoned monster does not deserve an apprentice, or a daughter.</text>
<text id="213070040">But at times, that's precisely what she feels like to me.</text>
<text id="213070050">I've gone soft. And it isn't easy.</text>
<text id="213080000">No, no, no, no...</text>
<text id="213080010">I need to do better than this! This'll never kill a god.</text>
<text id="213080020">I can do better than this! It needs to slay a bloody god!</text>
<text id="213081000">Oh, it's you.</text>
<text id="213081010">Don't pay me any mind. It's not important.</text>
<text id="213081020">Just lay out your arms.</text>
<text id="213090000">Are you having second thoughts?</text>
<text id="213090010">Might I have a word, then?</text>
<text id="213090020">Your kind are meant to challenge them. To slay them.</text>
<text id="213090030">The demigods. And their god.</text>
<text id="213090040">If you remain loyal to your calling,</text>
<text id="213090050">then no matter what you do, no matter what happens to me,</text>
<text id="213090060">I will never cease to smith your weapons.</text>
<text id="213090070">Until you have one to slay a god.</text>
<text id="213100000">I knew you'd be back.</text>
<text id="213100010">Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.</text>
<text id="213101000">Lay out your arms. Let's get smithing.</text>
<text id="213110000">Weren't you listening?</text>
<text id="213110010">As I've always said.</text>
<text id="213110020">You came to challenge the demigods, and their god. To slay them.</text>
<text id="213110030">And as long as you do, I will always smith your weapons.</text>
<text id="213110040">It is what I wish. To smith a weapon for you to slay a god.</text>
<text id="213111000">I've upset the girl.</text>
<text id="213111010">She says that now that my chains are broken, I'm free.</text>
<text id="213111020">That if I stay here, I will be ruined with the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="213111030"> </text>
<text id="213111040">What use have I for freedom now?</text>
<text id="213111050">I smith weapons to slay a god.</text>
<text id="213111060">I have lived, and will die, doing so, upon this spot.</text>
<text id="213111070">Is there any other way?</text>
<text id="213120000">Oh, finally! It's complete!</text>
<text id="213120010">I've done it! A weapon to slay a god!</text>
<text id="213120020">Oh, you have my deepest gratitude.</text>
<text id="213120030">Thanks to you, my wish is granted.</text>
<text id="213120040">Now wield it, and kill them.</text>
<text id="213120050">The demigods. And their god.</text>
<text id="213120060">Queen Marika herself wishes it so.</text>
<text id="213121000">You seek better weapons still?</text>
<text id="213121010">Very well. I'll smith another, if needed.</text>
<text id="213121020">A weapon to slay a god.</text>
<text id="213122000">I'll smith as long as you like.</text>
<text id="213122010">Now, lay out your arms.</text>
<text id="213123000">I'll smith...as long as you like.</text>
<text id="213123010">Now...lay out your...arms.</text>
<text id="213124000">I'll smith...as long...as you like.</text>
<text id="213124010">Now...lay out...your...arms.</text>
<text id="213130000">Use my masterpiece to slay a god.</text>
<text id="213130010">That is all that I have lived for.</text>
<text id="213130020">And my promise to Q-queen Marika.</text>
<text id="213130030">But do me a favor, and do look after the girl.</text>
<text id="213131000">I can't hold on much longer.</text>
<text id="213131010">I'm going the way of the R-roundtable...</text>
<text id="213131020">It was a great honor to smith your weapons during my time here.</text>
<text id="213131030">Allow me to c-call you this, just once, before it ends.</text>
<text id="213131040">My lord, f-for that is what you are.</text>
<text id="213140000">Who are you?</text>
<text id="213140010">Oh, I must be a blacksmith.</text>
<text id="213140020">Now, let's get smithing...</text>
<text id="213141000">Could you tell me what happened?</text>
<text id="213141010">Why is the Roundtable burning, in ruins?</text>
<text id="213141020">Why does that girl weep for me?</text>
<text id="213141030">Have I forgotten something of dire importance?</text>
<text id="213150000">Now, let's get smithing...</text>
<text id="213160000">...</text>
<text id="213160010">I-I smith... I do...</text>
<text id="213171000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="214900000">A fine sacrifice indeed.</text>
<text id="214900010">Let us devour the gods, together!</text>
<text id="214900900">Now you are family.</text>
<text id="214901000">Now, we can devour the gods, together!</text>
<text id="214902000">O shapers of gods, meddlers in fortune.</text>
<text id="214902010">I do not abide! By your suffocating Order.</text>
<text id="214903000"> </text>
<text id="214903100"> </text>
<text id="214903200"> </text>
<text id="214904000">So must it be.</text>
<text id="214904010">Eveligne, show him the way...</text>
<text id="214904011">Eveligne, show her the way...</text>
<text id="214904020">...to devour the gods.</text>
<text id="214905000">No one will hold me captive.</text>
<text id="214905010">A serpent never dies.</text>
<text id="214905020">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="216001000"><howl></text>
<text id="216002000">Who goes there?</text>
<text id="216002010">Kalé send you, did he? Ever the bloody busybody.</text>
<text id="216002020">Hmm. Maybe to him, you don't seem so strange.</text>
<text id="216002030">The name's Blaidd. I'm looking for a man who goes by "Darriwil".</text>
<text id="216002040">He fled somewhere nearby. Or so I've heard.</text>
<text id="216002050">Come tell me if you find him before I do.</text>
<text id="216002060">I can offer you ample reward.</text>
<text id="216003000">Darriwil is nothing but a traitor.</text>
<text id="216003010">And in need of a fitting end to his tale.</text>
<text id="216010000">Darriwil...</text>
<text id="216010010">Rotting in a cell is no true justice.</text>
<text id="216010020">No, this is where it ends for you.</text>
<text id="216020000">...Right. There you are.</text>
<text id="216020010">Had to work for it, but it's done.</text>
<text id="216020020">Don't say I'm not a man of my word. Here's your prize.</text>
<text id="216021000">Oh yes, I should say,</text>
<text id="216021010">If you venture north to Raya Lucaria, and come across a venerable blacksmith who's a little on the large side...</text>
<text id="216021020">Tell him I sent you.</text>
<text id="216021030">And he'll be sure to treat you right.</text>
<text id="216021040">I owe you one, I reckon.</text>
<text id="216022000">That's enough chit-chat for now.</text>
<text id="216022010">It's time we parted ways.</text>
<text id="216030000">Ahh, long time, friend.</text>
<text id="216030010">Blaidd, if you've forgotten.</text>
<text id="216030020">Glad to have you in the service of mistress Ranni.</text>
<text id="216030030">Well. Getting right to business...</text>
<text id="216030040">I'm still in Limgrave.</text>
<text id="216030050">The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.</text>
<text id="216030060">I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.</text>
<text id="216030070">See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...</text>
<text id="216030080">See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...</text>
<text id="216031000">Ah. I heard about you. Good to finally meet.</text>
<text id="216031010">Name's Blaidd, sworn sword to mistress Ranni.</text>
<text id="216031020">Glad to have you aboard.</text>
<text id="216031030">Well. Getting right to business...</text>
<text id="216031040">I'm situated in Limgrave right now.</text>
<text id="216031050">The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.</text>
<text id="216031060">I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.</text>
<text id="216031070">See if I can't find the road to Nokron from there...</text>
<text id="216032000">I'm going below through the well in the Mistwood.</text>
<text id="216032010">See if I can't find the road to Nokron...</text>
<text id="216032020">Don't keep me waiting, eh.</text>
<text id="216040000">Ah, good to see you.</text>
<text id="216040010">Apologies mate, but I don't have much to report.</text>
<text id="216040020">I can see bloody Nokron, right above me, but I'm absolutely stumped.</text>
<text id="216040030">I've tried all the gateways, to no avail...</text>
<text id="216040040">...Perhaps it's time to ask Seluvis?</text>
<text id="216040050">I recall that spiteful little rat acting like he knew something...</text>
<text id="216040060">Let's give him a squeeze. Show him just how sharp my teeth are...</text>
<text id="216041000">I jest, I wouldn't go that far.</text>
<text id="216041010">Besides, I should check on some things here.</text>
<text id="216041020">Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.</text>
<text id="216041030">If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?</text>
<text id="216042000">Ah. Well met.</text>
<text id="216042010">What news?</text>
<text id="216043000">Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.</text>
<text id="216043010">If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?</text>
<text id="216043020">And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source.</text>
<text id="216043030">Seluvis rarely gives a straight answer, the first time.</text>
<text id="216050000">Hmm...</text>
<text id="216050010">So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...</text>
<text id="216050020">That reminds me of something I heard.</text>
<text id="216050030">There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave.</text>
<text id="216050040">It's a festival of combat. And I heard...that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods...</text>
<text id="216050050">Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I think it's worth investigating.</text>
<text id="216050060">I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...</text>
<text id="216051000">You're coming too, right? To Radahn's festivities...</text>
<text id="216051010">I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid.</text>
<text id="216051020">The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.</text>
<text id="216052000">Right. I see.</text>
<text id="216052010">Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.</text>
<text id="216052020">If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right?</text>
<text id="216053000">Hmm...</text>
<text id="216053010">So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn...</text>
<text id="216053020">And there's a festival of war being held at Redmane Castle in Caelid,</text>
<text id="216053030">where you can fight the man himself, once the strongest of the demigods.</text>
<text id="216053040">It's all coming together. Seems like Iji was on to something.</text>
<text id="216053050">I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then...</text>
<text id="216060000">Ah, there you are. Took your sweet time.</text>
<text id="216060020">The players are all made up, and waiting for the curtain...</text>
<text id="216060030">Let's give them a show to remember, eh.</text>
<text id="216060040">Just don't you go dying on me. For Ranni's sake, too.</text>
<text id="216061000">Once more into the fray together, eh.</text>
<text id="216061010">Heh. This might even be fun.</text>
<text id="216062000">Into the fray together, eh.</text>
<text id="216062010">Heh. Let's see what you're made of.</text>
<text id="216063000">Ah, thought I might find you here.</text>
<text id="216063010">I must admit I was a little worried. We missed our meeting.</text>
<text id="216063020">But it looks like you're still in one piece, eh.</text>
<text id="216063030">You must have heard by now, right?</text>
<text id="216063040">That Starscourge Radahn holds Ranni's fate in stasis.</text>
<text id="216063050">But once he's out of the way, it will spring back into motion.</text>
<text id="216063060">So now, we stand against the demigod once known as the strongest of them all.</text>
<text id="216063070">The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang.</text>
<text id="216064000">Hm. Long time.</text>
<text id="216064010">Seems we're fated to keep crossing paths.</text>
<text id="216064020">Now, we find ourselves at a festival of combat, pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.</text>
<text id="216064030">The way ahead is pleasingly simple. A path forged by sword and fang.</text>
<text id="216065000">Mm... As a fellow combatant, allow me to introduce myself.</text>
<text id="216065010">Blaidd, warrior.</text>
<text id="216065020">Now, we find ourselves pitted against Radahn, once the strongest of the demigods.</text>
<text id="216065030">The way ahead is pleasingly simple; a path forged by sword and fang.</text>
<text id="216066000">Hm. Nothing to do but wait. Until the festival begins.</text>
<text id="216080000">Ah, good. I was waiting for you.</text>
<text id="216080010">What a sick way to fight, eh.</text>
<text id="216080020">The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.</text>
<text id="216080030">And hah! Did you see that, afterwards?</text>
<text id="216080040">A falling star, right before our eyes!</text>
<text id="216080050">I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.</text>
<text id="216080060">He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.</text>
<text id="216080070">And, the path has now been cleared.</text>
<text id="216080080">To Nokron, where Ranni's fate will be decided.</text>
<text id="216080090">Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.</text>
<text id="216080100">We'll take up our swords once more. For mistress Ranni.</text>
<text id="216081000">Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth.</text>
<text id="216081010">And we'll go into battle again, side by side.</text>
<text id="216081020">My only purpose is to fight for Ranni's fate, sword and fang.</text>
<text id="216081030">The curtain's rising...on the final act.</text>
<text id="216082000">Hmph, what a sick way to fight, eh mate.</text>
<text id="216082010">The glory of the clash is shared, by Radahn and you.</text>
<text id="216082020">And then a falling star, right before our eyes!</text>
<text id="216082030">I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.</text>
<text id="216082040">He was a living legend, if ever I saw one.</text>
<text id="216083000">Well, it's time I left.</text>
<text id="216083010">The wheel of fate has been set into motion.</text>
<text id="216083020">If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.</text>
<text id="216083030">You are a fine warrior.</text>
<text id="216084000">If it's on the cards, I'd be glad to meet again.</text>
<text id="216084010">You are a fine warrior.</text>
<text id="216090000"><howl></text>
<text id="216100000">Oh, it's you...</text>
<text id="216100010">It's me, Blaidd.</text>
<text id="216100020">Old Iji trapped me here.</text>
<text id="216100030">Told me I'd bring nought but bale to Lady Ranni.</text>
<text id="216100040">But there's no chance that could happen.</text>
<text id="216100050">I'm part of her being. Her very shadow...</text>
<text id="216100060">I thought old Iji knew as much...</text>
<text id="216100070">Honestly, I don't know what's going on anymore...</text>
<text id="216101000">I don't understand. Why would Iji do this...</text>
<text id="216101010">I could never intend harm to Lady Ranni. What's he thinking...</text>
<text id="216110000">My thanks, friend.</text>
<text id="216110010">I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.</text>
<text id="216110020">I don't know what came over old Iji,</text>
<text id="216110030">but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.</text>
<text id="216110040">Now, Ranni can finally set in motion</text>
<text id="216110050">the fight against her fate she's dreamt of for so long.</text>
<text id="216111000">I'm going to see mistress Ranni, now.</text>
<text id="216111010">I don't know what came over old Iji,</text>
<text id="216111020">but even if the odds are slim, I need to check the mistress is safe.</text>
<text id="216120000">...</text>
<text id="216120010">No. I'm part of her very being!</text>
<text id="216120020">I could never betray her!</text>
<text id="216120030">No matter what might happen...</text>
<text id="216120040">Ranni... She needs me...</text>
<text id="216121000"><growling></text>
<text id="216800000">Oh?</text>
<text id="216801000">What are you playing at?</text>
<text id="216802000">Fine.</text>
<text id="216802010">Time to douse your little flame.</text>
<text id="216803000">Alright then.</text>
<text id="216803010">Better to put you down now.</text>
<text id="216803020">Before you trouble mistress Ranni.</text>
<text id="216804000">Hmph. Pathetic little man.</text>
<text id="216804001">Hmph. Pathetic little woman.</text>
<text id="216805000">Don't show your face again.</text>
<text id="216805010">Stay away from mistress Ranni.</text>
<text id="216806000">You're...you're strong of arm.</text>
<text id="216806010">But ask yourself...</text>
<text id="216806020">What harm can be done...to a shadow?</text>
<text id="216807000">Traitorous wretch...</text>
<text id="216807010">You're...you're a danger...</text>
<text id="216807011">From... From this woman…</text>
<text id="216808000">Stop, please...</text>
<text id="216808010">You think me a bringer of bale as well?</text>
<text id="216808020">Fine. I am Ranni's shadow and it's for her that I fight.</text>
<text id="216808030">Whatever any of you might call me.</text>
<text id="216809000">I am no bringer of bale.</text>
<text id="216809010">I must return to Ranni's side.</text>
<text id="216810000">Tell...me...</text>
<text id="216810010">Why... Why am I...bale to Ranni?</text>
<text id="216811000">Didn't I say? No harm can befall a shadow.</text>
<text id="216812000">I...am shadowbound.</text>
<text id="216812010">Wherever mistress Ranni goes, I follow.</text>
<text id="216812020">You are a danger. You die here.</text>
<text id="216813000">Rraargh!</text>
<text id="216900000"> </text>
<text id="216900010"> </text>
<text id="216900020"> </text>
<text id="218001000">Please, wait!</text>
<text id="218001010">Proud Tarnished warrior. Before you kill me, let me speak.</text>
<text id="218001020">I can aid you. Please, just hear me out.</text>
<text id="218002000">Thank you for listening.</text>
<text id="218002010">I am Asimi. My true form is that of a silver tear.</text>
<text id="218002020">I am a simple being who can assume the shapes of other living things.</text>
<text id="218002030">But now, I've gained knowledge. I speak, and ponder, and...live in fear of death.</text>
<text id="218002040">O, mighty Tarnished warrior, I beg of you.</text>
<text id="218002050">Let me keep the life I've been granted. In exchange, I offer you power.</text>
<text id="218003000">Ahh, thank you.</text>
<text id="218003010">Now, set your lips upon me, and breathe in deep.</text>
<text id="218003020">I will live inside of you, and grant you strength untold.</text>
<text id="218004000">Onward, to our glorious future, my host...</text>
<text id="218005000">You won't listen to me, will you?</text>
<text id="218005010">It's such a pity. I had a feeling you would become...</text>
<text id="218006000">Please, proud Tarnished warrior, I beg you reconsider.</text>
<text id="218006010">The gifts I can bestow you in life far outstrip those which could be plundered from my corpse.</text>
<text id="218006020">Please, can't you find it in your heart to trust me?</text>
<text id="218007000">So, you won't trust me.</text>
<text id="218007010">But you still haven't killed me, have you.</text>
<text id="218007020">Do you wish to think it over? Then I will wait.</text>
<text id="218007030">For as long as it takes for you to trust me.</text>
<text id="218008000">Proud Tarnished Warrior, have you made up your mind?</text>
<text id="218008010">I can grant you power, if you let me live.</text>
<text id="218010000">My lord host, do you hear that?</text>
<text id="218010010">The sound of water. The river that flows in my home, the Eternal City.</text>
<text id="218010020">Good lord host, I beg you, we must see the Eternal City.</text>
<text id="218010030">To discover the ancient wonders of the stars. A wellspring of strength.</text>
<text id="218020000">My lord host, great lord host.</text>
<text id="218020010">May I ask something of you?</text>
<text id="218020020">A chalice is close by, the cradle of my kind...</text>
<text id="218020030">Would you mind finding it for me?</text>
<text id="218020040">Mm, you should find the chalice...and drink it dry.</text>
<text id="218020050">Ahh, my lord host. I am terribly parched.</text>
<text id="218020060">The chalice will quench my thirst, rejuvenate my flesh, and allow me to grant you further strength.</text>
<text id="218020070">Please, my lord host. It is my only desire.</text>
<text id="218021000">Bless this brook of sustenance. My lord host...</text>
<text id="218030000">My lord host, great lord host.</text>
<text id="218030010">A tear chalice lies in these lands, too.</text>
<text id="218030020">A tear chalice lies in these lands.</text>
<text id="218030030">Our mother chalice.</text>
<text id="218030040">Please, search out this most sacred chalice.</text>
<text id="218030050">It's suffused with the blessed wonders of the stars...</text>
<text id="218030060">It will allow us to become a perfect whole.</text>
<text id="218040000">Now, lord host.</text>
<text id="218040010">Please, drink every last drop from the mother chalice.</text>
<text id="218040020">So that we may form a perfect whole.</text>
<text id="218041000">Oh no...</text>
<text id="218041010">Excuse me, lord host.</text>
<text id="218041020">I'm still so very, very parched.</text>
<text id="218041030">In the other Eternal City, there's a cradle chalice to be found.</text>
<text id="218041040">And if you were to drink the entirety of that one, first...</text>
<text id="218050000">Ahh, are you awake?</text>
<text id="218050010">We've become a perfect whole.</text>
<text id="218050020">There is nothing to fear. I will merely follow in your footsteps.</text>
<text id="218050030">Living only as you would have yourself.</text>
<text id="218050040">And I vow, that when I perfect your form.</text>
<text id="218060000">Ahh, how could you...</text>
<text id="218060010">I was you, and only you. We were one...together.</text>
<text id="218060020">Please, I only want to live...</text>
<text id="218060030">I only wanted you...</text>
<text id="218060040">to become Lord...</text>
<text id="218060050">Gah...</text>
<text id="218070000">Oh...you found me...</text>
<text id="218070010">I had hoped you wouldn't...</text>
<text id="218070020">You could have become Elden Lord, and I could have become Sovereign Eternal, eventually.</text>
<text id="218070030">If you hadn't found me, we both could have been Lords.</text>
<text id="218800000">I was wrong about you...</text>
<text id="218801000">My apologies, lord host.</text>
<text id="218801010">I will take the throne.</text>
<text id="218802000">I'm...dying...</text>
<text id="218802010">So this...is fear...</text>
<text id="218803000">I'm...glad...</text>
<text id="218803010">My lord host, worthiest of lords...</text>
<text id="218900000"> </text>
<text id="218900010"> </text>
<text id="218900020"> </text>
<text id="219001000">Ah!</text>
<text id="219001010">Please, no. Dear me!</text>
<text id="219001020">...</text>
<text id="219001030">I haven't a clue.</text>
<text id="219001040">No secrets lie with me, not a one.</text>
<text id="219001050">Oh, please. Leave me be.</text>
<text id="219002000">Wait, then, you're not one of them?</text>
<text id="219002010">Well, what a relief.</text>
<text id="219002020">...</text>
<text id="219002030">Oh, goodness me.</text>
<text id="219002040">I am Albus. An Albinauric, as you can see.</text>
<text id="219002050">We're finished. The whole village is finished.</text>
<text id="219002060">The cursemongers have destroyed everything. No one that remains has their wits about them.</text>
<text id="219002070">I beg you. Would you look after this medallion?</text>
<text id="219002080">You must keep it out of the cursemongers' hands.</text>
<text id="219002090">And if you should meet the young Albinauric Latenna,</text>
<text id="219002100">then please, give it to her.</text>
<text id="219003000">A chosen land awaits us Albinaurics.</text>
<text id="219003010">Miquella's city, far to the north, a place called Eburion, where we are conferred eternal grace.</text>
<text id="219003020">The medallion is the key that leads to the city.</text>
<text id="219003030">It's only a quaint treasure, for we who cannot make the journey.</text>
<text id="219003040">But for dear Latenna, it is needed. To fulfil her purpose.</text>
<text id="219004000">My legs will soon fade, and with them, my life.</text>
<text id="219004010">Alas, this is the immovable fate of all Albinaurics.</text>
<text id="219004020">...</text>
<text id="219004030">If only I could have gazed upon it, even once. The great chalk buttress of Eburion.</text>
<text id="219004040">...</text>
<text id="219800000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="219801000">We are Albinaurics.</text>
<text id="219801010">We have caused you no harm!</text>
<text id="219802000">You merciless brutes.</text>
<text id="219802010">Let the curse take everything.</text>
<text id="219803000">I will never give this up.</text>
<text id="219803010">Not to your kind.</text>
<text id="219900000"> </text>
<text id="219900010"> </text>
<text id="219900020"> </text>
<text id="219900030"> </text>
<text id="220001000">Hello-o? Can you hear me?</text>
<text id="220001010">Help me! I'm stuck!</text>
<text id="220001020">Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?</text>
<text id="220002000">Oh my stars I'm so happy to see you!</text>
<text id="220002010">I am Alexander, also known as the Iron Fist. And as you can see, I'm stuck here.</text>
<text id="220002020">Please, can you help me out of this?</text>
<text id="220002030">My thanks! A thousand thanks!</text>
<text id="220002040">Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.</text>
<text id="220002050">And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!</text>
<text id="220002060">Don't dally. No no, there's no need to fret, I'm very well trained.</text>
<text id="220002070">Give it your all, I say!</text>
<text id="220003000">Ah!</text>
<text id="220003010">Ouuch!</text>
<text id="220004000">S-stop please! That's a little too rough for me, friend.</text>
<text id="220004010">You'll crack me in half, like that! A little more gently, gently, please.</text>
<text id="220005000">Ahhh!</text>
<text id="220006000">Ahh! Well played, good sir. Well played!</text>
<text id="220006001">Ahh! Well played, good lady. Well played!</text>
<text id="220006010">Though that mighty wallop of yours almost spelt the end of me!</text>
<text id="220006020">Ha ha ha ha!</text>
<text id="220006030">Well, I'm out now, and that's what counts.</text>
<text id="220006040">I thank you, and as a token of my appreciation, I'd like you to have this.</text>
<text id="220007000">Once again, the pleasure is mine. I am the warrior jar known as Alexander. Iron Fist Alexander, in fact.</text>
<text id="220007010">I journey to the east, where I intend to further my education in the ways of war.</text>
<text id="220007020">Beyond these lands lie the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220007030">And upon their southern edge is Redmane Castle, in which a festival of combat is being held.</text>
<text id="220007040">I'd heard whispers of such festivities before...</text>
<text id="220007050">Doesn't the notion set your breast aflutter!</text>
<text id="220007060">Ha ha ha ha!</text>
<text id="220008000">I see. More's the pity.</text>
<text id="220008010">No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.</text>
<text id="220008020">Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.</text>
<text id="220009000">Ah, what's that look, good sir?</text>
<text id="220009001">Ah, what's that look, good lady?</text>
<text id="220009010">Are you willing to help me out after all?</text>
<text id="220010000">Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.</text>
<text id="220010010">I'll pop clean out. I'm sure, of it!</text>
<text id="220011000">Don't stop now, friend.</text>
<text id="220011010">Just keeping clobbering away at the old behind!</text>
<text id="220011020">Put those doubts to rest, I'll be just fine. I'm very well trained.</text>
<text id="220011030">Give it your all, I say!</text>
<text id="220012000">G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my face!</text>
<text id="220012010">Smack me from the other end! The other end!</text>
<text id="220013000">I'm heading eastward.</text>
<text id="220013010">To Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220013020">I've heard there's to be a festival held there.</text>
<text id="220014000">G-good gosh, stop, please! That's my lid!</text>
<text id="220020000">Oh, I hadn't expected to see your face again.</text>
<text id="220020010">Are you heading to the festival of combat, too?</text>
<text id="220020020">Oh, no need to be coy with me.</text>
<text id="220020030">Judging by the fine wallop you gave the old backside earlier, I would venture you're something of a warrior yourself.</text>
<text id="220020040">The mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!</text>
<text id="220020050">Now, now, according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220020060">But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.</text>
<text id="220020070">I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.</text>
<text id="220020080">It seems my calculations must have been off...</text>
<text id="220021000">I was created to be a warrior vessel.</text>
<text id="220021010">Many great warriors reside within me, ever dreaming of becoming a great champion.</text>
<text id="220021020">It's my destiny. And the reason for which I quest.</text>
<text id="220021030">It is my ordeal, you could say. To test myself, to better myself, to fell ever greater foes.</text>
<text id="220021040">And then, one day, we'll be a single great champion. The greatest of them all!</text>
<text id="220021050">What do you think, eh? How do you rate my chances?</text>
<text id="220021060">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="220022000">Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.</text>
<text id="220022010">Are you travelling my way?</text>
<text id="220022020">I'm heading to the festival at Redmane Castle, on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220022030">Oh, no need to be coy with me.</text>
<text id="220022040">I can tell from your bearing you're skilled in the arts of combat.</text>
<text id="220022050">Ah, yes, the mere thought of such a festival gets the blood pumping, eh!</text>
<text id="220022060">I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.</text>
<text id="220022070">And according to my calculations, passing through this road should lead us to the Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220022080">But however you slice it, it seems we've reached a dead end.</text>
<text id="220022090">I'm sorry to have raised your hopes.</text>
<text id="220022100">It seems my calculations must have been off...</text>
<text id="220030000">...!</text>
<text id="220030010">Good sir, where did you spring from?</text>
<text id="220030011">Good lady, where did you spring from?</text>
<text id="220030020">This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.</text>
<text id="220030030">What's going on here? A door, from thin air!</text>
<text id="220030040">Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220030050">I suppose my calculations were right all along. You should head this way as well, friend.</text>
<text id="220030060">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="220031000">...!</text>
<text id="220031010">The esteemed warrior. Where did you spring from?</text>
<text id="220031020">This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.</text>
<text id="220031030">What's going on here? A door, from thin air!</text>
<text id="220031040">Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward! To the Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220031050">Gosh, that dead-end had me rather stumped!</text>
<text id="220031060">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="220032000">...!</text>
<text id="220032010">Where did you spring from?</text>
<text id="220032020">This was supposed to be a dead end, I'm sure of it.</text>
<text id="220032030">What's going on here? A door, from thin air!</text>
<text id="220032040">Well, stranger things happen at sea, or so I'm told, but onward I shall go.</text>
<text id="220032050">I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander.</text>
<text id="220032060">I was heading to Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220032070">Where a festival is being held. Until I was stumped by that dead end!</text>
<text id="220032080">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="220033000">It's time I set off.</text>
<text id="220033010">To the festival at Redmane Castle on the southern edge of the scarlet rot-blighted Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="220033020">Doesn't the thought just set your heart aflutter!</text>
<text id="220040000">Ah, you came, how delightful!</text>
<text id="220040010">Indeed, I thought I might find you here.</text>
<text id="220040020">By the by, do you know for whom this festival is being held?</text>
<text id="220040030">Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!</text>
<text id="220040040">To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...</text>
<text id="220040050">In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.</text>
<text id="220040060">But! The fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking!</text>
<text id="220040070">Now, be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.</text>
<text id="220040080">I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.</text>
<text id="220041000">Ah, if it isn't a Tarnished warrior.</text>
<text id="220041010">I am the warrior jar, Iron Fist Alexander. The pleasure is mine.</text>
<text id="220041020">Do you know for whom this festival is being held?</text>
<text id="220041030">Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself!</text>
<text id="220041040">To think, I could face a great champion of the Shattering, a demigod in the flesh...</text>
<text id="220041050">In truth I quiver at the thought, such is his frightful repute.</text>

<text id="220041070">Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.</text>
<text id="220041080">I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.</text>
<text id="220042000">Be sure to get a good vantage, my friend.</text>
<text id="220042010">I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.</text>
<text id="220050000">A-ah, hello there.</text>
<text id="220050010">It was a battle marvellously fought. You are well and truly a champion, friend.</text>
<text id="220050020">I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock.</text>
<text id="220050030">One hit was all it took to crack me, and for my insides to come spilling out...</text>
<text id="220050040">After that, I hid like a coward.</text>
<text id="220050050">And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you.</text>
<text id="220051000">...But don't you think I've given up just yet.</text>
<text id="220051010">As luck would have it, there's a veritable mountain of warriors' bodies right here.</text>
<text id="220051020">If I can just squeeze this bunch down inside me, I'll be a mighty warrior again in no time.</text>
<text id="220051030">And you know... The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.</text>
<text id="220051040">Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!</text>
<text id="220051050">Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!</text>
<text id="220051060">Just you wait, when next we meet!</text>
<text id="220051070">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="220052000">Alright lads, I'm going to take you on a little journey.</text>
<text id="220052010">You'll all be inside me, and be part of me.</text>
<text id="220052020">From now on, we're all in it together.</text>
<text id="220052030">So let's all of us dream big.</text>
<text id="220053000">The bodies found here are exceedingly fine.</text>
<text id="220053010">Who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the Shattering, the greatest of all wars!</text>
<text id="220053020">Just you wait and see, friend. I'll grow even stronger!</text>
<text id="220053030">Just you wait, when next we meet!</text>
<text id="220053040">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="220060000">Hello-o? Can you hear me?</text>
<text id="220060010">Help me! I'm stuck!</text>
<text id="220060020">Hello? Hellooo! Anyone?</text>
<text id="220061000">Ahh, hello! How nice it is to see a friendly face!</text>
<text id="220061010">As you can surmise, I've got myself stuck in another hole.</text>
<text id="220061020">Would you mind helping me out, again?</text>
<text id="220061030">My thanks in advance, I know you're the man for the job!</text>
<text id="220061031">My thanks in advance, I know you're the woman for the job!</text>
<text id="220061040">You know what to do, hm?</text>
<text id="220061050">Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big.</text>
<text id="220061060">Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.</text>
<text id="220061070">I'm stuck back together good and proper!</text>
<text id="220061080">Just give it your all!</text>
<text id="220062000">Ah!</text>
<text id="220062010">Ouuch!</text>
<text id="220063000">P-please! Wait. I have a terrible feeling about this!</text>
<text id="220063010">Would you stop hitting me for a minute!</text>
<text id="220064000">I see. More's the pity.</text>
<text id="220064010">No no. I apologise. Don't you worry about a thing.</text>
<text id="220064020">Despite my appearance, I am but a chip off a greater jar. I'll pop out eventually, just you wait.</text>
<text id="220065000">What's that look, good sir?</text>
<text id="220065001">What's that look, good lady?</text>
<text id="220065010">Are you willing to help me out after all?</text>
<text id="220066000">Come on, give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!</text>
<text id="220067000">I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.</text>
<text id="220067010">I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.</text>
<text id="220067020">Hmm...</text>
<text id="220067030">Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...</text>
<text id="220067040">What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?</text>
<text id="220068000">Hmm...</text>
<text id="220068010">Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...</text>
<text id="220068020">What if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?</text>

<text id="220070000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="220070010">Nngh!</text>
<text id="220070020">Oh, yes!</text>
<text id="220070030">That's the ticket!</text>
<text id="220071000">Nnngh!</text>
<text id="220072000">My thanks! To you and your razor-sharp wits.</text>
<text id="220072010">As a token of my thanks, I'd like you to have this.</text>
<text id="220073000">Deary me, I'm oilier than a toad!</text>
<text id="220073010">There were countless oil jars back where I'm from, actually.</text>
<text id="220073020">And now I know what it's like to be one of them!</text>
<text id="220073030">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="220074000">Yes, indeed, I too have a home.</text>
<text id="220074010">Though it is one to which I have vowed not to return.</text>
<text id="220074020">So, I thought I might look out from atop the cliff, but as I drew closer and closer...</text>
<text id="220074030">Pow! Wouldn't you know it, I was perfectly stuck in that blasted hole.</text>
<text id="220074040">I can feel the warriors inside admonishing me for my mawkishness.</text>
<text id="220074050">To walk the path of champions, one cannot cleave to the past!</text>
<text id="220074060">I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.</text>
<text id="220074070">I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.</text>
<text id="220074080">I will forge myself anew in its flames!</text>
<text id="220075000">I'm headed to the fiery mount in the north.</text>
<text id="220075010">I can strengthen myself there, without fear of cracking this vessel.</text>

<text id="220080020">O mountain of fire! Bake me in your flames!</text>
<text id="220080030">Rrrrngh!</text>
<text id="220081000">Nnngh!</text>
<text id="220081010">Ah, good sir, what business might you have in such a place as this?</text>
<text id="220081011">Ah, good lady, what business might you have in such a place as this?</text>
<text id="220081020">I hardly think you're here to temper yourself with flame, considering that fleshly form of yours.</text>
<text id="220081030">Your timing though, is impeccable as ever!</text>
<text id="220081040">I've been making just the thing for you on my journey here.</text>
<text id="220081050">Take it, I'm sure it'll suit you to a tee.</text>
<text id="220081060">But oh, it's hardly more than lukewarm here.</text>
<text id="220081070">I won't be able to temper my body such that it'll never crack again.</text>
<text id="220081080">Perhaps I'll head eastward.</text>
<text id="220081090">There's an old saying I've caught wind of.</text>
<text id="220081100">"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."</text>
<text id="220083000">Perhaps I'll head eastward.</text>
<text id="220083010">There's an old saying I've caught wind of.</text>
<text id="220083020">"Above the lofty clouds, the icy giant's peak doth soar, here lieth the flame of ruin, which ever burning roars."</text>
<text id="220090000">Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.</text>
<text id="220090010">The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.</text>
<text id="220090020">But that aside, you're certainly a force to be reckoned with, eh.</text>
<text id="220090030">I doubt there's a single soul who could've handled that giant, other than you. It was practically a god...</text>
<text id="220090040">Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.</text>
<text id="220090050">Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.</text>
<text id="220090060">Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?</text>
<text id="220090070">Come and tell me when you're ready.</text>
<text id="220090080">I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.</text>
<text id="220091000">You are ready then, I take it?</text>
<text id="220091010">Then let us begin!</text>
<text id="220091020">I am the great jar warrior, Iron Fist Alexander!</text>
<text id="220091030">Lend me strength, O warriors within!</text>
<text id="220091040">Let us become one champion, together!</text>
<text id="220092000">Ah, I see you've finally made it here yourself.</text>
<text id="220092010">The city hanging in the air is slowly crumbling. What an incredible place we find ourselves.</text>
<text id="220092020">But that aside, I can't believe you felled that giant. It was practically a god...</text>
<text id="220092030">I doubt there's another soul out there who could've done the same.</text>
<text id="220092040">Of course I count myself, the great Alexander, among the many.</text>
<text id="220092050">Which means, I've but one thing to ask of you.</text>
<text id="220092060">Would you kindly undertake my ordeal?</text>
<text id="220092070">Come and tell me when you're ready.</text>
<text id="220092080">I've been longing to fight a warrior as accomplished as you.</text>
<text id="220100000">As I suspected... Victory...was impossible.</text>
<text id="220100010">This vessel...was found lacking...</text>
<text id="220101000">My thanks. I knew you were the stuff of champions.</text>
<text id="220101010">It was a marvellous battle.</text>
<text id="220101020">I implore you, take what I bequeath...from inside me...</text>
<text id="220101030">All vessels are destined to one day break.</text>
<text id="220101040">But the great Alexander lived as a warrior to his last!</text>
<text id="220101050">Ha ha ha ha!</text>
<text id="220102000">Good sir, I can't believe your heart was in it at all.</text>
<text id="220102001">Good lady, I can't believe your heart was in it at all.</text>
<text id="220130000">By the gods you are a man of vision!</text>
<text id="220130001">By the gods you are a woman of vision!</text>
<text id="220130010">This will have me as slippery as a toad.</text>
<text id="220130020">I have a good feeling about this, my friend.</text>
<text id="220130030">Right! Give me a good smack from behind with something nice and big!</text>
<text id="220131000">Argh! Cease! Please!</text>
<text id="220131010">Just stop a moment, I beg!</text>
<text id="220132000">My lower half is stuck on something down there!</text>
<text id="220133000">I'll break! I'll break before I'm out!</text>
<text id="220134000">Argh! No!</text>
<text id="220134010">Stop, please!</text>
<text id="220134020">I beg! I beg of you!</text>
<text id="220135000">Argh!</text>
<text id="220140000">Phew.</text>
<text id="220140010">I thought I was apt to split in half...</text>
<text id="220140020">Mm, I can feel my lower half is stuck on something.</text>
<text id="220140030">I don't think you can get me out just by hitting me, this time.</text>
<text id="220140040">Hmm...</text>
<text id="220140050">Let's think... Perhaps there's a way to slide me out a little more smoothly...</text>
<text id="220140060">W-what if I could somehow be made slippery, or somesuch?</text>
<text id="220141000">My thanks! A thousand thanks!</text>
<text id="220141010">Just give me a good smack from the rear, with something nice and big.</text>
<text id="220141020">And I'll pop clean out. I'm sure!</text>
<text id="220141030">Don't worry about my wound sustained at the festival.</text>
<text id="220141040">I'm stuck back together good and proper!</text>
<text id="220141050">Just give it your all!</text>
<text id="220800000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="220801000">What are you playing at?</text>
<text id="220801010">This is no time for games!</text>
<text id="220802000">Wait, I see. I see it now.</text>
<text id="220802010">Humans all lose their wits, eventually.</text>
<text id="220803000">Then there's nothing left to say, except...</text>
<text id="220803010">I am Iron Fist Alexander!</text>
<text id="220803020">The great jar warrior!</text>
<text id="220810000">A finer battle was never witnessed.</text>
<text id="220810010">How do you fancy joining the lads inside, eh?</text>
<text id="220820000">How could this...</text>
<text id="220820010">Was my whole existence... just a crock?</text>
<text id="220900000"> </text>
<text id="220900010"> </text>
<text id="220900020"> </text>
<text id="221001000">...</text>
<text id="223001000">Oi! You there!</text>
<text id="223001010">Could you help us out, cully?</text>
<text id="223001020">You, yeah, you there!</text>
<text id="223001030">Stop pretending you can't see me!</text>
<text id="223001040">Why won't anyone look me in the eye?</text>
<text id="223001050">I-I'm not that ugly, am I?</text>
<text id="223002000">Ow!</text>
<text id="223002010">What'd you go and do that for!</text>
<text id="223003000">Hm? Oh, yes, I remember.</text>
<text id="223003010">Some clod turned me into a tree.</text>
<text id="223003020">You were just breaking the spell, weren't you.</text>
<text id="223003030">Thank you. The name's Boc.</text>
<text id="223003040">I was pushed out of the cave. Told not to come back, not ever.</text>
<text id="223003050">Then I ended up as a tree.</text>
<text id="223003060">Lucky you came along, really.</text>
<text id="223004000">Oh, what a shame.</text>
<text id="223004010">When they threw me out of the cave, they took everything I owned,</text>
<text id="223004020">and so this is all I have to express my thanks.</text>
<text id="223004030">I hope you can forgive me.</text>
<text id="223004040">Or, if you can afford to wait for a while,</text>
<text id="223004050">I could sneak back into the cave, and bring back something of actual value.</text>
<text id="223004060">Then I'd be of some real use to you, I reckon.</text>
<text id="223005000">Right, but I'll need a moment.</text>
<text id="223005010">I-I'm frightened of them... So I have to gather myself.</text>
<text id="223005020">My knees start knockin'...just thinking about that god-awful cave on the shore...</text>
<text id="223010000">Oh, what are you doing here?</text>
<text id="223010010">You must leave this place at once. They'll rush in and beat you to a pulp.</text>
<text id="223010020">You'll end up just like me.</text>
<text id="223011000">Wait, is that what I think it is?</text>
<text id="223011010">You got it back for me? My sewing needle!</text>
<text id="223011020"><sob></text>
<text id="223011030">What made you go and do a thing like that...</text>
<text id="223011040">My mum was a seamstress...</text>
<text id="223011050">...and that sewing kit was all I had to remember her by.</text>
<text id="223011060">I always wanted to be just like sweet old Mum.</text>
<text id="223011070">Then, I suppose I-I can't just curl up and die, can I.</text>
<text id="223012000">Thank you.</text>
<text id="223012010">You're very kind.</text>
<text id="223012020">I always wanted to be a seamster, l-like my mum.</text>
<text id="223012030">Then, I suppose I can't just curl up and die, can I.</text>
<text id="223013000">Oh..</text>
<text id="223013010">It...hurts...</text>
<text id="223013020">Ooh...</text>
<text id="223020000">Good to see you! Master.</text>
<text id="223020010">Do you remember me? Boc, the demi-human.</text>
<text id="223020020">You helped me before, and retrieved my sewing needle.</text>
<text id="223020030">Please, master.</text>
<text id="223020040">Allow me to serve you, as your seamster.</text>
<text id="223020050">I can't make nothing from scratch, but…</text>
<text id="223020060">I'm happy to make adjustments to your garments.</text>
<text id="223021000">Boc the seamster, at your service, Master.</text>
<text id="223021010">Ready to make adjustments to your garments.</text>
<text id="223022000">Oh, going so soon?</text>
<text id="223022010">Please, do be safe on your journeys.</text>
<text id="223023000">Master, I was wondering...</text>
<text id="223023010">Do you ever...make adjustments to your garb yourself?</text>
<text id="223023020">I would, well, rather you let me do the job when possible, please.</text>
<text id="223023030">I don't ask anything in return, you know, and, well...</text>
<text id="223023040">I am your personal seamster, after all!</text>
<text id="223023050">I am your personal seamster, after all!</text>
<text id="223030000">Master, my apologies.</text>
<text id="223030010">Your wardrobe includes the garb of old demigods,</text>
<text id="223030020">and I'm afraid I can't make adjustments to them.</text>
<text id="223030030">My mum told me once.</text>
<text id="223030040">That a royal seamster would do them up in a jiffy.</text>
<text id="223030050">Just wait, master. Before long, I'll be that good, too!</text>
<text id="223031000">Is that a gift for my undeserving self?</text>
<text id="223031010">Thank you kindly. But what on earth could it...</text>
<text id="223031020">Oh!</text>
<text id="223031030">Amazing! I've never seen a golden needle, not in all my life!</text>
<text id="223031040">With a spectacular royal crest, to boot...</text>
<text id="223031050">Are you certain that this is for me?</text>
<text id="223031060">Oh, I can hardly believe it.</text>
<text id="223031070">Have faith in me, Master!</text>
<text id="223031080">I'll polish my craft enough that I deserve this golden gift!</text>
<text id="223031090">I'll be the golden seamster, Boc!</text>
<text id="223031100">Now I'll be able to sew anything, even the threads of the demigods!</text>
<text id="223032000">Do you think that Mum would be pleased if she knew?</text>
<text id="223032010">That I'm as good as any royal seamster, now.</text>
<text id="223032020">Oh, it's still not enough.</text>
<text id="223032030">I need to learn how to sew from scratch, like her.</text>
<text id="223040000">Master, may I ask you something?</text>
<text id="223040010">Would you mind if I called you lord?</text>
<text id="223040020">I heard that you and the other Tarnished seek the throne of the Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="223040030">Well, I know that you will be the one,</text>
<text id="223040040">and you'd make just the manner of kind-hearted lord that I'd wish for.</text>
<text id="223040050">So, please, if you would.</text>
<text id="223040060">Allow me to call you lord.</text>
<text id="223041000">You don't say! Thank you, thank you!</text>
<text id="223041010">M'lord, m'lord, m'lord!</text>
<text id="223041020">Please, become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="223041030">And please, let I, Boc the seamster, remain at your side.</text>
<text id="223042000">No, and why would you...</text>
<text id="223042010">Forgive me, for overstepping my bounds. I didn't mean it.</text>
<text id="223043000">Boc the seamster, at your service, m'lord.</text>
<text id="223043010">Ready to make adjustments to your garments.</text>
<text id="223044000">Going already, m'lord?</text>
<text id="223044010">Please, do be safe on your journeys.</text>
<text id="223045000">Master, did you see it?</text>
<text id="223045010">Th-the Erdtree?</text>
<text id="223045020">I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...</text>
<text id="223045030">But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.</text>
<text id="223045040">The Erdtree is waiting for you, master.</text>
<text id="223045050">I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.</text>
<text id="223046000">M'lord, did you see it?</text>
<text id="223046010">Th-the Erdtree?</text>
<text id="223046020">I, oh, I don't really have the words for this...</text>
<text id="223046030">But I was so...so dazzled, I felt something stir, in my breast.</text>
<text id="223046040">The Erdtree is waiting for you, m'lord.</text>
<text id="223046050">I know it, I do. I feel it in my bones.</text>
<text id="223046060">O please, take the throne of Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="223050000">M'lord... Have you ever wished you might be born again?</text>
<text id="223050010">Well, they say that Rennala of Raya Lucaria</text>
<text id="223050020">has the power to help people be reborn.</text>
<text id="223050030">Oh? Me? Reborn?</text>
<text id="223050040">Oh, look at me. When you're this ugly...</text>
<text id="223050050">well, being reborn? It would hardly make a difference, I'm afraid.</text>
<text id="223051000">M'lord, what's this?</text>
<text id="223051010">Oh! Oh!</text>
<text id="223051020">It can't be… For my rebirth?</text>
<text id="223051030">But these are precious, are you certain that it's for me?</text>
<text id="223051040">Oh...</text>
<text id="223051050">M'lord, how did you know?</text>
<text id="223051060">It was my only wish, that I might honour you with a decent appearance.</text>
<text id="223052000">M'lord, it shouldn't take me long.</text>
<text id="223052010">I'm off to see Rennala of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="223052020">I'll be reborn, fresh and new.</text>
<text id="223053000">M'lord.</text>
<text id="223053010">In all honesty, what do you think of me?</text>
<text id="223053020">Am I fit to serve a lord such as you, in all my ugliness?</text>
<text id="223053030">Must I be reborn, no matter what ill fate awaits me?</text>
<text id="223053040">Oh, I'm such a fool.</text>
<text id="223053050">I don't even have answers to the simplest of questions.</text>
<text id="223054000">Master... Have you ever wished you might be born again?</text>
<text id="223055000">Master, what's this?</text>
<text id="223055050">Master, how did you know?</text>
<text id="223056000">Master, it shouldn't take me long.</text>
<text id="223057000">Master.</text>
<text id="223057020">Am I fit to serve you, master, in all my ugliness?</text>
<text id="223060000">Did I just hear my mum speaking?</text>
<text id="223060010">Thank you very much.</text>
<text id="223060020">Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.</text>
<text id="223060030">And now, my dear lord let me hear her voice.</text>
<text id="223060040">Please, if I may dream, just once...</text>
<text id="223060050">Do you feel the same way my mum did, m'lord?</text>
<text id="223060060">Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?</text>
<text id="223061000"><sob></text>
<text id="223061010">M'lord, my dear lord...</text>
<text id="223061020">I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.</text>
<text id="223061030">May the throne of Elden Lord be yours.</text>
<text id="223062000">No, why on earth would you...</text>
<text id="223062010">It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.</text>
<text id="223062020">But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.</text>
<text id="223062030">One day, I'll look every bit the servant.</text>
<text id="223065000">Did I just hear my mum speaking?</text>
<text id="223065010">Thank you very much.</text>
<text id="223065020">Mum was always the only one who said I was beautiful.</text>
<text id="223065030">And now, my kind master let me hear her voice.</text>
<text id="223065040">Please, if I may dream, just once...</text>
<text id="223065050">Do you feel the same way my mum did, master?</text>
<text id="223065060">Do you think I'm beautiful, despite these looks?</text>
<text id="223066000"><sob></text>
<text id="223066010">Master, kind master...</text>
<text id="223066020">I, Boc the seamster, am forever in your service.</text>
<text id="223067000">No, why on earth would you...</text>
<text id="223067010">It was silly of me to ask. Please, forget that I did.</text>
<text id="223067020">But I beg, don't renounce me for my appearance.</text>
<text id="223067030">One day, I'll look every bit the servant.</text>
<text id="223100000">S-surely, not? For me?!</text>
<text id="223100010">Oh no, I can't. It would be wasted on the likes of me.</text>
<text id="223100020">You should drink it yourself, master.</text>
<text id="223100030">I would be far happier knowing you enjoyed it yourself.</text>
<text id="223101000">S-surely, not? For me?!</text>
<text id="223101010">Oh no, I can't. It would be wasted on the likes of me.</text>
<text id="223101020">You should drink it yourself, m'lord.</text>
<text id="223101030">I would be far happier knowing you enjoyed it yourself.</text>
<text id="223102000">Master...</text>
<text id="223102010">O-oh...</text>
<text id="223102020">My most earnest thanks.</text>
<text id="223102030">I don't deserve it, but I'll savour every last drop.</text>
<text id="223103000">M'lord...</text>
<text id="223103010">O-oh...</text>
<text id="223103020">My most earnest thanks.</text>
<text id="223103030">I don't deserve it, but I'll savour every last drop.</text>
<text id="223104000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="223110000">...</text>
<text id="223800000">Ow!</text>
<text id="223800010">Why'd you go and do that?</text>
<text id="223800020">It's because I'm ugly, isn't it?</text>
<text id="223801000">Oh, now, you too, is it?</text>
<text id="223801010">The story of my rotten life...</text>
<text id="223801020">Ah...aaah!</text>
<text id="223802000">No...</text>

<text id="223803000">Mum...</text>
<text id="223803010">I've... I've let you down...</text>
<text id="223810000">Ow!</text>
<text id="223810010">M-master?</text>
<text id="223810020">Is something wrong?</text>
<text id="223810030">It's me! Boc, the seamster!</text>
<text id="223811000">Master, what's happened...</text>
<text id="223811010">Did I do something wrong?</text>
<text id="223811020">Or is it just...because I'm ugly?</text>
<text id="223812000">Oh, my...</text>
<text id="223812010">Master, is that the truth, your heart of hearts? My, oh my...</text>
<text id="223812020">Ah...aaah!</text>
<text id="223813000">Oh, master, what have I done...</text>
<text id="223813010">Master! Master!</text>
<text id="223814000">Master...</text>
<text id="223814010">I've failed you...please, forgive me.</text>
<text id="223820000">Ow!</text>
<text id="223820010">M-m'lord?</text>
<text id="223820020">Is something wrong?</text>
<text id="223820030">It's me! Boc, the seamster!</text>
<text id="223821000">M'lord, what's happened...</text>
<text id="223821010">Did I do something wrong?</text>

<text id="223824000">M'lord...</text>
<text id="223824010">I've failed you...please, forgive me.</text>
<text id="223900000"> </text>
<text id="223900010"> </text>
<text id="223900020"> </text>
<text id="223910000"> </text>
<text id="223910010"> </text>
<text id="223910020"> </text>
<text id="223920000"> </text>
<text id="223920010"> </text>
<text id="223920020"> </text>
<text id="224001000">Well, look at you. We don't receive many visitors.</text>
<text id="224001010">I presume you are a Tarnished. What brings you here?</text>
<text id="224010000">Oh, pardon me. It's hardly my place to ask, is it.</text>
<text id="224010010">I am Iji. A blacksmith who once served the Carian royals…</text>
<text id="224010020">An old codger who refuses to retire his rusty hammer.</text>
<text id="224010030">So, here I am, still quietly plying my trade, on this spot.</text>
<text id="224010040">Perhaps you'd like a display? These bones are old, but still able.</text>
<text id="224011000">Well, it's kind of you to speak to me again.</text>
<text id="224011010">Then I presume these old bones served their purpose, more or less?</text>
<text id="224012000">Brave Tarnished. Here to put my old bones to work again?</text>
<text id="224013000">Brave Tarnished. A word of warning, if you please.</text>
<text id="224013010">This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point.</text>
<text id="224013020">When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract.</text>
<text id="224013030">After leveling it, they carried on to the manor.</text>
<text id="224013040">The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...</text>
<text id="224013050">By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.</text>
<text id="224013060">That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor.</text>
<text id="224013070">Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo.</text>
<text id="224014000">Oh, watch out, there.</text>
<text id="224014010">When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else.</text>
<text id="224014020">If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm.</text>
<text id="224014030">I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, Tarnished.</text>
<text id="224014040">You don't know how hard it is not to break anything while I work.</text>
<text id="224015000">Something else for you?</text>
<text id="224016000">I've explained the peril.</text>
<text id="224016010">Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor.</text>
<text id="224016020">Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap.</text>
<text id="224017000">Blaidd actually did that, did he?</text>
<text id="224017010">Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he.</text>
<text id="224017020">Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you.</text>
<text id="224017030">At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd,</text>
<text id="224017040">I've a few more things that might suit you.</text>
<text id="224017050">I've something else that might suit you.</text>
<text id="224020000">Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.</text>
<text id="224020040">Again, I am Iji.</text>
<text id="224020050">The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.</text>
<text id="224020060">I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.</text>
<text id="224020070">I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.</text>
<text id="224023020">The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.</text>
<text id="224023030">I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.</text>
<text id="224023040">I will give you whatever guidance I can. And pray, for your success.</text>
<text id="224024000">Oh, then you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.</text>
<text id="224024010">The pleasure is mine. I am Iji.</text>
<text id="224030000">I take it you've heard of the Eternal City of Nokstella?</text>
<text id="224030010">Well, it has a twin, known as Nokron. The other Eternal City.</text>
<text id="224030020">After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron.</text>
<text id="224030030">By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above.</text>
<text id="224030040">Only, we've failed to find a path leading to the city.</text>
<text id="224030050">Blaidd's made a good go of it, but I'm afraid this has him quite stumped.</text>
<text id="224030060">To be honest, I'm not sure where to go from here...</text>
<text id="224031000">Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother.</text>
<text id="224031010">Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood.</text>
<text id="224031020">They were always happy to have me tag along, as well.</text>
<text id="224031030">When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean,</text>
<text id="224031040">Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals,</text>
<text id="224031050">but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together.</text>
<text id="224031060">Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you?</text>
<text id="224031070">The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you.</text>
<text id="224032000">Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.</text>
<text id="224032010">Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.</text>
<text id="224032020">An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.</text>
<text id="224032030">No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival.</text>
<text id="224032040">Oh, no, wait...</text>
<text id="224032050">How did I not see it before!</text>
<text id="224032060">I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight!</text>
<text id="224032070">Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars.</text>
<text id="224032080">As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line.</text>
<text id="224032090">But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars.</text>
<text id="224032100">Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory.</text>
<text id="224032110">And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.</text>
<text id="224032120">As would Lady Ranni's destiny.</text>
<text id="224032130">Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron.</text>
<text id="224033000">My apologies for the misleading words of warning.</text>
<text id="224033010">I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate.</text>
<text id="224033020">I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not.</text>
<text id="224033030">Do forgive me, my fellow.</text>
<text id="224033040">Let us give all that we can of ourselves.</text>
<text id="224033050">Together, for Lady Ranni.</text>
<text id="224034000">Let us give all that we can of ourselves.</text>
<text id="224034010">Together, for Lady Ranni.</text>
<text id="224035000">Let us give all that we can of ourselves.</text>
<text id="224035010">Together, for Lady Ranni.</text>
<text id="224036000">Well, my fellow. How may I serve you?</text>
<text id="224036010">As war counsellor, or as blacksmith?</text>
<text id="224037000">Greetings, my fellow. How can I help?</text>
<text id="224038000">Something else for you?</text>
<text id="224039000">Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds.</text>
<text id="224039010">Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.</text>
<text id="224039020">Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron.</text>
<text id="224040000">Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything.</text>
<text id="224040010">You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.</text>
<text id="224040020">The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all.</text>
<text id="224040030">There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character.</text>
<text id="224040040">Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.</text>
<text id="224040050">Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.</text>
<text id="224040060">And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.</text>
<text id="224041000">Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you.</text>
<text id="224041010">Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron.</text>
<text id="224041020">Blaidd has been given an important task.</text>
<text id="224041030">Apparently, a matter of great urgency.</text>
<text id="224042000">You need not await Blaidd.</text>
<text id="224042010">Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave.</text>
<text id="224042020">And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.</text>
<text id="224042030">So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.</text>
<text id="224050000">Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated...</text>
<text id="224050010">Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled.</text>
<text id="224050020">Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role.</text>
<text id="224050030">Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made.</text>
<text id="224050040">With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality...</text>
<text id="224050050">Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed...</text>
<text id="224051000">Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.</text>
<text id="224051010">Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.</text>
<text id="224051020">An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.</text>
<text id="224051030">It's funny how things happen.</text>
<text id="224051040">Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate.</text>
<text id="224051050">I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...</text>
<text id="224060000">I presume you've spoken with Blaidd?</text>
<text id="224060010">Very well. There is something you should know.</text>
<text id="224060020">The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery.</text>
<text id="224060030">But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers,</text>
<text id="224060040">the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse.</text>
<text id="224060050">But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight.</text>
<text id="224060060">It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake.</text>
<text id="224070000">Unthinkable, how could Blaidd...</text>
<text id="224070010">How did he break free from his cell?</text>
<text id="224070020">No, more importantly...</text>
<text id="224070030">Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her.</text>
<text id="224070040">I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...</text>
<text id="224070050">I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd.</text>
<text id="224070060">When I do, I only hope you'll accept my apology.</text>
<text id="224100000">Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.</text>
<text id="224100010">You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.</text>
<text id="224100020">A grand reward, justly procured by any measure.</text>
<text id="224100030">Again, I am Iji.</text>
<text id="224100040">The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.</text>
<text id="224100050">I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.</text>
<text id="224101000">Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.</text>
<text id="224101010">Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.</text>
<text id="224101020">And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.</text>
<text id="224101030">So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean.</text>
<text id="224102000">Oh, so you must be the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.</text>
<text id="224102010">You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.</text>
<text id="224102020">A grand reward, justly procured by any measure.</text>
<text id="224102030">The pleasure is mine. I am Iji.</text>
<text id="224102040">The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.</text>
<text id="224102050">I welcome one of your calibre. A fellow champion in service of Lady Ranni.</text>
<text id="224150000">Oh, there you are. Good of you to drop by.</text>
<text id="224150010">Have you heard? Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.</text>
<text id="224150020">Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it.</text>
<text id="224150030">It would not have been possible without you.</text>
<text id="224150040">As Lady Ranni's war counsellor, and moreover, her childhood warden, I express my deepest gratitude.</text>
<text id="224150050">You, and only you, were Lady Ranni's true champion.</text>
<text id="224151000">My purpose is nearing its end.</text>
<text id="224151010">I've served Lady Ranni for as long as I can remember...</text>
<text id="224151020">It has been a long and wondrous journey.</text>
<text id="224151030">Now Lady Ranni is in your hands.</text>
<text id="224151040">I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.</text>
<text id="224152000">Well, what's this?</text>
<text id="224152010">Are you certain? This is a fine reserve.</text>
<text id="224152020">Perhaps you knew that Old Iji appreciates a good drink.</text>
<text id="224152030">I'll save it for a quiet moment, that I might truly savour it.</text>
<text id="224153000">Lady Ranni has departed on her journey.</text>
<text id="224153010">Along the dark path of the Empyrean, from Renna's Rise, as she calls it.</text>
<text id="224153020">Now Lady Ranni is in your hands.</text>
<text id="224153030">I pray that you serve her well, unto the very end.</text>
<text id="224154000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="224800000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="224801000">Enough of that, Tarnished.</text>
<text id="224801010">There is no fight without a foe.</text>
<text id="224802000">If that's the cloth you're cut from,</text>
<text id="224802010">don't ever show your face again.</text>
<text id="224802020">Not to me. And not to my liege.</text>
<text id="224802030">...</text>
<text id="224803000">Not to me. And not to my liege.</text>
<text id="224803010">...</text>
<text id="224804000">How could I have missed this...</text>
<text id="224804010">I have failed you...</text>
<text id="224804020">Lady... Ranni...</text>
<text id="224810000">Agh.</text>
<text id="224811000">Cease this treachery at once.</text>
<text id="224811010">Lady Ranni will be devastated.</text>
<text id="224812000">This is a true shame.</text>
<text id="224812010">Don't ever show your face again.</text>
<text id="224812020">Not to me. And not to my liege.</text>
<text id="224812030">...</text>
<text id="224813000">...</text>
<text id="224813010">Lady Ranni has seen enough.</text>
<text id="224814000">Go as you must, Lady Ranni...</text>
<text id="224814010">Along the path of darkness...</text>
<text id="224910000"> </text>

<text id="226002000">Gosh, truly? That's wonderful news!</text>

<text id="226004070">The flowers we have now are nice, but it's a bit boring having the same ones all the time.</text>
<text id="226004080">I think everyone would be glad of a change, actually...</text>

<text id="226010040">can you put them in the big vase in the middle of the village?</text>

<text id="226020020">Such pretty flowers are blooming! Everyone's so happy.</text>
<text id="226020030">I've never seen anything like it! I'd love to see more flowers from the outside, someday. Loads more!</text>
<text id="226021000">Oh, hallo again, coz.</text>
<text id="226021001">Oh, hallo again, coz.</text>
<text id="226021010">You put seeds in the big vase, didn't you?</text>
<text id="226021020">But...I don't really like those flowers.</text>
<text id="226021030">I'm sorry coz, I know you brought the seeds from all that way away...</text>
<text id="226021031">I'm sorry coz, I know you brought the seeds from all that way away...</text>
<text id="226021040">But I'm a jar, and you're not. I s'pose we just see things differently.</text>
<text id="226021041">But I'm a jar, and you're not. I s'pose we just see things differently.</text>
<text id="226030000">Ah, hallo again.</text>
<text id="226030010">Say, coz. Have you met Uncle Alexander?</text>
<text id="226030011">Say, coz. Have you met Uncle Alexander?</text>
<text id="226030020">He used to live here with us, but then he left, to be a champion.</text>
<text id="226030030">I asked to go with him, but he said "The path of champions must be trod alone".</text>
<text id="226030040">So heroic, right? I miss him though.</text>
<text id="226030050">If you see him, you should ask him to teach you how to fight, coz.</text>
<text id="226030051">If you see him, you should ask him to teach you how to fight, coz.</text>
<text id="226030060">He's big and tough and strong!</text>
<text id="226031000">Uncle Alexander said he won't be back again.</text>
<text id="226031010">"My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country."</text>
<text id="226031020">I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it.</text>
<text id="226031030">So...please don't tell anyone, coz, but...</text>
<text id="226031031">So...please don't tell anyone, coz, but...</text>
<text id="226031040">I'm actually a warrior jar as well! One day, I'll be just like Uncle Alexander.</text>
<text id="226031050">And I'll have to leave the village to become a champion.</text>
<text id="226032000">Uncle Alexander won't come back here again.</text>
<text id="226032010">"My home is of the past. And the past, as they say, is a different country."</text>
<text id="226032020">I suppose that's part of being a warrior, isn't it.</text>
<text id="226040000">Ah, hallo again.</text>
<text id="226040010">Do you know what a poacher is, coz?</text>
<text id="226040011">Do you know what a poacher is, coz?</text>
<text id="226040020">They hunt us, smash us, and then take us away.</text>
<text id="226040030">This village is kept secret, so I think we're safe here.</text>
<text id="226040040">But you should be careful if you ever meet one of them, coz.</text>
<text id="226040041">But you should be careful if you ever meet one of them, coz.</text>
<text id="226040050">I hope uncle Alexander beats them all up, first...</text>

<text id="226050001">Oh, hallo again, coz.</text>
<text id="226050010">Have you heard? A new Potentate's come to the village!</text>
<text id="226050020">I think he said his name was Diallos.</text>
<text id="226050030">He seems a little down in the dumps, but his hands! As smooth as silk!</text>
<text id="226051000">I don't know, I'm a little disappointed actually.</text>
<text id="226051010">Even though good sir Diallos has a wonderful suit of armour...</text>
<text id="226051020">He says he isn't a warrior.</text>
<text id="226051030">And since he's a coward, he won't be fighting anymore.</text>
<text id="226051040">His smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us.</text>
<text id="226051050">But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you.</text>
<text id="226051051">But I wish we had a potentate big and strong like you.</text>
<text id="226052000">Diallos' smooth and silky hands feel nice when he pats us...</text>

<text id="226060010">I'm glad you came.</text>
<text id="226060020">But we're fine now. Diallos fought the poacher.</text>
<text id="226060030">Though quite a lot of us got broken...</text>
<text id="226060040">...</text>
<text id="226060050">I won't cry though... I'm a warrior jar. A warrior.</text>

<text id="226071060">I can really have them, right?</text>
<text id="226071070">I understand. I'll get strong.</text>
<text id="226071080">Strong enough I deserve to have Uncle's insides.</text>
<text id="226072000">I'm about to go on a journey.</text>

<text id="226900100"> </text>
<text id="226900200"> </text>
<text id="227001000">Sister... Where did you go?</text>
<text id="227001010">You promised me. When we turned 14, we'd go to see the stars...</text>
<text id="227001020">I've been waiting ever so long. Forever and ever, it seems.</text>
<text id="227002000">Ahh, dear sister, you're finally here.</text>
<text id="227002010">No time to waste. Let's see the stars.</text>
<text id="228001000">Foul Tarnished, what do you want?</text>
<text id="228001010">I told the all-hearing brute.</text>
<text id="228001020">That I possess no such medallion.</text>
<text id="228001030">Or have you come to take more from me?</text>
<text id="228001040">Was my other half not enough?</text>
<text id="228001050">I told the bastard in the bone armour.</text>
<text id="228002000">I told the all-hearing brute already.</text>
<text id="228002010">That I possess no such medallion.</text>
<text id="228002020">Or have you come to take more from me?</text>
<text id="228002030">Was my other half not enough?</text>
<text id="228002040">I told the bastard in bone armour already.</text>
<text id="228010000">Oh...do you speak true?</text>
<text id="228010010">So old Albus entrusted his medallion to you.</text>
<text id="228010020">...</text>
<text id="228010030">Then I've no choice. But to trust that this was his dying will.</text>
<text id="228010040">Let's try again. I'm Latenna. An Albinauric, the same as Old Albus.</text>
<text id="228010050">My apologies for my coarse words earlier.</text>
<text id="228010060">I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like that all-hearing brute.</text>
<text id="228010070">I hope that you will forgive me.</text>
<text id="228010080">I presumed the worst, seeing that you were another Tarnished, like the bastard before.</text>
<text id="228011000">Mm, the medallion is better off in your hands, anyway.</text>
<text id="228011010">Would you consider doing me a great service?</text>
<text id="228011020">I must go back.</text>
<text id="228011030">There is something that I must do, even if I must say farewell to my wolf, Lobo.</text>
<text id="228011040">Will you show me the way? To the land of Miquella's Haligtree.</text>
<text id="228011050">If you accept, I would gladly apprise you.</text>
<text id="228011060">Of the whereabouts of the medallion's other half.</text>
<text id="228012000">Thank you kindly.</text>
<text id="228012010">They say the other half of the medallion is beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="228012020">In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.</text>
<text id="228013000">Then I suppose it's time.</text>
<text id="228013010">Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.</text>
<text id="228013020">I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.</text>
<text id="228013030">Forgive me, Lobo.</text>
<text id="228013040">...</text>
<text id="228014000">Call upon me when needed.</text>
<text id="228014010">And I will fight at your side.</text>
<text id="228015000">Well...</text>
<text id="228015010">I understand. You must have your own duty to fulfil.</text>
<text id="228015020">But please, allow me to say my piece.</text>
<text id="228015030">Even if you cannot take me, old Albus wished I relay to you the following:</text>
<text id="228015040">The other half of the medallion can be found beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="228015050">In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.</text>
<text id="228016000">If you seek the other half of the medallion, they say it's beyond the forbidden lands north of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="228016010">In Castle Sol, on the Mountaintops of the Giants, accessible by the Grand Lift of Rold.</text>
<text id="228017000">My thanks...</text>
<text id="228017010">You'll lead me then, to the land of Miquella's Haligtree.</text>
<text id="228017020">Farewell, Lobo. My faithful wolf, my better half.</text>
<text id="228017030">I will go with the Tarnished. So that our journey will not have been in vain.</text>
<text id="228017040">Forgive me, Lobo.</text>
<text id="228017050">...</text>
<text id="228018000">Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.</text>
<text id="228018010">We're almost there. Castle Sol lies just off to the north,</text>
<text id="228018020">where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.</text>
<text id="228019000">Castle Sol lies just off to the north,</text>
<text id="228019010">where the other medallion is housed. It will grant passage to the land of the Haligtree.</text>
<text id="228020000">Oh young yet towering sister of ours.</text>
<text id="228020010">Let the birthing droplet in.</text>
<text id="228020020">And create life. For us. For all the Albinaurics.</text>
<text id="228021000">Thank you.</text>
<text id="228021010">I've finally fulfilled my purpose.</text>
<text id="228021020">Our young yet towering sister will give us hope.</text>
<text id="228021030">Now that nothing is left unfinished,</text>
<text id="228021040">I will join you in battle to the bitter end.</text>
<text id="228021050">And when the fighting is done,</text>
<text id="228021060">then you may lay me to rest. Beside Lobo, my dear wolf.</text>
<text id="228021070">...</text>
<text id="228030000">Do you hear me? It is I, Latenna.</text>
<text id="228030010">We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree, where Lobo and I began our travels.</text>
<text id="228030020">It's entirely thanks to you that I'm so close to home.</text>
<text id="228030030">These great snow-laden lands stretch far to the north.</text>
<text id="228030040">And beyond the ancient bowers, and the liturgical town of Ordina,</text>
<text id="228030050">lies the place to which I must return.</text>
<text id="228031000">We have reached the land of Miquella's Haligtree.</text>

<text id="228801000">Stop, now.</text>
<text id="228801010">And I'll consider that a simple mishap.</text>
<text id="228802000">Are all you Tarnished the same?</text>
<text id="228802010">Was taking my other half not enough for you?</text>
<text id="228803000">There is no meaning in a fight, lest it serve a greater duty.</text>
<text id="228804000">Ohh...Phillia</text>
<text id="228804010">Take...the birthing...droplet...</text>
<text id="228900000"> </text>
<text id="228900010"> </text>
<text id="228900020"> </text>
<text id="300001000">Brave Tarnished, welcome to the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="300001010">I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house.</text>
<text id="300001020">Rya spoke well of you.</text>
<text id="300001030">"A warrior of promise," I believe she said.</text>
<text id="300001040">Perhaps you are prepared to make a commitment.</text>
<text id="300001050">Will you join us here at the Volcano Manor, and resist the tide?</text>
<text id="300001060">Why accept the burden of their grace, or be fooled by the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?</text>
<text id="300001070">Rise with us, against the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="300002000">Interesting. Your decision is most welcome.</text>
<text id="300002010">Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.</text>
<text id="300002020">The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.</text>
<text id="300002030">But be sure to earn your keep.</text>
<text id="300003000">Well. That is unfortunate.</text>
<text id="300003010">Rya will be disappointed, but I won't twist your arm.</text>
<text id="300003020">Now, time for you to leave, I should think.</text>
<text id="300003030">Let this intersection of our paths be the last.</text>
<text id="300004000">Aren't you precocious.</text>
<text id="300004010">We rarely receive visitors to the Volcano Manor without invitation.</text>
<text id="300004020">Fascinating. And not unlike another guest we had long ago…</text>
<text id="300004030">So, Tarnished, have you ever harboured doubts?</text>
<text id="300004040">About the burden of grace, and the dogmatic ramblings of the Fingers?</text>
<text id="300004050">If you have, why not join the Volcano Manor, and fight with us?</text>
<text id="300004060">Rise with us, against the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="300005000">Your decision is most welcome.</text>
<text id="300005010">Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.</text>
<text id="300005020">The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.</text>
<text id="300005030">I am Tanith, the proprietress of this house. An honour to have you.</text>
<text id="300006000">Well. That is unfortunate.</text>
<text id="300006010">Now, time for you to leave, I should think.</text>
<text id="300006020">Let this intersection of our paths be the last.</text>
<text id="300007000">Did you read the letter left for you?</text>
<text id="300007010">That is the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.</text>
<text id="300007020">You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.</text>
<text id="300007030">If you are loath to hunt your own kin, so be it.</text>
<text id="300007040">But you must leave this house at once.</text>
<text id="300007050">This is a war against the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="300007060">We have no place for the meek, nor the luxury of keeping clean hands.</text>
<text id="300008000">What's this?</text>
<text id="300008010">Have you reconsidered the prospect?</text>
<text id="300008020">Of rising with us, against the Erdtree?</text>
<text id="300009000">Very well.</text>
<text id="300009010">Your decision is most welcome.</text>
<text id="300009020">Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.</text>
<text id="300009030">The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.</text>
<text id="300010000">You've completed your task.</text>
<text id="300010010">I am pleased. Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="300010020">This is your reward, as promised.</text>
<text id="300010030">Never forget. That the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion.</text>
<text id="300010040">The way is tainted, but for this very reason,</text>
<text id="300010050">it is the true path to valour.</text>
<text id="300012000">I see you've performed another task for us.</text>
<text id="300012010">Here is your usual reward. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="300012020">Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you.</text>
<text id="300012030">Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard.</text>
<text id="300012040">The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace.</text>
<text id="300012050">But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task.</text>
<text id="300012060">The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs.</text>
<text id="300012070">Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering.</text>
<text id="300012080">Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.</text>
<text id="300012090">If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so,</text>
<text id="300012100">then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.</text>
<text id="300012110">We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done.</text>
<text id="300012120">If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.</text>
<text id="300012130">The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle.</text>
<text id="300012140">It cannot come a day too soon!</text>
<text id="300013000">The letter describes the task the Volcano Manor desires you enact.</text>
<text id="300013010">You will be compensated once the deed is done. Good luck.</text>
<text id="300014000">If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.</text>
<text id="300014010">It cannot come a day too soon!</text>
<text id="300021000">She said that, to you?</text>
<text id="300021010">I should have known something was wrong. The signs were clear enough.</text>
<text id="300021020">Well. Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.</text>
<text id="300021030">That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.</text>
<text id="300021040">Think about it. We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself.</text>
<text id="300021050">What matters one's lineage in such a crisis?</text>
<text id="300022000">No, I haven't seen Zorayas anywhere.</text>
<text id="300022010">And she has no scouting duties now.</text>
<text id="300022020">Has she gone off in search of answers?</text>
<text id="300022030">Why won't she just listen...</text>
<text id="300023000">May I ask your aid?</text>
<text id="300023010">Not as the Manor's proprietress, but as Zorayas' mother.</text>
<text id="300023020">If she discovers the answer to her question, and it causes distress,</text>
<text id="300023030">have her drink this potion.</text>
<text id="300023040">To purge that which would cause her pain.</text>
<text id="300024000">Yes, I know.</text>
<text id="300024010">My wish is a grave disrespect to her.</text>
<text id="300024020">No different than the Erdtree's imposition.</text>
<text id="300024030">But I've no choice... It must be done.</text>
<text id="300025000">Thank you, for allowing me this.</text>
<text id="300025010">I will never be a good mother. My heart is too frail.</text>
<text id="300025020">Our Lord must have known this all along.</text>
<text id="300025030">My meekness is all too clear...</text>
<text id="300026000">Really, she is dead, then...</text>
<text id="300026010">My gratitude for your forthrightness.</text>
<text id="300026020">If you would...allow me some time alone.</text>
<text id="300029000">Please, allow me some time alone.</text>
<text id="300030000">I see that you've stayed the path of champions.</text>
<text id="300030010">This is your usual reward. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="300030020">Perhaps you are ready. Might you see our Lord?</text>
<text id="300030030">Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.</text>
<text id="300031000">Yes, as it should be.</text>
<text id="300031010">Now, close your eyes for a moment.</text>
<text id="300031020">I will transport you to the Lord's chamber.</text>
<text id="300031030">Farewell, then.</text>
<text id="300031040">May your visit be fruitful.</text>
<text id="300032000">I see... Well, I cannot make you take the leap.</text>
<text id="300032010">But do know this.</text>
<text id="300032020">To follow the path of valour, an audience with our Lord is essential.</text>
<text id="300032030">In order to defy this debasement, and rise up against the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="300032040">Like a true recusant of the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="300033000">Won't you consider having an audience with our Lord?</text>
<text id="300033010">Our Lord will no doubt welcome you. Another kindred spirit, treading the path of champions.</text>
<text id="300040000">You...</text>
<text id="300040010">It's true then. You've defeated our Lord.</text>
<text id="300040020">No, I must thank you. Our Lord was yet weak. You have taught us that.</text>
<text id="300040030">Defeat is not the end. Our Lord is immortal, and will one day rise again, stronger.</text>
<text id="300040040">Until then, I must stay the path, and do my part.</text>
<text id="300041000">I will leave the Volcano Manor before long.</text>
<text id="300041010">I suggest you do the same.</text>
<text id="300041020">Here is my thanks. For allowing our Lord to be revived, even stronger than before.</text>
<text id="300041030">I will miss these encounters.</text>
<text id="300041040">The champion who walks the tainted path shines all the more.</text>
<text id="300041050">I always was an admirer.</text>
<text id="300050000">Oh, you...</text>
<text id="300050010">Allow me some time.</text>
<text id="300050020">Our Lord's carcass is vast, and not easily consumed.</text>
<text id="300050030">Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,</text>
<text id="300050040">I wish to be your serpent; your family.</text>
<text id="300050050">One day, let us devour the gods together.</text>
<text id="300051000">Dear Rykard, please find purchase within me,</text>
<text id="300051010">I wish to be your serpent; your family.</text>
<text id="300051020">One day, let us devour the gods together.</text>
<text id="300076000">Now, time for you to leave, I should think.</text>
<text id="300076010">Let this intersection of our paths be the last.</text>
<text id="300077000">The drawing room is through the hall.</text>
<text id="300077010">Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable.</text>
<text id="300078000">What's this?</text>
<text id="300078010">Have you reconsidered the prospect?</text>
<text id="300078020">Of rising with us, against the Erdtree?</text>
<text id="300079000">Very well.</text>
<text id="300079010">Your decision is most welcome.</text>
<text id="300079020">Now you belong to the Volcano Manor family.</text>
<text id="300079030">The drawing room lies down the hall. Make yourself comfortable.</text>
<text id="300080000">Now, time for you to leave, I should think.</text>
<text id="300080010">Let this intersection of our paths be the last.</text>
<text id="300081000">The drawing room is through the hall.</text>
<text id="300081010">Use the key I handed you, and make yourself comfortable.</text>
<text id="300082000">Now you are a recusant true, and a full-fledged member of the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="300082010">I am pleased to have you on our side.</text>
<text id="300110000">Did you see her?</text>
<text id="300110010">The girl, Rya…with her true face.</text>
<text id="300110020">...</text>
<text id="300110030">Well, if she confided in you the name Zorayas,</text>
<text id="300110040">then perhaps it is not my place to speak.</text>
<text id="300110050">But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you.</text>
<text id="300110060">Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.</text>
<text id="300110070">Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.</text>
<text id="300110080">…Honestly, I hardly deserve the sweet child.</text>
<text id="300111000">Please, be kind to her. Look after young Zorayas.</text>
<text id="300111010">Her true visage belies the purity of her heart.</text>
<text id="300112000">Zorayas has placed her trust in you. All the more reason I must tell you.</text>
<text id="300112010">That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.</text>
<text id="300113000">My wish is a grave disrespect to her.</text>
<text id="300113010">But I've no choice... It must be done.</text>
<text id="300114000">Sweet Zorayas, have I earned your scorn?</text>
<text id="300200000">This is farewell.</text>
<text id="300200010">Perhaps we will meet again, along the path.</text>
<text id="300201000">What is it?</text>
<text id="300201010">I have no need of that.</text>
<text id="300201020">I must continue devouring my beloved lord...</text>
<text id="300202000">Oh, you...</text>
<text id="300202010">Allow me some time.</text>
<text id="300202020">Our lord's carcass is not easily consumed.</text>
<text id="300800000"> </text>
<text id="300800010"> </text>
<text id="300801000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="300801010">Ahh, my lord...</text>
<text id="300801020">Rykard...</text>
<text id="300900000">Oh, Rykard…</text>
<text id="300900010">Let me be your serpent…</text>
<text id="301001000">Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?</text>
<text id="301001010">Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?</text>
<text id="301001020">Of course you have. No shame in it.</text>
<text id="301001030">But I'm afraid you're plumb out of luck.</text>
<text id="301001040">You are maidenless. A bit player, fully divorced from the strength of runes.</text>
<text id="301001050">Feel free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere.</text>
<text id="301002000">Oh, can't seem to wrap your head around your predicament?</text>
<text id="301002010">It's no surprise. You poor have-nots are a stubborn lot.</text>
<text id="301002020">Fine, then.</text>
<text id="301002030">If you must have a go at it, maidenless as you are, you'll require an education.</text>
<text id="301002040">On the ways of the learned Tarnished.</text>
<text id="301002050">Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.</text>
<text id="301002060">You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.</text>
<text id="301002070">That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.</text>
<text id="301002080">It's nothing short of a miracle. That the guidance of grace can lead you,</text>
<text id="301002090">maidenless as you are, to the perfect place to die in obscurity.</text>
<text id="301003000">What's the matter?</text>
<text id="301003010">Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such?</text>
<text id="301003020">Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace.</text>
<text id="301003030">To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff.</text>
<text id="301003040">And if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,</text>
<text id="301003050">you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold…</text>
<text id="301004000">Guidance will show the way, most certainly.</text>
<text id="301004010">To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.</text>
<text id="301004020">The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.</text>
<text id="301004030">Although I'm afraid you'll never make it that far, hmm.</text>
<text id="301004040">Rest assured, I sympathise, deeply. There's no worse fate than to be maidenless.</text>
<text id="301004050">Oh, but if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,</text>
<text id="301004060">you may receive a summons. To the famed Roundtable Hold…</text>
<text id="301011000">Oh, yes... Tarnished, are we?</text>
<text id="301011010">Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?</text>
<text id="301011020">Of course you have. No shame in it.</text>
<text id="301011030">Unfortunately for you, however, you are maidenless.</text>
<text id="301011040">Without guidance, without the strength of runes, and without an invitation to the Roundtable Hold...</text>
<text id="301011050">You are fated, it seems, to die in obscurity.</text>
<text id="301012000">Luckily for you, however, there is one shining ray of hope for even the maidenless.</text>
<text id="301012010">Me. Varré. Take care to listen.</text>
<text id="301012020">Are you familiar with grace? The golden light that gives life to you Tarnished.</text>
<text id="301012030">You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times.</text>
<text id="301012040">That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel.</text>
<text id="301012050">Mm, indeed. Grace's guidance holds the answers.</text>
<text id="301012060">It will lead you Tarnished to the path you are meant to follow.</text>
<text id="301012070">Even if it leads you to your grave.</text>
<text id="301013000">Grace's guidance will reveal the path forward, most certainly.</text>
<text id="301013010">To Castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.</text>
<text id="301013020">The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.</text>
<text id="301014000">It's time you set off, I should think.</text>
<text id="301014010">To Castle Stormveil, on the cliff, where grace would guide you.</text>
<text id="301014020">If you seek the Elden Ring, maidenless as you are.</text>
<text id="301020000">Ohh, well done, well done indeed.</text>
<text id="301020010">You made it through that entire mess, all the way to Stormveil.</text>
<text id="301020020">And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold… My sincerest congratulations.</text>
<text id="301020030">But, how did you find the Roundtable?</text>
<text id="301020040">Oh, you don't have to say it.</text>
<text id="301020050">Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens.</text>
<text id="301020060">I fear you've been terribly disappointed.</text>
<text id="301020070">I don't blame you. But still, the Roundtable has its perks.</text>
<text id="301020080">Why not earn a seat? Fly straight and true, so to speak.</text>
<text id="301021000">Ahh, then you're interested? A wise choice indeed.</text>
<text id="301021010">To join the Roundtable proper, you must acquire a Great Rune, and request audience...</text>
<text id="301021020">...with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.</text>
<text id="301021030">They are the purported masters of the grace that guides your kind, the Tarnished.</text>
<text id="301021040">Mm, yes, pay them a visit, so that you may see for yourself.</text>
<text id="301022000">Challenge Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil, to acquire a Great Rune.</text>
<text id="301022010">Decrepit, he may be, but a demigod he remains. And of course, an inheritor of a Great Rune.</text>
<text id="301022020">Worse yet, I hear old Godrick's acquired a ferocious new toy to graft...</text>
<text id="301022030">So. Prepare for the worst.</text>
<text id="301023000">...</text>
<text id="301023010">Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well.</text>
<text id="301023020">Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided.</text>
<text id="301023030">But then again, if you should realise the error of your ways,</text>
<text id="301023040">I'm always willing to hear you out.</text>
<text id="301024000">Oh, have you decided to have a go after all? At joining the Roundtable proper?</text>
<text id="301025000">What's the matter?</text>
<text id="301025010">Aren't you supposed to be earning your place at the Roundtable Hold?</text>
<text id="301025020">Then you must face Godrick the Grafted, lord of Stormveil,</text>
<text id="301025030">for without a Great Rune, you will not be granted audience.</text>
<text id="301025040">With the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.</text>
<text id="301026000">Ohh, well done, well done indeed.</text>
<text id="301026010">You bested Godrick the Grafted, and claimed a Great Rune.</text>
<text id="301026020">You felled a demigod, and claimed a Great Rune.</text>
<text id="301026030">My congratulations.</text>
<text id="301026040">Now, visit the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="301026050">For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.</text>
<text id="301027000">Go to the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="301027010">For an audience with the Two Fingers, in the inner chamber.</text>
<text id="301030000">Ah, there you are.</text>
<text id="301030010">You claimed a Great Rune, and had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="301030020">You've had your audience. With the Two Fingers, at the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="301030030">What was your impression?</text>
<text id="301031000">Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well.</text>
<text id="301031010">My doubts had been piling up, you see.</text>
<text id="301031020">...The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted.</text>
<text id="301031030">Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions.</text>
<text id="301031040">I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed.</text>
<text id="301031050">Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind.</text>
<text id="301031060">That's the part that irks the most.</text>
<text id="301032000">Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise.</text>
<text id="301033000">A means for circumventing the draw of the Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="301033010">Give it a try, won't you?</text>
<text id="301033020">And if it please you, may we meet again.</text>
<text id="301033030">I've high hopes for you. My lambkin.</text>
<text id="301034000">You don't say. Well, what a relief that must be.</text>
<text id="301034010">You may go, then. My work here is done.</text>
<text id="301034020">May the wisdom of the Two Fingers guide you.</text>
<text id="301035000">Oh? Is something wrong?</text>
<text id="301036000">Be sure to try that finger I gave you.</text>
<text id="301036010">There's no reason to dither.</text>
<text id="301036020">The Tarnished were spurned by grace, forsaken by the Two Fingers. And now they ask you to mend their crumbling world?</text>
<text id="301036030">Hah, your loyalties are misplaced with them.</text>
<text id="301037000">Be sure to try that finger I gave you.</text>
<text id="301037010">I'm quite certain that you'll take to it.</text>
<text id="301050000">Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here.</text>
<text id="301050010">I'm glad that you're enjoying my gift.</text>
<text id="301050020">Mmm, I knew it from the very start.</text>
<text id="301050030">You have a taste for noble blood.</text>
<text id="301050040">...</text>
<text id="301050050">I wish to anoint you a proper inductee.</text>
<text id="301050060">A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty.</text>
<text id="301050070">Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love.</text>
<text id="301050080">So, what do you say, my lambkin?</text>
<text id="301051000">Mm, yes, who would have it any other way?</text>
<text id="301051010">Now, take this.</text>
<text id="301051020">For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood.</text>
<text id="301051030">Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="301051040">But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do.</text>
<text id="301052000">Oh my, perhaps you misheard me.</text>
<text id="301052010">Nothing wrong with giving you a day or two.</text>
<text id="301052020">For your ears to clear out.</text>
<text id="301053000">Oh, it's you.</text>
<text id="301053010">Could you tell me once more? Your honest reply.</text>
<text id="301054000">Ahh, my lambkin.</text>
<text id="301054010">You've completed your final trial.</text>
<text id="301054020">And with this, you are a formal inductee.</text>
<text id="301054030">A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty.</text>
<text id="301054040">Now, give me your finger.</text>
<text id="301054050">This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you.</text>
<text id="301054060">Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something.</text>
<text id="301054070">Never forget that feeling of agony.</text>
<text id="301054080">For it is what binds you, to Luminary Mohg. To all of us.</text>
<text id="301054090">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="301054100">You have the sweetest scream. My lambkin.</text>
<text id="301055000">Oh, another thing. You should have this.</text>
<text id="301056000">A medal granted by the new Mohgwyn dynasty.</text>
<text id="301056010">With the power to grant audience with Luminary Mohg.</text>
<text id="301056020">I've gone out of my way to provide one to you.</text>
<text id="301056030">But you mustn't use it just yet.</text>
<text id="301056040">The meeting must wait until the Mohgwyn dynasty commences.</text>
<text id="301056050">Luminary Mohg yet slumbers beside the Divinity.</text>
<text id="301056060">We must endure a little longer.</text>
<text id="301057000">Ahh, it is trying, but we must be patient.</text>
<text id="301057010">One day, you will be elevated, deservedly, basking in love.</text>
<text id="301057020">Right, my lambkin?</text>
<text id="301057030">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="301058000">The cloth is your final trial. Soak it with the blood of a maiden.</text>
<text id="301058010">The blood of anyone's maiden will do. You are maidenless, after all.</text>
<text id="301080000">What business does a maidenless wretch like you have here?</text>
<text id="301080010">Did you come seeking violence, upon learning my esteemed position under Luminary Mohg?</text>
<text id="301080020">I'll take pleasure in ensuring you regret this.</text>
<text id="301080030">Before you die in obscurity.</text>
<text id="301081000">You seek violence, heedless of my warning, though you have been raised to a knight of the dynasty?</text>
<text id="301081010">I am pained, to the very depths of my being.</text>
<text id="301081020">I'll ensure you regret this, my lambkin.</text>
<text id="301081030">Enjoy your miserable death.</text>
<text id="301082000">How dare you trouble Luminary Mohg's passions.</text>
<text id="301082010">You vulgar churl.</text>
<text id="301083000">I made a grave error.</text>
<text id="301084000">Why must I be...</text>
<text id="301084010">Disgraced by this lowborn...</text>
<text id="301085000">O...Luminary...Mohg...</text>
<text id="301085010">Please grant...the strength...you promised...</text>
<text id="301085020">I have given...everything...</text>
<text id="301085030">Please...my lord...</text>
<text id="301086000">Please, answer me...Luminary...Mohg.</text>
<text id="301086010">...</text>
<text id="301086020">A-ahh...</text>
<text id="301086030">Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!</text>
<text id="301086040"><groan></text>
<text id="301086050">...</text>
<text id="301800000">Oh?</text>
<text id="301801000">Do you even comprehend?</text>
<text id="301801010">The gravity of this choice.</text>
<text id="301802000">Very well.</text>
<text id="301802010">If you mistake kindness for frailty of heart,</text>
<text id="301802020">then perhaps a more physical lesson is in order!</text>
<text id="301803000">You disappoint me.</text>
<text id="301803010">Perhaps noble blood is too rich for the maidenless.</text>
<text id="301803020">Well, no sense in sparing your life now.</text>
<text id="301804000">You were a maidenless upstart to begin with.</text>
<text id="301804010">You will die nameless, without ceremony.</text>
<text id="301805000">Oh dear, a pity it's come to this, my lambkin.</text>
<text id="301805010">How does it feel to die a failure?</text>
<text id="301805020">Materials of quality are so hard to find, these days...</text>
<text id="301806000">You maidenless runt...</text>
<text id="301806010">Who do you think I am?</text>
<text id="301806020"><groan></text>
<text id="301807000">Luminary Mohg...</text>
<text id="301807010">Bless the Mohgwyn Dynasty, with love!</text>
<text id="301807020"><groan></text>
<text id="301900000"> </text>
<text id="301900010"> </text>
<text id="301900020"> </text>
<text id="302001000">You there.</text>
<text id="302001010">Come over here, would you?</text>
<text id="302002000">You're Tarnished, aren't you?</text>
<text id="302002010">I would advise against taking the main gate into the castle.</text>
<text id="302002020">It's tightly guarded by hardened old hands.</text>
<text id="302002030">Try the opening right here.</text>
<text id="302002040">The guards don't know about it.</text>
<text id="302002050">You'll breach the castle undetected.</text>
<text id="302003000">Yes, that's the spirit.</text>
<text id="302003010">...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.</text>
<text id="302003020">I pray for your success.</text>
<text id="302004000">Fair enough, you certainly don't have to trust me.</text>
<text id="302004010">Well, If you must go through the gates, I'll signal them to open.</text>
<text id="302004020">But of course, I'd advise against it.</text>
<text id="302005000">Use that opening to breach the castle.</text>
<text id="302005010">The guards haven't a clue about it.</text>
<text id="302005020">You'll slip right inside undetected.</text>
<text id="302006000">Of course. I understand.</text>
<text id="302006010">When you approach the gates, I'll signal them to open.</text>
<text id="302006020">It's only your neck on the line, after all.</text>
<text id="302007000">The gates! Open the gates!</text>
<text id="302008000">...You're just the kind of Tarnished that I like.</text>
<text id="302008010">I pray for your success.</text>
<text id="302009000">The gates are open. Do as you like.</text>
<text id="302009010">It's only your neck on the line, after all.</text>
<text id="302020000">Oh, oh, you...</text>
<text id="302020010">Oh, great, I'm glad you're here.</text>
<text id="302020020">Just a small reward, I was saving it for you.</text>
<text id="302020030">Please, it's all yours.</text>
<text id="302021000">Good, now let's be on our way, shall we?</text>
<text id="302021010">Wouldn't want the guards to spot you.</text>
<text id="302022000">Hop along, will you?</text>
<text id="302022010">What'll happen if the guards catch you strutting about?</text>
<text id="302025000">Rubbish...</text>
<text id="302025010">Another one...another one all skin and bones.</text>
<text id="302025020">...Worse than a petty squire...</text>
<text id="302025030">...Ahh, not a muscle on this one either...</text>
<text id="302026000">Oh, you...</text>
<text id="302026010">For god's sake, don't scare me like that!</text>
<text id="302026020">...</text>
<text id="302026030">What, oh, just clearing out some corpses.</text>
<text id="302026040">Can't just leave them about, you know, they'll start to pong, eh.</text>
<text id="302027000">Oh, hello. No, don't you mind me for a minute.</text>
<text id="302027010">It's my job to keep the grounds clean.</text>
<text id="302028000"> </text>
<text id="302040000">Oh, hello... Glad to see you safe.</text>
<text id="302040010">I've come into some fine goods.</text>
<text id="302040020">Only, it turns out I can't use a one of them.</text>
<text id="302040030">Perhaps you'd like to take them off my hands?</text>
<text id="302041000">Oh, hello, anything you'd care to purchase?</text>
<text id="302045000">Fare thee well.</text>
<text id="302045010">I pray for your success.</text>
<text id="302050000">What a pathetic excuse for a Lord you were. Craven to the bone.</text>
<text id="302050010">Pushing me about like that. And after all that grafting? Where did that get you?</text>
<text id="302050020">Look down, on me, would you?</text>
<text id="302050030">Godrick? You filthy slug.</text>
<text id="302050040">Feel it! Feel it! Feel my bloody wrath!</text>
<text id="302051000">Oh...hello there.</text>
<text id="302051010">This weasel was... Godrick was always looking down on me.</text>
<text id="302051020">He got what he bloody deserved, thanks to you.</text>
<text id="302051030">I tell you though, what goes around comes around.</text>
<text id="302051040">He had an ugly heart, an uglier countenance, and met the ugliest of ends, eh.</text>
<text id="302051050">He he he he he...</text>
<text id="302052000">Now, I suppose I'm free.</text>
<text id="302052010">I can do whatever takes my fancy...</text>
<text id="302052020">Can't I, mate?</text>
<text id="302060000">You giving that to me?</text>
<text id="302060010">...</text>
<text id="302060020">Well, I suppose I did save your life, in a way.</text>
<text id="302060030">I'll gladly take it off your hands. Be rude not to, eh!</text>
<text id="302060040">Mmm, you Tarnished are alright by me.</text>
<text id="302060050">The sweet ones like you, anyway.</text>
<text id="302061000">...</text>
<text id="302070000">Ah, you, is it?</text>
<text id="302070010">Haven't seen your mug in quite some time.</text>
<text id="302070020">As you can see, I'm the new Lady's attendant.</text>
<text id="302070030">Freedom? Wasn't worth squat.</text>
<text id="302070040">B-besides, I like it 'round 'ere...</text>
<text id="302070050">Lady Nepheli's still fair of heart and countenance...</text>
<text id="302071000">Still, I have the Lady's trust.</text>
<text id="302071010">...So I can loot all the corpses I like.</text>
<text id="302071020">I'll let you take a look at the goods, if you fancy.</text>
<text id="302072000">Ah, back again, are we? Curious one, you are.</text>
<text id="302072010">Well then, what are you after?</text>
<text id="302800000">Ouch!</text>
<text id="302801000">Oi, what're you doing?</text>
<text id="302801010">Stop that!</text>
<text id="302802000">Blast, what's it to you!</text>
<text id="302802010">Step back, you wretched Tarnished!</text>
<text id="302803000">Finally given up the ghost, eh...</text>
<text id="302803010">Oh, don't worry, I've got big plans for what's left of you...</text>
<text id="302804000">Hah! Do you feel it?</text>
<text id="302804010">Do you feel my bloody wrath?</text>
<text id="302805000">Damn it all. Why is it always me...</text>
<text id="302805010">What did I do to deserve...</text>
<text id="302806000">But...I'm free...</text>
<text id="302806010">I can do...what I like...</text>
<text id="302900000"> </text>
<text id="302900010"> </text>
<text id="302900020"> </text>
<text id="303001000">Good Lord! Good God of Vengeance!</text>
<text id="303001010">Till grudges soak the lands!</text>
<text id="303002000">Oh...</text>
<text id="303002010">I see, you're Tarnished.</text>
<text id="303002020">I am Guilbert. A Redeemer of vengeance. In all its forms.</text>
<text id="303003000">By the way...</text>
<text id="303003010">Have you heard of the crucible knights?</text>
<text id="303003020">There's one by the name of Ordovis, and I must find him.</text>
<text id="303003030">He's an old hero of the Shattering, but there's a grudge out against him.</text>
<text id="303003040">The Lands Between are brimming with those who cannot die. It makes for a cesspool of vengeance.</text>
<text id="303003050">...Gives me a shiver just thinking about it...</text>
<text id="303004000">These fellows?</text>
<text id="303004010">Who knows, just some lads who did someone wrong.</text>
<text id="303004020">They got what was coming, nothing more.</text>
<text id="303004030">If you're intent on revenge, pray to the God of Vengeance.</text>
<text id="303004040">You'll have yourself a corpse in no time.</text>
<text id="303005000">You're Tarnished. Then you're here to fight, aren't you?</text>
<text id="303005010">For the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="303005020">Well, there's something you ought to know.</text>
<text id="303005030">There's an aberration of a blacksmith past the checkpoint that leads to Stormveil.</text>
<text id="303005040">He doesn't seem to think much of anyone or anything, but oddly, he's willing to smith weapons for Tarnished.</text>
<text id="303005050">He has a fine arm. Have him take a crack at your goods.</text>
<text id="303005060">...The question for me, of course, is whether he's in need of any vengeance...</text>
<text id="303006000">In the Lands Between, everyone lives longer than they should.</text>
<text id="303006010">They may go mad, but even so, they plead to the God of Vengeance.</text>
<text id="303006020">That's why I'm here. To exact revenge for those who can't do it themselves.</text>
<text id="303006030">Like someone did for me, when I...when I was but a tyke.</text>
<text id="303010000">Oh, there you are...</text>
<text id="303010010">It must have been a dream. Strange.</text>
<text id="303010020">I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis of the Crucible.</text>
<text id="303010030">It was a revenge so sweet, fit to serve the very God of Vengeance.</text>
<text id="303010040">Heh...</text>
<text id="303010050">Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer, as well...</text>
<text id="303010520">I was fighting at your side. Against Ordovis, the Crucible Knight.</text>
<text id="303011000">Ah, you...</text>
<text id="303011010">Did you defeat Ordovis of the Crucible?</text>
<text id="303011020">I could sense it. The God of Vengeance surely smiled upon that battle.</text>
<text id="303011030">Heh...</text>
<text id="303011040">Maybe you're meant to be a Redeemer too...</text>
<text id="303011510">Did you defeat Ordovis, the Crucible Knight.</text>
<text id="303013000">Alright, then.</text>
<text id="303013010">I'm off to Stormveil Castle.</text>
<text id="303013020">Lord Godrick has kept busy with his grafting...</text>
<text id="303013030">Slicing off arms like harvesting ears of wheat. He's run up a mighty debt in blood.</text>
<text id="303013040">A demigod, yes, he may be...</text>
<text id="303013050">But no one escapes a Redeemer.</text>
<text id="303014000">I was thinking...</text>
<text id="303014010">Godrick must have an idea.</text>
<text id="303014020">About the vengeance sought by General Radahn, to whom I swore my oath.</text>
<text id="303014030">...Yes, Godrick's corpse will know what to do...</text>
<text id="303014510">Godrick must know.</text>
<text id="303014920">That of all the grudges born of the Shattering, Malenia the Rotted is the object of the most profound.</text>
<text id="303015000">Ahh, my head is throbbing, everything is bright red...</text>
<text id="303015010">Master Radahn, is this how it feels to ferment with vengeance?</text>
<text id="303015020">I can hardly keep from trembling...</text>
<text id="303900000">Well, well, you've made yourself a target of vengeance.</text>
<text id="303900010">Perhaps this, too, was meant to be.</text>
<text id="303900020">Prepare to become an offering.</text>
<text id="303900030">Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.</text>
<text id="303901000">Hello there, I don't believe we've met.</text>
<text id="303901010">I'm afraid you've made yourself the object of somebody's ire.</text>
<text id="303901020">As a Redeemer, I'm bound to exact revenge.</text>
<text id="303901030">Prepare to become an offering.</text>
<text id="303901040">Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.</text>
<text id="303902000">Whoah, what're you playing at? (OKテイク, v303902000_ALT_3) What're you playing at?</text>
<text id="303903000">...</text>
<text id="303903010">This is a little awkward.</text>
<text id="303903020">There's no revenge to be had in this killing.</text>
<text id="303904000">Not too sharp, are you?</text>
<text id="303904010">If you want to die, ask someone else.</text>
<text id="303905000"> </text>
<text id="303905100"> </text>
<text id="303905200"> </text>
<text id="303906000">Let it be known.</text>
<text id="303906010">Wherever vengeance must be had, a Redeemer there will be...</text>
<text id="303907000">Oh, my Lord. Good God of Vengeance!</text>
<text id="303907010">Till grudges soak the lands...</text>
<text id="303908000">Don't you see now?</text>
<text id="303908010">There is no escape from a Redeemer.</text>
<text id="303909000">Death ought to be earned.</text>
<text id="303909010">What am I to make of this?</text>
<text id="303910000">Didn't I tell you before?</text>
<text id="303910010">No one escapes a Redeemer.</text>
<text id="303910020">Prepare to become an offering, once and for all.</text>
<text id="303910030">Trust me, you'll rest easier as a corpse.</text>
<text id="307001000">I see... You must be Ranni's new hireling.</text>
<text id="307001001">I see... You must be Ranni's new girl.</text>
<text id="307001010">Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.</text>
<text id="307001020">I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts.</text>
<text id="307001030">I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,</text>
<text id="307001040">but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,</text>
<text id="307001050">I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.</text>
<text id="307002000">I reside...in another tower, close by.</text>
<text id="307002010">Come and pay me a visit...</text>
<text id="307002020">Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.</text>
<text id="307002030">If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you.</text>
<text id="307002040">But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?</text>
<text id="307010000">Well, well. You took me at my word.</text>
<text id="307010010">Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze...</text>
<text id="307010020">Hmm, I suppose you're here now.</text>
<text id="307010030">Perhaps I'll give you something to do.</text>
<text id="307010040">I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion.</text>
<text id="307010050">Even you can do that much, can't you?</text>
<text id="307011000">Good, good.</text>
<text id="307011010">Now I shall hand over the potion in question.</text>
<text id="307011020">Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.</text>
<text id="307011030">I expect glad tidings. And soon.</text>
<text id="307012000">I see...</text>
<text id="307012010">What a wretched bunch you Tarnished are.</text>
<text id="307012020">Do you understand? I've given you a very fine chance.</text>
<text id="307012030">If you complete this simple task, I will graciously permit you to learn from me.</text>
<text id="307012040">Even you wish to serve our Lady well, do you not?</text>
<text id="307012050">Turn those little cogs upstairs, and return with the correct answer.</text>
<text id="307013000">Have you fumbled out the correct answer now?</text>
<text id="307013010">Then you will undertake my task?</text>
<text id="307014000">...</text>
<text id="307014010">You are peerless in your dullardry.</text>
<text id="307014020">Fine. I can feel my wits evaporating in your mere presence.</text>
<text id="307014030">Don't bother wasting your breath on me again.</text>
<text id="307015000">I could have sworn I told you to trouble me no more...</text>
<text id="307015010">Are you here to tender your sincere apology, and undertake my task?</text>
<text id="307016000">Good, good.</text>
<text id="307016010">As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.</text>
<text id="307016020">Now I shall hand over the potion in question.</text>
<text id="307016030">Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.</text>
<text id="307016040">I expect glad tidings. And soon.</text>
<text id="307017000">I've no time for idle chit chat.</text>
<text id="307017010">The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion.</text>
<text id="307017020">Are we understood? Then off you trot.</text>
<text id="307017030">I have enough on my plate.</text>
<text id="307030000">Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?</text>
<text id="307030010">Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought.</text>
<text id="307030011">Well done. You are a slight more useful than I had thought.</text>
<text id="307030020">Very well. Then you shall have your gift.</text>
<text id="307030030">Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis.</text>
<text id="307030040">I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but...</text>
<text id="307030050">If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady.</text>
<text id="307031000">You wish to begin right this moment?</text>
<text id="307031010">Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it.</text>
<text id="307032000">Begging for another lesson so soon?</text>
<text id="307032010">There remains much to be done. Make it quick.</text>
<text id="307033000">Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not.</text>
<text id="307033010">Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break.</text>
<text id="307040000">Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you?</text>
<text id="307040010">The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?</text>
<text id="307040020">Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot.</text>
<text id="307040030">Well...there's no helping it.</text>
<text id="307040040">Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.</text>
<text id="307040050">There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.</text>
<text id="307040060">She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.</text>
<text id="307040070">I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.</text>
<text id="307040080">I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her.</text>
<text id="307041000">So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?</text>
<text id="307041010">Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.</text>
<text id="307041020">It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.</text>
<text id="307041030">I may have expected too much of her, to begin with.</text>
<text id="307050000">You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?</text>
<text id="307050010">Your oafishness knows no bounds.</text>
<text id="307050020">Fine and well.</text>
<text id="307050030">You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.</text>
<text id="307050040">I believe that makes you my accomplice.</text>
<text id="307050050">You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?</text>
<text id="307050060">Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.</text>
<text id="307050070">But perhaps I can make a very special exception.</text>
<text id="307050080">Now, choose.</text>
<text id="307051000">Ah, I knew you'd see things my way.</text>
<text id="307051010">You knew you were already my accomplice, and as such...</text>
<text id="307051020">You wanted one for yourself, hmm? A puppet, to cherish.</text>
<text id="307051030">Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.</text>
<text id="307051031">Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are.</text>
<text id="307051040">Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road.</text>
<text id="307051050">To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire.</text>
<text id="307051060">Now, choose.</text>
<text id="307052000">Well, this is a surprise.</text>
<text id="307052010">But aren't we forgetting something?</text>
<text id="307052020">The tipple you fooled Nepheli into drinking, yes, my little draught.</text>
<text id="307052030">You are already my accomplice.</text>
<text id="307052040">Are you ready to change your mind, now?</text>
<text id="307052050">It's no sin, pining for a puppet to cherish.</text>
<text id="307053000">Now, hand it over, and don't make a fuss.</text>
<text id="307053010">Nothing bad will happen. I'll even consider giving you a puppet of your own.</text>
<text id="307054000">(huge sigh)</text>
<text id="307054010">You truly are beyond salvation.</text>
<text id="307054020">Fine. Leave this place, and never darken my doorstep again.</text>
<text id="307054030">Ah, what a terrible pity.</text>
<text id="307054040">This is the last time I'll see you, in your present state.</text>
<text id="307055000">I thought I told you never to show your face again.</text>
<text id="307055010">Have you decided to return what's mine, and proffer a sincere apology?</text>
<text id="307056000">Good, good.</text>
<text id="307056010">As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.</text>
<text id="307056020">And well, you finally realised, did you?</text>
<text id="307056030">All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart.</text>
<text id="307056040">Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.</text>
<text id="307056041">Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are.</text>
<text id="307056050">Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road.</text>
<text id="307056060">To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire.</text>
<text id="307056070">Now, choose.</text>
<text id="307060000">How's the puppet I gave you?</text>
<text id="307060010">A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?</text>
<text id="307070000">What's that? You want another puppet?</text>
<text id="307070010">Quite the keen paramour, aren't we.</text>
<text id="307070011">Well, aren't you a woman of many passions.</text>
<text id="307070020">But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me.</text>
<text id="307070030">I can hardly just give them away.</text>
<text id="307070040">Oh dear, what's to be done?</text>
<text id="307070050">Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards?</text>
<text id="307070060">It's no mere booze, but a refined old drink of amber hue.</text>
<text id="307070070">If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.</text>
<text id="307070080">The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.</text>
<text id="307070090">And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.</text>
<text id="307070100">Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road.</text>
<text id="307080000">You're proving to be quite the puppeteer.</text>
<text id="307080010">I've not had an apprentice for…a very long time indeed.</text>
<text id="307081000">Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine?</text>
<text id="307081010">It will produce the finest of puppets.</text>
<text id="307081020">Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands.</text>
<text id="307081030">A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound?</text>
<text id="307082000">Ahh, I knew I had you pegged.</text>
<text id="307082001">Heh. I knew I had you pegged.</text>
<text id="307082010">You're just like me.</text>
<text id="307082020">Then I'd like you to procure something.</text>
<text id="307082030">A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.</text>
<text id="307082040">With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.</text>
<text id="307082050">And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...</text>
<text id="307082060">Procure it for me.</text>
<text id="307082070">The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.</text>
<text id="307082080">With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.</text>
<text id="307082090">And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...</text>
<text id="307083000">Very good.</text>
<text id="307083010">A wise choice, indeed.</text>
<text id="307083020">You passed my little test with flying colours.</text>
<text id="307083030">I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni.</text>
<text id="307083040">Well done, I'm very proud of you.</text>
<text id="307083050">Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady.</text>
<text id="307084000">Ah ha. Might you be interested after all?</text>
<text id="307084010">In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni?</text>
<text id="307085000">Alright, enough of these games.</text>
<text id="307085010">Your test is well and truly over.</text>
<text id="307085020">Wag your tail for master all you like, but your loyalty is merely blind.</text>
<text id="307085030">I fear your wretched provinciality is apt to burst. You're oozing at the seams.</text>
<text id="307090000">Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it!</text>
<text id="307090010">The blessed day is finally upon us...</text>
<text id="307090020">Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting.</text>
<text id="307090030">To think, this was once a demigod's very fate...</text>
<text id="307090040">My oh my oh my...</text>
<text id="307091000">Ah, are you still here?</text>
<text id="307091010">Oh yes, I should give you your reward.</text>
<text id="307091020">Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous.</text>
<text id="307091030">Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin.</text>
<text id="307091040">The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...</text>
<text id="307092000">Good, I've been waiting for you.</text>
<text id="307092010">It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet.</text>
<text id="307092020">Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it.</text>
<text id="307092030">The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably.</text>
<text id="307092040">Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona…she's a frail, gentle girl at heart.</text>
<text id="307092050">Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's still just a feeble, pampered little girl when it comes down to it.</text>
<text id="307092060">Which is why you're the only one for the job.</text>
<text id="307092070">Now do it. Make Ranni drink my draught.</text>
<text id="307093000">You...understand, don't you?</text>
<text id="307093010">That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition.</text>
<text id="307093020">And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted.</text>
<text id="307093030">Just imagine...the pure elation...</text>
<text id="307094000">Come now, don't make me wait.</text>
<text id="307094010">I can barely contain myself as it is...</text>
<text id="307095000">You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you.</text>
<text id="307095010">The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...</text>
<text id="307100000">Hmm. Is that a scroll?</text>
<text id="307100010">I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but...</text>
<text id="307100020">You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it.</text>
<text id="307100030">So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.</text>
<text id="307100040">That said, don't you dare get your hopes up.</text>
<text id="307100050">More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect…</text>
<text id="307100060">…upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.</text>
<text id="307110000">Oh, perhaps you've already noticed.</text>
<text id="307110010">The nightly wolf howling that's been disturbing the peace here.</text>
<text id="307110020">If that bothersome mutt, Blaidd, is back in town,</text>
<text id="307110030">then tell him to pack up and ship out.</text>
<text id="307110040">I never liked the din of a dog's howl.</text>
<text id="307110050">From a mongrel like him, it's simply agony.</text>
<text id="307120000">Well, what have we here?</text>
<text id="307120010">Are you proposing that I partake?</text>
<text id="307120020">Do I appear such a gormless tomfool to you?</text>
<text id="307120030">A slow-wit who'd divulge his secrets for a moment of bliss?</text>
<text id="307120040">Well, let me give you some advice.</text>
<text id="307120050">Scheming has its place, but consider the one you're scheming against.</text>
<text id="307120060">You might find yourself on the wrong end of a proper beating one day.</text>
<text id="307200000">O-oh!</text>
<text id="307200010">Y-you! I, er, sorry, your worship...</text>
<text id="307200011">Y-you! I, er, sorry, madam...</text>
<text id="307200020">I-I apologise for any offence given.</text>
<text id="307200030">I am Pidia. Servant to the Carian royal family.</text>
<text id="307200040">I am charged with maintaining these g-ghastly dolls.</text>
<text id="307201000">Ahh, your worship, allow me to be of use.</text>
<text id="307201001">Ahh, kind madam, allow me to be of use.</text>
<text id="307201010">Other than the puppets, there are some very fine things up here in this storeroom.</text>
<text id="307201020">Why not pick something out, before you go?</text>
<text id="307201030">But please, can you offer poor ill-starred Pidia...</text>
<text id="307201040">A little something by way of compensation?</text>
<text id="307202000">Ah, a fine day to your worship.</text>
<text id="307202001">Ah, kind madam, a fine day to y-you.</text>
<text id="307202010">Please, choose whatever you like.</text>
<text id="307203000">Ah, I'm sorry your worship, but poor Pidia has given all he has.</text>
<text id="307203001">Ah, I'm sorry kind madam, but poor Pidia has given all he has.</text>
<text id="307203010">I can't be of further use to you. Please, forgive me.</text>
<text id="307204000">Please, find it in your heart... Forgive me...</text>
<text id="307205000">Argh!</text>
<text id="307205010">Arrgh!</text>
<text id="307205020">S-stop, please, stop!</text>
<text id="307205030">Y-you're my puppets! I loved you with all I have!</text>
<text id="307205040">How could you forget...such bliss?</text>
<text id="307205050">Ouch!</text>
<text id="307205060">That hurts!</text>
<text id="307205070">Please, I beg you, cease this cruelty!</text>
<text id="307205080">Eeek</text>
<text id="307205090">Eeeeeeek!</text>
<text id="307210000">Oh, that's very kind.</text>
<text id="307210010">Poor Pidia could never accept such a precious brew.</text>
<text id="307210020">Very sorry, really, if I... I've disappointed you,</text>
<text id="307210030">If you will, please forget this matter entirely.</text>
<text id="307800000">Agh!</text>
<text id="307801000">Enough of that, now.</text>
<text id="307801010">Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady?</text>
<text id="307802000">You incorrigible lout.</text>
<text id="307802010">Don't you dare waltz back here ever again.</text>
<text id="307802020">...</text>
<text id="307900000"> </text>
<text id="307900100"> </text>
<text id="309001000">Well, well, well?</text>
<text id="309001010">Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?</text>
<text id="309001020">You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!</text>
<text id="309001030">Cough up your coin, all of it!</text>
<text id="309002000">Wait, wait, please!</text>
<text id="309002010">I surrender! White flag and all!</text>
<text id="309003000">For Pete's sake! I concede!</text>
<text id="309003010">No one likes a bull-headed brute, you know!</text>
<text id="309003020">I yield, yield! You can't harm a yielding man!</text>
<text id="309004000">Cripes, are you dense, boy?</text>
<text id="309004001">Cripes, are you dense, sweetheart?</text>
<text id="309004010">Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.</text>
<text id="309004020">We're about to make out like Bandits, boys!</text>
<text id="309005000">Well, finally come around, have you?</text>
<text id="309005010">I knew you would. You're a man of reason, through-and-through.</text>
<text id="309005011">I knew you would. You're a lady of reason, through-and-through.</text>
<text id="309005020">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="309006000">Ahhh...</text>
<text id="309006010">Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me.</text>
<text id="309006020">Now, how did I get that wrong?</text>
<text id="309006030">I took you for a demi-human, or some such.</text>
<text id="309006040">An innocent mistake, I assure you.</text>
<text id="309006050">Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on?</text>
<text id="309007000">A true man of reason. Just what I like about you.</text>
<text id="309007001">A true lady of reason. Just what I like about you.</text>
<text id="309007010">I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.</text>
<text id="309007020">Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.</text>
<text id="309007030">Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits they're paying for my gruel.</text>
<text id="309007040">In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.</text>
<text id="309007050">But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.</text>
<text id="309007060">Frankly, I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.</text>
<text id="309007070">So, don't be a stranger, eh?</text>
<text id="309007080">I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.</text>
<text id="309007090">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="309008000">Slow down, son...</text>
<text id="309008001">Slow down, madame...</text>
<text id="309008010">What's the matter? This simply isn't like you.</text>
<text id="309008020">You've always known an innocent mistake when you see one.</text>
<text id="309008030">Well, suit yourself.</text>
<text id="309008040">I'm Patches. Patches the Untethered.</text>
<text id="309008050">Tarnished, like you, only, free-spirited. Nomadic, you might say.</text>
<text id="309008060">Only for now, those retired-soldiers-turned-bandits are paying for my gruel.</text>
<text id="309008070">In exchange for my, well, showing them the ropes.</text>
<text id="309008080">But honestly... this looting racket is bloody terrifying.</text>
<text id="309008090">I'm ready to wash my hands clean. Maybe set up a legitimate shop.</text>
<text id="309008100">So, don't be a stranger, eh?</text>
<text id="309008110">I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.</text>
<text id="309008120">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="309009000">Don't forget to pop back for another visit, friend.</text>
<text id="309009010">I'll be ready to wheel and deal, come next time.</text>
<text id="309009020">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="309020000">Well, nice of you to drop in, finally.</text>
<text id="309020010">It's all a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something.</text>
<text id="309020020">And welcome to Patches' Emporium.</text>
<text id="309020030">Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch.</text>
<text id="309021000">Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.</text>
<text id="309022000">Cheers for that.</text>
<text id="309023000">Stingy little beggar...</text>
<text id="309023010">Try to find it in your heart next time, eh?</text>
<text id="309024000">Yeah, I had those bandits make a clean break.</text>
<text id="309024010">Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that.</text>
<text id="309024020">I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying,</text>
<text id="309024030">but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection.</text>
<text id="309024040">They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army.</text>
<text id="309024050">Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish.</text>
<text id="309024060">...It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all.</text>
<text id="309025000">Hm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest?</text>
<text id="309025010">Well, it's uh, nothing too special.</text>
<text id="309025020">Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer...</text>
<text id="309025030">But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin...</text>
<text id="309025040">And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming...</text>
<text id="309025050">Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take.</text>
<text id="309026000">Forgot something on your shopping list?</text>
<text id="309026010">No, no trouble to me.</text>
<text id="309041000">By the way, friend...</text>
<text id="309041010">You've really been there for me, through thick and thin.</text>
<text id="309041020">And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you.</text>
<text id="309041030">An extra-special thanks, for an extra-special customer.</text>
<text id="309042000">What's wrong? I've made up my mind.</text>
<text id="309042010">The treasure chest is yours, in word and deed.</text>
<text id="309042020">Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold.</text>
<text id="309042030">But a Patches Promise? Well, that's priceless!</text>
<text id="309050000">Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.</text>
<text id="309050010">You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.</text>
<text id="309050020">Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm?</text>
<text id="309050030">But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience.</text>
<text id="309050040">At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.</text>
<text id="309050050">And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!</text>
<text id="309051000">Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive.</text>
<text id="309051010">You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that.</text>
<text id="309051020">Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests?</text>
<text id="309051030">No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate.</text>
<text id="309051040">At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe.</text>
<text id="309051050">And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!</text>
<text id="309060000">Oh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave.</text>
<text id="309060010">I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on.</text>
<text id="309060020">No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop.</text>
<text id="309060030">They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face.</text>
<text id="309060040">Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh?</text>
<text id="309070000">Oh, well! It's been a long while.</text>
<text id="309070010">It's me. Patches the Untethered.</text>
<text id="309070020">I'm still in business, if you can believe it.</text>
<text id="309070030">Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch.</text>
<text id="309070040">Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="309071000">You have yourself a discerning eye, I can tell.</text>
<text id="309071010">That statuette will net you a small fortune, no doubt.</text>
<text id="309071020">In fact, I'll bet any of those scruffy merchants would leap at the chance to buy it...</text>
<text id="309071030">(laughs)</text>
<text id="309072000">Oh, really? No interest in the statuette?</text>
<text id="309072010">I was sure it would catch your eye.</text>
<text id="309072020">Well, I can't force it on you, but...</text>
<text id="309072030">Incomparable craftsmanship, you know. I'd hate to see it go to someone else...</text>
<text id="309073000">By the way, have you met that girl Rya?</text>
<text id="309073010">I spotted her somewhere along the highroad not long ago.</text>
<text id="309073020">She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help.</text>
<text id="309073030">Not that it's any of my business, but...</text>
<text id="309073040">If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear?</text>
<text id="309074000">Looking for Rya? Still hanging around on the high road, I suppose.</text>
<text id="309080000">Oh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine...</text>
<text id="309080010">Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium!</text>
<text id="309081000">You're...making your way to the Erdtree, no?</text>
<text id="309081010">Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination.</text>
<text id="309081020">Have you ever seen an iron virgin?</text>
<text id="309081030">The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels.</text>
<text id="309081040">...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition.</text>
<text id="309081050">And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="309081060">Its transpositional powers fully intact.</text>
<text id="309081070">So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...</text>
<text id="309081080">It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told...</text>
<text id="309081090">Ha ha...ha ha...</text>
<text id="309082000">Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like.</text>
<text id="309082010">There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="309082020">And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="309082030">Heh heh...ha ha...</text>
<text id="309090000">Well, fancy meeting you here.</text>
<text id="309090010">Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend.</text>
<text id="309090020">I spoke no lie, not a one.</text>
<text id="309090030">You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake,</text>
<text id="309090040">but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out.</text>
<text id="309090050">I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear.</text>
<text id="309090060">But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right?</text>
<text id="309101000">Oh, erm, hello, yes.</text>
<text id="309101010">Strange place for a chance encounter, eh?</text>
<text id="309101020">Thought I could use a rest. Don't mind me, go about your business.</text>
<text id="309101030">Right, over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.</text>
<text id="309101040">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="309102000">What is it? Oh, don't mind me. Off you trot.</text>
<text id="309102010">Right over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear.</text>
<text id="309102020">Heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="309110000">Oh, my, well, here you are again.</text>
<text id="309110010">So sorry for that. I meant to warn you, but whoops! There you went.</text>
<text id="309110020">Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have.</text>
<text id="309110030">But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh.</text>
<text id="309110040">And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different!</text>
<text id="309110050">Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.</text>
<text id="309110060">I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.</text>
<text id="309110070">Mm...heh heh...</text>
<text id="309111000">You didn't listen last time, but I'm warning you again.</text>
<text id="309111010">Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.</text>
<text id="309111020">I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals.</text>
<text id="309111030">Heh heh...heh heh...</text>
<text id="309120000">Well, you've joined the Manor, eh?</text>
<text id="309120010">I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you.</text>
<text id="309120020">And here I thought Rya was barking up the wrong tree...</text>
<text id="309120030">All good, though. We're on the same side, now.</text>
<text id="309120040">We'll do good work together.</text>
<text id="309121000">Oh, and of course, we can do business, if you like.</text>
<text id="309121010">Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you.</text>
<text id="309130000">Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing.</text>
<text id="309130010">This is for you.</text>
<text id="309131000">You're new here at the Manor.</text>
<text id="309131010">But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing.</text>
<text id="309131020">Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right?</text>
<text id="309131030">Go on, break a leg, then.</text>
<text id="309131040">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="309132000">What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey?</text>
<text id="309132010">Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon.</text>
<text id="309132020">We're not here to make your life easier.</text>
<text id="309132030">Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="309132040">Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with?</text>
<text id="309133040">You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with?</text>
<text id="309134000">You hunted down Tragoth?</text>
<text id="309134010">Are you certain?</text>
<text id="309134020">No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed.</text>
<text id="309134030">I'll give Tanith the news.</text>
<text id="309134040">Have some rest, by all means.</text>
<text id="309135000">Are you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="309135010">I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="309135020">I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade.</text>
<text id="309135030">Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.</text>
<text id="309135040">I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.</text>
<text id="309135050">Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud.</text>
<text id="309135060">I've never seen a woman quite like her...</text>
<text id="309136000">Hmph.</text>
<text id="309136010">Sharper than you seem, aren't you...</text>
<text id="309136020">I was just holding onto it for you, you know.</text>
<text id="309136030">Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.</text>
<text id="309150000">Now you've gone and killed Rykard?</text>
<text id="309150010">You scheming little bastard.</text>
<text id="309150011">You scheming little doxie.</text>
<text id="309150020">Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical...</text>
<text id="309150030">Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all...</text>
<text id="309150040">But for now, this Manor is finished.</text>
<text id="309150050">The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.</text>
<text id="309150060">A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy.</text>
<text id="309150070">Heh heh...ha ha...</text>
<text id="309150080">Well, here I am. Untethered, once again.</text>
<text id="309150090">Good-bye, my friend.</text>
<text id="309151000">What is it?</text>
<text id="309151010">Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium?</text>
<text id="309160000">Ah, oh, you again...</text>
<text id="309160010">A shame you had to see me like this...</text>
<text id="309160020">Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all.</text>
<text id="309160030">I should have stuck to what I know best...</text>
<text id="309160040">No matter. I know I-I can trust you.</text>
<text id="309160050">Gullible, yes, but a good soul.</text>
<text id="309160060">Make certain that Tanith gets this.</text>
<text id="309160070">Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape.</text>
<text id="309160080">C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.</text>
<text id="309161000">You're able, then?</text>
<text id="309161010">Then I can rest easy, my friend...</text>
<text id="309170000">Well, well, well?</text>
<text id="309170010">Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?</text>
<text id="309170020">You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance!</text>
<text id="309170030">Cough up your coin, all of it!</text>
<text id="309171000">Hm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you?</text>
<text id="309171010">Oh, cripes, please, wait!</text>
<text id="309171020">I surrender! I surrender, I swear!</text>
<text id="309172000">Do you even hear me? I said "surrender", loud and clear!</text>
<text id="309172010">No one likes a bull-headed brute!</text>
<text id="309172020">You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you?</text>
<text id="309173000">Cripes! Are you dense, mate?</text>
<text id="309173010">What in the world has gotten into you!</text>
<text id="309173020">Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming.</text>
<text id="309173030">Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!</text>
<text id="309174000">Well, glad to see we're on the same page.</text>
<text id="309174010">I'd never cross you, not even close.</text>
<text id="309174020">He he he...</text>
<text id="309175000">Ahhh...</text>
<text id="309175010">It's been ages since I've seen you.</text>
<text id="309175020">I didn't even realise it was you.</text>
<text id="309175030">Took you for a demi-human, or some such.</text>
<text id="309175040">You know how it is, just an innocent mistake.</text>
<text id="309175050">Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual?</text>
<text id="309176000">Hell's bells...</text>
<text id="309176010">This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be...</text>
<text id="309176020">Especially if we keep running into the likes of you...</text>
<text id="309176030">...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...</text>
<text id="309177000">...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...</text>
<text id="309190000">Well, finally made it, eh, and just in time.</text>
<text id="309190010">For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium.</text>
<text id="309190020">Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch!</text>
<text id="309191000">Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.</text>
<text id="309192000">Cheers for that.</text>
<text id="309193000">What, do I have to beg?</text>
<text id="309193010">Give us a coin or two next time around, will you?</text>
<text id="309194000">Forgot something on your shopping list?</text>
<text id="309194010">No trouble to me.</text>
<text id="309200000">Booze, eh? Good stuff, by the look of it.</text>
<text id="309200010">But, er, I'm alright, thanks.</text>
<text id="309200020">As my dear nan used to say, "there's no such thing as a free lunch"...</text>
<text id="309201000">...</text>
<text id="309800000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="309801000">What are you playing at? That bloody well hurts!</text>
<text id="309802000">What's wrong with you?</text>
<text id="309802010">It's me, Patches. Patches!</text>
<text id="309802020">Enough now, stop!</text>
<text id="309803000">Ugh. Hard of hearing, are we?</text>
<text id="309804000">Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming!</text>
<text id="309804010">Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!</text>
<text id="309806000">Last chance to surrender, mate.</text>
<text id="309806010">Grovel...and I'll forgive you.</text>
<text id="309810000">Well... It was bound to happen some day...</text>
<text id="309810010">What a shit show...</text>
<text id="309820010">Try not to be so slow on the uptake, eh.</text>
<text id="309821010">There's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you.</text>
<text id="309830000">Well, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways.</text>
<text id="309830010">...</text>
<text id="309830020">Water under the bridge. Am I wrong?</text>
<text id="309830030">We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.</text>
<text id="309830040">So, what can I do you for today?</text>
<text id="309840000">Okay, I can see you mean it.</text>
<text id="309840010">Consider it water under the bridge.</text>
<text id="309840020">A momentary lapse of judgment. "All's well", as you know.</text>
<text id="309841000">So. Do you need something from me?</text>
<text id="309900000"> </text>
<text id="309900010"> </text>
<text id="309900020"> </text>
<text id="310001000">Hello? Is somebody there?</text>
<text id="310001010">Might I bend your ear for a moment, please.</text>
<text id="310001020">My name is Irina. I've escaped from Castle Morne, to the south.</text>
<text id="310001030">The servants there...have rebelled.</text>
<text id="310001040">I-I can't be sure what it is; my eyesight's been weak since birth you see...</text>
<text id="310001050">But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over.</text>
<text id="310001060">My good father secreted me out the castle,</text>
<text id="310001070">but decided himself to stay. He says it's his duty, as commander.</text>
<text id="310002000">I understand.</text>
<text id="310002010">I fear some of the castle's servants are still prowling nearby.</text>
<text id="310002020">Do take care on the road. I pray your journey comes to fruition.</text>
<text id="310002030">And if you happen to change your mind...</text>
<text id="310002040">Please come to see me again.</text>
<text id="310003000">Hello? Is somebody there?</text>
<text id="310003010">Ah, you're the one from before, aren't you?</text>
<text id="310003020">Please, I implore you.</text>
<text id="310003030">Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?</text>
<text id="310003040">My sole wish is that he escape, even if his honour should be the price.</text>
<text id="310003050">Please...I just need him to be safe...</text>
<text id="310004000">Thank you, dearly.</text>
<text id="310004010">Then please, take this.</text>
<text id="310004020">...</text>
<text id="310004030">Deliver it to my father, who remains in the castle, if you please.</text>
<text id="310005000">Please, if you wouldn't mind. Deliver the letter to my father at the castle.</text>
<text id="310005010">He can be stubborn, but I'm sure he'll come around.</text>
<text id="310006000">I...I fear for father's life.</text>
<text id="310006010">The servants are full wroth. Filled with hatred for every one of us.</text>
<text id="310006020">They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with. They haven't spared a soul.</text>
<text id="310006030">I fear it's no different at Castle Morne...</text>
<text id="310006040">Please, I implore you.</text>
<text id="310006050">Would you mind taking a letter to my father, at the castle?</text>
<text id="310006060">My sole wish is that he escape, even if his honour should be the price.</text>
<text id="310006070">Please...I just want him to be safe...</text>
<text id="310010000">Hello? Is someone there?</text>
<text id="310010010">My name is Hyetta, and I'm journeying in search of the distant light.</text>
<text id="310010020">If I might be so bold as to ask...</text>
<text id="310010030">Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?</text>
<text id="310010040">My eyesight has been weak since birth, you see. I can't tell which way I'm supposed to go next.</text>
<text id="310010050">But when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel a distant light in the back of my eyes.</text>
<text id="310010070">It will lead me, to my true duty, as a Finger Maiden.</text>
<text id="310011000">Hello? Is someone there?</text>
<text id="310011010">Would you donate any Shabriri grapes in your possession to me?</text>
<text id="310011020">I'm on a pilgrimage in search of the distant light.</text>
<text id="310011030">And when I eat one of those grapes, I can feel the light in the back of my eyes.</text>
<text id="310012000">Oh, many thanks to you.</text>
<text id="310012010">Now I can feel the distant light once more.</text>
<text id="310012020">You are most kind, indeed.</text>
<text id="310012030">May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.</text>
<text id="310013000">You're not like the others who give me grapes, are you...</text>
<text id="310013010">They rest their trembling hands upon me.</text>
<text id="310013020">Howling wordlessly, they gently stroke my eyes.</text>
<text id="310013030">Their frail fingers, emaciated... Yet still, they give me the grapes.</text>
<text id="310013040">But you...seem somehow...firmer.</text>
<text id="310014000">Oh, many thanks to you.</text>
<text id="310014010">Now I can feel the distant light once more.</text>
<text id="310014020">That aside, I wonder what Shabriri grapes really are?</text>
<text id="310014030">Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...</text>
<text id="310014040">What a sight they must be to behold.</text>
<text id="310015000">N-No... That's not possible...</text>
<text id="310015010">Not all of those people... Their own...</text>
<text id="310015020">So those noises I heard were...</text>
<text id="310015030">...</text>
<text id="310015040"><retching></text>
<text id="310015050">Sorry... I'm alright now.</text>
<text id="310015060">Don't mind me...</text>
<text id="310016000">...</text>
<text id="310017000">Ah, is that you over there?</text>
<text id="310017010">I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.</text>
<text id="310017020">The reason why it was eyes I had to eat.</text>
<text id="310017030">The distant light is far and frail.</text>
<text id="310017040">So faint it can't be seen by the naked eye.</text>
<text id="310017050">But with everyone's eyes together, it appears.</text>
<text id="310017060">Finally, it all makes sense.</text>
<text id="310017070">I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.</text>
<text id="310019000">You are most kind, indeed.</text>
<text id="310019010">May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.</text>
<text id="310020000">You are most kind, indeed.</text>
<text id="310020010">May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.</text>
<text id="310021000">I wonder, what are Shabriri grapes?</text>
<text id="310021010">Delectably tender and sweet, yet searing...</text>
<text id="310021020">What a sight they must be to behold.</text>
<text id="310022000">I apologise. You only did as I asked.</text>
<text id="310022010">I'll be fine. Think no more of it.</text>
<text id="310023000">I've gleaned something very important indeed, thanks to you.</text>
<text id="310023010">I'm certain now. I will be a Finger Maiden.</text>
<text id="310030000">Oh hello, is that you over there?</text>
<text id="310030010">Have you ever heard of fingerprint grapes?</text>
<text id="310030020">They're special grapes which only grow on those who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers...</text>
<text id="310030030">I would truly love to try one...</text>
<text id="310030040">The distant light seems far closer than before,</text>
<text id="310030050">But I can't sense a thing from the usual grapes anymore...</text>
<text id="310030060">Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?</text>
<text id="310030070">Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.</text>
<text id="310031000">Oh, Oh!</text>
<text id="310031010">A fingerprint grape, tried and true, what a wondrous thing! A fingerprint grape!</text>
<text id="310031020">Ohh, how sweet, yet, how it burns...</text>
<text id="310031030">Thank you. I've composed myself again.</text>
<text id="310031040">May the blessing of the Fingers be upon you.</text>
<text id="310032000">Oh, that's right.</text>
<text id="310032010">...Might I ask a boon of you?</text>
<text id="310032020">Look after this for me, if you please.</text>
<text id="310032030">It's been so long, I don't know how I came upon it, but I've been looking for its owner.</text>
<text id="310032040">Now I'm to be a Maiden though, it'll never find its way home.</text>
<text id="310032050">Which is why I'd like you to have it.</text>
<text id="310032060">It must be very, very precious indeed.</text>
<text id="310033000">They're special grapes which only grow on those who've been clasped by the burnt Fingers...</text>
<text id="310033010">Please, could you donate a fingerprint grape to me?</text>
<text id="310033020">Without one I don't know, I feel like I might go mad.</text>
<text id="310034000">Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</text>
<text id="310034010">I'm sure I'll be a Finger Maiden.</text>
<text id="310040000">Ah, so you're here as well, are you?</text>
<text id="310040010">...I realised as we've talked.</text>
<text id="310040020">I'll be a Maiden, and you... Surely, a Lord.</text>
<text id="310040030">Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.</text>
<text id="310040040">It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.</text>
<text id="310040050">May the flame of chaos find purchase within you.</text>
<text id="310041000">Go to the door ahead, after divesting yourself of your possessions.</text>
<text id="310041010">It will surely open, and the Three Fingers will welcome you.</text>
<text id="310050000">Ahh, the flame of chaos has nestled within you.</text>
<text id="310050010">Could you please rest your hand upon me?</text>
<text id="310050020">Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...</text>
<text id="310051000">Oh, it burns...</text>
<text id="310051010">My eyes, my eyes, they're melting...</text>
<text id="310051020">Aaargh!</text>
<text id="310051030">...</text>
<text id="310052000">Could you please rest your hand upon me?</text>
<text id="310052010">Burn me with the flame, to make me your maiden...</text>
<text id="310053000">...</text>
<text id="310053010">Thank...thank you...</text>
<text id="310053020">I have touched them. The words of the Three Fingers.</text>
<text id="310053030">As your maiden, allow me to divine them.</text>
<text id="310053040">All that there is came from the One Great.</text>
<text id="310053050">Then came fractures, and births, and souls.</text>
<text id="310053060">But the Greater Will made a mistake.</text>
<text id="310053070">Torment, despair, affliction. Every sin, every curse.</text>
<text id="310053080">Every one, born of the mistake.</text>
<text id="310053090">And so, what was borrowed must be returned.</text>
<text id="310053100">Melt it all away, with the yellow chaos flame.</text>
<text id="310053110">Until all is One again.</text>
<text id="310054000">Those who gave me grapes howled without words.</text>
<text id="310054010">Saying they wished they were never born.</text>
<text id="310054020">Become their lord.</text>
<text id="310054030">Take their torment, despair. Their affliction. Every sin, every curse.</text>
<text id="310054040">And melt it all away. As the Lord of Chaos.</text>
<text id="310054050">No more fractures. No more birth...</text>
<text id="310054060">...</text>
<text id="310800000">Agh!</text>
<text id="310801000">What's happened to you?</text>
<text id="310801010">Please, you must stop this.</text>
<text id="310802000">Ah, why on earth?</text>
<text id="310802010">I do not wish to cause anyone harm.</text>
<text id="310803000">Oh, bless the stars.</text>
<text id="310803010">You've chosen to reconsider.</text>
<text id="310804000">Father...</text>
<text id="310804010">Please, be safe...</text>
<text id="310805000">Ahh, the distant light...fades...</text>
<text id="310805010">I'm so sorry, my dears...</text>
<text id="310900000"> </text>
<text id="310900010"> </text>
<text id="311001000">Ah, there's a face I've not seen before.</text>
<text id="311001010">I'm Edgar, warden of this castle as ordained by Lord Godrick himself.</text>
<text id="311001020">But you can see how things have turned out.</text>
<text id="311001030">The menials have all rebelled.</text>
<text id="311001040">They gave me good service, or so I thought, but it seems it was all an act.</text>
<text id="311001050">Foul creatures, as it's said. And true enough they're foul inside and out.</text>
<text id="311001060">I'm sorry to disappoint you,</text>
<text id="311001070">But whatever you've come here to do, I'm afraid Castle Morne won't hold much longer.</text>
<text id="311001080">Take this, by way of apology.</text>
<text id="311002000">Now then, away with you.</text>
<text id="311002010">You've no reason to risk your neck dawdling here, eh.</text>
<text id="311003000">I see, from Irina...</text>
<text id="311003010">Thank you. I'm in your debt.</text>
<text id="311003020">But I can't leave yet.</text>
<text id="311003030">Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain.</text>
<text id="311003040">To ensure the treasured sword of Morne does not fall into the wrong hands.</text>
<text id="311004000">If you see Irina, do tell her.</text>
<text id="311004010">That her father will come for her, once he's fulfilled his duty.</text>
<text id="311010000">I'm in your debt.</text>
<text id="311010010">For keeping the sword from those fallen creatures.</text>
<text id="311010020">I'm no longer bound by duty.</text>
<text id="311010030">Once I've rescued Irina, I will spend my remaining days with her.</text>
<text id="311011000">Thanks to you, I will be reunited with Irina.</text>
<text id="311011010">And devote my remaining days to her.</text>
<text id="311011020">Irina has a gentle nature, though.</text>
<text id="311011030">I only hope it remains intact.</text>
<text id="311020000">Irina...</text>
<text id="311020010">How could this be…</text>
<text id="311020020">My daughter deserved better…</text>
<text id="311020030">The fault lies...with me.</text>
<text id="311020040">I chose duty over my daughter's safety.</text>
<text id="311020050">And that is how fate has answered…</text>
<text id="311021000">I'll find them.</text>
<text id="311021010">The foul wretches responsible for this.</text>
<text id="311021020">I'll hunt them down, and exterminate every last one of them.</text>
<text id="311021030">Rest assured, Irina. It will be done.</text>
<text id="311800000">Ugh!</text>
<text id="311801000">What's this about?</text>
<text id="311801010">We need not fight, I assure you.</text>
<text id="311802000">I haven't a clue what's got into you,</text>
<text id="311802010">but as Lord of this castle, I will stand for it no longer!</text>
<text id="311803000">And now even your ilk have complicated matters.</text>
<text id="311804000">Please, enlighten me.</text>
<text id="311804010">What was the purpose of such folly?</text>
<text id="311805010">Please forgive me, Lord Godrick.</text>
<text id="311806000">No, not here, not yet…</text>
<text id="311806010">Forgive me, Iri…na…</text>
<text id="311810000">Ugh!</text>
<text id="311811000">What's the matter?</text>
<text id="311811010">Cease this at once.</text>
<text id="311812000">Ah, now I see!</text>
<text id="311812010">You had a hand in Irina's undoing!</text>
<text id="311812020">What could she have done to deserve that?</text>
<text id="311813010">I will not rest until they are eliminated.</text>
<text id="311814000">Forgive me, Irina…</text>
<text id="311814010">I will join you soon enough…</text>
<text id="311900000"> </text>
<text id="311900010"> </text>
<text id="311900020"> </text>
<text id="311910000"> </text>
<text id="311910010"> </text>
<text id="311910020"> </text>
<text id="311920010"> </text>
<text id="311920020"> </text>
<text id="311920030"> </text>
<text id="312001000">Oh, Tarnished, are you?</text>
<text id="312001010">How did you slip inside, with the gate closed?</text>
<text id="312001020">Hmph. No matter.</text>
<text id="312001030">If you can fell one of them, you're a champion, in my book.</text>
<text id="312001040">I am Jerren. Foolish old warrior, and witness.</text>
<text id="312001050">Incidentally, do you like a good festival, from time to time?</text>
<text id="312001060">Well, it's true, this fortress houses only the vanquished.</text>
<text id="312001070">But when the stars align, we celebrate.</text>
<text id="312001080">A war festival honoring the last battle and death of General Radahn,</text>
<text id="312001090">the mightiest demigod of the Shattering, and bearer of a Great Rune.</text>
<text id="312002000">Well, good.</text>
<text id="312002010">As you should. The festival affords glory to warriors.</text>
<text id="312002020">Then all you need is a little patience.</text>
<text id="312002030">When the stars align, the festival will be declared.</text>
<text id="312003000">Well, you're not much fun, are you, chum?</text>
<text id="312003010">No matter. One day you will see.</text>
<text id="312003020">That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.</text>
<text id="312004000">Have patience, mm.</text>
<text id="312004010">When the stars align, the festival will be declared.</text>
<text id="312005000">Go on, now.</text>
<text id="312005010">This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.</text>
<text id="312006000">One day you will see, chum.</text>
<text id="312006010">That true warriors bask in glory at the festival.</text>
<text id="312007000">Go on, now.</text>
<text id="312007010">This old geezer hasn't any use for you just yet.</text>
<text id="312020000">Well, I haven't heard that name in an age.</text>
<text id="312020010">Then you must serve Princess Ranni?</text>
<text id="312020020">The next time you speak to Iji, tell him this:</text>
<text id="312020030">The festival of Radahn will surely set Ranni's fate back into motion.</text>
<text id="312020040">By the by… Is that old fool still hammering out weapons?</text>
<text id="312020050">His enormous frame, cramped in that little place...</text>
<text id="312020060">Bit of a haughty sort. Strange fella, when I knew him.</text>
<text id="312020070">And funny thing, his swords were all blunt as stone.</text>
<text id="312020080">But not one of them decayed when faced with the scarlet rot...</text>
<text id="312030000">Champions, welcome!</text>
<text id="312030010">The stars have aligned! The festival is nigh!</text>
<text id="312030020">General Radahn, mightiest demigod of the Shattering, awaits you!</text>
<text id="312030030">Champions, prepare for battle! Defeat the General, claim glory, and grab that Great Rune!</text>
<text id="312030040">A celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!</text>
<text id="312031000">Are you good and prepared, young chum?</text>
<text id="312031010">The festival begins!</text>
<text id="312034000">But now, we must make merry.</text>
<text id="312034010">O gathering of champions, the revels begin!</text>
<text id="312034020">The celebration of war! The Radahn Festival!</text>
<text id="312035000">You will find the field of battle past the church ahead, upon the shore under the fort.</text>
<text id="312035010">General Radahn is there, even now.</text>
<text id="312035020">Divested of his wits, devouring corpses…</text>
<text id="312035030">And howling at the sky...</text>
<text id="312036000">I see...</text>
<text id="312036010">When you are ready, come to me again.</text>
<text id="312040000">At last, the war festival has ended.</text>
<text id="312040010">Brave champion, you have our gratitude.</text>
<text id="312040020">The celebration was spectacular. General Radahn is surely pleased.</text>
<text id="312040030">Festering with rot, and crippled by madness, all he wanted was an honourable death.</text>
<text id="312041000">Finally, my work is done.</text>
<text id="312041010">I am no longer bound to this fortress.</text>
<text id="312041020">I have a task in mind.</text>
<text id="312041030">Old business you could say. You wouldn't understand.</text>
<text id="312041040">May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.</text>
<text id="312042000">It's time I went on my way.</text>
<text id="312042010">May we meet again, if the fates deign it. Brave champion.</text>
<text id="312050000">Ah, well met.</text>
<text id="312050010">I hardly expected to see the champion of the festival here of all places.</text>
<text id="312050020">You didn't...know Sellen, did you?</text>
<text id="312050030">Well, whatever the case, she's dead now.</text>
<text id="312050040">Just put it behind you.</text>
<text id="312050050">She was known as the Graven Witch.</text>
<text id="312050060">Obsessed by the primeval current, countless sorcerers fell to her hand.</text>
<text id="312050070">The most dangerous mage in the entire history of Raya Lucaria's Academy.</text>
<text id="312051000">Oh, a Tarnished, are you?</text>
<text id="312051010">You didn't...know Sellen, did you?</text>
<text id="312052000">It is strange, though...</text>
<text id="312052010">The woman, she was like a husk, her soul already fled.</text>
<text id="312052020">I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.</text>
<text id="312052030">I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.</text>
<text id="312052040">A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.</text>
<text id="312053000">I suspect Sellen lives on, elsewhere.</text>
<text id="312053010">I'm sure she'll turn up eventually, in another body.</text>
<text id="312053020">A sickening thought, but one that won't stop gnawing at me.</text>
<text id="312060000">My thanks, for the aid given.</text>
<text id="312060010">I heard from Iji that Lady Ranni might have found herself a champion.</text>
<text id="312060020">But I didn't know he was talking about you.</text>
<text id="312060030">You've helped me fulfil an old promise.</text>
<text id="312060040">This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="312061000">My thanks, for the aid given.</text>
<text id="312061010">Always a pleasure to witness the festival champ put on a display.</text>
<text id="312061020">You've helped me fulfil an old promise.</text>
<text id="312061030">This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="312062000">My thanks, Tarnished, for the aid given.</text>
<text id="312062010">You've helped me fulfil an old promise.</text>
<text id="312062020">This is the least I can do for you. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="312063000">Well, I must be leaving now.</text>
<text id="312063010">Brave warrior, if the fates deign it...</text>
<text id="312063020">No, we shall indeed meet again, at the next glorious tourney.</text>
<text id="312064000">Well, I must be leaving now.</text>
<text id="312064010">If the fates deign it, may we meet again, Tarnished.</text>
<text id="312800000">Ugh!</text>
<text id="312800010">What's the matter with you?</text>
<text id="312800020">You trying to get revenge?</text>
<text id="312801000">Very well.</text>
<text id="312801010">If the Graven Witch put you under her spell, you must be eliminated...</text>
<text id="312801020">Before you can pose a threat to Caria.</text>
<text id="312802000">Rest now. Alongside the witch's corpse.</text>
<text id="312803000">You...are a menace...</text>
<text id="312803010">Iji...beware...</text>
<text id="312804000">Sellen, Graven Witch, enemy of Caria.</text>
<text id="312804010">I vow this time to crush both your frame and your primal glintstone.</text>
<text id="312804020">I am Jerren, bringer of your death. Do not forget.</text>
<text id="312805000">You must be eliminated...</text>
<text id="312900000"> </text>
<text id="312900010"> </text>
<text id="312900020"> </text>
<text id="313001000">Hello... Hello...</text>
<text id="313001010">Please... Over here...</text>
<text id="313002000">Hello... Hello...</text>
<text id="313002010">Right over here...</text>
<text id="313003000">Hello.</text>
<text id="313003010">It's rather chilly here, isn't it?</text>
<text id="313003020">My mistress sent me off on an errand...</text>
<text id="313003030">But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind.</text>
<text id="313003040">Could I ask you lend a hand, perhaps?</text>
<text id="313003050">That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it.</text>
<text id="313003060">I would be sure to provide ample reward.</text>
<text id="313003070">Only... He, too, is Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313003080">If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...</text>
<text id="313004000">Ohh, thank you dearly.</text>
<text id="313004010">What a blessing that we've met like this.</text>
<text id="313004020">The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...</text>
<text id="313004030">Please, I must have the necklace back.</text>
<text id="313005000">Yes, I see. Most unfortunate, but I'll have to make do.</text>
<text id="313005010">I know that some Tarnished balk at the thought of harming their own.</text>
<text id="313005020">But if you should change your mind, do not hesitate to speak to me again.</text>
<text id="313006000">Have you had a change of heart?</text>
<text id="313007000">The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way...</text>
<text id="313007010">Please, I must have the necklace back.</text>
<text id="313010000">Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace.</text>
<text id="313010010">Thank you kindly. I am in your debt.</text>
<text id="313010020">Did I forget to announce myself?</text>
<text id="313010030">I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313010040">I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house.</text>
<text id="313010050">You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,</text>
<text id="313010060">but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.</text>
<text id="313010070">Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.</text>
<text id="313010080">Please, take this.</text>
<text id="313010090">Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="313010100">Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree...</text>
<text id="313010110">But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,</text>
<text id="313010120">the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.</text>
<text id="313011000">Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you...</text>
<text id="313011010">This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road.</text>
<text id="313011020">But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage.</text>
<text id="313011030">Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.</text>
<text id="313011040">At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.</text>
<text id="313011050">It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.</text>
<text id="313011060">I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.</text>
<text id="313011070">I do hope that we can meet again.</text>
<text id="313012000">I've been waiting for you.</text>
<text id="313012010">I knew you had the stuff of champions.</text>
<text id="313012020">I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313012030">Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.</text>
<text id="313012040">I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="313013000">I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="313014000">Very well.</text>
<text id="313014010">Speak to me again once you are ready.</text>
<text id="313014020">You will find me here.</text>
<text id="313015000">Are you ready, then?</text>
<text id="313015010">I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313015020">Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress.</text>
<text id="313015030">I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="313016000">Give me your hand.</text>
<text id="313016010">I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="313020000">Hello... Hello...</text>
<text id="313020010">Right over here...</text>
<text id="313020020">But I hardly hold him in high regard.</text>
<text id="313020030">He seems to bear animosity toward the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313020040">Perhaps it is to be expected, only...</text>
<text id="313020050">his intent, while vicious, is also tenuous, as if his heart is not in it.</text>
<text id="313020060">Doesn't really seem like champion material, to me...</text>
<text id="313021000">Brave Tarnished, what is your business here?</text>
<text id="313021010">I'm afraid this is not a guest room.</text>
<text id="313021020">What's that peculiar look upon your face?</text>
<text id="313021030"><gasp></text>
<text id="313021040">Goodness, am I still a serpent?</text>
<text id="313021050">Oh, how dreadful...</text>
<text id="313021060">How dreadful indeed...</text>
<text id="313021070">Forgive my distress.</text>
<text id="313021080">I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance.</text>
<text id="313021090">Brave Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313021100">This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas.</text>
<text id="313021110">Please forgive the deception.</text>
<text id="313021120">Do understand. This duplicity is my own doing.</text>
<text id="313021130">Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.</text>
<text id="313022000">Lady Tanith is my mother.</text>
<text id="313022010">I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king.</text>
<text id="313022020">That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit.</text>
<text id="313022030">I am proud of what I am.</text>
<text id="313022040">But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, they wouldn't speak to me.</text>
<text id="313022050">And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits.</text>
<text id="313022060">But you are not like the rest.</text>
<text id="313023000">My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas,</text>
<text id="313023010">were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I.</text>
<text id="313023020">Now I share the secrets with you, as well.</text>
<text id="313023030">Please keep them safe from anyone else.</text>
<text id="313024000">Seek the old ruins in the cliff.</text>
<text id="313024010">At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.</text>
<text id="313024020">It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.</text>
<text id="313024030">I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.</text>
<text id="313024040">I do hope that we can meet again.</text>
<text id="313030000">Hello again. Brave Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313030010">As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313030020">Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.</text>
<text id="313031000">Have you ever...</text>
<text id="313031010">heard any strange sounds here at the manor?</text>
<text id="313031020">Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales...</text>
<text id="313031030">Oh fie, what am I saying?</text>
<text id="313031040">It just isn't possible. I must be tired.</text>
<text id="313032000">Um, oh, it's you.</text>
<text id="313032010">Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late.</text>
<text id="313032020">Hmm, well...</text>
<text id="313032030">I know I can trust you...</text>
<text id="313032040">I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night.</text>
<text id="313032050">It entered the room across the hall, and never came out.</text>
<text id="313032060">If I'm not mistaken,</text>
<text id="313032070">it took the form of a serpent, just like me...</text>
<text id="313032080">Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret,</text>
<text id="313032090">that Lady Tanith has kept from me?</text>
<text id="313032100">I realise that I shouldn't impose but,</text>
<text id="313032110">if you discover anything, would you please share?</text>
<text id="313032120">It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.</text>
<text id="313033000">The serpent that lurked in the shadows that night...</text>
<text id="313033010">It entered the room across the hall, and never came out.</text>
<text id="313033020">Perhaps the manor yet holds some secrets.</text>
<text id="313033030">If you discover anything, would you please share?</text>
<text id="313033040">It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.</text>
<text id="313034000">Really...</text>
<text id="313034010">Oh, so there was a secret after all...</text>
<text id="313034020">Oh my...</text>
<text id="313034030">Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...</text>
<text id="313034040">Was I not...</text>
<text id="313034050">born by the grace of a king?</text>
<text id="313035000">Hello again. Brave Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313035010">It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand,</text>
<text id="313035020">but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313035030">Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.</text>
<text id="313036000">Hello again. Brave Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313036010">Do you remember me? I am Rya. We spoke once in Liurnia.</text>
<text id="313036020">I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313036030">Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.</text>
<text id="313037000">A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313037010">I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="313037020">Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.</text>
<text id="313038000">Brave Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313038010">Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.</text>
<text id="313039000">Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls.</text>
<text id="313039010">Like breathing, or slithering scales.</text>
<text id="313039020">Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.</text>
<text id="313040000">Hmm, what is this?</text>
<text id="313040010">I remember this scent, distinctly.</text>
<text id="313040020">...</text>
<text id="313040030">Funny, isn't it.</text>
<text id="313040040">I am certain of it. I was born inside this.</text>
<text id="313040050">It's a part of my birth mother.</text>
<text id="313040060">You have my gratitude.</text>
<text id="313040070">Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid.</text>
<text id="313040080">I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="313040090">One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.</text>
<text id="313041000">Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me...</text>
<text id="313041010">Was I not...</text>
<text id="313041020">born by the grace of a king?</text>
<text id="313042000">I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="313042010">One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.</text>
<text id="313050000">Oh, it's you...</text>
<text id="313050010">I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you.</text>
<text id="313050020">I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual.</text>
<text id="313050030">Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents.</text>
<text id="313050040">Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me.</text>
<text id="313050050">You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,</text>
<text id="313050060">but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.</text>
<text id="313050070">I know that you have done so much for me.</text>
<text id="313050080">But I wish to ask one last kindness.</text>
<text id="313050090">Kill me, please.</text>
<text id="313050100">I thought that I feared nothing. But this...</text>
<text id="313050110">Free me from this accursed frame.</text>
<text id="313051000">Agh...</text>
<text id="313051010">Thank you... My champion...</text>
<text id="313051020">Mother...</text>
<text id="313052000">I'm to drink this, then?</text>
<text id="313052010">Yes, of course. You always were very kind.</text>
<text id="313052020">...</text>
<text id="313052030">Ahh... How delightfully sweet...</text>
<text id="313052040">And yet...</text>
<text id="313060000">I know that you have done so much for me.</text>
<text id="313060010">But I wish to ask one last kindness.</text>
<text id="313060020">Kill me, please.</text>
<text id="313060030">I thought that I feared nothing. But this...</text>
<text id="313060040">Free me from this accursed frame.</text>
<text id="313061000">You're not willing to kill me, are you.</text>
<text id="313061010">Hah...</text>
<text id="313061020">You've always been so kind. And uncompromising.</text>
<text id="313062000">I suppose I knew in my heart of hearts.</text>
<text id="313062010">How kind, and uncompromising, you always were.</text>
<text id="313070000">...</text>
<text id="313071000">Oh, it's you.</text>
<text id="313071010">Heaven knows what happened here,</text>
<text id="313071020">but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone.</text>
<text id="313071030">It feels rather quiet without them.</text>
<text id="313071040">But with you here, things will be just fine.</text>
<text id="313072000">I await Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="313072010">I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king.</text>
<text id="313072020">I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern.</text>
<text id="313072030">Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour.</text>
<text id="313072040">I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes.</text>
<text id="313800000">Please, stop, Brave Tarnished.</text>
<text id="313800010">You will only tire by striking this barrier.</text>
<text id="313801000">Besides, I am no foe of yours.</text>
<text id="313801010">Please, think this over.</text>
<text id="313802000">I see that you have reconsidered.</text>
<text id="313802010">Thank goodness.</text>
<text id="313900000"> </text>
<text id="313900100"> </text>
<text id="314001000">Ah, hello. You must be new here.</text>
<text id="314001010">I'm...</text>
<text id="314001020">Well, just call me Diallos.</text>
<text id="314001030">The honor of one's house holds little import in these lands.</text>
<text id="314001040">By the way, have you met a young woman named Lanya on your travels?</text>
<text id="314001050">She's my servant, but fickle as the wind.</text>
<text id="314001060">Take your eyes off her for but a moment and she's good as gone.</text>
<text id="314001070">If you find her, please be sure to tell me.</text>
<text id="314002000">Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya.</text>
<text id="314002010">She's a servant to my house.</text>
<text id="314002020">She's been my companion since childhood.</text>
<text id="314002030">I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this.</text>
<text id="314002040">Honestly, she's such a little tomboy.</text>
<text id="314010000">Lanya... Lanya...</text>
<text id="314010010">It's me, Diallos. Answer me, would you?</text>
<text id="314011000">Hello, friend. Tell me if you know, would you.</text>
<text id="314011010">The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends. The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished.</text>
<text id="314011020">They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand.</text>
<text id="314011030">"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."</text>
<text id="314011040">I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.</text>
<text id="314012000">Ah, you again, is it?</text>
<text id="314012010">The recusants sent a lackey.</text>
<text id="314012020">Can you believe they invited me to join them? Now! After what they did...</text>
<text id="314012030">I can scarcely believe it myself. Do they think me a fool?</text>
<text id="314012040">You might be surprised to learn I took them up on the offer.</text>
<text id="314012050">Then I only had to ask. The location of the recusant hideout.</text>
<text id="314012060">It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills.</text>
<text id="314012070">That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.</text>
<text id="314012080">Just you wait, wretched recusants.</text>
<text id="314012090">You'll rue the day you insulted my name by laying hands on Lanya.</text>
<text id="314012100">"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.</text>
<text id="314013000">Who on earth are you?</text>
<text id="314013010">Hmph, never mind. But tell me if you know, would you.</text>
<text id="314013020">The whereabouts of the hidden house of those despicable fiends. The recusants who hunt their fellow Tarnished.</text>
<text id="314013030">They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand.</text>
<text id="314013040">"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."</text>
<text id="314013050">I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.</text>
<text id="314014000">They laid hands upon my servant Lanya, and I refuse to let the insult stand.</text>
<text id="314014010">"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood."</text>
<text id="314014020">I, Diallos, swear to deliver the message.</text>
<text id="314015000">It's on Mt. Gelmir, found off the old road that leads west from the town of windmills.</text>
<text id="314015010">That's where they hide. The manor on the peak.</text>
<text id="314015020">Just you wait, wretched recusants.</text>
<text id="314015030">"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.</text>
<text id="314020000">Ah. Oh... I-it's you, is it?</text>
<text id="314020010">Well. Nice to see you again.</text>
<text id="314020020">So you've been invited as well, I see.</text>
<text id="314020030">Then we're comrades in arms, henceforth. You watch my back, and I'll watch yours, yes?</text>
<text id="314021000">I, um, I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya...</text>
<text id="314021010">Well, you see, I...</text>
<text id="314021020">After much internal debate, I've come to realise...</text>
<text id="314021030">Revenge is not the answer.</text>
<text id="314021040">According to Lady Tanith...</text>
<text id="314021050">I've got the stuff of champions.</text>
<text id="314021060">And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path.</text>
<text id="314021070">It hit me like a bolt from the blue...</text>
<text id="314021080">That my former thoughts were simple naiveté.</text>
<text id="314021090">Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya.</text>
<text id="314021100">That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.</text>
<text id="314021110">But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't make me a champion, will it.</text>
<text id="314021120">Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.</text>
<text id="314021130">But such is true of any road trod by champions.</text>
<text id="314022000">I always resented these hands.</text>
<text id="314022010">Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.</text>
<text id="314022020">But that won't be the case for long.</text>
<text id="314022030">They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions.</text>
<text id="314022040">"The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood" after all.</text>
<text id="314030000">Ah, it's you, is it.</text>
<text id="314030010">I'm terribly sorry, but would you mind giving me some time to myself?</text>
<text id="314030020">I haven't achieved anything at all thus far.</text>
<text id="314030030">Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again.</text>
<text id="314030040">I'm still yet to achieve anything.</text>
<text id="314030050">Perhaps I am a fool after all...</text>
<text id="314030060">No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.</text>
<text id="314030070">What an easy mark I must have been...</text>
<text id="314030080">How did it take me so long to realise, honestly...</text>
<text id="314030090">There's just no end to my foolishness, is there...</text>
<text id="314031000">It's just as my noble brother says.</text>
<text id="314031010">I'm a complete fool. I can't believe I thought I could become a champion.</text>
<text id="314032000">Perhaps I am a fool after all...</text>
<text id="314032010">No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.</text>
<text id="314032020">What an easy mark I must have been...</text>
<text id="314040000">Well. Aren't you full of beans.</text>
<text id="314040010">No wonder you're covered in muck.</text>
<text id="314041000">Oh? My friend, it's been far too long.</text>
<text id="314041010">I have to say you caught me at a rather low point.</text>
<text id="314041020">But...as you see, I've put all that behind me.</text>
<text id="314041030">Left the Volcano Manor. Forging my own path now. Making my own choices.</text>
<text id="314041040">Even a fool like me can look after some simple jars.</text>
<text id="314041050">Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow.</text>
<text id="314042000">A fool I may be, but I can look after some simple jars.</text>
<text id="314042010">Do you pity me? Well don't. I feel like for the first time in my life I'm on the straight and narrow.</text>
<text id="314051000">...Ah, you...</text>
<text id="314051010">Are the jars...they alright?</text>
<text id="314051020">Did I defend them?</text>
<text id="314052000">Then all is well...</text>
<text id="314052010">This fool proved his worth, in the end...</text>
<text id="314053000">Ha...ha ha...</text>
<text id="314053010">I see... I see...</text>
<text id="314053020">I've been a fool...to the last...</text>
<text id="314800000">Agh!</text>
<text id="314800010">What on earth was that for!</text>
<text id="314801000">Now I see. You're a wretched recusant!</text>
<text id="314801010">May you rue the day that you thought to trample me!</text>
<text id="314801020">The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!</text>
<text id="314801030">In blood!</text>
<text id="314802000">Lanya, your honour has been restored.</text>
<text id="314802010">As a charge of House Hoslow, you can rest easy.</text>
<text id="314803000">Ha ha...ha...</text>
<text id="314803010">I am the shame of House Hoslow after all...</text>
<text id="314810000">Ugh!</text>
<text id="314810010">What's the matter? Please, stop!</text>
<text id="314810020">I've no quarrel with the Volcano Manor.</text>
<text id="314810030">I will never brandish a sword again, I swear!</text>
<text id="314811000">Why on earth...?</text>
<text id="314811010">Wait, you're a poacher, aren't you?</text>
<text id="314811020">I'll turn my back on duty no more.</text>
<text id="314811030">The tale of House Hoslow is told in blood!</text>
<text id="314811040">In blood!</text>
<text id="314812000">Unharmed, thank the stars.</text>
<text id="314813000">Ahh, just what I deserve...</text>
<text id="314813010">For absconding from my duties...</text>
<text id="314813020">I'm sorry, my dear jars...</text>
<text id="314900000"> </text>
<text id="314900010"> </text>
<text id="314900020"> </text>
<text id="314910000"> </text>
<text id="314910010"> </text>
<text id="314910020"> </text>
<text id="316001000">Tarnished, are we? A wonder you should turn up here.</text>
<text id="316001010">I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly.</text>
<text id="316001020">Why are you here?</text>
<text id="316002000">Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries?</text>
<text id="316002010">Well, your aptitude does appear...passable.</text>
<text id="316002020">But one must choose one's masters wisely.</text>
<text id="316002030">I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria,</text>
<text id="316002040">as a reviled, apostate witch.</text>
<text id="316002050">Do you still wish to learn from me?</text>
<text id="316003000">Well, you are a piece of work.</text>
<text id="316003010">Very well. You are now my protégé in glintstone sorcery.</text>
<text id="316003020">But I refuse to coddle. Or cast kind words. Never.</text>
<text id="316003030">Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.</text>
<text id="316004000">Really.</text>
<text id="316004010">It's not every day I meet a Tarnished just milling about.</text>
<text id="316005000">What is it now? Why are you here again?</text>
<text id="316006000">...</text>
<text id="316006010">You are quite the enigma, aren't you...</text>
<text id="316007000">I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal...</text>
<text id="316007010">Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature, with a bit of luck.</text>
<text id="316008000">Yes, I think that would be wise.</text>
<text id="316008010">We must choose our masters wisely.</text>
<text id="316009000">Well? Have you made up your mind?</text>
<text id="316010000">Young apprentice. First things first.</text>
<text id="316010010">You are a tadpole when it comes to magic. Infantile. Without the legs to walk.</text>
<text id="316010020">So, to become a sorcerer, first, you must face your ignorance.</text>
<text id="316010030">Now, shall we start learning?</text>
<text id="316011000">There you are, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316011010">Shall we commence the lesson?</text>
<text id="316012000">You wish to continue the lesson?</text>
<text id="316012010">Very well, I have time aplenty.</text>
<text id="316020000">Our art draws upon the powers embedded in glintstone.</text>
<text id="316020010">But what is the nature of such power?</text>
<text id="316020020">Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos.</text>
<text id="316020030">Golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life, and houses its vitality,</text>
<text id="316020040">while glintstone contains residual life, and thus the vitality of the stars.</text>
<text id="316020050">It should not be forgotten,</text>
<text id="316020060">that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.</text>
<text id="316020070">A fact lost on most sorcerers, these days...</text>
<text id="316021000">Your appetite for learning is impressive.</text>
<text id="316021010">You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily.</text>
<text id="316021020">You must have a fabulous teacher.</text>
<text id="316030000">Hmm? What's on your mind?</text>
<text id="316031000">Well, well...</text>
<text id="316031010">Seluvis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again...</text>
<text id="316031020">But, fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge.</text>
<text id="316031030">The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.</text>
<text id="316031040">But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles.</text>
<text id="316031050">Now, he is the force that repulses the stars.</text>
<text id="316031060">If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement.</text>
<text id="316031070">And so, too, would Ranni's destiny.</text>
<text id="316040000">My apprentice, what happened to your nail?</text>
<text id="316040010">Perhaps you have a different view, but...</text>
<text id="316040020">That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.</text>
<text id="316040030">May I remove it for you?</text>
<text id="316041000">A wise choice. Let me neutralize it.</text>
<text id="316041010">But first...</text>
<text id="316041020">Listen up, wretched curse-peddler.</text>
<text id="316041030">This is a vile craft in which you engage.</text>
<text id="316041040">Let it be known.</text>
<text id="316041050">This is the beloved apprentice of Sellen, Graven Witch.</text>
<text id="316041060">I set a curse upon you and your meddling hand.</text>
<text id="316041070">Your death will not be a pleasant one.</text>
<text id="316041080">May you shudder between breaths in your sleep...</text>
<text id="316042000">If you prefer not, that is your prerogative.</text>
<text id="316042010">But let it be known.</text>
<text id="316042020">That foul thing is eyeing you from afar, plotting to enlist you as a pawn.</text>
<text id="316042030">If what I have told you one day rings true,</text>
<text id="316042040">by all means, come to me again.</text>
<text id="316050000">What's this sorcery, my apprentice?</text>
<text id="316050010">Ah, then you have seen Master Azur.</text>
<text id="316050020">Master Azur was a founding glintstone sorcerer, and my first teacher.</text>
<text id="316050030">A stern judge of men, but he must see something in you.</text>
<text id="316050040">You make us both proud.</text>
<text id="316050050">We can speak more later, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316060000">If you recall, I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="316060010">It was for attempting to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.</text>
<text id="316060020">The toothless pedantry peddled by the Carian royal family can rot for all I care.</text>
<text id="316060030">I want glintstone sorceries that open our minds, unbound by terrestrial taboos.</text>
<text id="316060040">No matter what we give in return.</text>
<text id="316060050">My apprentice. I presume nothing.</text>
<text id="316060060">Teacher and student are not bound to tread the same path.</text>
<text id="316060070">But hear me out, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316060080">I need your help to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.</text>
<text id="316060090">Perhaps this is a journey we could take together?</text>
<text id="316061000">Splendid. I thank you.</text>
<text id="316061010">This pleases me. It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.</text>
<text id="316061020">You must have a fabulous teacher.</text>
<text id="316062000">Forgive me, it was an outlandish idea to begin with.</text>
<text id="316062010">And I fear quite presumptuous of me, as well.</text>
<text id="316062020">Don't give it another thought, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316063000">Really? My apprentice.</text>
<text id="316063010">You must have given this quite some thought.</text>
<text id="316063020">Splendid. I thank you. This pleases me.</text>
<text id="316063030">It's been far too long since I found a fellow kindred spirit.</text>
<text id="316064000">There you are, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316064010">Shall we commence the lesson?</text>
<text id="316065000">You wish to resume the lesson?</text>
<text id="316065010">Indeed, that would be the wiser option.</text>
<text id="316070000">I need your help, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316070010">Master Lusat is another founding glintstone sorcerer.</text>
<text id="316070020">And like Master Azur, he was banished from the academy. Now he languishes, imprisoned somewhere.</text>
<text id="316070030">My apprentice, can you find Master Lusat?</text>
<text id="316070040">With this glintstone key, you should be able to cross the boundary that encloses him.</text>
<text id="316071000">I need him to restore the primeval current of glintstone sorcery.</text>
<text id="316071010">He's nigh a child of the stars, such is his body now...</text>
<text id="316072000">After his expulsion from the academy, I heard that Master Lusat returned to his home.</text>
<text id="316072010">A place called Sellia, in the eastern Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="316072020">Thinking about it, I obtained the glintstone key I gave you from a Sellian sorcerer.</text>
<text id="316072030">It wouldn't be too much of a leap to suppose he's still cooped up nearby...</text>
<text id="316080000">Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...</text>
<text id="316080010">You have my gratitude. This is all your work.</text>
<text id="316080020">I am truly pleased to have you as an apprentice, and a kindred spirit.</text>
<text id="316080030">This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="316080040">This brings us a full step closer.</text>
<text id="316080050">The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the Academy.</text>
<text id="316080060">If only I could undo these wretched shackles...</text>
<text id="316081000">This brings us a full step closer.</text>
<text id="316081010">The bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat can be admitted to the academy.</text>
<text id="316081020">If only I could undo these wretched shackles...</text>
<text id="316090000">My apprentice. Give me a moment later.</text>
<text id="316090010">I have a favour to ask.</text>
<text id="316090020">The form you see before you is merely a projection.</text>
<text id="316090030">My body lies elsewhere. But the academy's shackles prevent it being moved.</text>
<text id="316090040">My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,</text>
<text id="316090050">imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum.</text>
<text id="316090060">Can you make the journey to my body?</text>
<text id="316090070">I have something that I can only trust with you.</text>
<text id="316092000">My body is on the Weeping Peninsula, at the southern tip of the Lands Between,</text>
<text id="316092010">imprisoned in the ruins just down from the Church of Marika, past the plain of the Wandering Mausoleum.</text>
<text id="316092020">Can you make the journey to my body?</text>
<text id="316092030">I have something that I can only trust with you.</text>
<text id="316100000">My apprentice, thank you for coming.</text>
<text id="316100010">These shackles take a toll on us all.</text>
<text id="316100020">There is something I need you to look after.</text>
<text id="316100030">My primal glintstone.</text>
<text id="316101000">A star has fallen, and my fortunes waver.</text>
<text id="316101010">Someone may come for my life. And so, I entrust it with you.</text>
<text id="316101020">My self.</text>
<text id="316102000"><groaning in pain></text>
<text id="316102010"> </text>
<text id="316103000"><panting></text>
<text id="316103010"> </text>
<text id="316103020">Thank you...my apprentice...</text>
<text id="316103030">This...is my essence. Please, treat it with care.</text>
<text id="316104000"><shivering moans></text>
<text id="316104010"> </text>
<text id="316104020"> </text>
<text id="316104030">It will do no good, I swear it...</text>
<text id="316104040">...and yet you persist, you frothing degenerates...</text>
<text id="316104050">A...argh!</text>
<text id="316104060"><shivering moans></text>
<text id="316105000">Treat it with care, my apprentice...</text>
<text id="316105010">What you hold is my very being...</text>
<text id="316110000">My apprentice, just how long has it been?</text>
<text id="316110010">Thank you. You've helped me fill a new body, once again.</text>
<text id="316110020">And it's truly a gem. Young and full of vigor, a snug fit for my Primal Glintstone.</text>
<text id="316110030">Better still, I've shed those awful shackles.</text>
<text id="316110040">Finally, I can return to the academy.</text>
<text id="316110050">To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.</text>
<text id="316110060">My dear apprentice, I owe this all to you.</text>
<text id="316111000">Finally, I can return to the academy.</text>
<text id="316111010">To expel the Carian royal family, and restore the primeval current.</text>
<text id="316112000">My apprentice, shall we commence the lesson?</text>
<text id="316112010">As thanks for procuring this new form, I'll be holding you to a higher standard.</text>
<text id="316113000">You wish to resume the lesson?</text>
<text id="316113010">Have I not been strict enough, I wonder?</text>
<text id="316120000">Ahh, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316120010">You've saved my skin once again.</text>
<text id="316120020">Do you see this? The Queen of Caria is no more.</text>
<text id="316120030">With the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat returned, the academy can hone the primeval current.</text>
<text id="316120040">So that we, fallen children of the stars, shall beam with brilliance once again.</text>
<text id="316120050">My apprentice. Will you stay with us, here at the academy?</text>
<text id="316120060">Oh, I know it's not possible.</text>
<text id="316120070">You have your own calling. To be the next Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="316120080">But do think of me.</text>
<text id="316120090">Of your teacher. On the eve of your crowning.</text>
<text id="316120100">You will always be my darling pupil.</text>
<text id="316120110">Rest assured that I...</text>
<text id="316120120">No, the entire academy, will swear allegiance to the new monarch.</text>
<text id="316120130">My apprentice. Become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="316121000">Hmm, perhaps I'm jumping ahead,</text>
<text id="316121010">but here is a symbol of my allegiance, and the academy's.</text>
<text id="316122000">Do you recall what once I told you?</text>
<text id="316122010">That glintstone is the amber of the cosmos, and sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.</text>
<text id="316122020">When you become Elden Lord, please illuminate me.</text>
<text id="316122030">Lay bare the secrets of life which course the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="316122040">Next time, I will be your student.</text>
<text id="316123000">Oh, one last thing.</text>
<text id="316123010">If you fail to claim your throne,</text>
<text id="316123020">you can always pay me a visit.</text>
<text id="316123030">Oh, don't fret. Even my dullest pupils will always have a place here.</text>
<text id="316123040"> </text>
<text id="316125000">What is it? My apprentice.</text>
<text id="316126000">Ahh, I am glad to see you. My apprentice.</text>
<text id="316126010">Would you like a lesson? I'm always glad to further your education.</text>
<text id="316127000">It warms my heart. That you still think of me.</text>
<text id="316127010">Yet I still yearn, for you to find Master Lusat.</text>
<text id="316127020">His body is needed. At the academy, to hone the primeval current...</text>
<text id="316128000">Who could've guessed. What a place to find Master Lusat...</text>
<text id="316128010">Oh, this is wonderful news. Now, his body will be brought home.</text>
<text id="316128020">And when the bodies of Masters Azur and Lusat are together, the academy can hone the primeval current.</text>
<text id="316128030">So that we, fallen children of the stars, will beam once again.</text>
<text id="316128040">I am most grateful. There are no others who would have done this.</text>
<text id="316128050">What a joy to have you as an apprentice, and kindred spirit.</text>
<text id="316128060">This is a mere token of my thanks. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="316129000">You wish to resume the lesson?</text>
<text id="316129010">Good. Indeed, it is better to finish what one starts, is it not?</text>
<text id="316129030">With the body of Master Azur returned, the academy can restore the primeval current.</text>
<text id="316129040">So that we, fallen children of the stars, might beam with brilliance once again.</text>
<text id="316130000">Jerren, bringer of my death.</text>
<text id="316130010">You have my gratitude. For freeing me from my shackles.</text>
<text id="316130020">But I am afraid your work is done.</text>
<text id="316130030">Join the school. To reflect on your mistake.</text>
<text id="316140000">U...urgh</text>
<text id="316140010">M-my...apprentice...</text>
<text id="316140020">I-I'm...</text>
<text id="316141000">My...apprentice...</text>
<text id="316150000">Oh, is that a scroll? Takes me back to my academy days.</text>
<text id="316150010">Very well. This is sorcery with which I'm not entirely unfamiliar.</text>
<text id="316150020">I'll be sure to incorporate it into one of your lessons.</text>
<text id="316150030">Never lose that inquisitive spirit, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316800000">What's the meaning of this?</text>
<text id="316801000">How unfortunate.</text>
<text id="316801010">That we should part ways in this manner...</text>
<text id="316802000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="316803000">Why, you. Are you mad?</text>
<text id="316804000">My death would only be temporary.</text>
<text id="316804010">Your savagery achieves nothing.</text>
<text id="316805000">Agh!</text>
<text id="316806000">Why, you. Are you mad?</text>
<text id="316806010">Another moment of this, and no amount of grovelling will spare you.</text>
<text id="316807000">You sadden me, my apprentice.</text>
<text id="316808000">Ahh, how can this be...</text>
<text id="316808010">...every fallen child... must shine again...</text>
<text id="316809000">For a time, I believed us kindred spirits.</text>
<text id="316809010">My apprentice...</text>
<text id="316900000"> </text>
<text id="316900010"> </text>
<text id="316900020"> </text>
<text id="318001000">If it isn't Nerijus. The Bloody Finger.</text>
<text id="318001010">The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.</text>
<text id="318010000">Just joining the fray, Tarnished?</text>
<text id="318010010">Well, you fought Nerijus and survived. That alone deserves commendation.</text>
<text id="318010020">I am Yura. Hunter of Bloody Fingers.</text>
<text id="318010030">Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.</text>
<text id="318010040">If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.</text>
<text id="318010050">Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.</text>
<text id="318010060">Don't let your emotions stay your blade.</text>
<text id="318010900">Well, you fought Nerijus and made good your escape. Fortune favours you, it seems.</text>
<text id="318011000">Oh, one other thing...</text>
<text id="318011010">There are other Tarnished, like me, who hunt the Bloody Fingers.</text>
<text id="318011020">If a Bloody Finger threatens you, use this ring.</text>
<text id="318011030">If fortune takes your side, a hunter will come to your aid.</text>
<text id="318013000">Just joining the fray, Tarnished?</text>
<text id="318013010">I am Yura, hunter of Bloody Fingers.</text>
<text id="318013020">Have you ever faced a Bloody Finger?</text>
<text id="318013030">They are Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.</text>
<text id="318013040">If you stay the path, you will face this blight, sooner or later.</text>
<text id="318013050">Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.</text>
<text id="318013060">Don't let your emotions stay your blade.</text>
<text id="318014000">If fortune remains on your side, a hunter will come to your aid.</text>
<text id="318015000">One last word of warning.</text>
<text id="318015010">Stay clear of Agheel Lake. A great dragon roosts there.</text>
<text id="318016000">Be on your way.</text>
<text id="318016010">Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.</text>
<text id="318020000">Well, we meet again.</text>
<text id="318020010">Beware. A great dragon roosts at Agheel Lake.</text>
<text id="318020020">And it's as fearsome as it is majestic.</text>
<text id="318020030">So, unless you're mad, or wish to be burned alive...</text>
<text id="318020040">stay clear of the lake.</text>
<text id="318021000">Hmm, I gave you fair warning.</text>
<text id="318021010">To stay clear of Agheel Lake, a known dragon roost.</text>
<text id="318021020">Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.</text>
<text id="318022000">Don't be a fool. Turn back, before it's too late.</text>
<text id="318023000">Ah, we meet again.</text>
<text id="318023010">To have fought Nerijus and lived, you must have seen your share of battle.</text>
<text id="318023020">To have fought Nerijus and escaped, fortune must smile upon you indeed.</text>
<text id="318023030">I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.</text>
<text id="318023040">Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.</text>
<text id="318023050">If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.</text>
<text id="318023060">Just remember. No kinship with their ilk remains. Their madness precludes it.</text>
<text id="318023070">Don't let your emotions stay your blade.</text>
<text id="318024000">Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.</text>
<text id="318024010">You'd do well to steer clear of Agheel Lake, fledgling. A dragon roosts there...</text>
<text id="318025000">You bloody halfwit.</text>
<text id="318025010">Picking a fight with a dragon?</text>
<text id="318025020">Well, I can tell you want to see it through.</text>
<text id="318025030">Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.</text>
<text id="318026000">Ah, we meet again.</text>
<text id="318026010">I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.</text>
<text id="318026020">Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots who stalk their own.</text>
<text id="318026030">If you stay the path, you are certain to face more of them.</text>

<text id="318026050">Don't let your emotions stay your blade.</text>
<text id="318027000">Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.</text>
<text id="318027010">And quite the fool, by the look of it.</text>
<text id="318027020">Picking a fight with a dragon? Hah.</text>
<text id="318027030">Well, I can tell you want to see it through.</text>
<text id="318027040">Seems I'm forever crossing paths with hotheads like you.</text>
<text id="318028000">I can tell you want to see it through.</text>
<text id="318028010">Fools will be fools. Fight all the dragons you like.</text>
<text id="318030000">There you are. That was my first dragon hunt in quite some time.</text>
<text id="318030010">Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.</text>
<text id="318030040">Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know.</text>
<text id="318030050">That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.</text>
<text id="318030060">If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,</text>
<text id="318030070">then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.</text>
<text id="318031000">You must not forget, though.</text>
<text id="318031010">Those who partake in Dragon Communion will one day shed their humanity.</text>
<text id="318031020">Their hunger for dragon, their yearning, only worsens.</text>
<text id="318031030">Until the floodgates burst, unleashing eternal torment.</text>
<text id="318031040">The strength of a mighty dragon. Magnificent, but deadly.</text>
<text id="318031050">It's no surprise that Dragon Communion is ruinous.</text>
<text id="318032000">Beautiful work, felling that dragon.</text>
<text id="318032010">And as such, there's something you might like to know.</text>
<text id="318033000">...</text>
<text id="318033010">Wretched worms, leave me be...</text>
<text id="318033020"> </text>
<text id="318034000">Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.</text>
<text id="318034010">That was my first dragon hunt in quite a while.</text>
<text id="318034020">Paired up with a hothead like you, it was just like old times.</text>
<text id="318034030">Now that you've so impressively felled that dragon, there's something you should know.</text>
<text id="318034040">The heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.</text>
<text id="318034050">If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,</text>
<text id="318034060">then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.</text>
<text id="318035000">Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.</text>
<text id="318035010">Beautiful work, felling that dragon.</text>
<text id="318035020">And as such, there's something you might like to know.</text>
<text id="318035030">That heart you brought back. It's used in Dragon Communion.</text>
<text id="318035040">If you should find yourself overcome by hunger for the heart, yearning for its strength,</text>
<text id="318035050">then seek the decrepit church on the little island off the western coast.</text>
<text id="318040000">Ah, oh, it's you. Thanks for your help there.</text>
<text id="318040010">That Bloody Finger was a thorn in my side. And now I'm finally rid of him.</text>
<text id="318040020">Here's a token of thanks. Please, take it.</text>
<text id="318041000">I may not have much time.</text>
<text id="318041010">I'm dying to see you, Eleonora... Violet Bloody Finger...</text>
<text id="318042000">Yes, I've been tracking Eleonora for quite some time.</text>
<text id="318042010">She is the deadliest of all Bloody Fingers. She's felled many an old hand already.</text>
<text id="318042020">But in spite of her cessblood zealotry, Eleonora is a proud knight.</text>
<text id="318042030">If she comes for you, do not think twice. You must flee.</text>
<text id="318042040">There is no shame in self-preservation.</text>
<text id="318043000">Be on your way.</text>
<text id="318043010">Perhaps we will meet again, if fate permits.</text>
<text id="318070000">Eleonora, it seems I am no match for you.</text>
<text id="318070010">But I've learned a thing or two myself, you see.</text>
<text id="318070020">I've sliced the finger off.</text>
<text id="318070030">Please, please, Eleonora, yield to the cessblood no longer.</text>
<text id="318070040">Do not stain the immaculacy of your sword, your flesh, your fire...</text>
<text id="318080000">Finally, we meet.</text>
<text id="318080010">The Tarnished, who would be Lord.</text>
<text id="318080020">Oh my, why the long face?</text>
<text id="318080030">I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel.</text>
<text id="318080040">Well, that is most unfortunate. For he is dead.</text>
<text id="318080050">As for his flesh, he gave it to me, Shabriri.</text>
<text id="318080060">I hope you can make your peace with that.</text>
<text id="318081000">You are about to sacrifice something precious.</text>
<text id="318081010">The life of a fair maiden, that you would toss into the fiery forge.</text>
<text id="318081020">Only so that you may be Lord.</text>
<text id="318081030">What a horrible thing to ponder.</text>
<text id="318081040">Your ascendency requires her sacrifice, whether she wishes it or not.</text>
<text id="318081050">But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?</text>
<text id="318082000">Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord, dare to tread the path of true rigor.</text>
<text id="318082010">Spare the poor girl, and singe your own flesh in her stead.</text>
<text id="318082020">If you are prepared to show resolve,</text>
<text id="318082030">and attain Lordship through righteous hardship,</text>
<text id="318082040">then heed the words of I, Shabriri.</text>
<text id="318083000">Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.</text>
<text id="318083010">Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.</text>
<text id="318083020">Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.</text>
<text id="318083030">If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling,</text>
<text id="318083040">and the girl can be spared.</text>
<text id="318083050">...setting you on the righteous path of lordship.</text>
<text id="318083060">The path of the Lord of Chaos.</text>
<text id="318083070">Burn the Erdtree to the ground,</text>
<text id="318083080">and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.</text>
<text id="318083090">Ahh, may chaos take the world!</text>
<text id="318083100">May chaos take the world!</text>
<text id="318084000">Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.</text>
<text id="318084010">Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.</text>
<text id="318084020">Seek audience with the Three Fingers, and the flame of frenzy.</text>
<text id="318085000">Burn the Erdtree to the ground,</text>
<text id="318085010">and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.</text>
<text id="318085020">Ahh, may chaos take the world!</text>
<text id="318085030">May chaos take the world!</text>
<text id="318800000">Ugh.</text>
<text id="318801000">That will be quite enough.</text>
<text id="318801010">What do you stand to gain by challenging me?</text>
<text id="318802000">Too late for you, eh?</text>
<text id="318802010">Well, if you've succumbed to cessblood...</text>
<text id="318802020">it's better that I finish you here.</text>
<text id="318803000">I had no choice.</text>
<text id="318803010">Your death could have been much worse.</text>
<text id="318804000">What a wretched fate.</text>
<text id="318804010">Why did you turn foul...</text>
<text id="318805000">I must not die...</text>
<text id="318805010">until she is eradicated...</text>
<text id="318805020"> </text>
<text id="318820000">What's this?</text>
<text id="318821000">Well, this is peculiar.</text>
<text id="318821010">Is this how you express contempt?</text>
<text id="318822000">This, I did not expect.</text>
<text id="318822010">But if you do not care for Lordship,</text>
<text id="318822020">I'm afraid you are of no use.</text>
<text id="318823000">How very unfortunate.</text>
<text id="318823010">I did not take you for a fraud.</text>
<text id="318824000">Shabriri is chaos incarnate. I cannot die.</text>
<text id="318824010">Until we meet again, in another place or time.</text>
<text id="318824020">Ahh, may chaos take the world!</text>
<text id="318900000"> </text>
<text id="318900010"> </text>
<text id="318900020"> </text>
<text id="318910000"> </text>
<text id="318910010"> </text>
<text id="318910020"> </text>
<text id="319001000">There's no mistake, is there?</text>
<text id="319001010">Death has left its mark once again.</text>
<text id="319001020">I'm sorry, I cannot give you your proper rites...</text>
<text id="319001030">But at least you did not join Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="319001040">Your soul will return to the Erdtree, in time.</text>
<text id="319001050">Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.</text>
<text id="319002000">Ah, a Tarnished, are you?</text>
<text id="319002010">I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.</text>
<text id="319002020">Heed my warning.</text>
<text id="319002030">The village here has been touched by Death.</text>
<text id="319002040">And worse yet, it is home to a mariner.</text>
<text id="319002050">If you value your life, then go no further.</text>
<text id="319003000">The village here has been touched by Death.</text>
<text id="319003010">Turn back, while you still can.</text>
<text id="319010000">Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?</text>
<text id="319010010">But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.</text>
<text id="319010020">...</text>
<text id="319010030">How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?</text>
<text id="319010040">If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,</text>
<text id="319010050">then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.</text>
<text id="319010060">I have a matter of my own to attend to.</text>
<text id="319010070">And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.</text>
<text id="319010080">What say you?</text>
<text id="319011000">Very well. Show me your map.</text>
<text id="319011010">...</text>
<text id="319011020">I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.</text>
<text id="319011030">It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.</text>
<text id="319012000">I have a matter of my own to attend to.</text>
<text id="319012010">I spotted the mark of the centipede here in the village.</text>
<text id="319012020">An ill-omened symbol that should not be.</text>
<text id="319012030">Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="319012040">And must be eradicated.</text>
<text id="319013000">What is it? Still milling about?</text>
<text id="319013010">The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.</text>
<text id="319013020">It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.</text>
<text id="319014000">Well, all right, then.</text>
<text id="319014010">No sense in forcing you.</text>
<text id="319015000">What now? Had a change of heart?</text>
<text id="319016000">Ah, a Tarnished, are you?</text>
<text id="319016010">With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.</text>
<text id="319016020">...</text>
<text id="319016030">I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.</text>
<text id="319016040">How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?</text>

<text id="319016080">And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.</text>
<text id="319020000">Ha! Prince of Death, take a good long look!</text>
<text id="319020010">See the wrath of the Golden Order! The Order's justice, writ in blood!</text>
<text id="319020020">This is what's become of your precious witch! Naught but expired meat and bone!</text>
<text id="319020030">This is a proper death, O Prince!</text>
<text id="319020040">Look at this rotten whore. No more children can be got from this useless flesh!</text>
<text id="319020050">Behold, your mother is dead!</text>
<text id="319020060">Heh heh heh heh...</text>
<text id="319020070">This is revenge, you witch! And you, you ghoul! This is the wrath of D!</text>
<text id="319021000">Ah. Hello.</text>
<text id="319021010">The rotten witch is dead. The Golden Order, unsullied.</text>
<text id="319021020">Now I can look my brother Darian in the eye.</text>
<text id="319021030">Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit.</text>
<text id="319022000">Darian, now I have no regrets.</text>
<text id="319022010">Honeyed rays of gold, deliver my spirit.</text>
<text id="319030000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="319031000">Ah, aah...</text>

<text id="319033010">YESSS!</text>
<text id="319033020">Soon you will know, filthy witch...</text>
<text id="319033030">Soon you will know... Vengeance for Darian.</text>
<text id="319033040">The wrath of D...</text>
<text id="319120000">I don't believe we've met.</text>
<text id="319120010">I'm known as D. I hunt down Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot.</text>
<text id="319120020">Heed my warning.</text>
<text id="319120030">Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.</text>
<text id="319120040">All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.</text>
<text id="319120050">Unless you wish to lay down your life in vain.</text>
<text id="319121000">Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.</text>
<text id="319121010">All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.</text>
<text id="319122000">Ah...we meet again.</text>
<text id="319122010">I'm glad you took my warning to heart.</text>
<text id="319122020">Those Who Live in Death should be left well alone.</text>
<text id="319122030">All the more, should you spy a mariner among their number.</text>
<text id="319130000">Well, well...</text>
<text id="319130010">Another fool who won't listen to reason, eh?</text>
<text id="319130020">But with a prowess for weeding Deathroot.</text>
<text id="319130030">With a prowess for weeding Deathroot.</text>
<text id="319130040">...</text>
<text id="319130050">How would you like to earn the strength of beasts?</text>
<text id="319130060">If you're inclined to hunt more of Those Who Live in Death, and weed their Deathroot,</text>
<text id="319130070">then I'll introduce you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.</text>
<text id="319130080">I have a matter of my own to attend to.</text>
<text id="319130090">And the beast himself wishes for someone to take my place.</text>
<text id="319130100">What say you?</text>
<text id="319131000">Very well. Show me your map.</text>
<text id="319131010">...</text>
<text id="319131020">I've marked the location for you. Of a hidden gateway.</text>
<text id="319131030">It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.</text>
<text id="319132000">I have a matter of my own to attend to.</text>
<text id="319132010">I've spotted the mark of the centipede.</text>
<text id="319132020">An ill-omened symbol that should not be.</text>
<text id="319132030">Someone, or something, threatens the sanctity of the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="319132040">And must be eradicated.</text>
<text id="319133000">What is it? Still milling about?</text>
<text id="319133010">The map indicates where the gateway is hidden.</text>
<text id="319133020">It will lead you to Gurranq, the beast clergyman.</text>
<text id="319134000">Well, all right, then.</text>
<text id="319134010">No sense in forcing you.</text>
<text id="319135000">What's wrong? Got cold feet, have you?</text>
<text id="319140000">You've met Gurranq, I take it?</text>
<text id="319140010">Then owing to our duties shared, we are now comrades-in-arms.</text>
<text id="319140020">I think you've earned this.</text>
<text id="319140030">The power of the Golden Order, to aid the hunt of Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="319141000">Did you need something else?</text>
<text id="319142000">Ah, hello there. What can I do for you?</text>
<text id="319143000">Ah, hello. You've been busy weeding Deathroot, I take it.</text>
<text id="319143010">I thank you, as your brother-in-arms.</text>
<text id="319143020">So what can I do for you?</text>
<text id="319144000">Ah, hello again.</text>
<text id="319144010">You haven't gone to see Gurranq yet, have you?</text>
<text id="319144020">Well, no rush. You do as you please.</text>
<text id="319144030">Just as long as he doesn't starve to death, eh.</text>
<text id="319145000">Go to Gurranq only if you feel the time is right.</text>
<text id="319145010">Killing Those Who Live in Death and weeding their Deathroot...</text>
<text id="319145020">Is a path not to be trod without ample resolve.</text>
<text id="319150000">I serve the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="319150010">That I might put this crooked land to rights.</text>
<text id="319150020">Following only the guidance of the great Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="319150030">Those Who Live in Death fall outside the principles of the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="319150040">Their mere existence sullies the guidance of gold. Tainting its truth.</text>
<text id="319150050">And so it is the vermin must be exterminated... Down to the very last.</text>
<text id="319151000">Are you acquainted with a man named Rogier?</text>
<text id="319151010">You know, the piteous fellow hiding away on the balcony?</text>
<text id="319151020">He was a formidable spellblade, in times past.</text>
<text id="319151030">Don't let his easy air deceive you. He was wise beyond his years, stout of heart and clear of mind.</text>
<text id="319151040">No more though.</text>
<text id="319151050">You see him now, ravaged by thorns, muttering and rambling...</text>
<text id="319151060">Like he's half dead already. I can't stomach to watch.</text>
<text id="319151070">Take well the lesson, friend.</text>
<text id="319151080">That's how you end up, when seduced by Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="319151090">When grace is sullied, it rots people from the inside. Breaks them.</text>
<text id="319152000">Well, what have we here?</text>
<text id="319152010">How did you get your hands on that dagger?</text>
<text id="319152020">...</text>
<text id="319152030">Well. That hardly matters.</text>
<text id="319152040">I know very well whose dagger it is.</text>
<text id="319152050">Why don't I return it to them for you?</text>
<text id="319152060">Good work, bringing this to me.</text>
<text id="319800000"><wince></text>
<text id="319800010">Don't you dare.</text>
<text id="319800020">Unless you want to die like a dog?</text>
<text id="319801000">Very well.</text>
<text id="319801010">Honeyed rays of gold, deliver this spirit.</text>
<text id="319802000">I swear, there's a blight spreading amongst the Tarnished.</text>
<text id="319803000">How could this...happen...?</text>
<text id="319803010">Forgive me, Devin... D-Devin...</text>
<text id="319810000">Oof!</text>
<text id="319810010">What's the meaning of this?</text>
<text id="319810020">Has she bewitched you?</text>
<text id="319811000">Very well.</text>
<text id="319811010">Then you are a blight.</text>
<text id="319811020">A defiler of the Golden Order, and murderer of my brother!</text>
<text id="319811030">Die! Die! Die!</text>
<text id="319811040">I'll grind your corpse into that vile wench's rotting remains.</text>
<text id="319811050">A witch's eternal embrace, just as you wished!</text>
<text id="319812000">You defiled cretin. My brother is now avenged!</text>
<text id="319813000">How could this...</text>
<text id="319813010">Forgive me, Darian... D-Darian...</text>
<text id="319900000"> </text>
<text id="319900010"> </text>
<text id="319900020"> </text>
<text id="319910000"> </text>
<text id="319910010"> </text>
<text id="319910020"> </text>
<text id="320001000">Everyone's...been grafted.</text>
<text id="320001010">Everyone who came with me. They crossed the sea for me. They fought, for me.</text>
<text id="320001020">Heh...</text>
<text id="320001030">Only to have their arms taken. Their legs taken. Even their heads...taken. Taken and stuck to the spider.</text>
<text id="320001040">Did you know? If you're grafted by the spider, you become a chrysalid.</text>
<text id="320001050">It's quite the lark, when you think about it.</text>
<text id="320002000">You're all on your own, are you?</text>
<text id="320002010">And heading to Stormveil Castle?</text>
<text id="320002020">Enticed by the one in the white mask, I suppose. Oh, you've come to be one with the spider?</text>
<text id="320002030">Well, that makes us two peas in a pod.</text>
<text id="320002040">But I don't have your courage.</text>
<text id="320002050">It's scary, you know. Having your arms cut off. Or legs. Or your head.</text>
<text id="320002060">I want to be like everyone else, but I'm just too scared.</text>
<text id="320002070">I'm nothing but a craven.</text>
<text id="320003000">Oh, I know.</text>
<text id="320003010">Can you take this little one along with you?</text>
<text id="320003020">Can you take these little ones along with you?</text>
<text id="320003030">The poor thing deserves someone braver than myself…</text>
<text id="320003040">And the spirits look rather fondly upon you.</text>
<text id="320003050">It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.</text>
<text id="320003060">They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns.</text>
<text id="320003900">The poor things deserve someone braver than myself…</text>
<text id="320005000">It was a pleasure to see you.</text>
<text id="320005010">Oh, can you pass on a message for me, if you see the little chrysalids in Stormveil Castle?</text>
<text id="320005020">Tell them I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.</text>
<text id="320005030">I'm finally getting the hang of this whole "pain" thing, you know.</text>
<text id="320005040">Heh heh...</text>
<text id="320013000">What's this?</text>
<text id="320013010">A keepsake? From my men?</text>
<text id="320013020">Oh, goodness me…</text>
<text id="320013030">I can't…</text>
<text id="320013040">...</text>
<text id="320014000">A pleasure to see you.</text>
<text id="320014010">Did you give the little chrysalids the message?</text>
<text id="320014020">That I love them. And that despite my craven heart, I'm sure I'll be joining their club soon enough.</text>
<text id="320020000">They all...believed in me.</text>
<text id="320020010">They all thought I'd make something of myself. Me! Who can't do anything...</text>
<text id="320020020">I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="320020030">Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.</text>
<text id="320021000">I think I'll head to the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="320021010">Perhaps I'll find my purpose there.</text>
<text id="320030000">Greetings. Nice to see you again.</text>
<text id="320030010">My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner.</text>
<text id="320030020">Isn't this place impressive, though?</text>
<text id="320030030">The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="320030040">I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.</text>
<text id="320030050">Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.</text>
<text id="320030060">I'm still looking for my own purpose.</text>
<text id="320032000">You're telling me I possess some kind of gift?</text>
<text id="320032010">I don't believe you. But...</text>
<text id="320032020">If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first...</text>
<text id="320032030">I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?</text>
<text id="320032040">I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.</text>
<text id="320032050">Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished...</text>
<text id="320032060">But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So...</text>
<text id="320032070">I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all.</text>
<text id="320033000">Oh, and…</text>
<text id="320033010">Please, allow to me to express my thanks.</text>
<text id="320033020">For giving me that keepsake from my men.</text>
<text id="320033030">It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn.</text>
<text id="320033040">You have my gratitude. Please, take this.</text>
<text id="320034000">A pleasure to meet you.</text>
<text id="320034010">My name is Roderika. I'm a recent arrival.</text>
<text id="320034020">Isn't this place impressive?</text>
<text id="320034030">The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="320034040">I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.</text>
<text id="320034050">Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.</text>
<text id="320034060">I'm still looking for my own purpose.</text>
<text id="320035000">It's all a bit much for me, in truth.</text>
<text id="320035010">I'm still looking for my own purpose.</text>
<text id="320036000">A pleasure to see you.</text>
<text id="320036010">Thank goodness you're safe.</text>
<text id="320036020">I'm still looking for my own purpose.</text>
<text id="320036030">It's not easy, by any means, but it's what I must do.</text>
<text id="320037000">If I do have a talent for spirit tuning, and goodness knows that would be a surprise…</text>
<text id="320037010">I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?</text>
<text id="320037020">I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.</text>
<text id="320040000">Good to see you again. Thank you very much!</text>
<text id="320040010">I have you to thank, don't I? For persuading Master Hewg?</text>
<text id="320040020">I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.</text>
<text id="320040030">I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish,</text>
<text id="320040040">but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try.</text>
<text id="320040050">And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted...</text>
<text id="320040060">Well, I certainly must try.</text>
<text id="320040070">Roderika the spirit tuner prentice. Pleased to make your acquaintance.</text>
<text id="320050000">Greetings.</text>
<text id="320050010">Are you here for spirit tuning?</text>
<text id="320051000">I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.</text>
<text id="320051010">I can see how and why immortal essence exists as spirit under the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="320051020">I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to...</text>
<text id="320051030">Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer.</text>
<text id="320051040"> </text>
<text id="320051050">Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner.</text>
<text id="320052000">I'd like to ask you a small favour.</text>
<text id="320052010">Can you take this little one along with you?</text>
<text id="320052020">Can you take these little ones along with you?</text>
<text id="320052030">They can't be summoned here.</text>
<text id="320052040">But the spirits look rather fondly upon you.</text>
<text id="320052050">It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.</text>
<text id="320052060">They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns.</text>
<text id="320053000">I need to warn you about something.</text>
<text id="320053010">A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.</text>
<text id="320053020">And I can hear, from all the way over there...</text>
<text id="320053030">The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...</text>
<text id="320053040">A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...</text>
<text id="320053050">I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...</text>
<text id="320053060">Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen...</text>
<text id="320053070">You should keep your distance.</text>
<text id="320053080">I know you're strong, but please...</text>
<text id="320054000">I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable...</text>
<text id="320054010">The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...</text>
<text id="320054020">You should keep your distance.</text>
<text id="320054030">I know you're strong, but please...</text>
<text id="320055000">I can't hear them any more; the voices of the spirits cowering from the curse...</text>
<text id="320055010">I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="320055020">I just pray nothing ill comes of this.</text>
<text id="320056000">Be on your guard, I beg you.</text>
<text id="320056010">He's back. The Dung Eater. Again.</text>
<text id="320056020">I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.</text>
<text id="320056030">And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself.</text>
<text id="320056040">But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.</text>
<text id="320056050">I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order.</text>
<text id="320057000">The voices of the tormented spirits are silent again..</text>
<text id="320057010">But it isn't like last time.</text>
<text id="320057020">I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement.</text>
<text id="320057030">Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder?</text>
<text id="320060000">Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.</text>
<text id="320060010">The Two Fingers went mad, and the Tarnished have all left.</text>
<text id="320060020">Myself and Master Hewg are the only ones who remain.</text>
<text id="320060030">Don't worry, I don't blame you.</text>
<text id="320060040">I'll continue spirit tuning just the same as before.</text>
<text id="320060050">Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave.</text>
<text id="320060060">His roots are so knotted in this place.</text>
<text id="320060070">He won't last much longer if he stays here...</text>
<text id="320060080">His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now.</text>
<text id="320060090">It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him.</text>
<text id="320061000">I see. You're here for some spirit tuning?</text>
<text id="320070000">Oh, is that right...</text>
<text id="320070010">So Master Hewg won't listen to you, either.</text>
<text id="320070020">You have my thanks, regardless.</text>
<text id="320070030">I'll try and talk him round next time.</text>
<text id="320070040">I know he was given this great entreaty;</text>
<text id="320070050">To craft a weapon which could slay a god. Though I can't help but think of it as a curse.</text>
<text id="320070060">A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.</text>
<text id="320070070">And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do...</text>
<text id="320080000">Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to...</text>
<text id="320080010">To think he'd forget who you were, as well.</text>
<text id="320080020">I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.</text>
<text id="320080030">I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.</text>
<text id="320080040">But maybe it's better that we don't.</text>
<text id="320080050">It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay.</text>
<text id="320081000">I'll remain with Hewg.</text>
<text id="320081010">He made me who I am today.</text>
<text id="320081020">I'd like to return the kindness, in whatever small way I can.</text>
<text id="320082000">Please, become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="320082010">Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him.</text>
<text id="320082020">So slay her, with the weapons he smithed.</text>
<text id="320082030">Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all.</text>
<text id="320090000">You're...giving it to me?</text>
<text id="320090010">I've never had alcohol before...</text>
<text id="320090020">I'm no longer a child. It's about time I took this step.</text>
<text id="320091000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="320800000">You're willing to make me a chrysalid?</text>
<text id="320801000">Ah, but I'm still a milksop craven...</text>
<text id="320801010">I can't even govern myself to step beyond the bounds of this ward...</text>
<text id="320802000">Please. You're only wasting your strength.</text>
<text id="320803000">I know how you must feel.</text>
<text id="320803010">But please, I'm not ready.</text>
<text id="320804000">Or are you like me? You're so far out of your mind with fear...</text>
<text id="320804010">You've divested yourself of all reason?</text>
<text id="320805000">Please, stop.</text>
<text id="320805010">Even if you persist, your fear will not abate.</text>
<text id="321001000">Hello? Is anybody there?</text>
<text id="321001010">Someone who might be interested in rescuing the great Kenneth Haight?</text>
<text id="321001020">Servant to the true Order, and celebrated repudiator of the false!</text>
<text id="321001030">O Erdtree! Grant me succour!</text>
<text id="321003000">What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?</text>
<text id="321003010">My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.</text>
<text id="321003020">Oh I see. You wish to know the reward?</text>
<text id="321003030">Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse.</text>
<text id="321003040">The celebrations will be lavish indeed, upon the dawn of my fort's retrieval.</text>
<text id="321004000">Hmph, yes, now allow me to furnish you with a little advice.</text>
<text id="321004010">I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes.</text>
<text id="321004020">That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of "grafting".</text>
<text id="321004030">Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh.</text>
<text id="321004040">First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle...</text>
<text id="321004050">Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man.</text>
<text id="321004060">Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse?</text>
<text id="321004070">And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn't know it to look at him.</text>
<text id="321004080">I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it.</text>
<text id="321005000">What are you waiting for? A kiss goodbye?</text>
<text id="321005010">My fort lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood. Take it back for me.</text>
<text id="321010000">Ah, you've come to lend me your aid, have you?</text>
<text id="321010010">Well, that's very kind, but, um...</text>
<text id="321010020">No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished.</text>
<text id="321010030">Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order.</text>
<text id="321010040">You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave.</text>
<text id="321010050">Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you.</text>
<text id="321010060">I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood.</text>
<text id="321010070">A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood!</text>
<text id="321014000">Hm? What's this, kind sir?</text>
<text id="321014001">Hm? What's this, fair lady?</text>
<text id="321014010">Remarkable! The Knight Commander, dead. Already!</text>
<text id="321014020">A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one.</text>
<text id="321014030">Fine work, I say, fine work, indeed.</text>
<text id="321014040">I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you.</text>
<text id="321014050">Now, this is your reward.</text>
<text id="321014060">Go on, it is yours, for the keeping.</text>
<text id="321020000">Ah-ha! I've been waiting for you with baited breath!</text>
<text id="321020010">Did you manage to recapture my fort?</text>
<text id="321020020">Oh excellent news, just wonderful. And the knight's dead to boot!</text>
<text id="321020030">Well done my friend, well done indeed!</text>
<text id="321020040">I knew I was right to trust you!</text>
<text id="321020050">Now, here's your reward, as promised.</text>
<text id="321020060">Go ahead, it's all yours.</text>
<text id="321021000">Right then. Time for me to head to the fort.</text>
<text id="321021010">I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans.</text>
<text id="321021020">What's that look? You don't believe me?</text>
<text id="321021030">Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible.</text>
<text id="321021040">Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order.</text>
<text id="321021050">Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it.</text>
<text id="321021060">Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch.</text>
<text id="321022000">Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask.</text>
<text id="321022010">Would you like to enter my service?</text>
<text id="321022020">I see bright things in your future, stout warrior.</text>
<text id="321022030">Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order.</text>
<text id="321022040">And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours.</text>
<text id="321022050">What say you? A fine accord, is it not?</text>
<text id="321023000">Very well. Very well, indeed.</text>
<text id="321023010">I knew I saw something in you.</text>
<text id="321023020">I shall await you at my fort.</text>
<text id="321023030">We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think.</text>
<text id="321023040">I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed.</text>
<text id="321024000">Excuse me?</text>
<text id="321024010">Such foolishness have I never seen!</text>
<text id="321024020">Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.</text>
<text id="321024030">Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.</text>
<text id="321024040">Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.</text>
<text id="321025000">What is it? Have you put your misgivings to rest?</text>
<text id="321026000">Well...not that I can't sympathise with your choice.</text>
<text id="321026010">Such a miraculous manifestation of felicity is like to startle one such as yourself.</text>
<text id="321026020">Oh don't fret, there's no hurry.</text>
<text id="321026030">Should you change your mind, do visit me at my fort.</text>
<text id="321040000">Why...</text>
<text id="321040010">Why the queen... Now all hope is...</text>
<text id="321040020">(dies)</text>
<text id="321050000">Ah, you, is it?</text>
<text id="321050010">I suppose you must have seen it by now, yes, the sorry state of my fort?</text>
<text id="321050020">Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler.</text>
<text id="321050030">One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick.</text>
<text id="321050040">But a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.</text>
<text id="321051000">I am sorry to have lifted your hopes...</text>
<text id="321051010">But I haven't the authority to raise you to knighthood as things stand.</text>
<text id="321051020">The great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology.</text>
<text id="321051030">But now, I must begin my search post-haste.</text>
<text id="321051040">For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.</text>
<text id="321052000">I must begin my search post-haste.</text>
<text id="321052010">For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave.</text>
<text id="321060000">Ah, nice to see you after so long.</text>
<text id="321060010">Safe and sound, I take it, yes? Good.</text>
<text id="321060020">Ah, quite. I have indeed selected a new ruler.</text>
<text id="321060030">Lady Nepheli is strong and just. Worthy of the burden of Limgrave's lineage.</text>
<text id="321060040">Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less.</text>
<text id="321060050">For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.</text>
<text id="321060060">At which time I can fulfil my old promise.</text>
<text id="321060070">By raising you to the glory of knighthood.</text>
<text id="321060080">I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.</text>
<text id="321061000">For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.</text>
<text id="321061010">At which time I can fulfil my old promise.</text>
<text id="321061020">By raising you to the glory of knighthood.</text>
<text id="321061030">I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine.</text>
<text id="321800000">Oof!</text>
<text id="321801000">Goodness gracious!</text>
<text id="321801010">Calm yourself, this instant!</text>
<text id="321801020">Enough! This is madness!</text>
<text id="321802000">Blast! You wretched Tarnished!</text>
<text id="321802010">I am Kenneth Haight, and I have seen quite enough!</text>
<text id="321803000">The madness leaves nothing untouched.</text>
<text id="321803010">I fear for the integrity of the Order...</text>
<text id="321804000">Where are my...men...?</text>
<text id="321804010">O Erdtree, why have you forsaken me...?</text>
<text id="321900000"> </text>
<text id="321900010"> </text>
<text id="321900020"> </text>
<text id="322001000">Greetings, great champion called by grace.</text>
<text id="322001010">I am Fia.</text>
<text id="322001020">Circumstances have compelled my stay at the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="322001030">Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly?</text>
<text id="322001040">Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness.</text>
<text id="322001050">Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion.</text>
<text id="322001060">And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing.</text>
<text id="322001070">Do you think it vulgar, perhaps?</text>
<text id="322001080">Where I come from, it is a sacred act.</text>
<text id="322002000">Ah, my thanks, great champion.</text>
<text id="322002010">You are...very warm...</text>
<text id="322002020">What you felt light up inside you was a baldachin's blessing.</text>
<text id="322002030">Though it is but a fleeting thing, I am afraid.</text>
<text id="322002040">Come back to me, should you require another.</text>
<text id="322002050">I will take you in my arms as often as you need.</text>
<text id="322003000">I understand.</text>
<text id="322003010">Your disdain is only natural.</text>
<text id="322003020">But should you change your mind...</text>
<text id="322003030">Come pay me another visit.</text>
<text id="322004000">Oh, my dear...</text>
<text id="322004010">Had a change of heart already?</text>
<text id="322005000">I am pleased to see you again.</text>
<text id="322005010">Would you like me to hold you, once more?</text>
<text id="322005020">The blessing is still aflame in your breast, dear.</text>
<text id="322005030">Would you like to be held, regardless?</text>
<text id="322006000">Now, come closer...</text>
<text id="322006010">You are so...very warm...</text>
<text id="322007000">Then good day to you, my dear.</text>
<text id="322020000">I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from.</text>
<text id="322020010">After I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number of champions,</text>
<text id="322020020">I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life.</text>
<text id="322020030">To do so is the purpose of my being.</text>
<text id="322020040">But before I could bear the noble into new life,</text>
<text id="322020050">I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.</text>
<text id="322020060">Pray, be kind.</text>
<text id="322020070">Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion.</text>
<text id="322020080">So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes.</text>
<text id="322021000">My dear...</text>
<text id="322021010">Might I ask something of you?</text>
<text id="322021020">Could you please find the owner of this dagger, and return it to them?</text>
<text id="322021030">A certain person gave it to me, as a gift.</text>
<text id="322021040">It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.</text>
<text id="322021050">So I would like for the original owner to have it back, if you wouldn't mind.</text>
<text id="322022000">I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger I gave you, and return it to them.</text>
<text id="322022010">It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.</text>
<text id="322023000">My dear...</text>
<text id="322023010">Have you ever heard of black knifeprints?</text>
<text id="322023020">Dear Rogier likes to talk of them when abed.</text>
<text id="322023030">And the ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.</text>
<text id="322023040">The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,</text>
<text id="322023050">along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.</text>
<text id="322023060">These grand affairs are hardly my forté...</text>
<text id="322023070">But dear Rogier began to weep as he spoke...</text>
<text id="322024000">Dear Rogier likes to talk of it when abed.</text>
<text id="322024010">The ancient plot, in which the first of the Demigods was slain.</text>
<text id="322024020">The black knives wielded by the assassins who committed the act,</text>
<text id="322024030">along with the impressions they made, somehow hide the truth of the conspiracy.</text>
<text id="322025000">I heard that you lent a hand to dear Rogier.</text>
<text id="322025010">He seemed positively elated.</text>
<text id="322025020">He must be possessed of great mental fortitude.</text>
<text id="322025030">It anchors his will, and sustains him, despite his grievous wounds.</text>
<text id="322025040">You truly are a champion.</text>
<text id="322025050">To dear Rogier, and myself, too.</text>
<text id="322027000">In truth I've heard tell from someone else,</text>
<text id="322027010">about the black knifeprints that fascinate dear Rogier so.</text>
<text id="322027020">But It wouldn't be right to give this to him, stuck as he is in the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="322027030">Perhaps you could make use of it?</text>
<text id="322030000">Finally, it is returned to its rightful place.</text>
<text id="322030010">The stolen hallowbrand, of the exalted noble.</text>
<text id="322030020">And now, I must bid you goodbye as well.</text>
<text id="322030030">Though I ask you deliver this message to the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="322030040">I am Fia, Deathbed Companion.</text>
<text id="322030050">Hark, Roundtable. Disturb not the Death of Godwyn, the exalted.</text>
<text id="322030060">We, who humbly live in Death...</text>
<text id="322030070">Live in waiting, to one day welcome our Lord.</text>
<text id="322030080">What right does anyone have to object?</text>
<text id="322030090">Our Lord will rise. The Lord of the many, and the meek.</text>
<text id="322040000">Ah...there you are.</text>
<text id="322040010">I knew you would come.</text>
<text id="322040020">What is it you intend?</text>
<text id="322040030">To deny us, and our ways?</text>
<text id="322040040">Like the dogmatic brutes of the Golden Order?</text>
<text id="322041000">I see. Then you must kill me.</text>
<text id="322041010">For I am the companion of Godwyn, Prince of Death.</text>
<text id="322041020">I wished to be a mother to Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="322041030">So it is, that any loathing, any hatred that overshadows them...</text>
<text id="322041040">I must bear, as a matter of duty, with my own flesh.</text>
<text id="322042000">Go on, kill me.</text>
<text id="322042010">You deny us, do you not?</text>
<text id="322042020">Because we deign to live in Death, and wish our Lord to rise to glory.</text>
<text id="322043000">You are an odd one.</text>
<text id="322043010">I am the guardian of Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="322043020">They call me a foul and rotten witch.</text>
<text id="322043030">Yet you still wish to be held by me?</text>
<text id="322044000">I will soon lay with Godwyn.</text>
<text id="322044010">And it will surely stir within me.</text>
<text id="322044020">the new life of the golden prince, and first Dead of the demigods,</text>
<text id="322044030">as the rune of Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="322044040">Please, do one thing for me.</text>
<text id="322044050">Brandish this child, my rune, and take for yourself the throne.</text>
<text id="322044060">Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="322044070">By becoming our Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="322045000">I will soon lay with Godwyn.</text>
<text id="322045010">To conceive my child, the rune.</text>
<text id="322045020">Brandish my rune, and take for yourself the throne.</text>
<text id="322045030">Stay the persecution of Those Who Live in Death.</text>
<text id="322045040">By becoming our Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="322046000">This is goodbye, my dear.</text>
<text id="322046010">But I am satisfied.</text>
<text id="322046020">I choose to lie with Godwyn of my own will. Not the remains of one chosen for me.</text>
<text id="322046030">And I will bear a child.</text>
<text id="322046040">Who will inherit your warmth, too.</text>
<text id="322046050">What greater blessing could there be, but to be born a Deathbed Companion?</text>
<text id="322051000">Have you ever seen a hallowbrand?</text>
<text id="322051010">When the first of the demigods died, his flesh was marked with the half-wheel wound of the centipede.</text>
<text id="322051020">Godwyn's hallowbrand has since been recovered at the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="322051030">But there is another hallowbrand out there somewhere.</text>
<text id="322051040">And I must find it.</text>
<text id="322051050">Before the time comes we receive our Lord.</text>
<text id="322052000">When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.</text>
<text id="322052010">But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.</text>
<text id="322052020">And I must find it.</text>
<text id="322052030">Before the time comes we receive our Lord.</text>
<text id="322052040">My hands will be dirtied once more by the deed.</text>
<text id="322052050">Will you still let me hold you, even then?</text>
<text id="322053000">When Godwyn died, a hallowbrand scored his flesh.</text>
<text id="322053010">But another exists. Another mark in the shape of the half-wheel wound of the centipede.</text>
<text id="322053020">And I must find it.</text>
<text id="322053030">Before the time comes we receive our Lord.</text>
<text id="322054000">...!</text>
<text id="322054010">This...is the other hallowbrand.</text>
<text id="322054020">How did you...</text>
<text id="322054030">Oh, my utmost thanks.</text>
<text id="322054040">With this, Godwyn can take his rightful place as First of the Dead.</text>
<text id="322054050">And claim a second, illustrious life.</text>
<text id="322054060">You are my-- our true champion.</text>
<text id="322054070">And though I can't be of any use to you...</text>
<text id="322054080">Can I hold you tight, if only for a moment?</text>
<text id="322800000">Godwyn...</text>
<text id="322800010">Is that you, dear?</text>
<text id="322801000">Will your kind never stop?</text>
<text id="322801010">Ravaging...the weak?</text>
<text id="322900000"> </text>
<text id="322900010"> </text>
<text id="323001000">Have you ever felt the curse, with your whole being?</text>
<text id="323001010">The pox upon life itself, feared and despised by all. The reviled blessing.</text>
<text id="323001020">...</text>
<text id="323001030">Apparently not.</text>
<text id="323001040">You are but a lamb. A stranger to defilement. Ignorant of your own ignorance.</text>
<text id="323001050">You no longer interest me.</text>
<text id="323001060">I've been long without peace. Don't spoil my quietude.</text>
<text id="323002000">I asked you not to disturb me.</text>
<text id="323002010">Be thankful of the Hold's serenity.</text>
<text id="323002020">It is all that keeps your death and defilement at bay.</text>
<text id="323010000">No, wait.</text>
<text id="323010010">...</text>
<text id="323010020">You have felt the curse.</text>
<text id="323010030">I can smell it on you. The pox, yet tender.</text>
<text id="323010040">Apparently my seedbed is ripe and waiting.</text>
<text id="323010050">Twas a brief respite, I must say.</text>
<text id="323010060">Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.</text>
<text id="323010070">Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.</text>
<text id="323010080">I can kill you, and defile your corpse.</text>
<text id="323010090">Then the pox will truly be your own.</text>
<text id="323011000">Go, and unshackle my corporeal flesh.</text>
<text id="323011010">Trapped in the sewer gaol, below the capital.</text>
<text id="323011020">I can kill you, and defile your corpse.</text>
<text id="323011030">Then the pox will truly be your own.</text>
<text id="323020000">...</text>
<text id="323020010">Let me out! Let me out of here!</text>
<text id="323020020">Must eat more! Defile more!</text>
<text id="323020030">Everything that matters to you!</text>
<text id="323020040">For generations to come!</text>
<text id="323020050">I am the Dung Eater!</text>
<text id="323020060">A scourge upon the living!</text>
<text id="323021000">Who are you?</text>
<text id="323022000">I've been here long enough.</text>
<text id="323022010">I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.</text>
<text id="323022020">Just to be sure. That when they're reborn…</text>
<text id="323022030">They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come…</text>
<text id="323023000">I will kill again. And defile each corpse with care.</text>
<text id="323023010">Just to be sure. That when they're reborn…</text>
<text id="323023020">They'll be cursed. Along with their children, and their children's children, for all time to come…</text>
<text id="323024000">I am the Dung Eater.</text>
<text id="323024010">A scourge upon the living.</text>
<text id="323024020">I must eat more. Defile more...</text>
<text id="323025000">Let me out. Let me out of here.</text>
<text id="323030000">I will kill you, and defile your corpse.</text>
<text id="323030010">Then the pox will truly be your own.</text>
<text id="323031000">I'll give you a good blessing.</text>
<text id="323031010">You'll be nourishment for the pox.</text>
<text id="323040000">There you are.</text>
<text id="323040010">You warded off my blessing.</text>
<text id="323040020">Despite the curse stirring within you.</text>
<text id="323040030">No one has succeeded in that before.</text>
<text id="323040040">How? I thought. Then it hit me.</text>
<text id="323040050">That you are, in fact, me. And I...am the Dung Eater.</text>
<text id="323040060">It is my flesh that must receive the blessing.</text>
<text id="323041000">Give me your blessing.</text>
<text id="323041010">Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.</text>
<text id="323041020">Again and again. Until it is done.</text>
<text id="323041030">Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.</text>
<text id="323041040">Countless, I have killed. And countless, I have defiled.</text>
<text id="323041050">And soon the fruits will be borne.</text>
<text id="323041060">Hundreds will be reborn cursed, and they'll bear thousands of cursed children, who'll bear tens of thousands more.</text>
<text id="323041070">A few of those will be born just like me, and they'll kill, and defile, and bless in my stead!</text>
<text id="323041080">The rotten fools. My fate was the grandest, most brilliant of them all!</text>
<text id="323042000">My corporeal flesh lies in the sewer gaol beneath the Capital.</text>
<text id="323042010">Give it your blessing. Defile my flesh with the seedbed curse.</text>
<text id="323042020">Until a cursed ring coalesces, that may one day defile Order itself.</text>
<text id="323050000">Uur...urgh...</text>
<text id="323050010">A curse... A curse upon them all.</text>
<text id="323050020">They'll be born cursed, all of them.</text>
<text id="323050030">Along with their children, and their children's children, heh, for all time to come…</text>
<text id="323051000">Uur...urgh...</text>
<text id="323051010">Curse you, Golden Order.</text>
<text id="323051020">One day, you'll get what's coming.</text>
<text id="323055000">Ah...argh...</text>
<text id="323055010">No... I am... the Dung Eater...</text>
<text id="323055020">I am...</text>
<text id="323055030">...</text>
<text id="323056000">...</text>
<text id="323060000">...</text>
<text id="323800000"> </text>
<text id="323800100"> </text>
<text id="323800200"> </text>
<text id="323900000"> </text>
<text id="323900100"> </text>
<text id="323900200">Bless you!</text>
<text id="323900300"> </text>
<text id="323900400"> </text>
<text id="324001000">Oh, this is a rare occasion.</text>
<text id="324001010">I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="324001020">Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome.</text>
<text id="324001030">It is safe here. You may let down your guard.</text>
<text id="324002000">Allow me a word of advice, as your senior.</text>
<text id="324002010">You are a mere visitor to the Roundtable, nothing more.</text>
<text id="324002020">A house guest, yet to earn their keep.</text>
<text id="324002030">Remember your place, newcomer.</text>
<text id="324003000">There's nothing left to say. Be at your leisure.</text>
<text id="324010000">What do you need? I have little time to spare.</text>
<text id="324011000">Oh, are you aggrieved? At the notion you are but a visitant here?</text>
<text id="324011010">Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.</text>
<text id="324011020">Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="324011030">If those words held any meaning to you...</text>
<text id="324011040">Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.</text>
<text id="324011050">Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.</text>
<text id="324011060">And you will receive the wisdom of the Two Fingers.</text>
<text id="324012000">Once the wisdom of the Two Fingers becomes your own, I'll impart to you a proper welcome.</text>
<text id="324012010">As a true member of the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="324012020">I have high hopes for you.</text>
<text id="324012030">I'm sick and tired of them.</text>
<text id="324012040">These namby-pamby Tarnished think us no more than a shelter from the rain...</text>
<text id="324013000">We've spoken long enough. I have matters to attend to.</text>
<text id="324015000">If you haven't anything to say, I would prefer you didn't pester me for attention.</text>
<text id="324015010">Try not to make a spectacle of yourself either. Or are you as irredeemably foolish as you appear?</text>
<text id="324020000">You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?</text>
<text id="324020010">Then just as promised, I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="324020020">I am known as Gideon Ofnir.</text>
<text id="324020030">As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,</text>
<text id="324020040">I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.</text>
<text id="324020050">You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.</text>
<text id="324021000">You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh?</text>
<text id="324021010">Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge.</text>
<text id="324021020">The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers.</text>
<text id="324021030">We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated.</text>
<text id="324021040">Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.</text>
<text id="324021050">General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="324021060">Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir.</text>
<text id="324021070">Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell.</text>
<text id="324021080">And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.</text>
<text id="324021090">...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you?</text>
<text id="324022000">So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.</text>
<text id="324022010">Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power.</text>
<text id="324022020">His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest.</text>
<text id="324022030">...but I suspect you know that well enough already.</text>
<text id="324023000">General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.</text>
<text id="324023010">He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.</text>
<text id="324023020">And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat.</text>
<text id="324023030">I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire.</text>
<text id="324023040">And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid.</text>
<text id="324023050">Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...</text>
<text id="324024000">Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir.</text>
<text id="324024010">He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour.</text>
<text id="324024020">The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="324024030">It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering.</text>
<text id="324024040">Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven.</text>
<text id="324025000">Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.</text>
<text id="324025010">It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.</text>
<text id="324025020">But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.</text>
<text id="324025030">Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="324025040">Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait.</text>
<text id="324026000">The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.</text>
<text id="324026010">Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.</text>
<text id="324026020">But Rennala herself is no demigod.</text>
<text id="324026030">She is merely the recipient of an amber egg, given to her by Radagon,</text>
<text id="324026040">Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort.</text>
<text id="324026050">The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her.</text>
<text id="324027000">There are four more demigods yet to be located.</text>
<text id="324027010">Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed.</text>
<text id="324027020">His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman.</text>
<text id="324027030">Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala.</text>
<text id="324027040">And the one only known as the Lord of Blood.</text>
<text id="324027050">Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune,</text>
<text id="324027060">so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers.</text>
<text id="324027070">If you should learn anything of these matters,</text>
<text id="324027080">I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me.</text>
<text id="324027090">We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="324027100">As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.</text>
<text id="324027580">I'll trade your findings for something rather special.</text>
<text id="324030000">Ah, you. What is it?</text>
<text id="324031000">Well...what is it now?</text>
<text id="324032000">Well. I see you've found another Great Rune.</text>
<text id="324032010">Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.</text>
<text id="324032020">Make the journey.</text>
<text id="324032030">To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="324032040">The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.</text>
<text id="324032050">You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="324032060">For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace.</text>
<text id="324033000">Journey to the capital Leyndell, to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="324033010">The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.</text>
<text id="324033020">You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="324035000">General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.</text>
<text id="324035010">He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.</text>
<text id="324035020">And by my reckoning Radahn remains there, even now.</text>
<text id="324035030">Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore...</text>
<text id="324036000">Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.</text>
<text id="324036010">It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.</text>
<text id="324036020">But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.</text>
<text id="324036030">Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="324037000">The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.</text>
<text id="324037010">Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.</text>
<text id="324037020">And her Great Rune dwells within the egg she so dearly clutches.</text>
<text id="324038000">You've received the wisdom of the Two Fingers, have you not?</text>
<text id="324038010">Then I bid you welcome, as a true member of the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="324038020">I am known as Gideon Ofnir.</text>
<text id="324038030">As a Tarnished who wishes to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,</text>
<text id="324038040">I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.</text>
<text id="324038050">You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant.</text>
<text id="324040000">I understand you've been speaking to Nepheli.</text>
<text id="324040010">She is my daughter.</text>
<text id="324040020">I took her in when she lost the guidance of grace.</text>
<text id="324040030">Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes.</text>
<text id="324040040">So I put her to work.</text>
<text id="324040050">Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you.</text>
<text id="324040060">Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle.</text>
<text id="324041000">Ahh, you've already heard?</text>
<text id="324041010">Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions.</text>
<text id="324041020">So I had no further use for her.</text>
<text id="324041030">Honestly, what's a man to do.</text>
<text id="324041040">A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly.</text>
<text id="324041050">I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants.</text>
<text id="324041060">A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished.</text>
<text id="324042000">Is that potion what I think it is?</text>
<text id="324042010">Bloody Seluvis. I suppose he's up to something again.</text>
<text id="324042020">Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must.</text>
<text id="324042030">The Roundtable has no code to speak of.</text>
<text id="324042040">But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?</text>
<text id="324042050">Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard?</text>
<text id="324043000">Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself.</text>
<text id="324043010">You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away.</text>
<text id="324043020">Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.</text>
<text id="324043030">Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.</text>
<text id="324043040">His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold.</text>
<text id="324044000">Well, I won't force you.</text>
<text id="324044010">But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste.</text>
<text id="324044020">She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential.</text>
<text id="324044030">Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet.</text>
<text id="324045000">I hear you helped get the girl back on her feet.</text>
<text id="324045010">Though I'm not her foster father anymore, I'd still like to thank you.</text>
<text id="324045020">Sorry. For the time you had to waste.</text>
<text id="324046000">Well, I won't force you.</text>
<text id="324046010">If you want to do that dolly botherer's bidding, that's up to you.</text>
<text id="324046020">Not that I could fathom why you'd want to...</text>
<text id="324050000">Oh, my apologies for that nasty business.</text>
<text id="324050010">Ensha got rather ahead of himself, it seems.</text>
<text id="324050020">As his master, I'd like to express my regret.</text>
<text id="324050030">But now, Ensha is slain and gone.</text>
<text id="324050040">Finished, forever more.</text>
<text id="324051000">Ah, yes, by way of apology,</text>
<text id="324051010">allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess.</text>
<text id="324051020">Find the Albinauric woman.</text>
<text id="324051030">She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia,</text>
<text id="324051040">She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.</text>
<text id="324051050">together with her great wolf.</text>
<text id="324052000">Find the Albinauric woman.</text>
<text id="324052010">She hides in a cave to the west of the Laskyar Ruins which jut from the mist-shrouded lake of Liurnia,</text>
<text id="324052020">She knows the location of the medallion's counterpart, I am sure.</text>
<text id="324052030">together with her great wolf.</text>
<text id="324053000">Ah, yes, by way of apology,</text>
<text id="324053010">allow me to tender some advice, in regard to the half of the secret medallion you possess.</text>
<text id="324053020">Find the village of the Albinaurics.</text>
<text id="324053030">It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.</text>
<text id="324053040">And some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere.</text>
<text id="324054000">Find the village of the Albinaurics.</text>
<text id="324054010">It lies to the southwest of Liurnia, below the Altar clifflands.</text>
<text id="324054020">Some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallion's other half somewhere. </text>
<text id="324060000">Ahh, I know already. You're after it too, aren't you.</text>
<text id="324060010">To pass the impenetrable thorns, you seek the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.</text>
<text id="324060020">Then you need to reach the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.</text>
<text id="324060030">Hah, no need to pay me for that gift.</text>
<text id="324060040">All my knowledge is for the sake of guidance.</text>
<text id="324060050">That a Tarnished might stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="324060060">It doesn't have to be me, my fellow.</text>
<text id="324061000">If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.</text>
<text id="324061010">You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.</text>
<text id="324061020">I marked your map with its location.</text>
<text id="324061030">Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin".</text>
<text id="324061040">The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago.</text>
<text id="324070000">Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.</text>
<text id="324070010">I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.</text>
<text id="324070020">You've made more of yourself than Ensha has...</text>
<text id="324070030">Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.</text>
<text id="324070040">I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?</text>
<text id="324070050">Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath.</text>
<text id="324071000">Ahh, so the secret medallions led you to the land of the Haligtree?</text>
<text id="324071010">I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.</text>
<text id="324071020">Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.</text>
<text id="324071030">But...with the Haligtree as it is...</text>
<text id="324071040">I suppose Miquella must already be...</text>
<text id="324072000">Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.</text>
<text id="324072010">The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:</text>
<text id="324072020">A hidden treasure, known only to me.</text>
<text id="324072030">A secret rite known only to me.</text>
<text id="324072040">You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.</text>
<text id="324072530">And it is a wondrous thing indeed.</text>
<text id="324073000">So. The Haligtree, now but a husk...</text>
<text id="324073010">I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,</text>
<text id="324073020">but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.</text>
<text id="324073030">Indeed, it seems those words held weight.</text>
<text id="324073040">How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...</text>
<text id="324073050">Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified...</text>
<text id="324074000">Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.</text>
<text id="324074010">A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.</text>
<text id="324074020">Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable.</text>
<text id="324074030">But perhaps it's worth looking into...</text>
<text id="324074040">If what I've heard is right, then maybe...</text>
<text id="324075000">Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all!</text>
<text id="324075010">That is some fine intelligence indeed!</text>
<text id="324075020">With it, the final clue has been brought into the light.</text>
<text id="324075030">One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.</text>
<text id="324075040">As promised, allow me to impart to you</text>
<text id="324075050">the last of the hidden treasures known only to me.</text>
<text id="324075060">the last of the secret rites known only to me.</text>
<text id="324075070">a thing most wondrous, known only to me.</text>
<text id="324076000">Well, I wonder what comes next...</text>
<text id="324076010">If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well.</text>
<text id="324076020">But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.</text>
<text id="324076030">Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me...</text>
<text id="324077000">You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you?</text>
<text id="324077010">Then the Roundtable is soon to follow.</text>
<text id="324077020">Ah, no need to fret about that.</text>
<text id="324077030">The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="324077040">And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen,</text>
<text id="324077050">then the Roundtable must go, as well.</text>
<text id="324078000">I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time.</text>
<text id="324078010">I must learn all that can be taken from this place,</text>
<text id="324078020">and sear it into my memory.</text>
<text id="324078030">How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less?</text>
<text id="324079000">The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.</text>
<text id="324079010">Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.</text>
<text id="324079020">Perhaps the same could be said of guidance.</text>
<text id="324079030">Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?</text>
<text id="324079040">What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord?</text>
<text id="324080000">Ahh, I knew you'd come.</text>
<text id="324080010">To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="324080020">What a sad state of affairs.</text>
<text id="324080030">I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.</text>
<text id="324080040">Queen Marika has high hopes for us.</text>
<text id="324080050">That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity.</text>
<text id="324100000">You think I don't know what that is?</text>
<text id="324100010">I have no secrets for you to salaciously gawp at.</text>
<text id="324100020">You think too little of Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing.</text>
<text id="324800000">My fellow, you've fought well, until now.</text>
<text id="324801000">I know...in my bones...</text>
<text id="324801010">A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you.</text>
<text id="324801020">A man cannot kill a god...</text>
<text id="324900000"> </text>
<text id="324900100">Knowledge above all!</text>
<text id="324900200"> </text>
<text id="324900300"> </text>
<text id="325001000">Ah, nice to meet you.</text>
<text id="325001010">The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.</text>
<text id="325001020">I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle.</text>
<text id="325001030">When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.</text>
<text id="325001040">But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?</text>
<text id="325001050">This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting.</text>
<text id="325001060">Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind...</text>
<text id="325002000">I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you?</text>
<text id="325002010">You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace.</text>
<text id="325002020">Well, enjoy it while you can.</text>
<text id="325002030">I'm Tarnished, like you.</text>
<text id="325002040">But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time.</text>
<text id="325002050">Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="325002060">I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.</text>
<text id="325002070">Would you care to learn one?</text>
<text id="325002080">As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please.</text>
<text id="325003000">Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we?</text>
<text id="325004000">Oh hello there, good to see you safe.</text>
<text id="325004010">Stopping by to learn a battle art or two?</text>
<text id="325005000">The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family.</text>
<text id="325005010">They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle.</text>
<text id="325005020">In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told.</text>
<text id="325005030">Fascinating, isn't it?</text>
<text id="325005040">That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.</text>
<text id="325005050">With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair,</text>
<text id="325005060">such adaptability is more important now than ever.</text>
<text id="325006000">Of course. I understand.</text>
<text id="325006010">Why place trust in a perfect stranger?</text>
<text id="325006020">Be safe, then, stranger.</text>
<text id="325006030">Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same.</text>
<text id="325007000">Oh? Something bothering you?</text>
<text id="325007010">Or are you just trying to pass the time?</text>
<text id="325007020">I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle.</text>
<text id="325020000">Ah, we meet again after all.</text>
<text id="325020010">I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see.</text>
<text id="325020020">So. What do you need?</text>
<text id="325021000">Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune.</text>
<text id="325021010">Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we.</text>
<text id="325021020">Well done, friend.</text>
<text id="325021030">Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.</text>
<text id="325021040">As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me.</text>
<text id="325021050">No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore.</text>
<text id="325022000">The misshapen corpse under Stormveil?</text>
<text id="325022010">That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.</text>
<text id="325022020">It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="325022030">Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade.</text>
<text id="325022040">And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.</text>
<text id="325022050">That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history.</text>
<text id="325022060">And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.</text>
<text id="325022070">I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot.</text>
<text id="325022080">The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights,</text>
<text id="325022090">You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm?</text>
<text id="325023000">This...is a black knifeprint!</text>
<text id="325023010">I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!</text>
<text id="325023020">You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes?</text>
<text id="325023030">They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City.</text>
<text id="325023040">A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.</text>
<text id="325023050">The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.</text>
<text id="325023060">Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time.</text>
<text id="325023070">I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.</text>
<text id="325023080">Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death.</text>
<text id="325023090">Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...</text>
<text id="325023100">Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see.</text>
<text id="325024000">Oh, still need something?</text>
<text id="325026000">Always good to see you safe.</text>
<text id="325026010">So. What do you need?</text>
<text id="325027000">Ah, so you've met D.</text>
<text id="325027010">D is an old friend.</text>
<text id="325027020">We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death.</text>
<text id="325027030">But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross.</text>
<text id="325027040">Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends.</text>
<text id="325028000">Pleased to meet you.</text>
<text id="325028010">The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade.</text>
<text id="325028020">But now I'm in this sorry state.</text>
<text id="325028030">I had a little mishap, and now I can't move.</text>
<text id="325028040">As you might guess, it's far from ideal...</text>
<text id="325029000">Ah, I know.</text>
<text id="325029010">I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.</text>
<text id="325029020">Would you care to learn one?</text>
<text id="325029030">Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know.</text>
<text id="325029040">A little conversation goes a long way.</text>
<text id="325030000">Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you.</text>
<text id="325030010">My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.</text>
<text id="325030020">Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.</text>
<text id="325030030">Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla.</text>
<text id="325030040">Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard.</text>
<text id="325030050">Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.</text>
<text id="325030060">Truly, you have my thanks.</text>
<text id="325030070">But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.</text>
<text id="325030080">If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,</text>
<text id="325030090">then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.</text>
<text id="325030100">I would like you to procure it for me.</text>
<text id="325030110">And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.</text>
<text id="325030120">Don't fret, it is entirely in accordance with the guidance of grace.</text>
<text id="325030130">If you seek to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,</text>
<text id="325030140">The answers you find will surely bolster your chances.</text>
<text id="325031000">I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts.</text>
<text id="325031010">There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="325031020">It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends.</text>
<text id="325031030">There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years</text>
<text id="325031040">Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once.</text>
<text id="325031050">But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born...</text>
<text id="325032000">If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,</text>
<text id="325032010">then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.</text>
<text id="325032020">Would you be willing to procure it for me?</text>
<text id="325032030">She may have returned to the manor that is her home.</text>
<text id="325032040">The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="325033000">I'm afraid there's something I must tell you.</text>
<text id="325033010">Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?</text>
<text id="325033020">The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="325033030">By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.</text>
<text id="325033040">But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.</text>
<text id="325033050">You may find this peculiar,</text>
<text id="325033060">but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.</text>
<text id="325033070">These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.</text>
<text id="325034000">Yes, indeed.</text>
<text id="325034010">If D knew what drives me now,</text>
<text id="325034020">he would surely boil over with rage.</text>
<text id="325034030">Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity.</text>
<text id="325034040">But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.</text>
<text id="325034050">I can tell a good lie when I need to.</text>
<text id="325035000">And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now...</text>
<text id="325035010">I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary...</text>
<text id="325036000">Oh? Forgot something, did you?</text>
<text id="325037000">Alright there. Good to see you safe.</text>
<text id="325040000">I see...</text>
<text id="325040010">When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.</text>
<text id="325040020">You know, not everyone would trust such a tale...</text>
<text id="325040030">But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...</text>
<text id="325040040">Then perhaps it's true after all.</text>
<text id="325040050">Hmm.</text>
<text id="325040060">Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...</text>
<text id="325040070">How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?</text>
<text id="325040080">Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course.</text>
<text id="325040090">The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.</text>
<text id="325040100">And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.</text>
<text id="325040110">I know you've got what it takes.</text>
<text id="325040120">Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.</text>
<text id="325041000">Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?</text>
<text id="325041010">While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.</text>
<text id="325041020">And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.</text>
<text id="325041030">I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.</text>
<text id="325041040">But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.</text>
<text id="325041050">Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it.</text>
<text id="325045000">D was telling me.</text>
<text id="325045010">That he discovered the mark of the centipede.</text>
<text id="325045020">The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark.</text>
<text id="325045030">As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,</text>
<text id="325045040">then we may be able to form an alliance.</text>
<text id="325045050">If only I could speak to them in person.</text>
<text id="325045060">And if they were like you, all the better.</text>
<text id="325046000">Hmm. Maybe I should tell you.</text>
<text id="325046010">Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice...</text>
<text id="325046020">Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.</text>
<text id="325046030">And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.</text>
<text id="325046040">So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.</text>
<text id="325046050">Since you're so scary and all.</text>

<text id="326001030">Are you here in the Lands Between to take up the fight?</text>
<text id="326001040">Does your faith in the guidance of grace hold firm,</text>
<text id="326001050">despite the collapse of the Golden Order?</text>
<text id="326002000">Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through.</text>
<text id="326002010">Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever.</text>
<text id="326002020">Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?</text>
<text id="326002030">All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.</text>
<text id="326002040">Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.</text>
<text id="326003000">Oh, not had your fill, eh? Worry not, I've enough to keep you busy.</text>
<text id="326004000">Ah, hello. Glad to see you safe.</text>
<text id="326004010">Here to learn a battle art or two?</text>
<text id="326005000">There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover.</text>
<text id="326005010">Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died.</text>
<text id="326005020">A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance.</text>
<text id="326005030">That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat.</text>
<text id="326005040">It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.</text>
<text id="326006000">Honest to a fault, I see.</text>
<text id="326006010">Such thoughts won't behove you, as a Tarnished.</text>
<text id="326006020">But there's nothing wrong with that.</text>
<text id="326006030">Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts?</text>
<text id="326006040">All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too.</text>
<text id="326006050">Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good Tarnished, like you.</text>
<text id="326007000">Not floating your boat, eh?</text>
<text id="326007010">Well, there's no rush. Knowledge of the arts can wait another day.</text>
<text id="326008000">There you are. Decided to bear the torch of my battle arts?</text>
<text id="326009000">Well, until we meet again.</text>
<text id="326010000">You...</text>
<text id="326010010">What in heaven's name are you doing here?</text>
<text id="326010020">The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.</text>
<text id="326010030">I hope you understand the weight of my words.</text>
<text id="326011000">Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.</text>
<text id="326011010">I thought you a Tarnished bred by virtue.</text>
<text id="326011020">Perhaps playing that part led you to your doubts, I wonder.</text>
<text id="326011030">But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.</text>
<text id="326011040">Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.</text>
<text id="326012000">This blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death.</text>
<text id="326012010">Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.</text>
<text id="326013000">So. You've bloodied your sword in the hunt.</text>
<text id="326013010">Then I shall introduce myself once more.</text>
<text id="326013020">Bernahl, a recusant, just like you.</text>
<text id="326013030">Recusants have particular battle arts, styled to our methods of slaughter.</text>
<text id="326013040">Why not add some to your repertoire?</text>
<text id="326014000">Oh, not had your fill, eh?</text>
<text id="326015000">You're still alive, I see.</text>
<text id="326015010">Why not learn another battle art, see if we can't keep it that way.</text>
<text id="326016000">You've come to understand, now, eh?</text>
<text id="326016010">To take power and make it his own,</text>
<text id="326016020">The recusant must hunt his own kind.</text>
<text id="326016030">To raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging,</text>
<text id="326016040">We recusants must become the most wretched of predators.</text>
<text id="326016050">All you can do is laugh.</text>
<text id="326017000">Look at you. A recusant through and through.</text>
<text id="326017010">I knew you had it in you.</text>
<text id="326017020">Take this.</text>
<text id="326017030">A special invitation, to hunt some of the first Tarnished who sat at the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="326017040">If you should accept, I'll next see you on the field of battle.</text>
<text id="326018000">Ah, I had hoped you'd soon return.</text>
<text id="326018010">I have the reward from Lady Tanith.</text>
<text id="326018020">Take it. It's yours, by right.</text>
<text id="326018030">Let us tread the path of the recusant together.</text>
<text id="326018040">Till we reach the miserable death that awaits us.</text>
<text id="326020000">So. You killed Rykard?</text>
<text id="326020010">I harbour you no ill will. The strong take. Such is our code.</text>
<text id="326020020">Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.</text>
<text id="326020030">But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more.</text>
<text id="326020040">Though we may yet fulfil an old promise.</text>
<text id="326020050">We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs.</text>
<text id="326020060">And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="326021000">O Greater Will, hear my voice.</text>
<text id="326021010">I am the recusant Bernahl, inheritor of my brother's will, and you will fall to my blade.</text>
<text id="326021020">We refuse to become your pawns. Consider this fair warning.</text>
<text id="326030000">Who are you?</text>
<text id="326030010">And what in heaven's name are you doing here?</text>
<text id="326030020">The Volcano Manor is a pit of recusants who spit at grace and hunt our own kind.</text>
<text id="326030030">I hope you understand the weight of my words.</text>
<text id="326040000">Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.</text>
<text id="326040010">You have harboured doubts from the very beginning.</text>
<text id="326040020">Perhaps this day was always lurking on the horizon.</text>
<text id="326040030">But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.</text>
<text id="326040040">Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.</text>
<text id="326041000">Then you must leave immediately.</text>
<text id="326041010">Those with weak stomachs have no place here.</text>
<text id="326042000">I thought I told you to leave.</text>
<text id="326042010">Or do you claim to understand?</text>
<text id="326042020">What it means to be a recusant, renouncing grace and hunting down one's own.</text>
<text id="326043000">Well. As long as you understand what you're saying.</text>
<text id="326043010">But know that the path you walk is blasphemy, and leads only to a miserable death.</text>
<text id="326043020">Before you consider hunting any of your own kind, think on that.</text>
<text id="326100000">Oh, a brew, is it?</text>
<text id="326100010">Thanking me for the battle arts?</text>
<text id="326100020">You're one of the good ones. Thank you.</text>
<text id="326101000">Oh, a brew, is it?</text>
<text id="326101010">Fitting, I suppose.</text>
<text id="326101020">For a recusant already drunk on blasphemy.</text>
<text id="326102000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="326800000">Agh!</text>
<text id="326800010">What's wrong with you?</text>
<text id="326800020">I won't say it twice. Stop this.</text>
<text id="326801000">I suppose I have no choice, then.</text>
<text id="326801010">Is this what grace would have of us?</text>
<text id="326802000">Dog eat dog, once again. A sad lot, we Tarnished.</text>
<text id="326803000">You are an enigma, to be certain.</text>
<text id="326803010">The Volcano Manor awaits you.</text>
<text id="326900000"> </text>
<text id="326900010"> </text>
<text id="326900020"> </text>
<text id="330001000">You're Tarnished, aren't you?</text>
<text id="330001010">I welcome you, to the Church of Vows.</text>
<text id="330001020">I am Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.</text>
<text id="330001030">My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.</text>
<text id="330001040">Do you know the origin of this place?</text>
<text id="330001050">How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?</text>
<text id="330002000">Well, that is a shame. But who can blame you?</text>
<text id="330002010">The Shattering has caused us - all of us - to lose sight of something very dear.</text>
<text id="330002020">It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the Erdtree and the Moon were joined.</text>
<text id="330002030">By the matrimonial bond between red-haired Radagon and Rennala of the Full Moon.</text>
<text id="330002040">And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses.</text>
<text id="330002050">The Erdtree of the Capital, and the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="330003000">Oh, was there something you needed?</text>
<text id="330003010">You are free to show yourself around.</text>
<text id="330003020">I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be...</text>
<text id="330003030">If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you.</text>
<text id="330003040">Unless perhaps you are in search of instruction?</text>
<text id="330003050">In which case, I will share all that I know.</text>
<text id="330003060">Whether it be sorcery or incantations, learning should not fetter you to one side or the other.</text>
<text id="330003070">This is, after all, a church celebrating the union of two such opposed practitioners.</text>
<text id="330004000">Is there something else?</text>
<text id="330010000">Greetings. Do you need anything?</text>
<text id="330011000">Do you possess any celestial dew?</text>
<text id="330011010">Then I would like to share my knowledge with you.</text>
<text id="330011020">Concerning the miracle of this Church of Vows.</text>
<text id="330011030">Radagon once cleansed himself with celestial dew,</text>
<text id="330011040">repented his territorial aggressions, and swore his love to Rennala.</text>
<text id="330011050">The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven.</text>
<text id="330011060">This miracle blesses the church to this day.</text>
<text id="330011070">And so, you need only follow Radagon's example,</text>
<text id="330011080">to restore any bond, however strained or severed, to its rightful state of harmony.</text>
<text id="330012000">My faith does not waver.</text>
<text id="330012010">The miracle rooted in these grounds will, once again, mend the world.</text>
<text id="330012020">And this time, its bounty will not be squandered.</text>
<text id="330012030">If you would be Elden Lord, Tarnished,</text>
<text id="330012040">I hope that you, too, will share my faith.</text>
<text id="330014000">Are you taking the sword with you?</text>
<text id="330014010">Oh, fear not, I don't wish to chide you.</text>
<text id="330014020">Clearly, you are no conniving thief.</text>
<text id="330014030">The sword is telling us something, no doubt.</text>
<text id="330014040">Rather than collect dust in the shadows underground,</text>
<text id="330014050">it yearns to be wielded by your rightful hand.</text>
<text id="330014060">Ah, now I recall.</text>
<text id="330014070">As the priest of the Church of Vows, I undo the sword's seal, and bequeath it unto you.</text>
<text id="330014080">May you hold it high and proud.</text>
<text id="330020000">Are you quite finished?</text>
<text id="330020010">Take this opportunity to learn to master your emotions.</text>
<text id="330020020">Worry not, I take no offence. But others are not always so forgiving.</text>
<text id="330020030">Some take to anger, others sorrow... Bonds are fragile things, wont to break under strain.</text>
<text id="330020040">And once they're broken, everything is lost, with naught to gain.</text>
<text id="330021000">Are you quite finished?</text>
<text id="330021010">I suppose my ample frame must have given you quite the fright.</text>
<text id="330021020">Allow me to introduce myself. Miriel, steward of this sacred chamber.</text>
<text id="330021030">My apologies, for the unseemly state of affairs.</text>
<text id="330021040">Do you know the origin of this place?</text>
<text id="330021050">How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?</text>
<text id="330022000">Are you quite finished, now?</text>
<text id="330031000">To experience the miracle, kneel in the basin at the back, and cleanse yourself with celestial dew.</text>
<text id="330031010">Absolution will be yours. Any bond, no matter how strained, or even severed, will be put to rights.</text>
<text id="330033000">Ah, I see you have undergone absolution, the miracle that blossoms from these grounds.</text>
<text id="330033010">Good. As such, the bond you may have strained or severed...</text>
<text id="330033020">Has been restored, to its rightful state of harmony.</text>
<text id="330033030">Be mindful, not to take for granted...</text>
<text id="330033040">the serenity restored by this miracle.</text>
<text id="330033050">And take care. Never to break a bond again.</text>
<text id="330050000">You wish to know more of Lord Radagon?</text>
<text id="330050010">Lord Radagon was a great champion, possessed of flowing red locks.</text>
<text id="330050020">He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle.</text>
<text id="330050030">He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.</text>
<text id="330050040">However. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between,</text>
<text id="330050050">Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort.</text>
<text id="330050060">Taking the title...of second Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="330050070">The mystery endures, to this day...</text>
<text id="330050080">As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside...</text>
<text id="330050090">And moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord...</text>
<text id="330051000">You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret...</text>
<text id="330051010">A famed sculptor of the Erdtree Capital was once summoned to render Lord Radagon's likeness in giant stature.</text>
<text id="330051020">When he glimpsed the skeleton in Radagon's closet.</text>
<text id="330051030">And as such, it's said the great statue harbours his secret too.</text>
<text id="330052000">You wish to know more of Lady Rennala?</text>
<text id="330052010">She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="330052020">The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch.</text>
<text id="330052030">Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her.</text>
<text id="330052040">And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library.</text>
<text id="330053000">In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her.</text>
<text id="330053010">Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite;</text>
<text id="330053020">the grim art of reincarnation.</text>
<text id="330053030">You would do well to remember...</text>
<text id="330053040">Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire.</text>
<text id="330060000">Why, this is nectar, is it not?</text>
<text id="330060010">And you're giving it to me?</text>
<text id="330060020">Oh, wonderful, just wonderful.</text>
<text id="330060030">Truth be told, I'm rather fond of the stuff.</text>
<text id="330060040">I'll happily take it off your hands!</text>
<text id="330061000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="330100000">Oh, what have we here?</text>
<text id="330100010">Very well, let us both learn together.</text>
<text id="330100020">Heresy is not native to the world; it is but a contrivance.</text>
<text id="330100030">All things can be conjoined.</text>
<text id="330800000">Mngh!</text>
<text id="330801000">Stop it, please.</text>
<text id="330801010">My flesh is akin to stone.</text>
<text id="330802000">I cannot be wounded. I cannot die.</text>
<text id="330802010">But nor will I cause any harm unto you.</text>
<text id="330802020">Cease your futile efforts.</text>
<text id="330803000">Well, aren't we determined.</text>
<text id="330803010">...</text>
<text id="330804000">...</text>
<text id="330805000">Aaa...aaargh!</text>
<text id="331001000">What are you lookin' at?</text>
<text id="331001010">You trying to start something, mate?</text>
<text id="331002000">Oh, that necklace what you're after, is it?</text>
<text id="331002010">Hmm, well…</text>
<text id="331002020">Show me what it's worth to you,</text>
<text id="331002030">and I'll consider parting ways with it.</text>
<text id="331002040">I'm not in love with it or nothing.</text>
<text id="331003000">You're a shrewd one, chief.</text>
<text id="331003010">First, you hand me the runes. And don't try nothin', neither.</text>
<text id="331003020">Hmm...</text>
<text id="331003030">Alright. Take it.</text>
<text id="331003040">Thing's no damn use to anyone, anyway.</text>
<text id="331003050">Your bloody idea, mate. Don't come crying to me later.</text>
<text id="331004000">Oh piss off, what is it now?</text>
<text id="331004010">Oh, I see. You want some of me prawn?</text>
<text id="331004020">Freshly cooked, it is.</text>
<text id="331004030">Alright then. It's yours, if you can meet me price.</text>
<text id="331004040">I could be persuaded to sell you some other bits too, if you've got the runes.</text>
<text id="331005000">What the hell is wrong with you.</text>
<text id="331005010">You trying to start something?</text>
<text id="331005020">Piss off. Before I crack you in 'alf.</text>
<text id="331006000">This bloody swine...</text>
<text id="331006010">Decided to play ball now, 'ave you?</text>
<text id="331006110">You'll be wantin' the necklace, then?</text>
<text id="331007000">Think you're bloody clever, do ya?</text>
<text id="331007010">Then how about you piss off?</text>
<text id="331007110">fore I crack you in 'alf.</text>
<text id="331010000">Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.</text>
<text id="331011000">Alright mate. Want some more prawn, do ya?</text>
<text id="331011010">Alright mate. Still 'ungry, are ya?</text>
<text id="331012000">Never met someone with a taste for prawn I couldn't trust.</text>
<text id="331012010">We'd make good mates, I reckon.</text>
<text id="331012020">I'll be seeing ya.</text>
<text id="331015000">Oh, so you met the girl, did ya?</text>
<text id="331015010">Alright, well, sod the particulars of the matter,</text>
<text id="331015020">But it ain't my fault she's stupid enough to get duped, is it.</text>
<text id="331015030">Anyway, she ain't all right, that one.</text>
<text id="331015040">Lucky she ain't died on the bloody roadside, I reckon.</text>
<text id="331016000">You're Tarnished too, ain'tcha?</text>
<text id="331016010">Can you see it then? The guidance of grace, I mean.</text>
<text id="331016020">I can't see it at all no more.</text>
<text id="331016030">Makes no bloody sense anyway, why some no-name shithead like me should get called to the Lands Between.</text>
<text id="331016040">Cruel bloody joke, you ask me.</text>
<text id="331016050">Maybe something went tits up with it. Maybe... it's been broke for a good long time.</text>
<text id="331016060">The Erdtree, I'm sayin'.</text>
<text id="331017000">You what? Sod the particulars, mate.</text>
<text id="331017010">Ain't my fault people are so bloody stupid, is it?</text>
<text id="331017020">Don't like that it's stolen? Don't sodding buy it..</text>
<text id="331020000">What are you lookin' at?</text>
<text id="331020010">Oh...you again, is it.</text>
<text id="331020020">Perfect bloody timing, actually.</text>
<text id="331020030">I got crab, cooked up fresh.</text>
<text id="331021000">Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry.</text>
<text id="331022000">Alright mate. Want some more crab, do ya?</text>
<text id="331022010">Alright mate. Still 'ungry, are ya?</text>
<text id="331023000">Never met someone with a taste for crab I couldn't trust.</text>
<text id="331023010">We've got a real thing here, eh, and it's only gettin' better.</text>
<text id="331025000">Mate, there's somethin' I should probably tell ya.</text>
<text id="331025010">You 'eard of the Dung Eater?</text>
<text id="331025020">E's a madman, 'as it out for everyone. Curses 'em. Goes 'round in this rank armour, an' all.</text>
<text id="331025030">You see 'im though, stay well away.</text>
<text id="331025040">I was in the same gaol as him, once, so I know first 'and.</text>
<text id="331025050">E's a god-forsaken monster. Not just some petty thug like me.</text>
<text id="331026000">E's a killer. Kills people and curses their souls...</text>
<text id="331026010">Does all sorts of shit to their corpses, to keep 'em cursed, forever.</text>
<text id="331026020">I ain't seen nothin' more disgustin' in all my years.</text>
<text id="331026030">I ain't ever been more scared, neither. Rooted to the bloody spot...</text>
<text id="331026040">While 'e did all that, to my friend...</text>
<text id="331027000">Yeah...and now I seen it 'ere, again.</text>
<text id="331027010">Never thought I would. What 'e does to those bodies.</text>
<text id="331027020">It was... It was 'im, no question.</text>
<text id="331027030">That monster. He's lurkin' round 'ere.</text>
<text id="331030000">Heh...serves me right.</text>
<text id="331030010">Fitting bloody end, for a jumped up little shit with big ideas...</text>
<text id="331031000">Help me out, would ya, mate...</text>
<text id="331031010">I don't wanna get cursed. Just let me die...</text>
<text id="331031020">I don't wanna live like this...not anymore...</text>
<text id="331031030">So, please...</text>
<text id="331031040">...</text>
<text id="331800000">Oof!</text>
<text id="331801000">What's your blinkin' problem!</text>
<text id="331801010">You don't mess with Big Boggart, mate.</text>
<text id="331802000">That bitch put you up to this, eh.</text>
<text id="331802010">Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds!</text>
<text id="331803000">Not scared, are ya.</text>
<text id="331803010">Damn it! I'll rip you to shreds!</text>
<text id="331804000">You feel that, eh?</text>
<text id="331804010">That's the fists of Big Boggart.</text>
<text id="331805000">Goddamn it.</text>
<text id="331805010">Why ain't it me, why ain't it ever...</text>
<text id="331900000"> </text>
<text id="331900010"> </text>
<text id="331900020"> </text>
<text id="332001000"><sigh></text>
<text id="332001010">Someone, please, kill him...</text>
<text id="332001020">That horrendous serpent... Praetor Rykard...</text>
<text id="332002000">Mm, you're Tarnished.</text>
<text id="332002010">Here to put the demigods to the sword.</text>
<text id="332002020">Then please. Kill the great serpent.</text>
<text id="332002030">The one that devoured Praetor Rykard.</text>
<text id="332002040">I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber.</text>
<text id="332002050">Worthy Tarnished, brandish the spear, and run him through.</text>
<text id="332002060">The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity.</text>
<text id="332003000">Praetor Rykard's ambitions, though blasphemous, marked him a worthy sovereign.</text>
<text id="332003010">But they were reduced to gluttonous depravity, once he gave himself to the serpent.</text>
<text id="332003020">Whatever that thing is, it is no longer Praetor Rykard.</text>
<text id="332003030">Someone must kill him.</text>
<text id="332003040">To spare him, and his ambitions, from further dishonour.</text>
<text id="332004000">Worthy Tarnished. I left the serpent-slaying spear in the Lord's Chamber.</text>
<text id="332004010">It is the only thing that can kill that horror.</text>
<text id="332004020">Run it through. The great serpent...that unspeakable monstrosity...</text>
<text id="333001000">You're Tarnished, aren't you?</text>
<text id="333001010">Then, perhaps you could spare some runes?</text>
<text id="333001020">Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="333001030">For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.</text>
<text id="333002000">Well, bless you, bless you.</text>
<text id="333002010">You are a true saint.</text>
<text id="333002020">My name is Thops.</text>
<text id="333002030">Presuming you're interested, I can teach you sorceries, as promised.</text>
<text id="333002040">Only, none of them are particularly great...</text>
<text id="333003000">Back to learn another?</text>
<text id="333003010">Wonderful. You're most welcome, to any of my anaemic little spells.</text>
<text id="333004000">Back to learn another?</text>
<text id="333004010">Why, of course.</text>
<text id="333005000">Well, I can't blame you, I suppose.</text>
<text id="333005010">But, in the case that you do change your mind,</text>
<text id="333005020">just speak up, loud and clear.</text>
<text id="333006000">Oh, there you are.</text>
<text id="333006010">Care to donate a few runes?</text>
<text id="333006020">Believe it or not, I studied glintstone sorceries at the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="333006030">For a small donation, I'd be happy to share my knowledge.</text>
<text id="333020000">Apologies, friend.</text>
<text id="333020010">I'm afraid my meagre sorceries are no match for your generosity.</text>
<text id="333020020">Oh, right.</text>
<text id="333020030">I can tell you what I know about this place. That should help a bit.</text>
<text id="333020040">You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water?</text>
<text id="333020050">That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries.</text>
<text id="333020060">Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now.</text>
<text id="333020070">After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering,</text>
<text id="333020080">the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.</text>
<text id="333020100">As you might have guessed, the seals are still active,</text>
<text id="333020110">making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.</text>
<text id="333020120">And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key.</text>
<text id="333020130">When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning.</text>
<text id="333021000">Why not find yourself a glintstone key?</text>
<text id="333021010">Without one, you can't pass through the academy,</text>
<text id="333021020">and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.</text>
<text id="333021030">And if you find an extra glintstone key, perhaps...</text>
<text id="333021040">Once you've tied up all your loose ends - and I can be very patient -</text>
<text id="333021050">would you consider donating it to me?</text>
<text id="333021060">I know it. I'm a bluntstone. Nary a hint of talent for sorcery.</text>
<text id="333021070">But still, my place is at the academy...</text>
<text id="333022000">Oh, one more thing... Beware the Albinaurics...</text>
<text id="333022010">...accursed souls born of a forbidden rite of the Eternal City.</text>
<text id="333022020">The curse withered the legs of the old, and silenced the tongues of the Frogs.</text>
<text id="333022030">And now they hold deep grudges for anyone left untouched.</text>
<text id="333023000">Thank you, kind soul.</text>
<text id="333023010">For learning my paltry sorceries.</text>
<text id="333023020">I never imagined that a bluntstone like myself would have the chance to play teacher.</text>
<text id="333024000">Are you certain?</text>
<text id="333024010">You're willing to give your glintstone key to me?</text>
<text id="333024020">…My oh my!</text>
<text id="333024030">Thank you, thank you dearly.</text>
<text id="333024040">Now I can go back to the academy.</text>
<text id="333024050">To resume my study...of glintstone sorceries, and the very stars.</text>
<text id="333024060">...</text>
<text id="333025000">You've taken an apprenticeship with Sellen?</text>
<text id="333025010">Well, that is something.</text>
<text id="333025020">Sellen was well known. The most promising sorceress in the history of the academy.</text>
<text id="333025030">I followed her at school, but there may as well have been an ocean between us.</text>
<text id="333025040">But Sellen was expelled from the academy.</text>
<text id="333025050">Accused of unthinkable treatment of certain sorcerers, under the name of the Graven Witch.</text>
<text id="333025060">I still don't believe the accusations.</text>
<text id="333025070">The illustrious Sellen would never do such things...</text>
<text id="333026000">Find yourself a glintstone key.</text>
<text id="333026010">Without one, you can't pass through the academy,</text>
<text id="333026020">and you'll never reach the Erdtree Capital.</text>
<text id="333030000">Well, what's this?</text>
<text id="333030010">For me, is it? But surely, that's a passing fine brew?</text>
<text id="333030020">My meagre sorceries hardly warrant such a reward.</text>
<text id="333030030">Oh, bless you.</text>
<text id="333030040">I'll save it for a special occasion.</text>
<text id="333030050">I may never have another drink like it for as long as I live.</text>
<text id="333031000">...</text>
<text id="333040000">So, you've found yourself a glintstone key.</text>
<text id="333040010">But I certainly can't take it from you.</text>
<text id="333040020">That key belongs to you.</text>
<text id="333040030">By rights, you should use it for yourself.</text>
<text id="333040040">It's true, I wish to return to my place of study.</text>
<text id="333040050">But that's no excuse to impose upon others.</text>
<text id="333040060">Ah...is this why bluntstones always finish last?</text>
<text id="333041000">Head to the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="333041010">Carry on with your journey. Press forward with your fight.</text>
<text id="333041020">Don't bother holding yourself up for my sake.</text>
<text id="333051000">Thank you dearly.</text>
<text id="333051010">With your blessing, I will depart for the Academy of Raya Lucaria.</text>
<text id="333051020">Perhaps, one day, you'll pay me a visit?</text>
<text id="333051030">Who knows, I may be a decorated sorcerer by then!</text>
<text id="333051040">Ha ha!</text>
<text id="333100000">Oh, did I not mention?</text>
<text id="333100010">I'm a bluntstone. I don't even have a pebble's worth of power.</text>
<text id="333100020">So I'm afraid I can't help you decipher the scroll.</text>
<text id="333100030">I'm sorry I'm so useless. I truly am.</text>
<text id="333800000">Ow!</text>
<text id="333801000">What's wrong with you?</text>
<text id="333801010">Stop that, now. Please.</text>
<text id="333802000">There's no getting through to you, is there.</text>
<text id="333803000">...</text>
<text id="333803010">Why on earth...</text>
<text id="333804000">Oh, Raya... Lucaria...</text>
<text id="333804010">The home of my studies...</text>
<text id="333900000"> </text>
<text id="333900010"> </text>
<text id="333900020"> </text>
<text id="334001000">Be proud. You were a fine warrior.</text>
<text id="334001010">Your only mistake was your choice of master.</text>
<text id="334001020">Let the winds lift you, to a higher place.</text>
<text id="334002000">Well, who do we have here?</text>
<text id="334002020">Tarnished, are you? Clearly not one of Godrick's lot.</text>
<text id="334002030">I am Nepheli Loux. Tarnished and warrior, like you.</text>
<text id="334002040">I'm here by decree of my father.</text>
<text id="334002050">How utterly repellant this is.</text>
<text id="334002060">This "grafting" of Godrick's ill befits a Lord.</text>
<text id="334002070">He's tainted the very winds.</text>
<text id="334003000">If you intend to challenge Godrick,</text>
<text id="334003010">I ask you call upon me.</text>
<text id="334003020">The winds run foul with his deeds.</text>
<text id="334003030">I'm certain father would permit me aid the fight.</text>
<text id="334004000">Apologies, but I've idled long enough.</text>
<text id="334004010">As fellow Tarnished we must each follow our own guidance.</text>
<text id="334004020">Down whatever road takes us to the throne of Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="334010000">You again...</text>
<text id="334010010">I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="334010020">Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.</text>
<text id="334010030">I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.</text>
<text id="334010040">I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.</text>
<text id="334010050">You defeated him. You should have it.</text>
<text id="334010060">Make good use of it.</text>
<text id="334010070">I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.</text>
<text id="334010080">You again...</text>
<text id="334010090">I thought you'd receive a summons to the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="334010100">Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.</text>
<text id="334010110">I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.</text>
<text id="334010120">I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.</text>
<text id="334010130">You were the one to defeat him, I would hazard?</text>
<text id="334010140">Make good use of it.</text>
<text id="334010150">I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses.</text>
<text id="334011000">Ah, yes.</text>
<text id="334011010">I wonder if you've met my foster father?</text>
<text id="334011020">He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there.</text>
<text id="334011030">If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.</text>
<text id="334011040">Father is leader of the Roundtable.</text>
<text id="334011050">I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while.</text>
<text id="334012000">It's about time I headed off.</text>
<text id="334012010">I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it.</text>
<text id="334018000">You again...</text>
<text id="334018010">You received a summons to the Roundtable?</text>
<text id="334018020">Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.</text>
<text id="334018030">The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="334019000">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="334019010">I've not seen you here before.</text>
<text id="334019020">I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.</text>
<text id="334019030">Here by decree of my father.</text>
<text id="334019040">The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="334020000">Is that some kind of medicine?</text>
<text id="334020010">One that affects the heart, I'd wager.</text>
<text id="334020020">If it's what I think, I have no need of it.</text>
<text id="334020030">I am a warrior.</text>
<text id="334020040">I need no external aid.</text>
<text id="334020050">Not to brave the horrors of battle. Nor to bolster my resolve.</text>
<text id="334030000">Oh, it's you...</text>
<text id="334030020">Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?</text>
<text id="334030030">I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.</text>
<text id="334030040">The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.</text>
<text id="334030050">A waking nightmare, made by men.</text>
<text id="334031000">But this time, I'm a woman grown.</text>
<text id="334031010">And though the suffering cannot be undone, I can still mete out justice.</text>
<text id="334031020">Justice to the oppressors.</text>
<text id="334031030">Let the scars I carve remind them. I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.</text>
<text id="334040000">Ah, you...</text>
<text id="334040010">Please, leave me be.</text>
<text id="334040020">It's pathetic, I know, but I...need to think.</text>
<text id="334041000">...So you know already, do you?</text>
<text id="334041010">Right. It's true. My father cast me out.</text>
<text id="334041020">For indulging my emotions. Forgetting the mission. Punishment for offing his pawns.</text>
<text id="334041030">Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.</text>
<text id="334041040">I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="334041050">And yet I... Though it was not my intent...</text>
<text id="334041060">I betrayed him...</text>
<text id="334042000">I...can no longer trust in father...</text>
<text id="334042010">To think he'd order his men to enact such tragedy...</text>
<text id="334042020">Where is the justice he purports, in that?</text>
<text id="334042030">He once told me that if he became Elden Lord,</text>
<text id="334042040">he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.</text>
<text id="334042050">Was he simply lying to me?</text>
<text id="334043000">No, no, no...</text>
<text id="334043010">How could I say that?</text>
<text id="334043020">Father has always given me his guidance...</text>
<text id="334043030">And now...I've lost it...</text>
<text id="334043040">...</text>
<text id="334050000">Medicine, is it?</text>
<text id="334050010">Fine. I'll take a dose. Perhaps it'll do me some good.</text>
<text id="334050020">...</text>
<text id="334050030">It's very sweet...isn't it...</text>
<text id="334050040">And very...very...</text>
<text id="334050050">...</text>
<text id="334060000">Is that ash?</text>
<text id="334060010">I can smell the ancient storm in it...</text>
<text id="334060030">My thanks. I'll gladly take it.</text>
<text id="334061000">I'm...not like Roderika.</text>
<text id="334061010">I don't feel the presence of spirits, let alone see them.</text>
<text id="334061020">Still, this ash..</text>
<text id="334061030">It reminds me of my first hawk.</text>
<text id="334061040">Thank you.</text>
<text id="334062000">In this ash, I can smell the ancient storm.</text>
<text id="334062010">It reminds me of my first hawk.</text>
<text id="334070000">It's been some time.</text>
<text id="334070010">I must thank you, for your aid.</text>
<text id="334070020">I told father I would be with him no longer.</text>
<text id="334070030">I remembered the vow I took when I first became a warrior, so many moons ago.</text>
<text id="334070040">This land is much like the one from which I hail.</text>
<text id="334070050">I will call upon the storm, to drive away the foulness that has settled on the winds.</text>
<text id="334071000">Again, I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.</text>
<text id="334071010">Some call me by the title of Lady, but I remain the same woman underneath.</text>
<text id="334071020">Though I have now abandoned my former guidance.</text>
<text id="334071030">I cannot express how much you've helped me.</text>
<text id="334071040">Should you become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="334071050">I would gladly lighten your burden.</text>
<text id="334072000">Farewell, fellow warrior.</text>
<text id="334072010">I will remain, to summon the storm.</text>
<text id="334072020">But your guidance, and your fight...</text>
<text id="334072030">Surely lie elsewhere.</text>
<text id="334073000">I will remain, to summon the storm.</text>
<text id="334073010">But your guidance, and your fight...</text>
<text id="334073020">Surely lie elsewhere.</text>
<text id="334800000"> </text>
<text id="334801000">What do you intend?</text>
<text id="334801010">Such conduct ill befits a warrior.</text>
<text id="334802000">I see. You are but a simple villain.</text>
<text id="334802010">Let the scars remind you; this lesson comes from Nepheli Loux!</text>
<text id="334803000">You wouldn't even register as a threat to father.</text>
<text id="334803010">Hurry up and die.</text>
<text id="334804000">Father... I am slain.</text>
<text id="334804010">Please...become Elden Lord...</text>
<text id="334900000"> </text>
<text id="334900010"> </text>
<text id="334900020"> </text>
<text id="335001000">Hm.</text>
<text id="335001010">A new face, are you?</text>
<text id="335001020">Well, while you're here. Have you, too, been seduced by the good lady alcohol?</text>
<text id="335001030">Perhaps you've heard of dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?</text>
<text id="335001040">Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.</text>
<text id="335001050">And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,</text>
<text id="335001060">I'd gladly share some with you.</text>
<text id="335001070">The Lands Between are no kind place for we Tarnished.</text>
<text id="335001080">And I'm getting too old to keep scavenging corpses on the battlefield...</text>
<text id="335002000">You'll help me then?</text>
<text id="335002010">Wonderful! Music to my ears.</text>
<text id="335002020">Then take this with you.</text>
<text id="335002030">That, is St. Trina's Crystal Ball.</text>
<text id="335002040">It can be used to take slumber fog from those submerged in deepest sleep,</text>
<text id="335002050">those merry fools sunk so low they will not awaken.</text>
<text id="335002060">Dreambrew, I should say, is a special filtration of slumber fog.</text>
<text id="335003000">Go ahead and bring me some slumber fog, my compeer.</text>
<text id="335003010">About two should do it, by my reckoning...</text>
<text id="335003020">About three should do it, by my reckoning...</text>
<text id="335003030">About four should do it, by my reckoning...</text>
<text id="335003040">About five should do it, by my reckoning...</text>
<text id="335003050">About six should do it, by my reckoning...</text>
<text id="335003060">And then I'll have enough dreambrew to share.</text>
<text id="335003070">Drink is a wonderful teacher. Imbibe and you will understand; this world's delights, and its futility.</text>
<text id="335004000">You what? You hardly know what you're missing out on.</text>
<text id="335004010">Well, suit yourself. But I'm sure you'll be after a drink before long.</text>
<text id="335004020">Perhaps you'll tire of this crumbling world...</text>
<text id="335004030">Or maybe you'll wish to uncover someone's deepest, darkest secrets...</text>
<text id="335005000">What? Taken an interest in the finer things, after all?</text>
<text id="335005010">Like dreambrew, the nectar of the demigods, once forbidden to we mortals?</text>
<text id="335005020">Well, believe it or not, I know just how to make it.</text>
<text id="335005030">And if you were to help me gather its ingredients,</text>
<text id="335005040">I'd gladly share some with you.</text>
<text id="335005050">What do you say?</text>
<text id="335010000">Ah, I've been eagerly awaiting your return.</text>
<text id="335010010">How did you fare? Find any slumber fog?</text>
<text id="335011000">Hmm, not quite enough.</text>
<text id="335011010">As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need two doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.</text>
<text id="335011020">As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need three doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.</text>
<text id="335011030">As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need four doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.</text>
<text id="335011040">As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need five doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.</text>
<text id="335011050">As I said, if you'd like me to share some dreambrew with you, we'll need six doses of slumber fog, or thereabouts.</text>
<text id="335012000">I see, I see. You have what I asked.</text>
<text id="335012010">All splendid fogs of superior quality. Sediment firmly settled, mm.</text>
<text id="335012020">Good work, my compeer.</text>
<text id="335012030">Here's the dreambrew I promised. All yours.</text>
<text id="335013000">Bring me more slumber fog, my compeer.</text>
<text id="335013010">Do so, and I'll have a bottle of dreambrew with your name on it.</text>
<text id="335014000">Allow me a little advice, my compeer.</text>
<text id="335014010">Dreambrew is known to drag people's secrets into the daylight.</text>
<text id="335014020">If that's what you seek, rather than the usual fleeting pleasures,</text>
<text id="335014030">Then treat them to some dreambrew.</text>
<text id="335014040">Secrets are like fine wine. The longer they mature in the dark, the richer the flavour...</text>
<text id="335014050">Know that, and all will be as you desire. Friendship, rule, intrigue...</text>
<text id="335015000">Did you forget something?</text>
<text id="335016000">Oh, hello there.</text>
<text id="335016010">Have you brought me some more slumber fog?</text>
<text id="335017000">You certainly have a taste for spirits.</text>
<text id="335017010">I'm sure I'll be seeing a lot more of you.</text>
<text id="335018000">...</text>
<text id="335019000">...</text>
<text id="335019010">...</text>
<text id="335020000">As you surely know, my compeer, I am but a humble man of the cloth.</text>
<text id="335020010">And I must profess, the study of alcohol is but another form of worship.</text>
<text id="335020020">Oh, St. Trina. My faith is in alcohol, and the hearts of men.</text>
<text id="335030000">Ah, good to see you.</text>
<text id="335030010">I heard the path to the Haligtree had been reopened.</text>
<text id="335030020">So I forced these old bones to weather the journey.</text>
<text id="335030030">Don't tell me it was you who opened the passage?</text>
<text id="335030040">Nevertheless, it's rather nippy in these lands, eh.</text>
<text id="335030050">But there's nothing like a good drink to warm the cockles...</text>
<text id="335031000">Did you need something else?</text>
<text id="335032000">Oh it's, good, good to see you.</text>
<text id="335032010">I think I was about to freeze solid.</text>
<text id="335033000">...</text>
<text id="335034000">...</text>
<text id="335034010">...</text>
<text id="335040000">You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.</text>
<text id="335040010">Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.</text>
<text id="335040020">The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.</text>
<text id="335040030">Hm? That's quite a face you're pulling...</text>
<text id="335040040">Need I remind you? Though I am but a humble man of the cloth,</text>
<text id="335040050">each of us has our secrets, my compeer.</text>
<text id="335041000">You know, a holy personage was once abducted from these lands.</text>
<text id="335041010">Thus I am here in search of clues that might unravel the mystery.</text>
<text id="335041020">The abductor's bloody footprints are said to have disappeared in the Forest of Ancient Bowers.</text>
<text id="335050000">Finally, I have found it!</text>
<text id="335050010">St. Trina's, no, Lord Miquella's cadaver.</text>
<text id="335050020">I have partaken of untold secrets.</text>
<text id="335050030">Such that I might aid you, O Lord.</text>
<text id="335050040">So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,</text>
<text id="335050050">Into your dream, the world of your heart.</text>
<text id="335050060">Indeed, I beg you grant my wish,</text>
<text id="335050070">That when you transcend from empyrean to god, allow me a place by your side.</text>
<text id="335051000">I have partaken of untold secrets.</text>
<text id="335051010">Such that I might aid you, O Lord.</text>
<text id="335051020">So please, I hope you can welcome your humble servant Rhico,</text>
<text id="335051030">Into your dream, the world of your heart.</text>
<text id="335060000">...</text>
<text id="335100000">Oh ho, are you asking me to partake?</text>
<text id="335100010">Well, I haven't got a clue what to think.</text>
<text id="335100020">Is this outright impudence? Simple callousness? Or genuine kindness, I wonder?</text>
<text id="335100030">...</text>
<text id="335100040">Well, what matters it? I'll take some, regardless.</text>
<text id="335100050">You couldn't possibly fathom the secrets I possess, my compeer.</text>
<text id="335101000">...</text>
<text id="335800000">...</text>
<text id="335800010">Have you lost your marbles?</text>
<text id="335800020">You do know I'm merely a beggar.</text>
<text id="335800030">I've nothing left to give.</text>
<text id="335801000">Haven't you Tarnished any respect?</text>
<text id="335801010">For those who came before you.</text>
<text id="335802000">Well, that knocked the wind out of me.</text>
<text id="335802010">The perfect time to try that special reserve…</text>
<text id="335803000">You base, facile, uncharitable bastard…</text>
<text id="335803010">You're beyond help, my compeer…</text>
<text id="335900000"> </text>
<text id="335900010"> </text>
<text id="335900020"> </text>
<text id="335900030"> </text>
<text id="337001000">Welcome, dear guest.</text>
<text id="337001010">After being out there, it must be quite surprising,</text>
<text id="337001020">to see our capital, cradled by the Erdtree, showered by an eternal wellspring of grace.</text>
<text id="337001030">The sights, the sounds, the luscious scents. Each precisely as they should be. Each eternal.</text>
<text id="337002000">Oh?</text>
<text id="337002010">I didn't notice that you were Tarnished.</text>
<text id="337002020">...</text>
<text id="337002030">Now, you mustn't take this the wrong way.</text>
<text id="337002040">But you must leave the capital at once.</text>
<text id="337003000">It is for your own good, I assure you.</text>
<text id="337003010">All things have their proper place.</text>
<text id="337003020">We, having been chosen by grace, were given this Golden Capital.</text>
<text id="337003030">You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here.</text>
<text id="337003040">So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch.</text>
<text id="337003050">The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds.</text>
<text id="337003060">Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground.</text>
<text id="337003070">But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken!</text>
<text id="337003080">Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace,</text>
<text id="337003090">the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall!</text>
<text id="337003100">The lesson here is self-evident.</text>
<text id="337003110">The capital is simply not where you belong.</text>
<text id="337004000">You mustn't take it the wrong way.</text>
<text id="337004010">But you must leave the capital at once.</text>
<text id="337010000">Well, what have we here...</text>
<text id="337010010">You hunt Omen, do you?</text>
<text id="337010020">Mm-hmm, yes it appears so...</text>
<text id="337010030">Well, then perhaps we can talk.</text>
<text id="337010040">For a barbarous Tarnished, you see the difference between right and wrong rather clearly.</text>
<text id="337010050">Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being.</text>
<text id="337010060">And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen.</text>
<text id="337010070">The Undercapital is a repository of waste.</text>
<text id="337010080">For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn.</text>
<text id="337010090">And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here.</text>
<text id="337010100">A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity.</text>
<text id="337011000">Get on with it, then.</text>
<text id="337011010">Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls.</text>
<text id="337011020">I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight.</text>
<text id="337020000">Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?</text>
<text id="337020010">Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw.</text>
<text id="337020020">I forgive you.</text>
<text id="337020030">We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble.</text>
<text id="337021000">Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?</text>
<text id="337021010">That wretched screeching... I feel as if I could go mad.</text>
<text id="337030000">Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you.</text>
<text id="337030010">You must've expunged the Omen from the repository.</text>
<text id="337030020">Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears.</text>
<text id="337030030">Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say.</text>
<text id="337030040">The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it.</text>
<text id="337030050">No, this is above their station...</text>
<text id="337030060">If I explained that this was all my idea,</text>
<text id="337030070">I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace.</text>
<text id="337030080">What a wondrous opportunity.</text>
<text id="337030090">That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace.</text>
<text id="337030100">Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights.</text>
<text id="337031000">Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely.</text>
<text id="337031010">This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations.</text>
<text id="337031020">It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request.</text>
<text id="337032000">I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but...</text>
<text id="337032010">For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory.</text>
<text id="337033000">Now, I need to get myself ready.</text>
<text id="337033010">If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace,</text>
<text id="337033020">I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best.</text>
<text id="337040000">Kill our lord...</text>
<text id="337040010">He is a stain upon all things golden...</text>
<text id="337040020">Kill Morgott, kingly impostor!</text>
<text id="337040030"> </text>
<text id="348001000">Ah...ahh...</text>
<text id="348002000">Ngh... W-who's there?</text>
<text id="348002010">Well, it matters not. If you are wise, you will leave, immediately.</text>
<text id="348002020">My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.</text>
<text id="348002030">It is a curse. Not to be meddled with by man.</text>
<text id="348003000">If you are wise, you will leave, immediately.</text>
<text id="348003010">My flesh writhes with scarlet rot.</text>
<text id="348010000">You ask that I stab myself with the needle...</text>
<text id="348010010">To quell the scarlet rot?</text>
<text id="348010020">But...how?</text>
<text id="348010030">...</text>
<text id="348010040">Never mind. I've decided.</text>
<text id="348010050">I would rather trust you,</text>
<text id="348010060">than simply continue to spoil from within.</text>
<text id="348011000">Would you mind...averting your eyes for a moment?</text>
<text id="348011050">Well. That was easier than expected.</text>
<text id="348011060">But...why do I feel so...</text>
<text id="348011070">...</text>
<text id="348012000">...</text>
<text id="348020000">I...hoped to see you again.</text>
<text id="348020010">My apologies, for when last we met. I fainted before I could even thank you.</text>
<text id="348020020">Everything is as you said. Since inserting the needle, the scarlet rot has ceased to writhe.</text>
<text id="348020030">Even the nightmares have abated... And now, though I can scarcely believe it myself, I can move as I please.</text>
<text id="348020040">Not that I could ever truly repay you,</text>
<text id="348020050">but I would like you to have this, by way of thanks. A token, though it is.</text>
<text id="348021000">I'm considering leaving. On a journey.</text>
<text id="348021010">With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...</text>
<text id="348021020">My destiny...</text>
<text id="348021030">It's all thanks to you.</text>
<text id="348021040">My name is Millicent. I pray fate permits us meet again.</text>
<text id="348022000">I'm considering leaving. On a journey.</text>
<text id="348022010">With the needle buried in my flesh, I've started to recall, but dimly...</text>
<text id="348022020">My destiny...</text>
<text id="348025000">Oh, hello again.</text>
<text id="348025010">Something about this place felt familiar to me.</text>
<text id="348025020">So I decided to pay a visit, hoping to find someone here.</text>
<text id="348025030">But I've only found emptiness.</text>
<text id="348025040">Perhaps before my departure, I needed someone to say farewell to.</text>
<text id="348026000">Well, never mind that.</text>
<text id="348026010">I must focus on my journey, for which I have you to thank.</text>
<text id="348026020">I must stay strong.</text>
<text id="348030000">Ah. We meet again.</text>
<text id="348030010">In truth, it's been smooth sailing, for me.</text>
<text id="348030020">The scarlet rot has stilled, since last we met.</text>
<text id="348030030">As such, I've been able to continue my journey.</text>
<text id="348030040">Though rather vexingly,</text>
<text id="348030050">I realise that if I still had my sword arm,</text>
<text id="348030060">I could have aided you in battle.</text>
<text id="348031000">Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took,</text>
<text id="348031010">after unleashing the power of the scarlet rot, during her battle with General Radahn, in the Caelid Wilds.</text>
<text id="348031020">I should like to meet her, this vanished woman.</text>
<text id="348031030">I think she's in the north.</text>
<text id="348031040">In the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="348032000">Are you...</text>
<text id="348032010">Giving me this arm?</text>
<text id="348032020">I thank you.</text>
<text id="348032030">I am in your debt, yet again.</text>
<text id="348032040">I think, If the arm serves well enough,</text>
<text id="348032050">It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.</text>
<text id="348033000">If the arm serves well enough,</text>
<text id="348033010">It might be possible for me to wield a sword again.</text>
<text id="348033020">Perhaps, then, I can aid you in battle.</text>
<text id="348035000">Now, I'm tracing the path Malenia took.</text>
<text id="348035010">She's passed into to the lands that lie beyond the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="348040000">Ah, we meet yet again.</text>
<text id="348040010">The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.</text>
<text id="348040020">It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.</text>
<text id="348040030">Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.</text>
<text id="348040040">Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle again, should you ever have the need.</text>
<text id="348041000">Ah, we meet yet again.</text>
<text id="348041010">The arm you gave me truly is a thing of wonder.</text>
<text id="348041020">It feels just like my own, even handling a sword.</text>
<text id="348041030">Perhaps it is foolish to say this to you of all people, but I am sure of my skill with the sword.</text>
<text id="348041040">Thus, I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.</text>
<text id="348042000">I would have you call upon me in battle, should you ever have the need.</text>
<text id="348042010">It is the only way that I can express my thanks.</text>
<text id="348050000">To think we'd meet in such a place...</text>
<text id="348050010">What could your purpose possibly...</text>
<text id="348050020">No, I know well enough who you are, and what I know is good enough for me.</text>
<text id="348050030">Call upon me again in battle, should you have the need.</text>
<text id="348051000">I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins.</text>
<text id="348051010">I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.</text>
<text id="348051020">I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.</text>
<text id="348051030">Indeed, I believe that is where Malenia will be found.</text>
<text id="348051040">The Haligtree is hidden somewhere in these Northern lands.</text>
<text id="348052000">I'm searching for a fort to the west of the ruins.</text>
<text id="348052010">I'm searching for a fort to the north of the ruins.</text>
<text id="348052020">I heard the master of the fort was given a medallion that allowed him to visit the Haligtree.</text>
<text id="348060000">Again we meet.</text>
<text id="348060010">I can only surmise our purposes are aligned.</text>
<text id="348060020">In which case, allow me to explain myself.</text>
<text id="348060030">I am of Malenia's blood.</text>
<text id="348060040">But in what capacity I know not. I could be sister, daughter, or an offshoot…</text>
<text id="348060050">Whatever the case though, I am certain of a kinship between us.</text>
<text id="348061000">There is something I must return to Malenia.</text>
<text id="348061010">The will that was once her own.</text>
<text id="348061020">The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.</text>
<text id="348061030">The pride she abandoned, to meet Radahn's measure.</text>
<text id="348062000">There is something I must return to Malenia.</text>
<text id="348062010">The will that was once her own.</text>
<text id="348062020">The dignity, the sense of self, that allowed her to resist the call of the scarlet rot.</text>
<text id="348070000">Oh, hello.</text>
<text id="348070010">Thank you for lending your hand.</text>
<text id="348070020">Without your help, I could not have defeated that quartet.</text>
<text id="348070030">I feel as if I've been in your debt from beginning to end.</text>
<text id="348070040">Thank you. With your help, I was able to live as my own person, if only in passing.</text>
<text id="348071000">But this is where things end.</text>
<text id="348071010">I pause to even tell you, but...</text>
<text id="348071020">I took out the needle myself.</text>
<text id="348071030">Tell whoever put you up to this.</text>
<text id="348071040">That if I am to flower into something other than myself,</text>
<text id="348071050">I would rather rot into nothingness as I am.</text>
<text id="348072000">Please, let me pass alone.</text>
<text id="348072010">The scarlet rot writhes now, worse than ever.</text>
<text id="348072020">Soon, I won't be more than a mound of flesh.</text>
<text id="348072030">Curse-laden. Untouchable.</text>
<text id="348072040">I wouldn't want such a thing to bring you harm.</text>
<text id="348800000">Ugh.</text>
<text id="348801000">Is there something wrong?</text>
<text id="348801010">Please, cease this at once.</text>
<text id="348802000">Why are you doing this?</text>
<text id="348802010">Now you've forced my hand.</text>
<text id="348803000">I will not forget what you did for me.</text>
<text id="348803010">But this day marks our farewell.</text>
<text id="348804000">I did not imagine it ending like this.</text>
<text id="348804010">But I will not forget what you have done.</text>
<text id="348804020">Thank...you...</text>
<text id="348805000">Ahh, how could you...</text>
<text id="348805010">Is this your true heart?</text>
<text id="348805020">Was I... was it all...for this?</text>
<text id="348900000"> </text>
<text id="348900100"> </text>
<text id="348900200"> </text>
<text id="349001000">Oh, a pleasure to see you, a pleasure indeed.</text>
<text id="349001010">I am Gowry. A great sage, in my day, anyway.</text>
<text id="349001020">I'd hoped to ask a favour, when one of your ilk came along.</text>
<text id="349001030">A strapping young Tarnished, able to cross the scarlet swamp of Aeonia.</text>
<text id="349001040">Don't fret, I'll provide fine recompense.</text>
<text id="349001050">Should you accept…</text>
<text id="349001060">I will teach you the secret of Sellia, the town you see there.</text>
<text id="349010000">Ah, then you're willing to lend a hand, are you?</text>
<text id="349010010">I need your help to heal a certain young girl.</text>
<text id="349010020">Her name is Millicent. You will find her beyond Sellia,</text>
<text id="349010030">resting at the church atop the cliff, stricken by the rotting sickness.</text>
<text id="349011000">The rotting sickness that afflicts Millicent has no cure.</text>
<text id="349011010">When the Erdtree flourished, even the demigods could not stave off its effects, despite their nigh godhood.</text>
<text id="349011020">But Millicent's suffering can be ameliorated.</text>
<text id="349011030">For this, you are to find a certain needle.</text>
<text id="349011040">Seek the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia, outside Sellia's bounds.</text>
<text id="349011050">The needle, made from unalloyed gold, is lost somewhere there.</text>
<text id="349012000">First, you must find the unalloyed gold needle.</text>
<text id="349012010">It's hidden somewhere in the deep scarlet swamp of Aeonia.</text>
<text id="349012020">Then I will tell you, as promised.</text>
<text id="349012030">The secret of the town of Sellia.</text>
<text id="349013000">Ah, my apologies. I rather got ahead of myself, didn't I.</text>
<text id="349013010">Well, no matter. I'm accustomed to waiting.</text>
<text id="349013020">But if you should decide to hear my offer, whenever that may be,</text>
<text id="349013030">do come and speak with me again.</text>
<text id="349013040">I'll wait as long as it takes.</text>
<text id="349014000">Ah, changed your mind, have you?</text>
<text id="349014010">If you are willing to undertake my request,</text>
<text id="349014020">I'll gladly share with you the secret of Sellia, the town yonder.</text>
<text id="349020000">Ohh, you've found the unalloyed gold needle.</text>
<text id="349020010">As promised, I've detailed the secret of Sellia right here.</text>
<text id="349020020">Go on, it's yours.</text>
<text id="349020030">Now, let me have a look at the needle.</text>
<text id="349020040">Hmm.</text>
<text id="349020050">Hmmmm.</text>
<text id="349020060">Well, well, this is a marvel indeed.</text>
<text id="349020070">The work of a true artisan…a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life.</text>
<text id="349020080">Can you give me some time with this?</text>
<text id="349020090">As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.</text>
<text id="349021000">I have awaited your return.</text>
<text id="349021010">The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure.</text>
<text id="349021020">Will you give it to the girl, Millicent?</text>
<text id="349021030">I will reward you in kind.</text>
<text id="349021040">Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder.</text>
<text id="349021050">Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god.</text>
<text id="349021060">A wretched fate, indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this.</text>
<text id="349022000">Do you find it peculiar?</text>
<text id="349022010">That I would show such concern for the girl.</text>
<text id="349022020">Well, I'm the one that found her.</text>
<text id="349022030">A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia.</text>
<text id="349022040">She is one of my dear daughters.</text>
<text id="349022050">But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory.</text>
<text id="349022060">I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me.</text>
<text id="349022070">Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much.</text>
<text id="349022080">Ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="349023000">Can you give me some time with this?</text>
<text id="349023010">As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it.</text>
<text id="349027000">Now, all you need do is deliver the needle to Millicent.</text>
<text id="349027010">She's convalescing in the church atop the cliff just beyond Sellia.</text>
<text id="349027020">Do so, and you shall receive handsome recompense, of course.</text>
<text id="349030000">Thank you kindly.</text>
<text id="349030010">For giving the needle to Millicent.</text>
<text id="349030020">Now she, too, can begin her journey.</text>
<text id="349030030">And stare her fate straight in the eye.</text>
<text id="349030040">You've been a saint, through and through.</text>
<text id="349030050">As thanks, I vow to impart to you my knowledge</text>
<text id="349030060">of the lost sorceries of the Sellians, descendants of the Eternal.</text>
<text id="349031000">Please make certain that little Millicent goes unharmed.</text>
<text id="349031010">Like her mother, she has the stuff to be a great warrior,</text>
<text id="349031020">but commands only one arm, and is yet preciously young.</text>
<text id="349032000">Oh, you noticed, did you?</text>
<text id="349032010">Indeed, Millicent did visit this hovel of a home.</text>
<text id="349032020">It seems the memories eaten away by the rotting sickness yet remain, but faintly.</text>
<text id="349032030">However, she has no need of me, any more.</text>
<text id="349032040">No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede.</text>
<text id="349032050">As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young...</text>
<text id="349032060">Is to be forgotten.</text>
<text id="349035000">Ah, welcome, welcome. How may I help?</text>
<text id="349036000">Do you...need me for something else?</text>
<text id="349040000">So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement…</text>
<text id="349040010">This is a wonderful development.</text>
<text id="349040020">Thank you for your kindness.</text>
<text id="349040030">Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential.</text>
<text id="349040040">Like her beautiful mother.</text>
<text id="349041000">The girl, Millicent. She is a bud.</text>
<text id="349041010">Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence.</text>
<text id="349041020">What a wondrous day that will be.</text>
<text id="349041030">In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality.</text>
<text id="349041040">She might very well outshine her sisters.</text>
<text id="349050000">Do you have an interest in rot incantations?</text>
<text id="349050010">Then you might like to learn something of the history...</text>
<text id="349050020">of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot.</text>
<text id="349051000">Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.</text>
<text id="349051010">She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.</text>
<text id="349051020">An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.</text>
<text id="349051030">In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika,</text>
<text id="349051040">the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.</text>
<text id="349051050">Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.</text>
<text id="349051060">And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth.</text>
<text id="349060000">Oh, Millicent. Finding herself, is she?</text>
<text id="349060010">The words of a true innocent, the dear girl.</text>
<text id="349060020">Well, perhaps this is just as it should be.</text>
<text id="349060030">Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what.</text>
<text id="349060040">This is their fate, after all.</text>
<text id="349070000"><sobbing></text>
<text id="349071000">Oh, mm, I didn't notice you there.</text>
<text id="349071010">Welcome. How may I help you?</text>
<text id="349071020">My apologies though, you hardly needed to see me like that.</text>
<text id="349072000">Oh, it's just…</text>
<text id="349072010">I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and…</text>
<text id="349072020">My eyes began to well...</text>
<text id="349072030">She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.</text>
<text id="349072040">And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.</text>
<text id="349072050">Which is why...</text>
<text id="349072060">If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,</text>
<text id="349072070">I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.</text>
<text id="349072080">It must be done by your hand; no other.</text>
<text id="349072090">Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.</text>
<text id="349072100">Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.</text>
<text id="349072110">When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.</text>
<text id="349072120">As a scarlet valkyrie.</text>
<text id="349073000">Thus, I have a request of the utmost import.</text>
<text id="349073010">I beg you, kill Millicent.</text>
<text id="349073020">Before the girl can meet her sisters.</text>
<text id="349073030">There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone.</text>
<text id="349073040">You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart.</text>
<text id="349073050">Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you.</text>
<text id="349073060">Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie.</text>
<text id="349074000">You can't tell me you don't wish to see it.</text>
<text id="349074010">The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?</text>
<text id="349074020">I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands.</text>
<text id="349075000">Welcome, welcome. How may I help you?</text>
<text id="349075010">Oh how I have counted the days. Millicent shall soon meet her sisters.</text>
<text id="349076000">When the time is ripe...</text>
<text id="349076010">Do what you must to ensure Millicent dies.</text>
<text id="349076020"><sigh></text>
<text id="349076030">Millicent, my daughter.</text>
<text id="349076040">Why would you take out the needle?</text>
<text id="349076050">You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers.</text>
<text id="349076060">Would you disown us too? As your Mother did?</text>
<text id="349076070">We children of the scarlet rot?</text>
<text id="349078000">Millicent...</text>
<text id="349078010">Malenia...</text>
<text id="349078020">Do you detest us, so utterly?</text>
<text id="349080000">Have you taken the lesson, now?</text>
<text id="349080010">Killing me is but an exercise in futility.</text>
<text id="349080020">All is well, provided you understand.</text>
<text id="349080030">Let's just pretend it never happened, shall we?</text>
<text id="349080040"><sobbing></text>
<text id="349080050">O Millicent, my daughter...</text>
<text id="349080060">Who would prune your sapling flesh?</text>
<text id="349080070">Such...such cruel and vulgar violence...</text>
<text id="349080080"><sobbing></text>
<text id="349101000">Oh, Millicent...</text>
<text id="349101010">My most promising little bud...</text>
<text id="349101020"><sobbing></text>
<text id="349110000">Well, well. What have we here?</text>
<text id="349110010">I-is this to toast the girl's departure?</text>
<text id="349110020">How very kind of you.</text>
<text id="349111000">Well, well. What have we here?</text>
<text id="349111010">Is this to toast the girl's flowering?</text>
<text id="349111020">You've got a good head on your shoulders.</text>
<text id="349111030">How very kind of you.</text>
<text id="349112000"><sleeping></text>
<text id="349800000">Owgh!</text>
<text id="349801000">Please, enough.</text>
<text id="349801010">There is nothing to be gained by persevering.</text>
<text id="349802000">So, the lesson remains unlearned.</text>
<text id="349802010">Perhaps you've taken one knock to the head too many.</text>
<text id="349803000">We shall meet again, you and I.</text>
<text id="349803010">There are countless pests to choose from.</text>
<text id="349804000">We shall meet again.</text>
<text id="349804010">As many times as it takes. For you to understand.</text>
<text id="349900000"> </text>
<text id="349900010"> </text>
<text id="351001000">Oh, I see you've just arrived.</text>
<text id="351001010">Welcome to the Roundtable Hold. I'm Corhyn, a man of the cloth.</text>
<text id="351001020">I teach incantations, the strength granted us by the Two Fingers,</text>
<text id="351001030">and explore the secrets of the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="351001040">So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,</text>
<text id="351001050">ensuring order regains its proper form, righting rule over men.</text>
<text id="351001060">By the way, do you still see it? The guidance of grace.</text>
<text id="351002000">You do! Wonderful news.</text>
<text id="351002010">Most Tarnished are blind to it these days.</text>
<text id="351002020">You are something of a rare breed.</text>
<text id="351002030">Well, what do you say? Care to learn an incantation of the Two Fingers?</text>
<text id="351003000">Ah, well, that is unfortunate.</text>
<text id="351003010">But no cause for despair.</text>
<text id="351003020">It's likely a temporary condition, I'm told. For whatever reason, it happens from time to time.</text>
<text id="351003030">Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.</text>
<text id="351003040">I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.</text>
<text id="351004000">What is it?</text>
<text id="351004010">Has the guidance of grace returned to your vision?</text>
<text id="351005000">Ah, I see.</text>
<text id="351005010">Just keep your chin up, and stay the path.</text>
<text id="351005020">I pray the great guidance of grace returns to you.</text>
<text id="351010000">Further study of incantations, is it?</text>
<text id="351010010">I can happily spare the time, and applaud your enthusiasm.</text>
<text id="351011000">Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.</text>
<text id="351011010">Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?</text>
<text id="351012000">May the Golden Order shine through you.</text>
<text id="351015000">There's something I should mention to you, as well.</text>
<text id="351015010">I'm thinking of leaving the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="351015020">Do you know of the noble Goldmask?</text>
<text id="351015030">Though he was but a Tarnished, living outside the Lands Between,</text>
<text id="351015040">he was a great scholar, who foresaw the coming guidance of grace.</text>
<text id="351015050">And now, I hear he has come to the Lands Between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order...</text>
<text id="351015060">I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research.</text>
<text id="351020000">Ah, I had been waiting for your return.</text>
<text id="351020010">I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold after all.</text>
<text id="351020020">As I mentioned, I'm off in search of the noble Goldmask.</text>
<text id="351020030">We may not meet again for some time.</text>
<text id="351020040">If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.</text>
<text id="351021000">Ah, I had been waiting for your return.</text>
<text id="351021010">I've decided to leave the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="351021020">I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the Goldmask, to beg his instruction.</text>
<text id="351021030">We may not meet again for some time.</text>
<text id="351021040">If there's any incantations you wish to learn, now's the moment.</text>
<text id="351030000">Ah, look who we have here.</text>
<text id="351030010">How delightful, to meet a familiar face, even after departing the Roundtable Hold.</text>
<text id="351030020">I've been doing some learning of my own since then, actually.</text>
<text id="351030030">And will happily pass it along to you.</text>
<text id="351035000">I'm yet to find the noble Goldmask.</text>
<text id="351035010">I suppose he'll be closer to the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="351035020">The path ahead might be perilous, but tread it I shall.</text>
<text id="351035030">Since departing the Roundtable Hold, I've come to understand, in my solitude,</text>
<text id="351035040">How little it is I truly know...</text>
<text id="351036000">Do...do you sport with me!?</text>
<text id="351036010">From your description, it can be no other than the Goldmask himself!</text>
<text id="351036020">Of course, of course, I knew he would be close by.</text>
<text id="351036030">Bless the Golden Order, and its benevolent rays.</text>
<text id="351036040">And to you too. My sincerest thanks.</text>
<text id="351037000">I will soon leave to join the noble Goldmask.</text>
<text id="351037010">It is entirely thanks to you. You have my sincerest gratitude.</text>
<text id="351040000">Ah, we meet yet again.</text>
<text id="351040010">Thanks to you, I have become acquainted with the noble Goldmask himself,</text>
<text id="351040020">and taken my place by his side, as you can see.</text>
<text id="351040030">Have no fear, I will still teach you incantations, as before.</text>
<text id="351040040">Though we must do so quietly, such that we not disturb the great master's cogitation.</text>
<text id="351041000">Further study of incantations, is it?</text>
<text id="351041010">Indeed, I applaud your enthusiasm.</text>
<text id="351042000">Ah, you appear to be doing well. Very good.</text>
<text id="351042010">Well then. Would you like to learn an incantation?</text>
<text id="351043000">May the Golden Order shine through you.</text>
<text id="351045000">The master is always deep in contemplation.</text>
<text id="351045010">While I frantically attempt to record his wisdom; the movement of his finger.</text>
<text id="351045020">And though I am yet to comprehend even the daintiest morsel of his wisdom...</text>
<text id="351045030">I know that this, this is my life's calling.</text>
<text id="351045040">The Golden Order has bestowed me, talentless as I am, the great duty of documentarian.</text>
<text id="351046000">Master! What ever is the matter?</text>
<text id="351046010">Please, I implore you continue! Continue your reflections, your rhythms!</text>
<text id="351046020">I must be the one to record them!</text>
<text id="351046030">What matters this issue of Radagon, really?</text>
<text id="351046040">The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!</text>
<text id="351046050">Why must these qualms come to you now?</text>
<text id="351046060">We were on the very cusp!</text>
<text id="351047000">Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed.</text>
<text id="351047010">I'm a little shaken since the master ceased his movements.</text>
<text id="351048000">Did you need something else?</text>
<text id="351049000">Oh, was that you?</text>
<text id="351049010">Yes, the master is still ceased.</text>
<text id="351049020">And after coming all this way... Why now, of all times?</text>
<text id="351050000">The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="351050010">While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild.</text>
<text id="351050020">Until he simply ceased.</text>
<text id="351050030">Now the master is facing quite the puzzle.</text>
<text id="351050040">The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However...</text>
<text id="351050050">The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...</text>
<text id="351050060">Who exactly was Radagon?</text>
<text id="351050070">The master is stumped.</text>
<text id="351050080">His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.</text>
<text id="351050090">Curse my mediocre mind.</text>
<text id="351050100">The master only has me, and here I fail him...</text>
<text id="351051000">What on earth did you do to the master?</text>
<text id="351051010">Well, not that I'm complaining.</text>
<text id="351051020">Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me.</text>
<text id="351051030">I haven't the words to thank you.</text>
<text id="351051040">So I'd like to pass this on to you instead.</text>
<text id="351051050">A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly.</text>
<text id="351052000">To think, that Radagon was Marika herself.</text>
<text id="351052010">Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger.</text>
<text id="351052020">How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder.</text>
<text id="351052030">Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself.</text>
<text id="351052040">Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter?</text>
<text id="351052050">...</text>
<text id="351052060">Well, either way, I can continue my documentation.</text>
<text id="351052070">In truth it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not,</text>
<text id="351052080">I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose.</text>
<text id="351053000">Who exactly was Radagon?</text>
<text id="351053010">The master is stumped.</text>
<text id="351053020">His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.</text>
<text id="351053030">But oh, how important could it really be?</text>
<text id="351053040">The Erdtree, heart of the Golden Order, lies before our very eyes!</text>
<text id="351053050">Why must these qualms come to you now?</text>
<text id="351053060">We were on the very cusp!</text>
<text id="351060000">Ah, nice to see you.</text>
<text id="351060010">I can't believe you've come all this way.</text>
<text id="351061000">Do you need...something else?</text>
<text id="351062000">Ah, nice to see you.</text>
<text id="351062010">Do you need...something else?</text>
<text id="351065000">I've…been gripped by a terrifying thought.</text>
<text id="351065010">The rhythms and calculus of the master's finger...</text>
<text id="351065020">betray a suspicion of the holism of the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="351065030">A conceit, I am afraid, that cannot be overlooked.</text>
<text id="351065040">Oh, but how could this be?</text>
<text id="351065050">I dread to even entertain the possibility...</text>
<text id="351065060">but somehow, I cannot cast aside my doubts about the master.</text>
<text id="351065070">Tell me, have I simply lost my head?</text>
<text id="351065080">Only, if the master were true to the Golden Order,</text>
<text id="351065090">why would he think to breach this forbidden mount of fire?</text>
<text id="351066000">Oh master, put my mind at ease.</text>
<text id="351066010">Dispel these fearsome thoughts.</text>
<text id="351066020">I want to place my trust in you, to be your scribe.</text>
<text id="351066030"><sobbing></text>
<text id="351067000">What...is this?</text>
<text id="351067010">It will make me forget, you say?</text>
<text id="351067020">So that I can push aside these frightful thoughts...</text>
<text id="351067030">Ha...ha ha...</text>
<text id="351067040">Would that I could... Would that I could...</text>
<text id="351067050"> </text>
<text id="351070000">Oh, it's you.</text>
<text id="351070010">I've finally come to understand.</text>
<text id="351070020">The master was nothing more than a madman.</text>
<text id="351070030">Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,</text>
<text id="351070040">seeking to supplant our glorious faith with his own!</text>
<text id="351070050">Could there be a more pitiable comedy?</text>
<text id="351070060">Look at it. The culmination of perfection, burning, before our very eyes!</text>
<text id="351070070">Ha...ha ha ha...</text>
<text id="351080000">Master...where did you go?</text>
<text id="351080010">I'm right here. Please, show me.</text>
<text id="351080020">Your finger. Your rhythms, and calculus.</text>
<text id="351080030">Let me document the motions...</text>
<text id="351080040">Master...master...</text>
<text id="351080050">Where did you go?</text>
<text id="351090000">This...is a volume of incantation.</text>
<text id="351090010">It's good to see your enthusiasm.</text>
<text id="351090020">Indeed, I will happily take it off your hands.</text>
<text id="351091000">That...is a work of heresy.</text>
<text id="351091010">Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="351091020">My interests lie solely in the Golden Order.</text>
<text id="351091030">I cannot accept this.</text>
<text id="351092000">That...is a work of heresy.</text>
<text id="351092010">Its incantations bear no lineage from the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="351092020">...</text>
<text id="351092030">Very well...I'll take it off your hands.</text>
<text id="351092040">I cannot afford to maintain my innocence any longer. I must dirty my hands to test my faith.</text>
<text id="351092050">Even if it offers only the most meagre of hints, I will do whatever I can to help my master.</text>
<text id="351800000">Ngh!</text>
<text id="351801000">What are you trying to achieve?</text>
<text id="351801010">Cease that!</text>
<text id="351802000">You've done it now.</text>
<text id="351802010">Faith grants me strength, that I might endure.</text>
<text id="351802020">O Golden Order, shine through me.</text>
<text id="351803000">I pray...</text>
<text id="351803010">That the guidance of grace abandons you.</text>
<text id="351804000">Please don't trouble us again.</text>
<text id="351805000">O guidance...of grace...</text>
<text id="351805010">Why...can't I...</text>
<text id="351806000">O, master...</text>
<text id="351806010">To be ever...at your side...</text>
<text id="351900000"> </text>
<text id="351900010"> </text>
<text id="351900020"> </text>
<text id="700001000">A proper death means returning to the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="700001010">Have patience. Until the time comes...and the roots call to you.</text>
<text id="700001020">...</text>
<text id="700010000">The mausoleum prowls. Cradling the soulless demigod.</text>
<text id="700010010">O Marika, Queen Eternal. He is your unwanted child.</text>
<text id="700010020">...</text>
<text id="700020000">O Sapling! Sweet sapling of glorious gold.</text>
<text id="700020010">Has your crystal teardrop ripened?</text>
<text id="700020020">...</text>
<text id="700030000">Unthinkable. Our hallowed resting place is violated.</text>
<text id="700030010">To refuse the Erdtree's call to return, to live within Death... Sickening.</text>
<text id="700030020">...</text>
<text id="700040000">The demi-humans wax wroth, now their mother's been taken...</text>
<text id="700040010">Where are you, Lord Kenneth?</text>
<text id="700040020">The knight...bedeviled by blood.</text>
<text id="700040030">...</text>
<text id="700050000">Please, help me. I'm of noble blood.</text>
<text id="700050010">If those hideous mongrels eat me, I'll be forever marred...</text>
<text id="700050020">Anything but that, please! Think of the disgrace!</text>
<text id="700050030">...</text>
<text id="700060000">All I wanted was to fight. To fight, as a warrior, to the last...</text>
<text id="700060010">So, why? Why, O guidance of grace, will this door not open?</text>
<text id="700060020">...</text>
<text id="700070000">...</text>
<text id="700070010">Maiden, dear maiden, where are you?</text>
<text id="700070020">Please, take my grapes.</text>
<text id="700080000">...</text>
<text id="700080010">Ohh, there it is, the tower!</text>
<text id="700080020">Finally, I can return. To our home, bathed in rays of gold!</text>
<text id="701000020">...</text>
<text id="701001000">This village is done for.</text>
<text id="701001010">Please, even if it's just you, old Albus, hide well and still your breath.</text>
<text id="701010000">...</text>
<text id="701010010">Ahh, Lord Vyke, it seems that you were no lord, after all.</text>
<text id="701010020">Then where is he? Our true Lord, our Lord of Frenzied Flame.</text>
<text id="701010030">We beg of you, incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.</text>
<text id="701010040">Ahh, may chaos take the world!</text>
<text id="701020000">...</text>
<text id="701020010">Ahh, the puppets...</text>
<text id="701020020">The puppets besiege us...</text>

<text id="701030010">Raya Lucaria, hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic.</text>
<text id="701030020">Why shut your doors to me? Am I barred from donning the crown of stone?</text>
<text id="701040000">...</text>
<text id="701040010">Ahh, Iji, forgive me.</text>
<text id="701040020">These royal grounds were placed in our trust,</text>

<text id="701090000">...</text>
<text id="701090010">It's there, somewhere.</text>
<text id="701090020">Another path, leading back to the foot of the Erdtree.</text>
<text id="701090030">An ancient tunnel.</text>

<text id="702001010">Eek... I hear a festive melody...</text>
<text id="702001020">No, no, don't skin me...</text>

<text id="743000440">We swat at flies, snuff out flame,</text>
<text id="743000450">Repel the Omen, and undo Tarnish.</text>
<text id="743000460">Blessed we, at your side, eternal.</text>
<text id="743000470">Blessed we, at your side, on this journey.</text>
<text id="743000480">Serve you we shall, in life, eternal.</text>
<text id="743400100"><Incoherent rambling. Very quiet, but sounds acutely irritated and on the verge of breaking out in madness.></text>
<text id="743400110"><The wings of a fly reverberate inside his headpiece, and it becomes too much to tolerate - he makes this sound as his psyche snaps.></text>
<text id="743820100"><Sound of swinging a giant pickaxe. A slow swing with much weight. Several versions.></text>
<text id="743820110"><A shout as he holds his pickaxe high, mustering strength. Several versions.></text>
<text id="743820120"><Loud snoring as he sleeps.></text>
<text id="746000100"><A roar as he releases the all the strength that he was holding inside. A growly warcry.></text>
<text id="746000110"><He screams to intimidate his foe as he draws his sword.></text>
<text id="746000120"><A shout as he holds his sword high, mustering strength: whoaahhh! Etc.></text>
<text id="746000130"><Feeling bored and exhausted, his jaw drops open and this sound emanates from deep down his throat. It is a low bellowing that can be heard echoing around the vicinity.></text>
<text id="746000140"><Loud snoring as he sleeps.></text>
<text id="746900100">Blessed Erdtree...</text>
<text id="746900110">O hallowed Runes...</text>
<text id="746900200"><Invigorating shouts for repeated rapier thrusts. Sharply enunciated, suggesting proper training.></text>
<text id="800001000">You're a Tarnished, I can see it.</text>
<text id="800001010">And I can also see...</text>
<text id="800001020">That you're not after my throat.</text>
<text id="800001030">Then why not purchase a little something?</text>
<text id="800001040">I am Kalé. Purveyor of fine goods.</text>
<text id="800002000">What is it? Still going to purchase something?</text>
<text id="800003000">Wait, weren't you...?</text>
<text id="800003010">Well, you're back. Care to buy something?</text>
<text id="800004000">Ah, it's you again.</text>
<text id="800004010">Always a pleasure. Care to purchase anything?</text>
<text id="800005000">Good-bye for now.</text>
<text id="800006000">Good-bye. Nice to do business.</text>
<text id="800007000">I am of a nomadic people.</text>
<text id="800007010">Selling wares as I travel.</text>
<text id="800007020">The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring.</text>
<text id="800007030">It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely.</text>
<text id="800007040">Let's say you're a very welcome customer.</text>
<text id="800008000">You know, if you can spare the runes,</text>
<text id="800008010">you should buy yourself a crafting kit.</text>
<text id="800008020">A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own.</text>
<text id="800008030">Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration.</text>
<text id="800008040">The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut.</text>
<text id="800008050">But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.</text>
<text id="800009000">I'm glad you took my warning to heart.</text>
<text id="800009010">You've made an excellent choice.</text>
<text id="800010000">There are others of my people who yet survive in these lands.</text>
<text id="800010010">If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you?</text>
<text id="800010020">My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold.</text>
<text id="800010030">Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey.</text>
<text id="800010040">But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered.</text>
<text id="800010050">I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts.</text>
<text id="800010060">Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.</text>
<text id="800011000">I suppose I shouldn't keep this from you.</text>
<text id="800011010"> I'm thinking of moving elsewhere for a time.</text>
<text id="800011020">My people are wanderers all, which I won't deny is one reason...</text>
<text id="800011030">But I've done all I can here, in search of the Great Caravan.</text>
<text id="800012000">Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but...</text>
<text id="800012010">See that no harm comes to my kin.</text>
<text id="800012020">We have a saying, we wanderers.</text>
<text id="800012030">Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing.</text>
<text id="800012040">But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy.</text>
<text id="800012050">That is our code, so to speak.</text>
<text id="800012060">Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.</text>
<text id="800013000">Ah, by the way...</text>
<text id="800013010">Have you heard of the Great Caravan?</text>
<text id="800014000">...I see, more's the pity.</text>
<text id="800014010">Well, even we had a place to call home, once. </text>
<text id="800014020">The Great Caravan, they called it… but it's been lost to us for ages.</text>
<text id="800014030">I've been searching for it as long as I can remember.</text>
<text id="800014040">And with a name like that,</text>
<text id="800014050">You'd hope they kept some fine goods there, eh.</text>
<text id="800015000">The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood...</text>
<text id="800015010">I suppose he must still be skulking about...</text>
<text id="800015020">Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself?</text>
<text id="800015030">Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source.</text>
<text id="800015040">Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear.</text>
<text id="800015050">I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off.</text>
<text id="800016000">Oh, by the way. There's someone you should meet.</text>
<text id="800016010">If you happen to hear a wolf's howl, make this signal under the source.</text>
<text id="800017000">Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you?</text>
<text id="800017010">Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction.</text>
<text id="800017020">He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg.</text>
<text id="800017030">I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another.</text>
<text id="800030000">Ah, good to see you.</text>
<text id="800030010">I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.</text>
<text id="800030020">Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.</text>
<text id="800030030">A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything?</text>
<text id="800031000">We meet again, I see.</text>
<text id="800031010">It's me, Kalé.</text>
<text id="800031020">Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.</text>
<text id="800031030">Right then. Care to purchase anything?</text>
<text id="800032000">Have you seen a crow around here by any chance?</text>
<text id="800032010">You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw?</text>
<text id="800032020">Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question.</text>
<text id="800032030">I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course.</text>
<text id="800033000">My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this.</text>
<text id="800033010">And I was willing to pay whatever was needed. Your reward, as promised.</text>
<text id="800034000">So, about the letter you brought me...</text>
<text id="800034010">It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people.</text>
<text id="800034020">And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to.</text>
<text id="800034030">This could be my chance to get close to it.</text>
<text id="800034040">Thanks to you.</text>
<text id="800035000">Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again.</text>
<text id="800035010">Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone.</text>
<text id="800035020">With any luck, I'll see you there, eh.</text>
<text id="800036000">I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's...</text>
<text id="800036010">And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors...</text>
<text id="800036020">But there's something I need to know.</text>
<text id="800036030">My roots.</text>
<text id="800036040">I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed.</text>
<text id="800050000">Ah, good to see you.</text>
<text id="800050010">I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.</text>
<text id="800050020">The shop is all set up.</text>
<text id="800050030">A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything?</text>
<text id="800051000">Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter...</text>
<text id="800051010">I think it's pointing underneath the capital.</text>
<text id="800051020">I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital.</text>
<text id="800051030">But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there.</text>
<text id="800051040">Well, the journey can wait, I suppose.</text>
<text id="800051050">I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it.</text>
<text id="800052000">Where...did you find this letter?</text>
<text id="800053000">I can't imagine how it ended up there...</text>
<text id="800053010">But the well might just lead under the capital.</text>
<text id="800053020">To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter.</text>
<text id="800053030">Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan...</text>
<text id="800053040">But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation.</text>
<text id="800053050">Once again, I find myself in your debt.</text>
<text id="800053060">Take this, as a token of my appreciation.</text>
<text id="800053070">It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special.</text>
<text id="800053080">I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact.</text>
<text id="800053090">Who knows what wonders there might be to trade?</text>
<text id="800054000">Ah, you, is it...</text>
<text id="800054010">Did you see? What they did to my ancestors?</text>
<text id="800054020">The whole clan, buried alive. Sick. Maddened. Husks of themselves.</text>
<text id="800054030">Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore.</text>
<text id="800054040">They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them?</text>
<text id="800054050">Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us! </text>
<text id="800054060">The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks.</text>
<text id="800054070">But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims...</text>
<text id="800054080">I'll never forgive any of you.</text>
<text id="800055000">I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.</text>
<text id="800055010">And...I think it's time we parted ways.</text>
<text id="800055020">Guided by grace, you seek to become Elden Lord.</text>
<text id="800055030">I don't want anything to do with you Tarnished lot any more.</text>
<text id="800056000">I should apologise to you.</text>
<text id="800056010">It's my fault that we stumbled into this mess.</text>
<text id="800056020">I'm sorry.</text>
<text id="800057000">I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer.</text>
<text id="800057010">I think it's time we parted ways.</text>
<text id="800058000">Wait, what's that?</text>
<text id="800058010">That burn...</text>
<text id="800058020">Your eyes...</text>
<text id="800058030">You've inherited the flame of frenzy!</text>
<text id="800058040">Oh, that's it... That's what I need...</text>
<text id="800058050">To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.</text>
<text id="800058060">The yellow flame of chaos...</text>
<text id="800059000">Oh, that's it... That's what I need...</text>
<text id="800059010">To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.</text>
<text id="800059020">The yellow flame of chaos...</text>
<text id="800070000">O Three Fingers, throw wide the door.</text>
<text id="800070010">Please, bestow unto me the yellow flame of chaos.</text>
<text id="800070020">A frenzied flame to melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.</text>
<text id="800070030">May chaos take the world.</text>
<text id="800070040">May chaos take the world.</text>
<text id="800071000">The frenzied flame...burned me...</text>
<text id="800071010">I was not... a suitable home.</text>
<text id="800071020">Unknown warrior...</text>
<text id="800071030">You, who reached the Three Fingers' abyss...</text>
<text id="800071040">Tell the one... Who will become Lord...</text>
<text id="800071050">Divest yourself of everything, and head to the door.</text>
<text id="800071060">Divest yourself of everything...</text>
<text id="800071070">And pray to the Lord...</text>
<text id="800071080">To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.</text>
<text id="800071090">May chaos...take the world.</text>

<text id="800072000">The frenzied flame...burned me...</text>
<text id="800072010">I was not... a suitable home.</text>
<text id="800072020">Dear Lord, Lord of Chaos...</text>
<text id="800072030">Melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.</text>
<text id="800072040">May chaos...take the world.</text>
<text id="800072050">...</text>
<text id="800100000">Are you offering that drink to me?</text>
<text id="800100010">Oh, no, what do you take me for? I am an honest merchant of good standing!</text>
<text id="800100020">[pause]</text>
<text id="800100030">Oh, for heaven's sake, I jest.</text>
<text id="800100040">That's a very kind gesture, and I accept.</text>
<text id="800100050">A pleasure as ever, old friend.</text>
<text id="800101000"> </text>
<text id="800800000">Urgh!</text>
<text id="800801000">What's the matter with you?</text>
<text id="800801010">Have you gone mad?</text>
<text id="800802000">I knew you for a highwayman all along.</text>
<text id="800802010">Then it's time you learnt a lesson.</text>
<text id="800802020">Our people will not stand for your barbarism!</text>
<text id="800803000">Is that all you were, mate?</text>
<text id="800804000">Is this...how it ends?</text>
<text id="800804010">I'll never find...</text>
<text id="800810000"><takes damage></text>
<text id="800811000">So you're just like the others?</text>
<text id="800811010">Another would-be oppressor to my people.</text>
<text id="800812000">I see. I see how it is! You were one of them all along!</text>
<text id="800812010">Trying to trample us underfoot, you grace-given bastard?</text>
<text id="800813000">I'll never forgive your kind...</text>
<text id="800814000">Your kind...will all be razed clean.</text>
