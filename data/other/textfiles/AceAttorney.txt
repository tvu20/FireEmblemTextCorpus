Maya:
Hey, Nick.

Phoenix:
Yeah? What is it?

Maya:
You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?

Phoenix:
Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.

Maya:
But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?

Phoenix:
Um... I guess so, yeah.

Maya:
Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!

Phoenix:
(Pearls...?)

Pearl:
So! That's why we need to go on a special "Spiritual Hot Spot Tour", Mr. Nick!

Phoenix:
...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?

Pearl:
It's the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!

Phoenix:
...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)

Maya:
"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!

Phoenix:
I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.

Maya:
It's at a spiritual retreat called "Hazakura Temple". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!

Phoenix:
(Now I definitely don't want to go...)

Maya:
You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!

Phoenix:
Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?

Pearl:
Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!

Maya:
Yeah! And I signed up for the "Special Course"!

Phoenix:
Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.

Maya:
Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!

Pearl:
Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!

Phoenix:
Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?

Maya:
Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.

Phoenix:
Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this "Hazakura Temple"?

Pearl:
No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!

Phoenix:
... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.

Maya:
Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?

Pearl:
Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?

Phoenix:
Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?

Pearl:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick?

Phoenix:
Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun...

Maya:
Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick?

Phoenix:
(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)

Dahlia:
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.

Dahlia:
Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!

Phoenix:
But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)

Pearl:
...Mr. Nick?

Phoenix:
... I'll go.

Maya:
Huh...?

Phoenix:
Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go.

Maya:
Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?

Pearl:
Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?

"Oh! Cult!" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.

Maya:
Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--

Bikini:
Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.

Maya:
B-B-B-Bikini...!?

Bikini:
That's riiight! Actually, that's my "temple" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, "Why not choose a bikini?" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!

Maya:
It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your "Special Course"!

Bikini:
Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!

Pearl:
R-Reckless...?

Maya:
"Wa ha ha"...?

Pearl:
Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.

Phoenix:
I-I'm just not very good with heights...

Maya:
Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!

Phoenix:
...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.

Maya:
Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, "Dusty Bridge".

Phoenix:

Well, it's practically the same thing.

Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!

Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.

Edgeworth:
...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.

Butz:
Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!

They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)

Butz:
I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!

You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?

Edgeworth:
...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...

Iris:
...M-Me?

Edgeworth:
Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.

Iris:
... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.

Edgeworth:
But before that, I have one question.

Iris:
Yes?

Edgeworth:
Do you know Wright?

Iris:
Er... Wh-Why would you ask that?

Edgeworth:
Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.

Iris:
... Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?

Edgeworth:
Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.

Iris:
... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.

Edgeworth:
You "deceived" him...?

Iris:
I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.

Edgeworth:
... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.

Iris:
...

Edgeworth:
I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.

Iris:
... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.

Edgeworth:
...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)

Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?

Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.

Gumshoe:
Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab! Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!

Edgeworth:
Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work. A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.

Gumshoe:
I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.

Edgeworth:
(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)

Gumshoe:
I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!

Edgeworth:

Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!

Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...

Butz:
What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?

Gumshoe:
Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! "Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?

Phoenix:
...*huff*...*huff*... Grr!! How did I get into this mess...?

That's far enough!
You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
Wha...!? What have I done wrong!?

I cannot allow you to go on like this!
Phoenix:
...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!

Silence!
You are no longer worthy of your title.
...I've had this dream before; someplace, sometime ago... ...As if this day was written into my destiny... ...Today I'll stand in court as a lawyer... ...To prove a killer innocent.

March 23, 9:43 AM
District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 3
Phone:
... ...*beep*...

Phoenix:
Hello, this is Phoenix Wright.

Engarde:
You don't look so well, dude. You're gonna prove me not guilty today, right?

Phoenix:
...

Phone:
...*beep*...

Engarde:
Hahaha... If you please, Mister Lawyer. Remember, it's not just me. Your precious friend's life is riding on today's verdict too.

Phoenix:
Grr...!

Maya:
Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever!

Phoenix:
(...Maya...)

???:
Phoenix... Phoenix!

Phoenix:
M-Mia! Maya! How's Maya!?

Mia:
...I don't know.

Phoenix:
You don't know...?

Mia:
She hasn't tried to channel me since yesterday.

Phoenix:
Mia... What... What am I supposed to do...?

Mia:
... Well, like I said. For a lawyer, the worst of times are when you have to force your biggest smiles.

Phoenix:
B-But!

Mia:
You can't give up! There's still some hope left.

Phoenix:
Stop it, please! There's nothing left... Not here, not anywhere...

Phone:

Phoenix:
(Argh! It's that accursed Engarde again...)

Phone:
...*beep*...

Phoenix:
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!? Look, don't call me anymore! I mean it!

Gumshoe:
......You're really mean, pal.

Phoenix:
Aaah! Gumshoe! I'm really, really sorry! Where are you?

Gumshoe:
They let me join the investigation team and we're chasing after De Killer, pal!

Phoenix:
...! Then, you have some sort of lead...!?

Gumshoe:
Sorry, but right now we've got zero leads on the guy... But we're not going to give up!

Phoenix:
Gumshoe...

Gumshoe:
Until the trial is over... until the verdict is handed down, we're going to do everything we can and find De Killer! If we can get Maya out, then you can get Engarde the guilty verdict he deserves, pal!

Phoenix:
(That's true, I could do that if they found Maya first...)

Gumshoe:
You got that!? So you have to do whatever you can to make the trial last longer!

Phoenix:
I have to make the trial last longer?

Gumshoe:
If you go at Mr. Edgeworth with everything you've got, then you two can draw it out!

Phoenix:

Gumshoe:
I believe in you, pal! You and Mr. Edgeworth can do it! So! Believe in us! We're going to give it all we've got, just like you!

Phoenix:
Got it! Thanks Gumshoe!

Mia:
...Hey, Phoenix. You understand now, don't you? You have something money will never be able to buy. Friendship. It's the strongest weapon in the world and you have it in abundance.

Phoenix:
...Yeah! (Looks like we're coming to the end... I have to make the trial last as long as I can! Gumshoe will come through, I know it!)

March 23, 10:00 AM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde.

Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.

Edgeworth:
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.

Judge:
Now, as I recall, we concluded yesterday's session with a big mystery on our hands. The mystery being what exactly was Ms. Adrian Andrews' role in this murder? That is to say, is she really connected to the crime itself? Mr. Edgeworth, if you would please inform the court of today's proceedings.

Edgeworth:
Adrian Andrews. She forged evidence that threw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, and then proceeded to escape the crime scene by wearing a Nickel Samurai costume. The guilt of these actions are those from which she cannot escape.

Judge:
Hmm, then you're saying that she is guilty after all...?

Edgeworth:
I'm not finished, Your Honor. Ms. Andrews has nothing to do with committing the actual murder.

Phoenix:
...!

Edgeworth:
I would like to direct the court's attention to this card.

Judge:
What is that...? It looks like a shell...

Edgeworth:
This is the calling card of a certain assassin.

Judge:
A-Assassin, you say!?

Edgeworth:
Yes, Juan Corrida was killed by a professional assassin! And the person who hired the assassin, his client so to speak, is Matt Engarde!

Judge:
Wh-What a surprising turn of events!

Edgeworth:
I would think it's become commonplace by now, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)

Mia:
But we still have to hold out as long as we can. At least, until Maya's safe and sound.

Phoenix:
I wonder how the trial will turn out today...?

Judge:
Now then, please call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.

Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls the defendant's "mentor", Mr. Will Powers to the stand.

Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. Your name and occupation, please.

Powers:
O-OK. I'm... Uh... Will Powers. I'm a poor, underpaid action star...

Edgeworth:
And what is your relation to the defendant?

Powers:
Well, that's... I guess I'm sort of a lousy mentor to him in a way. Yeah.

Judge:
Um, Mr. Powers. Please... You don't need to put yourself down so much.

Powers:
Oh, uh, sorry. Well, but I'm just kind of a nothing sort of guy.

Edgeworth:
On the night of the murder, you visited the defendant's room. Is this correct?

Powers:
Y-Yes.

Phoenix:
...! (I... I didn't know that...)

Powers:
Um, but you know... I didn't actually get to see Matt when I went...

Edgeworth:
All you need to do is answer what you're asked. Now then, I would like you to please testify about when you went to Mr. Engarde's room.

Powers:
O-OK... Sure...

Witness Testimony
-- Visit to Matt's Room --
Powers:
After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.
Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.
He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.
I watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.
I had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.

Judge:
Hmm... Nothing sounds out of place in Mr. Powers' testimony.

Phoenix:
(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)

Edgeworth:
If one assumes that the person Mr. Engarde was speaking with was an ordinary bellboy...

Judge:
Wh-What are you implying?

Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright. Let's have your cross-examination, shall we?

Mia:
Looks like we're in another sticky situation.

Phoenix:
Huh?

Mia:
A trap. Can't you smell it, Phoenix? But for us to find out more, we're just going to have to charge in head first, right?

Mia:

Phoenix:
The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?

Powers:
Um, sure. But giving him that much was maybe a little too much, I think...

Phoenix:
("A little too much"...?)

Edgeworth:
Would you please clarify for the court, about how much would you say the defendant gave to the bellboy?

Powers:
Honestly, I don't know. I can't even begin to guess.

Judge:
And why is that?

Powers:
Because he gave the bellboy a really, really fat roll of cash.

Phoenix:
A ROLL OF CASH!?

Judge:
Ah, well... How interesting... That certainly was a very generous tip, wasn't it?

Edgeworth:
A very fat roll of cash... That can hardly be called a "tip", Your Honor!

Judge:
Hmm...

Judge:
Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip... Then what was it?

Edgeworth:
Payment, Your Honor.

Phoenix:

Judge:
Payment...?

Edgeworth:
Isn't it obvious? For the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida.

Judge:
Then... Then the bellboy the witness saw...

Edgeworth:
Yes, he was the assassin.

Judge:
H-Hold your horses now! Mr. Edgeworth, you don't have any proof of this... do you?

Edgeworth:
Have I ever been unprepared to support my claims, Your Honor? I have here, the card Shelly de Killer left at the scene of the crime.

Judge:
Shelly... de Killer...

Edgeworth:
He is the person the police's special investigations team has been chasing for ages. I am certain that the person the witness saw was this very assassin, Shelly de Killer!

Powers:
R-Really!?

Judge:
...? What's wrong, Mr. Powers?

Powers:
No, nothing. Something just clicked in my head and I think I just figured something out!

Judge:
Oh?

Powers:
Actually, I saw that bellboy again later on that night!

Phoenix:
WHAAAT!?

Judge:
Mr. Powers! Please testify! Tell us what you saw!

Powers:
Yes, sir! Right away!

Of course, when I say "room", I mean Juan Corrida's room!
Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!
Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!
I mean...

Edgeworth:
Thank you very much. That is all we need for now.

Powers:
Huh? But I'm not done. There's still more...

Edgeworth:
Let us first establish that the bellboy was truly Mr. de Killer. Then we shall see.

Judge:
Hmm... So the bellboy came out of the victim's room... And if that bellboy really was the assassin... Then, I think the answer is fairly obvious.

Edgeworth:
That would be correct, Your Honor. Well, Mr. Wright. I believe it's your turn... to entertain and make us laugh.

Phoenix:
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

Mia:
This is no laughing matter!

Phoenix:
Mr. Powers.

Powers:
Y-Y-Yes?

Phoenix:
You're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.

Powers:
But... But... Isn't he really suspicious!?

Powers:
He's got all those stitches, and... and...

Phoenix:
So? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?

Powers:
*gulp!* Well, there's also... I mean, what about him being empty-handed!?

Phoenix:
I would like to ask the court to please take a look here.

Judge:
This is... the crime scene...

Phoenix:
There is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a tray with a bottle of tomato juice on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!

Powers:
Aah!

Judge:
B-But! That would mean that the bellboy had seen and left a dead body in the room!

Phoenix:
Ah, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?

Judge:
Uh... M-Mr. Edgeworth!

Edgeworth:
...Yes?

Judge:
I-I blame you for leading me down this route!

Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm terribly sorry...

Phoenix:
(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)

Edgeworth:
Witness. Isn't there one more thing you would like to share with us?

Powers:
I-Is there?

Edgeworth:
The bellboy was empty-handed... Or should I say empty-"hand"ed? I recall you had something interesting to say about his hands...

Powers:
Oh yeah! I almost forgot!

Phoenix:
Huh? Wh-What...?

Powers:
That bellboy -- he was wearing gloves!

Phoenix:
Gloves?

Powers:
Yeah, pitch black, leather ones. All the other bellboys don't wear gloves like that, right?

Judge:
Black leather gloves... Why didn't you mention them earlier!?

Powers:
S-Sorry... It slipped my mind.

Phoenix:
(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!) So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!

Powers:
Come on, Mr. Wright! That bellboy was wearing black leather ones!

Phoenix:
So? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?

Powers:
*gulp!*

Judge:
But that man... He received a large roll of cash from the defendant. And then he was seen leaving the crime scene wearing black leather gloves. I don't think that even someone like myself can believe he was just another bellboy...

Phoenix:
Urgh...

Edgeworth:
It seems that we have finally come to an understanding... Now then, witness. Please continue with the rest of your testimony.

Phoenix:
The rest...?

Judge:
Oh yes, please tell us more.

Powers:
OK!

After leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.
He gave something to the person inside the room.
Then the old guy just left, without even going into the room.
After that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.

Judge:
So the bellboy, after leaving the crime scene, next went to the defendant's room...?

Powers:
Yeah. I kinda saw all that by accident...

Phoenix:
(Some accident! I'd say you saw too much! And all of it was suspicious to high heaven...)

Judge:
Hmm... I think it's safe to say that we can no longer consider this bellboy to be "normal". Now then, let's get started, shall we? Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...

Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Powers' testimony just now was just as vague as his first.

Mia:
It's a little troublesome, isn't it? But I'm sure if you press him enough, everything will become clearer. Although, that just makes it harder on us, doesn't it?

Phoenix:
Ugh... Talk about a lose-lose situation.

Phoenix:

Edgeworth:
What was the point of that pregnant pause!?

Judge:
Where did that objection come from!? Well, speak up!

Phoenix:
Uh, it was me, Your Honor...

Mia:
What is it, Phoenix?

Phoenix:
I have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...

Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say, please spit it out!

Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. (OK Phoenix, deep breath...) Mr. Powers. The "something" you saw... Was it this item?

Powers:
Oh, hey! That's it! That's the something! Wow, Mr. Wright. You really figured it out.

Edgeworth:
Hmm, I recall we found this at Matt Engarde's mansion...

Judge:
At the d-defendant's house!? What does this mean!?

Edgeworth:
It's simple, Your Honor. Shelly de Killer assassinated Juan Corrida in his room. And then he stole this wooden bear from the scene of the crime.

Judge:
Then, the bear being found at Mr. Engarde's mansion would mean...

Edgeworth:
It goes without saying, Your Honor. Mr. Matt Engarde is De Killer's client!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...I said ORDER!!! Mr. Wright. This is a most unfortunate turn of events for you.

Phoenix:
Yeah... Sorry, Mia.

Mia:
No, it's alright. Your judgment was sound. Actually, I figured the bear would come up. If not now, then it would have later on. Even if you hadn't shown it to the court, I'm sure your friend Edgeworth would've.

Phoenix:
(Ah, I almost forgot that he knew about it too...)

Judge:
Hmm... I think it is clear that there is no need for us to continue this trial.

Phoenix:
(I... I can't let this happen! I have to do something... There has to be something we've overlooked!) Your Honor! A minute, please!

Judge:
Y-Yes, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
There are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!

Edgeworth:
What are you trying to pull!?

Judge:
Oh... Well, we can't have that. Alright, Mr. Wright. What questionable point would you like to explore further?

Powers' testimony

The person who received the bear

The bear itself

Judge:
I think we've heard enough. We now know why this bear figurine was at the defendant's mansion, as well as who it was that received the bear from the assassin in his room... Everything has become very clear. The client who hired the assassin to commit the murder was Mr. Matt Engarde! ... I see no reason for this trial to continue. Therefore, I will now hand down my verdict!

Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor, for your understanding. You see, Mr. Wright? You could not win against the truth, could you?

Phoenix:
... (I knew it would turn out this way... After all, what Edgeworth has stated is the truth...)

Judge:
Any last objections, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
(Well, do I...? What should I do...?)

Hear the verdict

Raise an objection

Judge:
I will now announce my ver--

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
(There is only one way for me to drag this trial out... The only thing I have left is this one dirty trick...) Your Honor. Right now, we have these two reasons to believe my client is a client of the assassin. Reason number one. He accepted the bear figurine from the assassin. Reason number two. That very same figurine was found at Engarde Mansion. However! It's possible this is all the work of a certain other person!

Judge:
What are you saying...?

Phoenix:
What I am saying is, it's possible a different person is De Killer's real client!

Judge:
The "real" client...?

Phoenix:
Yes.

Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk. Is this all you have?

Phoenix:
...

Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your theory. Who do you say is the real client of De Killer, and therefore, the real murderer?

Present Adrian Andrews profile

Present anything else

Judge:
Adrian Andrews...!?

Phoenix:
Yes. We already know that she tried to frame Matt Engarde for the crime... By wearing a spare Nickel Samurai costume!

Powers:
Ah! Then... Then the "Nickel Samurai's arm" that I saw...

Phoenix:
That could have very well been Ms. Andrews!

Judge:
But what about Mr. Engarde?

Phoenix:
If you would please recall yesterday's testimony, the defendant was taking a nap during the break period.

Judge:
That's right... Then... finding this figure at Mr. Engarde's mansion...?

Phoenix:
It was a well-laid trap set by Ms. Andrews.

Judge:
...

Edgeworth:
...

Powers:
...

Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... What is your opinion on this?

Edgeworth:
... I can't even begin to count the flaws in the defense's logic. Besides which, there is no evidence to support it. However... I can't fully discount its possibility either.

Judge:
Hmm...

...What is with this trial...?

...Come on. Anyone can tell Engarde did it...

...I can't believe the defense would go so far as to pin the guilt onto someone else...

...Yeah! Unbelievable! It's not something petty; it's murder of all things...!

Phoenix:
(This is to save Maya... This is to save Maya... Even if the whole world turns against me, this is one fight I can't give up on!)

Mia:
...

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! All disruptive parties will be forced to leave the courtroom!

Edgeworth:
Your Honor. ... For the benefit of the defense, I'm willing to play along with his "what if" game.

Judge:
His "what if" game, Mr. Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
The prosecution is prepared to challenge the defense's theory.

Phoenix:
...!

Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. Even you must have thought it strange and wondered, "Why would the criminal want this little wooden bear...?"

Phoenix:
(He's right... De Killer did specially bring that bear to Engarde right away...) Why do you ask? Is there something special about it?

Edgeworth:
Absolutely. And I'm sure that once the court knows its significance, the true killer's identity will become crystal clear. Your Honor! The prosecution calls upon a witness who will clear all doubts against Ms. Andrews.

Judge:
And who would that be!?

Edgeworth:
It's quite simple, Your Honor. Ms. Adrian Andrews herself.

Judge:
I see... Well then, the court will take a short 10 minute recess. The prosecution will prepare its witness in that time.

Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.

Pearl:
Oh, Mr. Nick! Your phone is...

Phoenix:
(It's from Gumshoe!)

Phone:
...*beep*...
Gumshoe:
How is it going!? Have you been hanging in there, pal!?

Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, sort of... We just barely found something to latch onto.

Gumshoe:
Phew. That's good, pal.

Phoenix:
And what about you!? Anything yet!? Have you figured out where De Killer and Maya are!?

Gumshoe:
Um, uh... We still don't have any leads, but...

Phoenix:
WHAT!? We don't have any more time!

Gumshoe:
If we just had one! Even a single clue would be really helpful...

Phoenix:
(I was only able to come this far because I kept thinking to myself... I've got to keep the trial going until Maya's been rescued... But have I just run out of luck this time...? Is all our hope for naught...?)

A tent!

Phoenix:
(Huh? A tent!?)

I could see a circus tent!

Phoenix:
M-Mia!

Mia:
It looks like Maya was unconscious until just a few minutes ago. As soon as she woke up, she called for me.

Phoenix:
So it was Maya that called you away!

Mia:
She's locked in a dusty little room right now. But I could see a circus tent outside the window about 300 feet away!

Phoenix:
Gumshoe! Is there a circus in town right now!?

Gumshoe:
There's only one, pal! The Berry Big Circus!

Phoenix:
Maya is somewhere within a 300 feet radius of the main tent!

Gumshoe:
Wh-What!? ... OK, hold on a sec, pal! Hey! Draw a circle on that map! About a 300 feet radius from the main tent! Hurry!

Mia:
And...

Phoenix:
And?

Mia:
I could see a mailbox under the window.

Phoenix:
Gumshoe! There's also a mailbox!

Gumshoe:
Hmm... OK! What else?

Phoenix:
What else, Mia!?

Mia:
I'm sorry, but it was a very small window. I couldn't see anything else... It felt like I was in an old office building... Maybe the third floor or so...

Gumshoe:
I heard her! An old office building. Good stuff, pal! OK, just hang in there! Just a little longer, pal! Wish us luck!

Phoenix:
Good luck!

Gumshoe:
I'll call you later, so don't let your battery die, OK pal!?

Phone:
...*beep*...
Phoenix:
Mia! Maya's not hurt, right!?

Mia:
She's in a pretty bad state, Phoenix. She's being starved.

Phoenix:
(Gumshoe! Please hurry!!)

Mia:
Looks like we're out of time. Are you alright, Phoenix?

Phoenix:
(It's only a matter of time before Maya's rescued... I can do this! I just have to make this trial last a little longer!)

March 23, 12:05 PM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court will now reconvene.

Edgeworth:
De Killer, the man who murdered the victim, handed this to his client. From this, one obvious question arises. "Why this particular item?" I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real criminal. Now then, the prosecution calls the defendant's manager, Adrian Andrews, to the stand!

Edgeworth:
Currently, the witness is accused of tampering and obstruction of justice.

Andrews:
...

Edgeworth:
However, you have been called to the witness stand today to ascertain... who exactly is guilty of murder.

Andrews:
I understand.

Edgeworth:
Very good. Now, have you ever seen this bear before, Ms. Andrews?

Andrews:
Of course I have.

Judge:
You have seen it before?

Edgeworth:
That's right. It's only natural that the witness has. Ms. Andrews. Could you please enlighten the court to this bear's secrets?

Andrews:
Alright.

Phoenix:
(Why... Why does she...??)

Witness Testimony
-- The Bear Figurine --
Andrews:
Actually, this is an elaborate puzzle.
If you know the correct order, it can be taken apart one piece at a time.
At its center is a small cavity, with just enough room to store a small item.
Because of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.
You really can't tell that it's a small "jewelry box" just by looking at it.

Judge:
So this figurine... it's a container of sorts, is it...?

Andrews:
Yes. Looks can be deceiving, wouldn't you agree?

Judge:
Yes. This is superb craftmanship. ...Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.

Mia:
It looks like there really was something to that bear after all.

After pressing all statements

Phoenix:
(I think this is about all I'm going to get for now...)

Figurine updated in the Court Record.

Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright? I think even you have come to realize...

Phoenix:
...?

Edgeworth:
That there is one very important fact we have uncovered, and that is this: This bear is actually a "jewelry box".

Judge:
Hmm...

Edgeworth:
Now that we have agreed to this point, there is only one logical question that can come next. And that is this: What is inside this box?

Judge:
What's inside!?

Edgeworth:
That's right. That's what we are going to find out next. Witness.

Andrews:
Yes?

Edgeworth:
You are the only one who can open this. Please...

Phoenix:
(There's a painful silence hanging over the courtroom... All eyes are on Ms. Andrews now as she solves the puzzle, and takes the bear apart...)

...*click*...
Andrews:
I've opened it. Is this what you wanted?

Judge:
Wh-What is that? It looks like a... note...

Edgeworth:
I don't think we need to guess at what that is... Do we, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
...

Edgeworth:
It's the suicide note.

Judge:
The suicide note?

Edgeworth:
The suicide note left by Juan Corrida's former manager, Celeste Inpax. Until now, no one knew of its whereabouts... But just as we suspected, it was hidden. Hidden by the victim, Juan Corrida himself. It seems Celeste Inpax had very beautiful handwriting. And she just as beautifully signed her own name on this document. This is most definitely the note she left right before she committed suicide!

Judge:
O-ORDER! Witness! Did you know about this...?

Andrews:
...Yes, I did. I heard all about it from Juan. When I discovered his body... I looked for the bear. I wanted to destroy the note before it became public. But... I couldn't find it anywhere.

Edgeworth:
Because it had already been taken by De Killer.

Mia:
Everything is going at Mr. Edgeworth's pace... So now that the suicide note has been found, what's the next logical question?

Phoenix:
"What is written on the note...?"

Mia:
That's right... At least, that's what I would think...

Edgeworth:
Now then, I believe it is only appropriate the contents of this note be made known.

Andrews:
I can't stop you, can I...? I went through so much... just to get my hands on it. And I was going to burn it... for her sake.

Edgeworth:
I'm deeply sorry, but I can't allow you to persuade me to stop. Your Honor. If you could please read the contents of this note aloud.

Judge:
Very well...

Phoenix:
The judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.

Judge:
... And that's all Ms. Inpax had to say.

Edgeworth:
There is one thing I would like to say here. The prosecution has no interest in slandering Mr. Engarde.

Judge:
Then... What...?

Edgeworth:
Our intention, Your Honor, is to establish a motive for murder. Isn't that correct, witness?

Andrews:
Yes... On the night of the murder, Juan was going to make the contents of the note public. After the post-ceremony show... he was going to hold a press conference.

Judge:
My word...

Edgeworth:
Matt Engarde values above all else, his "refreshing like a spring breeze" image. Which is why he had to stop this note from being made public... At any cost!

Celeste's Suicide Note added to the Court Record.

...It's Engarde's fault that woman killed herself...

...And this time, he even went so far as to kill someone to stop him from revealing that!

...How terrible...! What a selfish person...!

I guess there are slimeball lawyers out there who will defend these creeps too!

Edgeworth:
There is no margin for doubt here. Mr. de Killer's client's goal was to obtain this suicide note. And the only person who needed this note that badly is the defendant. Let's not forget that the bear with the note inside was found at the defendant's house!

Judge:
It seems that we have come to the truth at last. The defendant's motives were entirely selfish. He deserves no sympathy from anyone!

Phoenix:
Urk... (How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)

Mia:
Why the hesitation, Phoenix? Gumshoe hasn't called yet, so you know what you must do.

Phoenix:
(I know. I have to carry on and buy him some more time! OK. There are 2 deadly pieces of evidence: the figurine and the suicide note. Maybe somehow, I can find a way out of this situation through one of those!)

Mia:
The gavel is already in the judge's hand! Phoenix! Hurry!

Phoenix:
(The suicide note or the figurine!? Which one of these should I pursue??)

Celeste's Suicide Note

The Figurine

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Y-You make a valid point, Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth! What is your opinion!?

Edgeworth:
...

Phoenix:
(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)

Mia:
Unfortunately... I think he believes differently.

Edgeworth:
I believe a show of appreciation is in order.

Judge:
H-Huh?

Edgeworth:
The defense seems to be in love with wishing more despair upon itself.

Phoenix:
...!

Edgeworth:
I would like to direct the court's attention to this.

Judge:
What is that...?

Edgeworth:
It is a very small video camera, Your Honor. This type of camera is commonly used as a means of spying.

Judge:
S-Spying...?

Phoenix:
(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in my possession...)

Edgeworth:
Matt Engarde and the victim both thought of the other as their biggest rival. They even went so far as to use this type of item to find each other's weaknesses!

Judge:
And...?

Edgeworth:
The victim, Juan Corrida, was being spied on! His personal life was being watched by none other than Matt Engarde!

Judge:
Order! Oooooorder!! Ahem! Mr. Wright!

Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?

Judge:
You... Don't tell me you knew about your client's spying activities!?

Phoenix:
Well... sort of...

Judge:
"Sort of" is not an acceptable answer, Mr. Wright!

Edgeworth:
I see you are confused, Mr. Wright. You're probably thinking, "But I have the camera that was in the stuffed bear's eye..."

Phoenix:
...!

Edgeworth:
But this camera that I have is not that same one. Last night, I searched the victim's house on a hunch... Using this...

Phoenix:
(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)

Edgeworth:
By the way, Mr. Wright. The defendant's fingerprints were found on this camera.

Judge:
Matt Engarde's fingerprints were on there!?

Mia:
Well, Phoenix... It looks like those cameras were hidden all over the place, huh?

Phoenix:
(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)

Edgeworth:
I think this is the end. It's fairly obvious that Mr. Engarde learned of the suicide note through this. He was watching the victim all along.

Phoenix:
(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)

...Hey, hey... Now what's that lawyer thinking...?

...Mommy? Is that man the bad killer guy?

...Shush! Stop! Don't look at him!

...The way he's sweating is just so... Eww... Nasty...

Mia:
Phoenix...

Phoenix:
Yes, Chief!?

Mia:
Have you figured out what you're going to do next yet?

Phoenix:
What I'm going to do next!? (Does running away like a frightened child work?)

Mia:
I know it seems like Mr. Edgeworth is very close to putting the lid on this case. But... In his eagerness to prove his point, he forgot one very important thing.

Phoenix:
Well, what is it, Mia!?

Mia:
There is a piece of evidence that he really should investigate.

Phoenix:
(Something he should investigate?)

Mia:
I would really hate to see the good prosecutor get scolded... For not remembering to look into the item when he had the chance.

Phoenix:
(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)

Judge:
Alright, I think this time we finally understand everything. Well, Mr. Wright? You don't have any further objections, do you?

Phoenix:
(What is this piece of evidence that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)

Present evidence

No objections

Phoenix:
...I have an objection, Your Honor.

Edgeworth:
Hmph. That was about the weakest objection I've ever heard, Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense has no intentions of letting this go so easily!

Judge:
You are beginning to sound desperate...

Phoenix:
That's just your imagination, Your Honor! Mr. Edgeworth. This is not like you at all.

Edgeworth:
...?

Phoenix:
In your eagerness to prove your point, you've forgotten one very important thing.

Mia:
Hey... Isn't that what I just said!?

Edgeworth:
So, you're telling me that I forgot something?

Phoenix:
You're so close, Mr. Edgeworth... But there's something you really should examine about this piece of evidence!

Present Celeste's Suicide Note

Present anything else

Judge:
That is... Ms. Inpax's suicide note, right?

Phoenix:
Hmm... Who knows?

Edgeworth:
...!

Phoenix:
I mean, sure, this "suicide note" was found inside this bear. But this bear was in my possession until a few moments ago. Which means... The handwriting on this "suicide note" has yet to be analyzed!

Judge:
Oh...

Phoenix:
So! As to whether this pivotal piece of evidence was really written by Ms. Inpax or not... Has yet to be even remotely confirmed!

Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! You can't seriously be suggesting...

Andrews:
Mr. Wright! You... Are you saying this suicide note is a fake!?

Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews... You were the one who tried to pin this murder on Mr. Engarde. Who's to say you didn't create a fake "suicide note" and put it into this bear!?

Andrews:
H-How dare you!?

Edgeworth:
Objection

Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The defense is indiscriminately accusing the witness again! There is no evidence linking the witness to the suicide note whatsoever!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
But if this is a fake, then the witness is the only person who could have made it!

Edgeworth:
What!?

Phoenix:
Recall the witness' testimony concerning this figurine! The only person other than the victim who could solve the puzzle is the witness herself!

Andrews:
Ahh!

Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews! You wrote this note, didn't you? You wrote it so you could use it to frame Matt Engarde!

Andrews:
I... I did no such thing!

Edgeworth:
Objection

Edgeworth:
Wright! If you're going to pronounce this suicide note a fake... Then show this court some evidence to support your theory!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth! You were the one who presented this scrap of paper as evidence! That means the burden of proof lies with you, the prosecution!

Edgeworth:
Uuugn!

Judge:
That's enough! Mr. Edgeworth. Can you confirm the handwriting on this suicide note...?

Edgeworth:
It is as the defense has stated! The handwriting has yet to be analyzed!

Judge:
If that's the case... It seems that yet again we have reached a point where a verdict is impossible.

Edgeworth:
Imposs... That's impossible!

Mia:
This isn't good, Phoenix.

Phoenix:
(The judge is going to carry this trial over one more day. I don't think Maya will physically be able to make it another day!)

Judge:
I didn't want to have to do this, but I don't have a choice. I request that both the prosecution and defense further investigate...

...Handwriting analysis my butt! That's just the lawyer trying to buy more time!

...Engarde is guilty! Look, any idiot can tell you that!

Mia:
I think we've reached the end of the line...

...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!...

Phone:
...

Judge:
Wh-What is that sound!?

Phoenix:
(It's Gumshoe!)

Phone:

Phoenix:

Gumshoe:

Phoenix:

He, uh... He got away...

Phoenix:
WHAT!?

Gumshoe:
I'm sorry, pal! I really am! I don't know what to say besides I'm sorry. I wish there was some way to make it up to you! I really do!

Phoenix:
A-Anyway, what's going on!?

Gumshoe:
We found his hideout, pal. But... the two of them were already gone...

Mia:
...This is terrible...

Gumshoe:
I'm going to keep looking for them, pal. Don't you worry! I just need a little more time!

Phoenix:
But...

Gumshoe:
Don't tell me we don't... we don't have any more...

...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!...

Phoenix:
Do you hear that? They're calling for his head!

Gumshoe:
Mr. Wright... I can't... For us to come this far and... ... Oh!

Phoenix:
Wh-What is it!?

Gumshoe:
Let me talk to Mr. Edgeworth!

Phoenix:
I-I can't do that!

Judge:
Mr. Wright! Would you please get a hold of yourself!?

Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
I am about to end today's proceedings. You may take your phone calls after...

Phoenix:
Hold on, Your Honor! Edgeworth! Catch!

Phoenix:
Takethat

Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:

Gumshoe:
Please! You've got to buy us some more time!

Edgeworth:

I'm sorry, Your Honor! But...!

Judge:
I am reluctant to do this, however... It appears that I have no choice but to suspend proceedings until tomorrow!

Phoenix:
(I... This time, I really can't do anything...)

Judge:
Court is now adjourned for the day!

Edgeworth:
Objection

Edgeworth:
Please wait, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
(E-Edgeworth!?)

Judge:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
I humbly request another 30 minutes of Your Honor's time.

Judge:
For what purpose?

Edgeworth:
We can perform the necessary tests on this piece of evidence in that time!

Judge:
Hmm... But can you really obtain your results in 30 minutes?

Edgeworth:
I believe we can, Your Honor.

Judge:
But wouldn't it be better if we adjourned for today and then reconvened tomorrow...?

Edgeworth:
Thirty minutes. Please, Your Honor. That's all I am asking for.

Phoenix:
Please! Your Honor!

Judge:
... Very well.

Phoenix:
...!

Judge:
At the prosecution's request, this court will now take a 30 minute recess. But be advised that I will not allow another recess today.

Phoenix:
(I'm not sure if this is helping... or hurting us...)

Judge:
The court will now take its final recess of the day!

Wright! Well!? What's going on with Maya's situation!?

Phoenix:
De Killer... It looks like he got away again. Thirty minutes...? We can't find her in that time...

Edgeworth:
Unnngh...

Phone:
...

Phone:
...*beep*...
Edgeworth:
Report!

Gumshoe:
Ah! I-Is that Mr. Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:
We don't have time! Just spit it out!

Gumshoe:
R-Right! It looks like we just missed them, sir. But De Killer left a few things behind by accident in his rush to get away.

Edgeworth:
A few things...?

Phoenix:
Can we use any of them as evidence?

Gumshoe:
Ho ho ho. I thought you'd ask, pal!

Phoenix:
...?

Gumshoe:
I've got the things he left with me right now and I'm on my way over!

Phoenix:
Really!?

Edgeworth:
That's odd. Any items like that are usually sent to the crime lab first...

Gumshoe:
We don't have time to wait for those guys, sir! When those guys weren't looking, I swiped the stuff and ran!

Edgeworth:
What!?

Gumshoe:
Well... I'm not a detective anymore, so I had to... I'm really sorry, sir, but I've got to put the law on hold for now!

Phoenix:
(Sounds bad... I hope he doesn't get in too much trouble over this...)

Gumshoe:
With my hunk of junk car, I'd say I'll be there in about 20 minutes, sir! Don't worry! I'll be there! Wait for me!

Edgeworth:
A-Alright... Just get here in one piece.

Gumshoe:
I'm on a mission and no one can stop me now, sir! No one! I'm pulling out all the stops and running every red light!

Phoenix:
(Items left by the murderer, huh... Maybe there's something among them that will be decisive enough to end this!)

Edgeworth:
Hey! What's wrong!? Detective Gumshoe! Answer me!

Gumshoe:
... No one can stop... I'm...

Phone:
...*beep* *beep* *beep*...
Phoenix:
Wh-What happened?

Edgeworth:
It sounded like he had an accident. I'm guessing his cell phone broke as well.

Phoenix:
Wh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!

Edgeworth:
But we have no idea where he is. His cell phone is broken, and he wasn't driving a patrol car, so no radio either. Also... If we don't get to those items before they do, the police will take possessions of them.

Phoenix:
No! We can't let that happen!

Edgeworth:
Well, if there is a way we can find out where he is, then we stand a chance...

Phoenix:
(Why, oh why did Gumshoe have to get into an accident now!? Is there any way to find out exactly where he is at this moment...!?)

There is a way.

There is no way.

Phoenix:
Edgeworth...

Edgeworth:
What is it?

Phoenix:
I don't have any right to judge anyone ever again...

Edgeworth:
...

Phoenix:
I know my client is guilty. But what I'm doing now... I'm pinning the guilt onto someone totally innocent, and using the evidence to do so... ... It might be my turn to say, "Defense Attorney Phoenix Wright chooses death"...

Edgeworth:
Wright. It doesn't suit someone like you to cry useless tears. Whether you did your job well or not... That can only be seen after the verdict has been decided.

Phoenix:
The verdict...

Bailiff:
Is Prosecutor Edgeworth here!?

Edgeworth:
Yes, bailiff?

Bailiff:
There's a phone call for you, sir. They said it was extremely urgent.

Edgeworth:
They're probably finished with the handwriting analysis. I have to go take this call. In the mean time, think hard about what it is you must do.

To be continued.
March 23, 2:35 PM
District Court
Courtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court will now reconvene. I assume both sides are ready?

Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor...

Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, Your Honor...

Judge:
...I can understand the defense acting like this, however, why do you also seem distraught, Mr. Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:
I... that is... It's nothing, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
(What's wrong with Edgeworth...?)

Mia:
It looks like something unexpected just happened to him.

Judge:
Now then, Mr. Edgeworth. If you could please tell the court the results of the handwriting analysis on Ms. Inpax's suicide note...

Edgeworth:
Y...Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately... We have discovered that this suicide note is a forgery.

Phoenix:
What!?

Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:
This... This note was not written by Ms. Inpax herself! It is a fake!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Would you care to explain what is going on!? If this was not written by Ms. Inpax, then who wrote it!?

Edgeworth:
We would need more time to do a more detailed analysis, however... It appears that the handwriting matches that of the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida.

Phoenix:
Mr. C-Corrida...?

Mia:
Well, well... It looks like Ms. Inpax never left a suicide note after all. She never wrote anything about Engarde...

Edgeworth:
However! Your Honor. Even though this suicide note is indeed a fake, Mr. Engarde could not have known that, and so that facts remain unchanged! Acting under the assumption that it was real, he had plotted to possess it!

Judge:
Hmm... That does sound very plausible.

Phoenix:
(This theory that Engarde had no idea that the suicide note was fake... Something seems a little wrong with it...)

Present evidence

Back down

Judge:
So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake. And if that's true, then the situation has suddenly changed in a very dramatic way.

Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's motive for murder was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!

Edgeworth:
But Your Honor! It's not as if Mr. Engarde monitored Mr. Corrida 24 hours a day! Perhaps the victim wrote the note in a place Mr. Engarde didn't know of!

Phoenix:
Well, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?

Edgeworth:
Gnnngh!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like this time, it is you who has dug his own grave.

Edgeworth:
Unnnngh... As I figured...

Judge:
Huh? ...As you figured...?

Edgeworth:
As I figured... It came down to this after all...

Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, you are not making any sense...

Edgeworth:
When I heard the results of the handwriting analysis, I thought this might happen. The question is... "What next?"

Phoenix:
What next...??

Edgeworth:
If the prosecution can't prove Mr. Engarde's motive through the evidence, then we must prove it from another angle.

Judge:
Well, I agree with you there...

Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution... would like to call a witness to the stand at this time...

Judge:
Oh. Well, that's fine.

Edgeworth:
However... this witness... This witness is a little... unusual...

Phoenix:
(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)

Judge:
Unusual? Well, what sort of witness is this person, Mr. Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
This witness is one who is perfectly fit to answer once and for all the question of, "Who was it that hired Shelly de Killer to commit murder?"

Phoenix:
That's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!

Judge:
Y-Yes! Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this witness!?

Edgeworth:
It is... It's... um...

Judge:
Yes!? Go on! Who is it!?

Edgeworth:
The man himself... Mr. Shelly de Killer.

Judge:
Oh, Mr. de Killer. ... W-W-Waaaaait!! Shelly de Killer!? Um, you mean... The killer? Err... I mean the assassin?

Edgeworth:
Yes... Your Honor.

Judge:
He's coming here? To the witness stand...?

Edgeworth:
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking... I recognize that this is a very unusual circumstance, so I ask for your permission.

Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
Y-Yes?

Judge:
Is this alright with you?

Phoenix:
(Do I have a choice here...? I can't really do much else to drag this trial out...) The defense has no objections, Your Honor.

Judge:
I wonder if it really is alright to do this...?

Edgeworth:
Very well then. The prosecution calls our witness to the stand!

Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... Is there no other way left to us...?)

Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. ...Um, your name... and your, uh... occupation, please.

de Killer:
Very good, sir. My name is Shelly de Killer, and I am a professional assassin.

Judge:
I... I say!! Wh-What is going on here!?

Edgeworth:
Your Honor?

Judge:
How can you remain so calm? And what is the meaning of this two-way radio...?

Edgeworth:
Actually, Your Honor, it was delivered to me just now... And it came with a condition. As long as we do not trace its source, Mr. de Killer will testify to this court.

Phoenix:
(So this must be what that urgent phone call he got earlier was about...)

Judge:
Oh no, this will not do. I cannot allow this in my court. First of all, we can't even be sure this is really Mr. de Killer himself!

Edgeworth:
Witness. Please present some sort of proof that you are in fact Shelly de Killer.

de Killer:
I understand. Please wait a second.

Judge:
...?

???:
...

Maya:
... I'm... sooo... hungry...

Phoenix:
M-M-Maya!

Mia:
Maya!

Judge:
A... A voice! Mr. Wright! Can you confirm anything from this!?

Phoenix:
The defense has no objections to this person! We are satisfied that this man is indeed Shelly de Killer!

Judge:
It looks like we have run into yet another unexpected turn of events... Well, it doesn't seem like we have too many choices under these circumstances, so...

Edgeworth:
...Now then, witness. There is one thing I would like to confirm before we speak of anything else.

de Killer:
And what would that be?

Edgeworth:
At the request of a client, you killed Mr. Juan Corrida. Is this correct?

de Killer:
... It is as you say. I did indeed kill Mr. Corrida.

Judge:
*gulp*

Edgeworth:
Now that we have answered that, let's move on to the name of your client!

de Killer:
...Very well.

Judge:
This is all just a bad dream... Yes, that's it, a bad dream...

Phoenix:
(Shelly de Killer... What is he going to say...?)

Witness Testimony
-- About My Client --
de Killer:
There is something I must first state.
To an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.
And that is the reason I am here today on this witness stand.
It is my wish that you grasp this concept before I give the name of my client.

Judge:
Hmm, Mr. de Killer seems to be a very clever man. I'd almost say he seems to be mocking us.

Edgeworth:
While he may appear to be our enemy, Your Honor, Mr. de Killer is only stating the truth. He is no hypocrite. He has always stood by this one belief.

Judge:
You mean about this "trust between his clients and himself" thing? Hmm, it seems to be a level of trust beyond what people like me can comprehend. ...Well, Mr. Wright? Are you ready to cross-examine the witness?

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

Mia:
There's no way to know what's coming next, so stay cool and collected, Phoenix.

Patience. Try to calm down a little. It's important to try and understand his mindset. He seems very steadfast and closed so you're going to have to work to get him to talk.

That person's name is...

Edgeworth:

Pray tell, what are you talking about, Mr. Prosecutor? I should think I know my own client, and it is Adrian Andrews.

Edgeworth:
Whaaaaaaaat!?!? Th-This can't be! On the phone earlier...

Phoenix:
Wh-What's going on here...?

Mia:
My guess is that Mr. de Killer just stabbed Mr. Edgeworth in the back.

Phoenix:
Stabbed Edgeworth in the back...?

Mia:
I'm sure in order to get an audience with this court, Mr. de Killer told him a different name... "Matt Engarde", perhaps...?

Phoenix:
(I knew it...)

Edgeworth:
Objection

Edgeworth:
This... This is outrageous! I was deceived! This witness is telling a very serious lie!

Judge:
B-But you were the one who summoned this witness!

Edgeworth:
Grk! Grr... Y-You... Shelly de Killer...!

de Killer:
My testimony is the truth. The defendant at the moment is Matt Engarde, am I correct? All I wish to do is help procure his acquittal.

Judge:
H... Hmm...

Mia:
Wow... All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.

Phoenix:
Yeah...

Judge:
The prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!

Edgeworth:
...No...

Judge:
With all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is innocent!

de Killer:
I seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict.

...*beep*...
Judge:
Bailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!

Mia:
What now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our last chance... to save Maya...

Phoenix:
Yeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! (Can I live with myself if I win this!?)

Judge:
Who would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?

Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!

Judge:
Hmm...

Andrews:
It wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!

Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews...

Andrews:
The suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...

Edgeworth:
...

Judge:
But... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named you as his client.

Andrews:
No! That's not true!

Judge:
Also, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...

Andrews:
But that's... That's...

Judge:
You even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.

Andrews:
I... No... Mr. Wright!

Phoenix:
...!

Andrews:
You... You know the truth! Tell them! Tell them the real story... Who the real killer is... Tell them! Please... Help me...

Phoenix:
(Yes, I know the truth...)

Judge:
Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?

Judge:
I believe we have reached the end of this trial. Therefore, I ask the defense for any final words or opinions.

Phoenix:
... (I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)

Request the verdict

Request the trial continue

Mia:
Phoenix...

Phoenix:
I can't do it, Mia... I can't accept a not guilty.

Mia:
You are a lawyer.

Phoenix:
I know. But... But Matt Engarde is a killer; a murderer! I can't... I can't let him get away with this. I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be betraying his trust. (...His trust...? I never thought about it until now... I... I trust him...?)

Mia:
... Yes, you do.

Judge:
Mr. Wright. Your opinion, please.

Phoenix:
The defense requests that we be allowed to further question Mr. de Killer.

Judge:
A-Am I hearing you correctly, Mr. Wright!?

Edgeworth:
Wright...

Judge:
But... But... That witness has cleared your client through his testimony! Your job here is done!

Phoenix:
I'm not done yet. To see through this witness' lies and find the truth... THAT is my job, Your Honor!

Judge:
...!

Phoenix:
(There's still more evidence to look at... And I'm sure that once those pieces arrive here in this very courtroom... a miracle will occur!)

Judge:
Very well. The trial will continue. Mr. Edgeworth. Please re-establish connection with Mr. de Killer.

Edgeworth:
Right away, Your Honor!

de Killer:
...Has a verdict been reached?

Edgeworth:
Before that, we would like to talk with you a little more.

de Killer:
About? All you needed from me was the name of my client. What else could you need me for?

Edgeworth:
Well... Actually, we would like to hear everything you know about this case. This is how things are... usually done.

Phoenix:
(What is he talking about? "Usually done"...??)

Judge:
But... What shall we have him testify about now?

Edgeworth:
Mr. de Killer. If you don't mind, please testify about your client in more detail.

de Killer:
You legal people and your procedures. Is it any wonder no one likes to go to court?

Witness Testimony
-- About My Client, Pt. 2 --
de Killer:
As I have already stated quite a few times, Adrian Andrews is my client. However.
One thing I simply cannot overlook is tampering with the scene of the crime.
My client did it to frame another for the crime.
While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene,
Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!
But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the "knife" and "button".
That act is what I was referring to when I said my client had "broken the rules".

Judge:
Hmm... This is a most unexpected turn of events... For the... um, fifth time now...? However, this time, everything has finally been revealed.

Edgeworth:
Objection

Edgeworth:
Just a second, Your Honor!

Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
We still have the cross-examination to do...

Judge:
But you don't need to question testimony like this... Do you, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
... Your Honor, the defense will question the witness. (As if I have a choice here!)

Judge:
Huh!? Why!? What this witness has said is nothing but beneficial to the defense's case! If you scrutinize the testimony, then...

Phoenix:
(...Then I'll expose the lies in that oh-so-"beneficial" testimony, I suppose.)

Judge:
I don't understand what's going on anymore...

Phoenix:
Thank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.

de Killer:
What is the meaning of that attitude?

Phoenix:
When Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your "client" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!

Judge:
But how... How do you know that!?

Phoenix:
From this wine glass, Your Honor.

Judge:
The glass...

Phoenix:
Mr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!

Judge:
Hmm... But isn't that just a part of Adrian Andrews' calculated plan?

Phoenix:
That is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!

Judge:
I see your point... Mr. Edgeworth!? What is your opinion?

Edgeworth:
Strangely enough... I had the same exact thought just now. Witness! How do you explain this strange phenomenon!?

de Killer:
I-Isn't it a waste of time to ask about such a minor detail? It's not a very important point anyway, correct...?

Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you are mistaken. If Adrian Andrews really is your client, as you claim... Then your client should have had knowledge of Mr. Corrida's death. If not... Then that can only mean that Adrian Andrews was never your client at all!

de Killer:
... How strange...

Judge:
Yes?

de Killer:
Why is it that the attorney has yet to raise an objection at this absurd situation...?

Phoenix:
...!

Mia:
Phoenix. If De Killer figures out what we're up to, we're in real trouble!

Phoenix:
Yeah, I know...

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth! I'm surprised! You know you can't say things like that without any evidence.

Edgeworth:
Ah... Sorry.

Judge:
... Th-That sounded like an awfully weak "Objection!" to me...

Edgeworth:
Anyway! I am positive there was a contradiction in that testimony. The prosecution requests further testimony concerning when the request was taken!

de Killer:
... Very well.

Phoenix:
(Right now, I have to buy us more time... While we wait for the items De Killer left behind to get here. I just know that the very outcome of this trial lies with those items!)

That is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.

Judge:
Hmm... So you physically met your client, huh?

That is correct. Meeting one's client is the first step to building trust, in my opinion.

Phoenix:
(Talk about a delicate balance...)

Phoenix:
I would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?

de Killer:
Yes, that is correct.

Phoenix:
And that's when you thought "he" was trustworthy...

de Killer:
How many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.

Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.

de Killer:
Wh-What!?

Phoenix:
Shelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!

de Killer:
...! Wh-Why would you say that...?

Phoenix:
Because you made one very big slip-up... ...about her.

de Killer:
So what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About "her"...?

Phoenix:
If you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a woman!

de Killer:
Ohoooooo!

Judge:
O-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?

Phoenix:
This witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.

Judge:
But he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...

Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!

de Killer:
Ugnnn...

Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?

Edgeworth:
I believe it has to do with her name, Your Honor.

Judge:
Her name?

Edgeworth:
Yes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.

Judge:
Hmm... Yes, I see...

Edgeworth:
Unluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.

Judge:
Wh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!

de Killer:
Umm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.

Edgeworth:
So does that mean you remember something different now?

de Killer:
Yes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...

Phoenix:
(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)

Judge:
Very well. But this time, please give us the truth, and nothing but the truth!

Yes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.
There have been times when I took a job without having met my client.
The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.
When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.

Judge:
Hmm... So you took this job through a letter...

Phoenix:
(He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)

Mia:
Be careful, Phoenix. If you break the assassin's testimony completely, it's over for us.

Phoenix:
I know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK; like we can do this. (As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)

And that's exactly what is so bad. At the rate we're going, we will end up completely destroying De Killer's lie. If we do that... You already know how serious of a situation that will put us in.

Phoenix:
O-Oh yeah... (All I can do now is pray that those items reach us in time...)

Phoenix:
Shelly de Killer. If you had really given the bear to Ms. Andrews... then this item should not have been inside it.

de Killer:
"This item"...?

Edgeworth:
I see where you're going...

Phoenix:
Yup, that's where I'm going...

Judge:
Where is everyone going!? Do I need to pack a suitcase?

Phoenix:
Your Honor. Please think back to Ms. Andrews' testimony.

Andrews:
And I was going to burn it... for her sake.

Phoenix:
If even for a single minute, this bear had actually been in Ms. Andrews' hands... I'm sure she would have taken the suicide note out and burned it!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So that's where you two were going!

Edgeworth:
So by the very fact that this suicide note was still inside the bear... Tells us that your "client" didn't know how to disassemble the puzzle!

Judge:
Wh-Which means...?

Edgeworth:
It means, Your Honor, that it is impossible for Adrian Andrews to be the "client"!

de Killer:
Ohoooooo!

Judge:
O...Order! Order! ORDER!!

de Killer:
... Ungh... Mr...Phoenix Wright...

Phoenix:
...!

de Killer:
I... I'm sure I mentioned this before. How I hate traitors above all else!

Edgeworth:
...

de Killer:
I think your cross-examination has clearly demonstrated something to me. You... You must wish to break your end of our agreement!

Phoenix:
No! That's not...

de Killer:
That's enough! If that is your intention, then there is only one thing for me to do!

Phoenix:
W-Wait! Please!

de Killer:
Gentlemen, ladies, please excuse me. I have a matter that I must attend to.

Phoenix:
Holdit

Phoenix:
N...No... Please... Not that... Please wait...

de Killer:
Mr. Attorney! Bring this trial to a speedy end, and I may stay my hand! Otherwise...

Phoenix:
Nnnngh... Gnwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!

Judge:
What in the...? Mr. Wright...? Are you...?

Phoenix:
...

Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth...?

Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?

Judge:
I didn't understand this witness' outburst just now. Do you think there is a need to hear more testimony, or is this enough...?

Edgeworth:
Well... We should...

Phoenix:
(Edgeworth! We can't do this! If we keep this up... Maya... She'll...!)

Edgeworth:
U...Ungh! The prosecution... I...

Judge:
Wh-What has come over everyone? Even you are...

Edgeworth:
The prosecution... rests.

Judge:
What is going on around here...?

Edgeworth:
The prosecution has no further questions, Your Honor.

Judge:
Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?

Judge:
Well, I never thought I'd see the day. This is a most unusual situation... If the prosecution rests with no further questions... Then... the prosecution has failed to uphold its stance.

Edgeworth:
...

Judge:
If that is the case, then even though I am reluctant, I must believe that Mr. de Killer's testimony is accurate. That would mean that Shelly de Killer's client is... Adrian Andrews!

Phoenix:
...!

Edgeworth:
Nnngh...

Judge:
Mr. Wright!

Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?

Judge:
If I end the trial here, right now, then your client, Matt Engarde, would be declared innocent. And in his place, Adrian Andrews would be charged with murder.

Phoenix:
(M-Ms. Andrews... would be charged with murder!)

Edgeworth:
...

Judge:
The prosecution has no further questions, so we will now hear the defense's final remarks. Bailiff! Please bring the defendant, Matt Engarde, to the stand!

Mia:
The items from De Killer's hideout didn't make it in time... We tried as hard as we could, but it looks like our time has run out...

Phoenix:
(I can't believe it...)

Mia:
The outcome now lies in your hands.

Engarde:
Dude, did the old guy finally decide?

Judge:
To be honest, I can't think of you as a truly innocent and good person. You have done enough evil to drive a woman to suicide.

Engarde:
...

Judge:
But... At least on the charge of murder, it would appear you are innocent.

Engarde:
... Hah...! So, I guess even the old fuddy-duddy figured me out!

Judge:
M-Mr. Engarde...?

Engarde:
You were atrocious as a lawyer, weren't you? Giving your client away like this! And that "refreshing like a spring breeze" crap; it's just as atrocious, don't you agree? ... Anyway, get on with it and pronounce me innocent already. Right, Mister Lawyer!?

Phoenix:
...

Phoenix:
(Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?)

Maya:
You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!?

Phoenix:
(But... But if I did that... Maya will die! But if I say he's innocent... Then Ms. Andrews will be charged as the murderer! Do I say he's "guilty"... or "not guilty"...? Either choice I make, someone's life is going to end!)

Phoenix:
(It all hinges on what I "choose"!)

Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.

Phoenix:
...

Judge:
If the person who hired the assassin was Adrian Andrews... Then your client, Mr. Matt Engarde is innocent.

Engarde:
Hmph... There's no need to ask, old man. After all, my lawyer is going to say what I want... aren't you?

Edgeworth:
Wright...

Phoenix:
(I can't! I can't do this! But I have to decide something! I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart!) My client... Matt Engarde is...

Guilty

Not guilty

Judge:
We are waiting for your answer, Mr. Wright! Matt Engarde, your client deserves an answer!

Phoenix:
... (Maya... I'm sorry...) Matt Engarde is...

von Karma:
Objection

Phoenix:
F-Franziska von Karma!!

Judge:
Wh-What are you doing here... OWW!

von Karma:
You see now, don't you... Mr. Phoenix Wright? This is exactly why you should NEVER take your eyes off of that scruffy fool!

Edgeworth:
Did you bring them? The final pieces... Do you have them?

von Karma:
You should know better than to ask that, Mr. Miles Edgeworth. A Von Karma is perfect in every way! The evidence is here in perfect condition! Don't worry about Scruffy. He's fine, and his injuries are minor. All of the items are inside this.

Judge:
What a filthy, old coat this is...

Phoenix:
(That's Gumshoe's... I can spot his tattered rags anywhere...)

von Karma:
I apologize for its ugliness, but there was nothing else to wrap the items in.

Phoenix:
(I've fought long and hard this whole trial... All for what is inside that raggedy coat... I'm sure that inside that coat, lies a crucial piece of evidence!) Your Honor! Inside that filthy coat... Are the defense's final pieces of evidence!

Judge:
Your final... evidence!?

Judge:
... This trial is already over. All that remains is for me to hand down my verdict. I do not believe that any evidence presented now, would change the outcome of this trial.

Phoenix:
(Wh-What!?)

Edgeworth:
Objection

Edgeworth:
Your Honor. It is our duty to examine every piece of evidence, down to the last. I request that Ms. von Karma be allowed to present these pieces of evidence!

Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you are right, Mr. Edgeworth. I grant permission to do so. However, this one obvious rule applies here; If these items do not bring up any new points, then they will not be accepted by this court.

Phoenix:
...!

Judge:
Now, Ms. von Karma. If you please.

von Karma:
These pieces of evidence are items left by De Killer during his escape from the police.

Judge:
Hmm... He must have been in quite a rush.

von Karma:
Yes, Your Honor. De Killer left three pieces of evidence.

Phoenix:
(Somewhere among the evidence we're about to see... There will be something that will turn this whole situation around... like a miracle. I'm sure of it!)

Mia:
That is all we can hope for.

von Karma:
The first item is a pistol.

Phoenix:
(Does De Killer's pistol have anything to do with this case...?)

Question for more details

More details are not needed

Pistol added to the Court Record.

von Karma:
The second piece of evidence is this video tape.

Phoenix:
(I bet De Killer took that from Engarde Mansion...)

Question for more details

More details are not needed

Video Tape added to the Court Record.

von Karma:
The last piece of evidence is this bellboy's uniform.

Phoenix:
(Is that a uniform from the Gatewater Hotel...?)

Question for more details

More details are not needed

Bellboy's Uniform added to the Court Record.

von Karma:
That is all I have to present, Your Honor.

Judge:
Hmm... It's just as I thought.

Phoenix:
And... what is that, Your Honor..?

Judge:
I'm sure, were we under normal circumstances, these items from Shelly de Killer's hideout would be very important clues. However... Our question is not "Who did the killing?"

Edgeworth:
It is, "Who is the client?"...

Judge:
Yes, that is correct. And these three items do not tell us anything about that! Thank you for your hard work, Ms. von Karma. You may step down now.

Phoenix:
Holdit

Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor! Please allow me to examine this new evidence!

Judge:
Overruled. This court already has all the evidence it needs to hand down a verdict!

Engarde:
Wonderful... Absolutely splendid. This judge is such a brilliant man, isn't he?

Phoenix:
(Is this the end...?)

Mia:
Phoenix.

Phoenix:
I knew it... There's no such thing as a "miracle" in this world, is there?

Mia:
I think you're wrong. I think they do exist. But you have to make that "miracle" happen. You've come this far! You can't give up now!

Phoenix:
But... But... No matter how you think about it... It's... It's...

Mia:
Try... For my sake. Just think about it for a second. There are two ways out of this situation for us.

Phoenix:
(T-Two!?)

Mia:
The first... Make Engarde wish from the bottom of his soul for a guilty verdict.

Phoenix:
Huh?

Mia:
De Killer will always place his client's wishes first. If Engarde himself wished to be convicted, then he will let his hostage go.

Phoenix:
Th-That may be true, but... That's asking me to do the impossible!

Mia:
The second way... Force De Killer to end his contract with Engarde. If De Killer were to no longer think of Engarde as his "client"... Then he would let Maya go.

Phoenix:
Mia! That's even more impossible! He is a man who values his duty towards his clients above all else!

Mia:
... I know both of these seem like impossible feats at first. But if you could make either one happen, it would truly be a "miracle".

Phoenix:
The bigger problem is, the judge has already said he doesn't need any more evidence! The pieces he was just shown; he's not accepting them!

Mia:
Phoenix. Think things through from the other side. Isn't that what has always worked for us?

Phoenix:
...! (The "other side"...? Wait, does she mean...) You mean... to turn things around?

Mia:
Phoenix. The judge says he doesn't need the evidence. If that's the case, then who does need it?

Phoenix:
("The person who needs the evidence"...)

Mia:
The defense, prosecution, and the judge... We have seen all the pieces of evidence. And that is how we have come to know the "truth". But there are people who have not seen them all. And those people do not know the "truth". That truth... It may be what will bring about the miracle in the end.

Judge:
There are no objections this time, correct? Now then, I will pronounce my verdict!

Engarde:
Why don't we all respectfully sit back and listen, kids.

Phoenix:
Objection

Judge:
I have already told you, Mr. Wright. This court does not need any more evidence.

Phoenix:
I am not saying it is us that needs the evidence, Your Honor!

Edgeworth:
...!

Judge:
Then... you want to show the evidence to... that person...?

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
...

Phoenix:
Please, Your Honor!

Judge:
Mr. Wright. For you to ask with such passion... I will grant you one chance.

Phoenix:
(O...One chance...)

Judge:
Please show your evidence to who you think is the right person.

Edgeworth:
Objection

Edgeworth:
That's impossible! To turn this situation around in one try...

Judge:
One try. That is all I will permit.

Phoenix:
(I have to try to remember... Everything that has happened up to this point... Think, Phoenix! Think! There must be a way to save Maya while taking Engarde down at the same time!)

Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's not waste any more time.

Phoenix:
...

Judge:
Who would you like to show evidence to?

Present anyone

Judge:
I see. And now... Tell this court what one piece of evidence you would like to show this person!

Present Video Tape (after presenting Shelly de Killer profile)

Otherwise

Judge:
... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?

Edgeworth:
Uh... Um... I think there is some merit... in showing this evidence to that witness.

Judge:
... Bailiff! Please bring in the transceiver from earlier!

Phoenix:
(Alright! It looks like they got a hold of him...)

Phoenix:
Maya... She's OK, right!?

de Killer:
Didn't I tell you to concern yourself with bringing about a speedy end to this trial? Now, if I understand correctly, you wish to show me one piece of evidence?

Phoenix:
Yes. One is all I need. I have here a video tape. It was found at your hideout.

de Killer:
...

Phoenix:
I heard you injured three officers in your attempt to get this back.

de Killer:
That was most regrettable. However, it was an order from my client. I was told to protect that video tape.

Phoenix:
(I thought so...)

de Killer:
I'm afraid I seem to have failed in that regard.

Phoenix:
Do you know the contents of this tape?

de Killer:
I was sternly told by my client to not watch it. So I have absolutely no idea.

Phoenix:
Actually, you are on this tape.

de Killer:
Me?

Phoenix:
There was a video camera hidden at the crime scene. Your actions were being recorded.

de Killer:
Wh-What!?

Judge:
Is that true!? Mr. Wright!?

de Killer:
Who... Who was it that planted a camera...!?

Phoenix:
Well, the only person who could have placed a camera at the scene of the crime... would be your "client" naturally.

de Killer:
...!

Judge:
Th-That was... Adrian Andrews...

Edgeworth:
Be quiet and listen... Your Honor.

Judge:
Yes, sir.

Phoenix:
Your "client" specified a place and time for you, isn't that right?

de Killer:
Y-Yes...

Phoenix:
That was so they could film you.

de Killer:
... I had no idea. ... Mr. Wright. Why would my client do such a thing?

Phoenix:
...

de Killer:
I would like to know why...

Phoenix:
(Why did Matt Engarde film the crime scene...? The reason "why" he did that is my ticket out of this whole mess!) There is only one reason why your "client" would secretly film the crime scene. They...

wanted to see Juan get his.

wanted blackmail on you.

didn't trust your skills.

Phoenix:
Your "client" once told me something very interesting. We were talking about you, and this is what they said.

Engarde:
But I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins.

Engarde:
Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail.

Engarde:
Yes, that's where the video comes in. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want.

Phoenix:
Your "client" didn't trust you at all. They were thinking of using this video to blackmail you! What do you have to say to that, Shelly de Killer!?

de Killer:
Gnnn...nnnngh... Ohoooooo! ... It looks like... It looks like I was being deceived from the very beginning...

Phoenix:
Yes... By a natural... That is the kind of person they are. Your "client" is a person who only thinks and plots of how to use the people around them to protect themselves from any and all dangers that may arise. That is the true nature of your "client".

de Killer:
...

Edgeworth:
I have one question for the witness.

de Killer:
Yes?

Edgeworth:
You told us one thing numerous times during your testimony. You said that you detest traitors most of all.

de Killer:
Yes, that's right.

Edgeworth:
But what if that traitor was your own client...? What would you do then!?

de Killer:
... That's obvious. I would break our contract in that case. And then... That client would become my next target. For the honor of the De Killer name, even if it takes an eternity... I would follow that person to the ends of the earth to exact my punishment.

Edgeworth:
I see. That's all I wanted to know.

Phoenix:
(So the traitor becomes De Killer's next target... Ah! I get it... This is how we'll turn this case around!)

de Killer:
Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
Yes...?

de Killer:
My contract with my client is over as of now. I seem to have a new job on my hands. I will now return to you, your precious item.

Maya:
...What the!? I'm not an item!

...*beep*...
Phoenix:
(Maya... I thought I'd never see you again... Oh thank goodness!)

Judge:
Um... This trial appears to have come to its conclusion... However... I... Actually, I am sort of... I don't quite know what just happened there with the client and the witness and... Gwaaah! M-Ms. von Karma! Where did that...!?

Edgeworth:
She always has you in her sights. Now! I do believe it's time to finally hand down a verdict!

Phoenix:
Mr. Engarde. It looks like somehow, you got what you wanted. You will finally receive the acquittal you wanted so badly. You should be happy.

Edgeworth:
But before that, I would like to make one final statement. Sometime in the near future, one very betrayed assassin may appear before you.

Engarde:
...!

Edgeworth:
Needless to say, that man is very good at what he does. I'm sure you would understand what I mean, if you watch this video.

Engarde:
...H-- Help me...

Edgeworth:
Now then, Your Honor! The verdict, if you please.

Judge:
I-Is this alright with you, Mr. Wright?

Phoenix:
...!

Mia:
We have finally reached the end of a very long battle. Whether he's convicted or acquitted, there is no escape for him now. Go on, Phoenix. Plead whichever way your heart tells you.

Phoenix:
Right, Chief.

Plead not guilty

Plead guilty

Engarde:
... Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Guiltyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Guuuuuilty!!!GGG--Guuiiillltyyyy!!!GGGUUUILLLTYYY!!GUILTY!!!GuiLTy!!guIIIltYY!!Guil--guilty!guilty!GUilTY!GUILTY!

Judge:
As always, it looks like we have uncovered the real truth.

Phoenix:
(We? I don't remember you helping out much in this...)

Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. How is Matt Engarde?

Edgeworth:
I have left Ms. von Karma in charge of his incarceration. I'm sure he's getting a full-course meal of whip leather right about now.

Judge:
Very good. That was a close one, wasn't it, witness?

Andrews:
Yes... I plan to pay my debt to society for my own crime, Your Honor. ... This trial was the first time I had stood on the witness stand, and when I did... I really felt hopeless.

Phoenix:
(She must be talking about the time Edgeworth really went after her... I guess she's trying to forgive him for what he did...)

Edgeworth:
This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.

Edgeworth:
If you're going to say you would "choose death", that is of no concern to me.

Andrews:
But... after that, when I was alone at the detention center... That's the first time I really saw myself and who I am.

Edgeworth:
...

Andrews:
And today... When the two of you used your combined strength to convict Matt... I... I felt like I had finally been saved.

Phoenix:
(Wow, this is the first time I've ever seen her smile.)

Andrews:
I am really happy that you two were in charge of this case. I really don't know how to express how I feel at this moment... This is... This is the first time I've felt comfortable with myself; with who I am. Thank you so much, everyone!

Judge:
It looks like we have resolved everything at last. As for myself, there are still a few things I'm confused about... But everyone seems to be in good spirits, and that is good enough for me. That is all. This court is adjourned!

March 23, 5:14 PM
District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 3
Mia:
You were great out there, Phoenix!

Phoenix:
What I did out there was right... wasn't it?

Mia:
... This is the first time you've not gotten your client off. You got them a "guilty" verdict this time. But... You have to look past all of that, to what's really important. You now realize that there is something more than just getting a "not guilty", right?

Phoenix:
Yes, I understand now.

Mia:
Phoenix, think back for a second. Think to the moments before Ms. von Karma arrived with the final pieces of evidence. Think about the incredible decision you had to make...

Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.

Phoenix:
... (I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart! Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?) My client... Matt Engarde is...

Mia:
Is he "guilty"... or is he "not guilty"...? Those were your choices then. And your answer... Your answer spoke to what being a "lawyer" means to you...

Edgeworth:
Wright!

Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...

Edgeworth:
I have good news. Maya is now safe in police custody!

Pearl:
Really!?

Phoenix:
P-Pearls--

Pearl:
You're telling us the truth, right Mr. Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:
Y-Yes... She's quite safe. She is on her way here as we speak in a patrol car.

Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya's safe!! You did it! You really did it, Mr. Nick!

Phoenix:
(Oww... She punches deceptively hard for a kid...)

Pearl:
I... I believed in you. I kept saying to myself: Mr. Nick will save her... Mr. Nick will save her... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Phoenix:
Ah, um... Thanks.

Pearl:
Oh...

Phoenix:
What's wrong?

Pearl:
Ms. von Karma...

von Karma:
...

Phoenix:
Um... About earlier... Uh... Thanks... OWW!!

von Karma:
Why are you still smiling... Mr. Phoenix Wright!? You... You lost!! Your perfect win record has now been crushed! And yet... You are still happy!?

Phoenix:
... I don't think you'll ever understand... Ms. von Karma.

von Karma:
How dare you!?

Edgeworth:
Don't worry. She may in time. After all, I was like that myself, until a year ago...

Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...?

Edgeworth:
For my own personal victories... and for guilty verdicts... I used every dirty trick in the book. And so my win record remained spotless. But... A man appeared and stood fast against that selfish me. I fought him in my usual manner, and tasted my first defeat. I felt like I had lost everything because of that. And then... It was my turn to sit in the defendant's chair. And I was saved... by that person I called my "enemy"... I couldn't forgive myself for all that had happened. So I left the Prosecutor's Office. And I left that note... "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death"...

von Karma:
Hmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!

Edgeworth:
...But that was not what happened. After I left the Prosecutor's Office, I finally came to realize something. And it was in that moment of clarity that everything began to change.

von Karma:
Wh-What foolish nonsense...

Edgeworth:
We prosecutors use anything we can to attack the defendant. But every time we did so...

Phoenix:
Objection

Edgeworth:
No matter how desperate the situation... instead of giving up like most people, that man would hold strong with his undying faith. And then, before I knew it... I began to trust in that man as well.

von Karma:
Wh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?

Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter how many underhanded tricks a person uses... The truth will always find a way to make itself known. The only thing we can do is to fight with the knowledge we hold and everything we have. Erasing the paradoxes one by one... It's never easy... We claw and scratch for every inch. But we will always eventually reach that one single truth. This I promise you.

Pearl:
The "truth"...

Edgeworth:
Yes. That's the reason why prosecutors and defense lawyers exist. But I'm sure you knew that already, didn't you Wright?

Phoenix:
...

Edgeworth:
That's why you couldn't forgive me; this man who went into hiding. Isn't that right? This man who only had his sights set on "victory", who ran away into the night...

Pearl:
Ah! Is... Is Mr. Edgeworth right, Mr. Nick...!?

Phoenix:
(You really let me down...) When you disappeared, I felt... betrayed. The reason I decided to become a lawyer to begin with... Was because I believed in the things you said to me, all those years ago... And you... You betrayed your own words. That's why... one year ago, I made up my mind. I decided that the Miles Edgeworth I knew had died... ...At least, that's what I told myself.

von Karma:
You pathetic fool!

Pearl:
M-Ms. von Karma...

von Karma:
I don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over... It's all over!

Phoenix:
(Franziska threw something on the ground just now...)

Edgeworth:
This is... an electromagnetic receiver.

Phoenix:
Isn't that the thing she used to track Detective Gumshoe...?

Edgeworth:
I'll return this to the precinct later. There's something else...

Pearl:
Ah! Isn't that Ms. von Karma's whip!?

Edgeworth:
"I'll never set foot in another courtroom again"... I'm sure that's what she's saying by this action...

Phoenix:
...

Edgeworth:
You should keep this, Wright.

Phoenix:
... Umm... OK.

???:
Nick!!

Phoenix:
......! M-M-M... MAYA!

Pearl:
Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!

Maya:
Oh, Nick! I knew you would come through! You got Engarde convicted, like I knew you would... And on top of that, you even rescued me!

Phoenix:
Well, of course I did! You know I would never desert you! But we sure pressed our luck this trial... You're really lucky to be standing here!

Maya:
Whatever, whatever. Look, it's over, OK? Besides, if I did croak, I would just come back and haunt you like a bad ghost through Pearly!

Phoenix:
... (Is it really that easy to do something like that...?)

Maya:
... Th-Thanks a lot... Nick.

Phoenix:
Um... Don't mention it.

Edgeworth:
Maya...

Maya:
Oh, Mr. Edgeworth.

Edgeworth:
Um... I'm relieved you're alright.

Maya:
Hey... It looks like you've made some real progress, Mr. Edgeworth!

Edgeworth:
Umm... Well, I suppose I'm a little different from who I was a year ago.

Maya:
Heh...

*growwwwl...grrrrr...urrrr...*

Maya:
Alright! I think it's time we got out of this depressing place!

Phoenix:
Huh? Where are we going!?

Maya:
Food, Nick! FOOD! Grub! Chow! I'm starved! I'm so hungry even you look like a nice, juicy burger on a bun to me, Nick!

Phoenix:
Y-You think I look like a burger...? I'm a Prime Rib at least!

Pearl:
Come with us, Mr. Edgeworth! Please!!

Edgeworth:
Uh, um... If you insist...

Phoenix:
Alright... So how about we hit up our usual burger joint...?

Maya:
Don't be silly, Nick.

Phoenix:
Huh?

Maya:
This case messed up that awesome evening, and got in the way of my gourmet food. So I've decided that we have to make it up by having another feast!

Phoenix:
A-Another feast...?

Maya:
C'mon, Nick! FOOOOOOD!

March 23, 7:38 PM
Gatewater Hotel
Hotel Lobby
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

Phoenix:
Gumshoe! Are you alright!?

Gumshoe:
Yeah, but I'm really embarrassed. I didn't think I would hit a telephone pole, of all things.

Phoenix:
A telephone pole...? (Then, it wasn't a red light that got him...?)

Lotta:
Ya did it again, City Boy. I felt like my dear ol' heart was gonna give out on me! And I ain't jokin'!

Powers:
Yeah! It was more exciting than the very last episode of the Steel Samurai!

Phoenix:
Th-Thanks...

Lotta:
Now lookie here, mister snooty prosecutor! Don't ya reckon ya bullied Mr. Wright too hard!? If ya don't start bein' a lot nicer to him, he might just kick it... Tonight, even!

Edgeworth:
Umm... I'll keep that in mind.

Lotta:
Well, come on now! Everyone gather 'round! Y'all are gonna get yer picture taken by a genuine professional photographer!

Phoenix:
(Looks like Lotta bought herself a new camera...)

Gumshoe:
Well, pal... At least we can put this messy case behind us now. Come on! Tonight's all about eating, so let's go chow down, pal!

Maya:
Amen to that, pal! Amen!

Powers:
You know, when you think about it, you were the one who saved the day, Detective!

Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? ...You really think so?

Edgeworth:
He's right. If it wasn't for the three items you took... I think this trial would have had a very different ending.

Gumshoe:
Ah, well, you know... It's... Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho. ...Huh? Wait. That's odd... When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took 4 things total, sir.

Maya:
What?

Pearl:
Four?

Gumshoe:
Yeah, I'm sure I put one of the items in my coat pocket...

Phoenix:
(There was a fourth item...?)

Lotta:
Aw, come on y'all. It's over! But whoo boy, I tell ya! You really are somethin' else! Between getting' accused of murder and getting' kidnapped... Never a dull moment with you, huh?

Maya:
Hahaha, you think?

Phoenix:
(Why does she look so happy about that...?)

Pearl:
But being shut away for two whole days... Weren't you scared...?

Maya:
Yeah, it was really scary. I felt so hopeless. So to keep my mind off of things, I drew a picture!

Lotta:
Sounds like ya had it rough, gal! So where's this picture of yers?

Pearl:
Yeah! I want to see it! I want to see Mystic Maya's picture!

Maya:
... Hmm... You know, I don't know where it went...

Pearl:
Aww... That's too bad...

Maya:
W-Well, it's alright! It wasn't anything important anyway.

Phoenix:
(Ah... It sure is nice to finally see them both smiling again.)

...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...

Edgeworth:
...Hm?

Phoenix:
What is it, Edgeworth?

Edgeworth:
This thing is picking something up.

Gumshoe:
Ah! That's! That's Ms. von Karma's receiver! Ugh. Thanks to her, I had the most awful experience of my life, sir! I can't believe she stuck a tracking device on me...

Edgeworth:
That's odd. Even though you're standing right here... The tracking device seems to be in a different location.

Gumshoe:
Oh... It's probably busted or something, sir.

Edgeworth:
... ...Well, it doesn't matter. I'm afraid it's about time for me to excuse myself. I still have some work to do.

Maya:
Huh!? But Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even eaten anything yet!

Phoenix:
(And you've eaten way too much, you glutton!)

Edgeworth:
I had fun tonight. Now, if you'll excuse me...

Phoenix:
Wait.

Edgeworth:
What?

Phoenix:
... I just want to say... Thanks, Edgeworth. You really saved me out there.

Edgeworth:
...Hmph. If anyone should be saying thanks, it should be me, Wright.

Phoenix:
(I feel like words alone aren't enough here... I wonder if there's anything I can give him to express how I feel...?)

Edgeworth:
You don't need to thank me. I was only doing my job.

Pearl:
It looks like Mr. Edgeworth has left, Mr. Nick. Hey, Mystic Maya?

Maya:
Hm? Yes, Pearly?

Pearl:
I guess you two can go back to being lovey-dovey, right? You and Mr. Nick, I mean...

Maya:
P-Pearly! Would you cut it out already!? You're embarrassing me!

Powers:
Um, anyway... So, who's paying for this lovely dinner party?

Maya:
As if you need to ask! Everyone say, "Thank you" to Nick!

Phoenix:
Huh?

Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah... I'm kinda at the point where I can't even buy instant noodles, pal. So I kinda already put your name on the bill.

Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?

Lotta:
Yeah, I got me a situation just like that myself. There's this camera shop in this hotel, see... And I just bought myself this good ol' beauty here! It'd better be anyhow for $3,000!

Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?

Lotta:
Actually, I reckon ya bought it for me since it's on yer tab and all.

Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

Pearl:
Isn't this great, Mr. Nick!?

Maya:
Yeah, Nick!

Phoenix:
... (Why do I suddenly feel like screaming?)

Lotta:
Aww, ya don't need to hold back now, ya hear?

Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal! Time to let it all out!

Pearl:
This is going to be the first time I hear the real you.

You really came through for me, Nick! I had to hide that letter, but I knew you'd find it. I really feel like I've been living on the edge lately. I mean, I've escaped death three times now! Pretty cool, huh? I feel like a pro!

Pearl:
I'm so happy that you could save Mystic Maya, Mr. Nick! And I'm so happy for the two of you! Speaking of... I think this hotel is a popular place for honeymooners... So I sort of... made reservations for the two of you... Just in case...

Gumshoe:
Well, pal. It looks like I'm back on the force again. Mr. Edgeworth had a long talk with the Chief, and he got me reinstated for my sake! I heard he said things like, "Letting that one go is bad for all of society." I knew it! Crashing headlong into everything is the only way to live, pal!

Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Recently... Hmm, yes... That girl, you know... I haven't seen her around... Hmm, yes... But I remember...

Max:
I think if there are any talking bunnies, even they won't laugh at Moe's jokes!

Ah, but it's Edgey-poo's idea, so that means it must have a deep, hidden meaning. But... Why do I get the feeling... They wouldn't forget about me, would they? Ah, it was never like this in the old days! Everyone thought the world of me! They used to call me Queen Wendy, and treat me like royalty, and any man who hasn't heard about this is going to feel the pain of my heel, yes they're going to feel the burn, and speaking of burn, playing with fire is very dangerous and because of that, three of the warehouses where they stored the scenery were burned right down and that caused a huge stink that

Andrews:
I appreciate everything you and Mr. Edgeworth did for me from the bottom of my heart. Oh, that's right. I received a letter from Ms. von Karma. She said that after I get out, I should feel free to consult her about anything at all. I'm really thankful to have met everyone!

de Killer:
It has become difficult for me in this country as of late. As such, I will take a short leave of absence. If you would like to request my services, please be sure to visit my homepage. May we both be blessed with longevity.

Where are you going... Franziska?

von Karma:
...! How did you know I was here...?

Edgeworth:
With this.

von Karma:
That's...

Edgeworth:
I heard you were planting things on a certain person. Things like tracking devices in his coat, for example.

von Karma:
Hmph. That's just like you. I only planted it there because he was always wearing it. This... filthy, drab coat of his... I don't know how it ended up in my luggage. But it's going in the trash, I promise you that.

Edgeworth:
Oh, that's right... Speaking of that man... He told me something very interesting.

Gumshoe:
When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took 4 things total, sir.

von Karma:
Four items...?

Edgeworth:
It seems he put the last one in his coat pocket.

von Karma:
He put it in here...? ... It doesn't matter anymore. The case is already over.

Edgeworth:
... What are you going to do now?

von Karma:
... That's none of your business.

Edgeworth:
Are you running away?

von Karma:
Shut up! You don't understand a thing! You can't possibly understand what it means to be "Manfred von Karma's daughter"!

Edgeworth:
Franziska...

von Karma:
So many expectations from everyone around me... Expectations I must fulfill! I'm expected to win no matter what. And failure? Such a thing is not an option for me! My father was a genius. There's no doubt about that! But... But me... I'm no genius. I've always known that.

Edgeworth:
...

von Karma:
But I... I had to be one. I had to.

Edgeworth:
... You may not be a genius like your father... But... You are a prosecutor. You have been and always will be.

von Karma:
...! No, I'm not... Not anymore. I've even thrown my whip away.

von Karma:
... You haven't changed a bit... You've always... You've always left me alone and walked on ahead without me. Miles Edgeworth... I've always hated you.

Edgeworth:

von Karma:
And then... Finally, my chance to take my revenge on you arrived. If I could win against that man... If I could make Phoenix Wright bow down in defeat... Then this "girl" you left behind would have risen higher than you! That was supposed to be my "revenge"...

Edgeworth:
I see...

von Karma:
... You know, I can't do it... I can't change who I am. I can't throw away everything I've been until today.

Edgeworth:
I believe you can. Just like how Adrian Andrews did.

von Karma:
Adrian Andrews...?

Edgeworth:
You were going to use her during the trial, right? But you... You were "dependant" on your father by using his tactics. Isn't that right?

von Karma:
Hmph!

Edgeworth:
Today, you chased after me, after I had left you behind all these years. And that's why we're standing here now, side by side.

von Karma:
...!

Edgeworth:
But I have no intention of stopping. If you say you are going to quit your walk down the prosecutor's path... ... Then, this is where we part ways, Franziska von Karma.

von Karma:
... I... I... I am Franziska von Karma. Don't think I'm going to walk in your shadow forever... Our battle... begins now... so you had better prepare yourself, Miles Edgeworth!

Phoenix Wright... One day... Someday... I'm sure we'll meet again in battle. Until then... This last piece of evidence that never made it to you... I'll take good care of this fourth piece... So I can give it to you... when at last we meet again...

Pearl:
Good morning! ...Oh? Are you by yourself?

Phoenix:
Ah... Morning, Pearls.

Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick! Please tell me! What's going to happen to Mystic Maya?

Phoenix:
I'm sorry... We don't know yet. The investigation is still going on, so I wasn't allowed into the Inner Temple.

Pearl:
Oh, I see... So is Sister Iris still trying to remove those trick locks in the Training Hall?

Phoenix:
No... She's the defendant in this case, so she can't be at the Inner Temple. She's required to be here in court.

Pearl:
Um... Then... How come she's not here in the defendant's lobby?

Phoenix:
(I have to admit it's kinda strange...)

???:
...If you're looking for Iris, she's in the prosecutor's lobby.

Phoenix:
...Ed-Edgeworth. What's Iris doing over there?

Edgeworth:
She's going over today's testimony with the prosecutor as we speak.

Phoenix:
Today's testimony...?

Edgeworth:
You heard me... Iris is going to be testifying as a witness for the prosecution.

Phoenix:
Wait, what!?

Edgeworth:
The prosecutor is squeezing her for a confession. ...Or so I heard.

Phoenix:
(Franziska von Karma... What are you up to...?)

Edgeworth:
I know what you're thinking, but Franziska isn't going to be the prosecutor today.

Phoenix:
What...!? Then who is?

Edgeworth:
Who else would it be but Godot?

Phoenix:
G-Godot...

Edgeworth:
...Franziska is engaged in some important work at the Sacred Cavern.

Pearl:
The Sacred Cavern...? You don't mean that she's...

Edgeworth:
Exactly. She has been out there all night, trying to remove those trick locks. With the head nun's assistance, naturally. We estimate that the last of the locks should be taken care of in about three hours. I hope everything continues to go smoothly and we receive some good news soon.

Phoenix:
Yeah... Thanks, Edgeworth.

Edgeworth:
Prosecutor Godot intends to nail this case shut today. Be prepared to fight like there's no tomorrow!

Phoenix:
...You don't have to tell me that.

Edgeworth:
I know. I can already see it in your eyes. You're not the same fever-ridden, frantic maniac you were yesterday.

Phoenix:
It's strange... On the way here, I decided that today would be the end of all this. Almost immediately after I made that decision, I felt myself getting stronger.

Edgeworth:
Interesting... Maybe you've passed your cold onto someone else, literally. And with that... I leave the rest in your capable hands... partner.

Phoenix:
Thanks...

Phoenix:
(...I still don't have answers for most of the riddles plaguing this case. The circumstances around the murder of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, no, I mean Ms. Misty Fey... The impossible flight Larry claims to have seen... And... What that woman is really after...) I will solve them all and bring this whole tragedy to an end!

February 10, 10:00 AM
District Court
Courtroom No. 7

Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Iris of Hazakura Temple.

Godot:
...

Phoenix:
... Umm... Your Honor...? Wh-What are you...?

Judge:
Who? Me? Well, my little brother came to visit me in my chambers earlier this morning. All of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, he developed a scorching fever and fainted! Therefore, I'll be standing in for him.

Phoenix:
I-I see, Your Honor... (So they're brothers! That explains a lot...)

Judge:
My poor brother. He looked a bit pale, not to mention sad that he couldn't be here.

Godot:
It is impossible to predict what the future has in store for any of us. This is precisely why people feel the need to judge the past. And we of the court have been charged with the solemn duty of passing such judgment.

Judge:
...Well said, Mr. Godot. I understood exactly what you said... at least up until the end, anyway. Now then, Mr. Godot. Please proceed with your opening statement.

Godot:
...Humans are fragile, fickle beings. Our hearts change with the shifting of the tides. There is only one thing that remains a constant in this crazy world... The bitter darkness that lies at the bottom of this mug.

Judge:
So then you mean...? Um... Forget it. What do you mean?

Godot:
During yesterday's trial, the accused refused to admit her role in the crime. But today, she has had a change of heart... Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple has a confession to make.

Judge:
C-Confession...! Th-The defendant...?

Phoenix:
(Iris... Why didn't she discuss this with me first...?)

Judge:
Very well. This court will now hear the defendant's confession!

Godot:
...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.

Iris:
...Um, my name is Iris. I am but a simple nun undergoing training at Hazakura Temple.

Judge:
Witness, is there something that you want to confess to?

Iris:
...Yes. But first, I want to apologize to Mr. Wright... I... I can't continue lying to everyone anymore.

Phoenix:
I-It's alright... What is it...?

Iris:
Mr. Wright, I have to admit that I... I did play a part in this terrible incident.

Judge:
Are... Are you actually confessing!? Are you saying that you were the one who murdered Ms. Elise Deauxnim?

Iris:
...No, I'm not, Your Honor. But I dealt with the cover up, after the murder took place. After her spirit left, I took the lifeless shell of Mystic Elise... ...and carried it to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard where I desecrated it.

Judge:
Wh... Whaaaat!? O-Order in the court! Order! W-Witness...! Are you... Are you saying you were an accomplice to the murder!?

Iris:
... Yes. That's correct.

Phoenix:
...Whaaaaaaat!? (Three minutes in court and I'm already covered in a cold sweat...)

Godot:
Ha...! Everyone on the planet is an accomplice to something. It just happens to be that in this case, it's to murder. Isn't that right... Mr. Trite?

Phoenix:
(Grrr, that Godot... So this is the confession they were conferring about! It pains me to say this... ...but it looks like Iris's testimony was all a lie.)

Iris's Testimony crumpled up and shoved into a pocket.

Godot:
Now then, little lady. If you don't mind, I've got a question for you. Whose crime were you trying to cover up by your actions?

Phoenix:
(Iris was covering for someone...? Nngh... Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a lifejacket.)

Iris:
...I've been at Hazakura Temple ever since I was a little girl. Hazakura Temple is run by one of the branch families of the Kurain Tradition. One of our missions is to protect the main family.

Judge:
I'm sorry, but "main family"...?

Iris:
Yes, and that's why I would dirty myself, if need be, to protect her... The daughter of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Maya Fey!

Phoenix:
Huh...?

Godot:
Wake up and smell the coffee, Trite.

Phoenix:
Sh-She's naming... MAYAAAAAAAAA!?

Judge:
Order! Order in the court! So not only did you witness the murder... You know the name of the murderer!

Iris:
I'm terribly sorry... But it's true. I saw her commit the crime with my very own eyes... And then I cleaned up the area to try to protect her.

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Th-That's ridiculous! Maya could never do such a--

Judge:
The defense will refrain from commenting until the appropriate time. Now, witness. Let's hear your testimony. What exactly happened on the night of the crime?

Iris:
... ...Yes, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
(I thought I was prepared for the unexpected... But I never imagined the case would wind up going in this direction...)

Witness Testimony
-- The Real Murderer --
Iris:
I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.
I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!
While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!
Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...!
It was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!
Judge:
So it was in self-defense?

Iris:
Yes. Mystic Elise was the one who attacked first!

Judge:
Hmm...

Iris:
That's why I tried my best to protect Mystic Maya!

Godot:
You moved the victim's body to the temple so that Maya wouldn't be suspected... Isn't that right? Not bad... You've got the instincts of a true criminal.

Phoenix:
(Something's not quite right. I'm sure it was established yesterday... ...that Iris never went to the Inner Temple that night. And that the person who did go was... that woman... ...Iris even admitted it.)

Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please proceed with your cross-examination.

First I need to pick her testimony apart and expose the unnatural-sounding parts... I don't know why Iris would tell a story like this... ...but there are two things I noticed that just don't add up!)

Phoenix:
Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events.

Iris:
Huh...?

Phoenix:
Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me.

Iris:
B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone...

Phoenix:
Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword.

Iris:
Ah...!

Phoenix:
If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! ...Well, Sister Iris? What do you have to say?

Iris:
Uhh, err, I...

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this?

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade.

Phoenix:
Um, well...

Godot:
Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony.

Phoenix:
(But there is something strange about this whole testimony!)

Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point.

Phoenix:
...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument.

M-Mr. Wright...!

I have here another piece of evidence that shows that this testimony can't be trusted. Because Ms. Elise Deauxnim would never attempt to take the life of Maya Fey!

Judge:
..."Fey"?

Iris:
Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey!

Judge:
Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...?

Phoenix:
Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey!

Judge:
A-Are you serious!?

Iris:
Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!?

Phoenix:
There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...)

Iris:
I can hardly believe it...

Phoenix:
The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing!

Godot:
...Ugh...!

Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Upon first hearing the witness's testimony, it seemed natural enough. ...However. In light of some facts that have just been presented...

Iris:
...

Judge:
One, that the victim supposedly threw away a sword during a fight... ...and two, that the two people battling to the death were mother and daughter... Despite the facts being believable when taken on their own... ...when taken together, the entire story seems difficult to believe.

Godot:
...Listen. There's nothing in this world that is impossible. Except for one little thing.

Judge:
Yes? What is this one little impossible thing...?

Godot:
Ha...! You still don't get it. You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.

Phoenix:
Umm... Could you get to your point?

Godot:
I heard this witness's confession this morning... ...just as I had taken the first sip of my eighth cup of morning coffee.

Judge:
...You're going to ruin your health, my friend.

Godot:
Anyway, after hearing this woman's confession... I had a detective who loves to investigate sent to the scene of the crime. And... he discovered this little beauty.

Judge:
Is that the dagger the witness testified to seeing...?

Godot:
Obviously, Your Honor... But do you not notice something else?

Judge:
...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be a bloodstain!

Phoenix:
Wh-Where did you find that? I didn't see that when I investigated the crime scene!

Godot:
...Did you investigate the pine tree at the crime scene?

Phoenix:
Huh? The pine tree...?

Godot:
This dagger was stuck in the back side of the pine tree. When the last blow was struck, ending the violent battle between the two women... ...this little baby was thrown in the direction of the back of the pine tree.

Judge:
Which means... the blood on this dagger belongs to the victim, correct!?

Godot:
Ha...! Were you even listening, old man? I first heard this confession this morning. Just as I had taken the first sip of my 13th cup of morning coffee.

Phoenix:
(Didn't you say it was your 8th just a few minutes ago!?)

Godot:
I didn't have enough time to get the blood analyzed on such short notice.

Judge:
In any case, the court will accept the dagger as evidence. Furthermore, I order that a blood test be performed on it immediately!

Godot:
This is my sweetheart. Make sure you treat her right.

Judge:
...Bailiff! Get this piece of evidence to the crime lab for testing immediately!

Dagger added to the Court Record.

Judge:
Now then... The testimony we've just heard had numerous unbelievable aspects to it. However! After having found the very dagger the witness spoke of... ...I believe we can consider her testimony to be credible.

Godot:
Cute girls never lie. Ever.

Judge:
In any case, witness... If you could please testify again to this court.

Iris:
Umm... About what, Your Honor?

Judge:
About the incident you saw... The battle between the two women!

Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.

Witness Testimony
-- The Battle --
Iris:
Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...
But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!
Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.
That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!
Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.
Judge:
...That was a very heart-breaking story.

Iris:
I don't know if there were any bad feelings between them, but... It had been 17 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. ...Perhaps they simply didn't recognize each other anymore...

Judge:
Hmm... That seems reasonable. Now then, Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.

Huh...?

Until now, I didn't think you were the type to make such a careless mistake. However! The testimony you just gave contains quite a few contradictions.

According to you... ...Maya Fey stabbed the victim, who had her back to the stone lantern... Correct?

Y-Yes... That's right.

Phoenix:
But in that case, the victim would've been stabbed in the stomach, right?

Judge:
Y-Yes, I think so...

Phoenix:
But! According to the autopsy report... ...the cause of death was due to blood loss from a stab wound in her back.

Iris:
Ah...!

Phoenix:
This proves that the victim was stabbed from behind, not from the front! Sister Iris! It appears another seed of doubt has sprouted from your testimony!

Iris:
Aaaaaaaah!

Judge:
What...!? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?

Godot:
Ha...! It's simple. People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?

Judge:
... Umm, is that all you have to say?

Godot:
I can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Could you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!? The point is, too much of this testimony just doesn't make sense! Throwing away a useful staff, the people fighting being mother and daughter... And now, she falsely claims the victim was stabbed in the stomach!

Judge:
Hmm... There certainly are some inconsistencies.

Phoenix:
Well, Iris... How about it!?

Iris:
... W-Well, it's just...

Godot:
If you ask me, you're just being too naÃ¯ve about the whole thing.

Phoenix:
What do you mean...?

Godot:
There are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses. Were you really concentrating on what this witness actually said?

Judge:
Prosecutor Godot! Explain yourself!

Godot:
The witness was quite unambigious [sic] about her own ambiguities when she said... ...that the garden was dark and she couldn't see clearly.

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
A human needs one thing to see clearly. And that is... light.

Judge:
Light...

Godot:
By the way, did you know? The Inner Temple has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is there training... ...the stone lantern in the garden is to always be lit.

Phoenix:
(Hmm... I did wonder what that stone lantern was there for...)

Judge:
Well if that's true... ...shouldn't the witness have been able to see the crime more clearly?

Godot:
...Normally yes, Your Honor. But according to the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...on the night of the crime, it was impossible to light that stone lantern.

Phoenix:
Impossible...?

Godot:
It hadn't been used in a long time and the wick was no good. In other words... It had to be nearly pitch black in the garden that night. There could have been a faint light coming from the Training Hall, but that's all.

Judge:
Most enlightening...

Godot:
Yes, that illuminating fact has chased all the contradictions away! ...If the staff was dropped, it would be difficult to see. It also explains why they didn't recognize each other. We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak. Isn't that right, Trite?

Phoenix:
N-- Nooooooooooooooo!

Judge:
Order! Order! Ordeeer!

Godot:
Here, Your Honor. Let me present the stone lantern into evidence. Maybe it will rekindle the flame of truth in your mind.

Stone Lantern added to the Court Record.

Judge:
............

Phoenix:
(Why is the judge just sitting there with that look on his face...?)

Godot:
...What's wrong, Your Honor? Was that flame too hot?

Judge:
Th-This lantern... There's something written on it!

Godot:
...?

Judge:
Wh-Why... It's written in blood!

Phoenix:
(Oooh boy...! So the judge didn't know about that yet...)

Godot:
Written... in blood?

Iris:
...

Judge:
It... It says...! It says, "Maya" upside-down!

Godot:
Wh-What the...!?

Iris:
Oh yes... That's right... After being cornered and then stabbed by Mystic Maya... Mystic Elise didn't fall down right away. She must have been writing that on the stone lantern behind her... ...with the blood that was draining out of her body!

Judge:
Hmm... It certainly looks that way...

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Hang on... Hang on just a minute! What are you all talking about!?

Judge:
What do you mean, "What are we all talking about?"

Phoenix:
We're talking about the message written in blood...

Godot:
Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!

Phoenix:
(C-Could it be...? He can't see the bloody writing at all...!? Now that I think of it, he did say something to me yesterday...)

Godot:
My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.

Phoenix:
(So that's what he meant by that...)

Judge:
...In any case, this is obviously an important clue. We now know that the crime scene was dark... ...and that the victim scrawled this message on the stone lantern! Well, Mr. Godot? Anything further?

Godot:
...

Judge:
M-Mr. Godot?

Godot:
...! Errr, umm... OK then... Let's move on.

Phoenix:
(Godot is literally shaking, and somehow, I don't think it's from caffeine overdose.)

Judge:
...I believe it has now been established... ...that Ms. Deauxnim was killed by Maya Fey.

Phoenix:
(Th-That's... just wrong!)

Godot:
...Now it's time to turn our attention to you.

Iris:
...Yes, sir.

Godot:
After the victim died, you did something, didn't you? Let's hear it. ...We're all ears.

Witness Testimony
-- Sister Iris's Cover-Up --
Iris:
After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.
I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.
So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...
I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.
Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...
...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.
Judge:
...So you moved the body.

Iris:
Yes... I was raised at Hazakura Temple... I owe a great deal of thanks to the Fey clan. But even so... I never imagined... ...that Elise Deauxnim was actually Misty Fey! I've... I've committed a terrible sin!

Judge:
Hmm... A terrible trick of fate.

Phoenix:
(I believe you're looking for "twist of fate", Your Honor.)

Iris:
I intended to return to the Inner Temple after taking care of the body... But...

Godot:
You were spotted by the head nun, correct?

Iris:
Yes... And that's why I couldn't go back.

Judge:
...Your story makes sense, I suppose. Mr. Wright, go ahead with your cross-examination.

Phoenix:
...Yes, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
(I don't want to believe it, but I don't think my logic is failing me... ...Iris is trying to pin the murder on Maya! But why would she want to do that...? There's only one reason I can think of...)

Phoenix:
...You claim that the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred. But I'm sorry, Iris. That just isn't possible.

Iris:
What...!?

Phoenix:
This is the weather data from the night of the murder. According to this, the snow didn't stop until 10:50 PM. But you couldn't have crossed Dusky Bridge at that time.

Iris:
W-Why do you say that!?

Phoenix:
Because 5 minutes before the snow stopped... ...Dusky Bridge was struck by lightning and had caught on fire.

Iris:
What did you say!? Th-The bridge... It was on fire...?

Judge:
You don't mean to say... you didn't know about it? It was because of that lightning strike that the bridge burned down!

Iris:
Whaaaaaat!? But it can't... It can't be...!

Phoenix:
It looks like you still haven't figured it out. No matter how hard you try to deceive or conceal the truth... ...you can't pull the wool over the eyes of a real defense attorney!

Iris:
...Nooooooooo!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order!

Phoenix:
The bridge was already on fire when the incident took place. That's right! The Inner Temple was already totally cut off from the outside world! There's no way she could have crossed the bridge, body or no body!

Iris:
Uh... Aaaaaaaah!

Judge:
Witness! Even my patience has its limits. Any further lying and I will find you in contempt of court! Do you have anything to say for yourself!?

Iris:
Ugggh...

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
The only person here that is truly contemptible is you... ...old man!

Judge:
......... Me!? How dare you!?

Godot:
Whether this witness lied or not doesn't mean squat right now.

Phoenix:
S-S-Squat!?

Godot:
The important thing now is to find out the truth. ...Isn't that right?

Judge:
Y-Yes, of course. But...

Godot:
Whether it was snowing, or not snowing, or whether the bridge was burning or not... There are 2 facts that can't be disputed. First, the body of Elise Deauxnim was discovered in the Hazakura Temple Courtyard. And second, the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...witnessed Iris desecrating Elise Deauxnim's body!

Phoenix:
...! (H-He makes a good point... on both accounts.)

Iris:
Th-That's right! I'm not lying!

Judge:
What are you claiming this time!?

Iris:
I wasn't myself at all that night. ...So my memory is still somewhat hazy!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
You have stood at that witness stand and testified this entire time! Are you telling us now that your memory of that night is hazy...?

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
It is only human to err. If you're so perfect, Trite, maybe you can explain this for the court?

Phoenix:
Wh-What is it...?

Godot:
When the murder happened, the bridge had already burnt down. But somehow the body traveled across the bridge and was found in the temple courtyard. Perhaps you have some kind of perfect explanation for this little magic trick?

Phoenix:
Ugh...! Well not exactly, no... (I know there must be some other way she got across that burnt-out bridge. But unless I can somehow demonstrate it... We'll never know the truth!)

Judge:
It looks like the defense is not prepared to offer a suitable explanation...

Godot:
You see what I mean? In other words... You're in no position to suggest that this lady's testimony isn't the truth!

Phoenix:
Aaaaaack!

Judge:
Alright then. Witness, let's hear your testimony once more.

Iris:
About what, Your Honor?

Judge:
You've admitted that you moved the victim's body. Nevertheless, your prior testimony contained a rather large inconsistency. ...Please add an explanation for that to your testimony.

Iris:
Yes, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
(...Will this be her final testimony...!?)

Godot:
...

Witness Testimony
-- Moving the Body --
Iris:
Other than walking over the bridge, there's no way to move the body.
So I... must have just... gotten confused, I guess.
Was the snow still falling or had it stopped...? Does it really matter that much?
Or are you saying that there is a way to cross a burning bridge?
Judge:
Hmm... So it was just a misunderstanding, I see.

Godot:
This is a photo of Dusky Bridge after it burned down from the lightning blast. It was taken on the morning after the incident.

Judge:
It certainly was burned to a crisp... And one of the suspension wires is gone... It's amazing the whole bridge didn't fall. Clearly it would be impossible to carry a corpse across a bridge in this condition.

Dusky Bridge Photo added to the Court Record.

Phoenix:
(Unless I do something to discredit this testimony... ...it's going to be deemed as the truth... ...and Maya will be accused of murder!)

Godot:
Trite. I'm only going to say it one more time.

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
It is only human to err. And... ...only humans can spot the errors of our ways.

Phoenix:
(The more sense he makes, the less sense he makes...)

Alright, Mr. Wright! Please begin your final cross-examination.

Present Larry's Sketch

Phoenix:
(I've come all this way, so I owe it to everyone to figure this out... But how do you transport a body across a burning bridge...? Even if I don't know the exact answer yet, it's OK. I'll start by examining all of my evidence, and see where that takes me... I've gotta be like a shark... If I don't keep moving, I'm as good as dead!)

Judge:
That's a photo of Dusky Bridge, correct?

Phoenix:
Yes. Now, compare the sketch and the photo for a minute. In the sketch, the wires appear to be above the guard wires. But on the actual Dusky Bridge...

Judge:
Jumping Jehosaphat!

Phoenix:
The wires are... below the guard wires!

Godot:
...Bwhaaaat!?

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! This sketch is somewhat different than what's depicted in the photo! However... Isn't it likely that the artist just saw it wrong?

Iris:
Or perhaps he just drew it wrong!

Godot:
Either way, it sounds like you're... just wrong!

Phoenix:
...With someone like Laurice, I admit a mistake is a definite possibility. But then that begs the question... "Why did he make a mistake?" What was the reason?

Godot:
...Are you saying you know the answer to that?

Phoenix:
Listen! Think back, alright? Remember what Laurice was doing when he witnessed this event. ...He was at Heavenly Hall waiting for a lover that was never going to come. He waited and waited, and finally he laid down. ...But then! Lightning shoots from the sky and sets the bridge aflame! Now ponder what sort of position Larry must have been in at the time... He was lying on his back, which is why he remembered the scene the way he did.

Judge:
... He was lying on his back...? I can't see how it relates...

Phoenix:
But it does, Your Honor. That is the reason why the wires in the sketch go up instead of down...

Judge:
Aaaaaah!

Godot:
Ugh... No way...!

Phoenix:
Laurice Deauxnim witnessed the event while he was lying on his back, face up. In other words, the scene that he saw... ...was actually upside-down!

Judge:
So then...! This sketch should actually...

Phoenix:
I think you finally get it, Your Honor. The correct way to view Laurice Deauxnim's sketch is like this! This is how it should actually look! The victim's body wasn't flying above the bridge! It was actually swinging below! ...That's right! Just like a pendulum!

Godot:
Bwwweeeediculous!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order--

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Of all the things to say! A pendulum!?

Phoenix:
...The bridge was burning to a crisp. There was no way to get across it. But if the body had been found at the Inner Temple, it would have caused problems. This is where the criminal decided to take a gamble. They used the burning bridge to get the body across to the other side. And a pendulum was the only way to get it done!

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
...Let's think about this for a minute, shall we? Dusky Bridge is about 20 yards long. Which means it's about that far from the Inner Temple to the opposite cliff.

Phoenix:
...Yes, that sounds right.

Godot:
In order to cover that distance with a pendulum... You'd need a rope at least 10 yards long. To get a rope that long, you have to plan ahead!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
(The lightning strike that night can only have been an accident. So it doesn't make sense that the criminal would have prepared the rope beforehand. So then, the criminal...) They didn't have to get the rope ready... The rope was already right in front of the criminal.

Godot:
What!?

Phoenix:
I'm saying that it was just a matter of using what was already there.

Judge:
In that case, Mr. Wright, please give us an explanation to support your theory. What makes you think the criminal had the rope on hand to create a pendulum!?

Present Dusky Bridge Photo

Present anything else

Judge:
And the meaning of this is...?

Phoenix:
If you want to know where the rope came from... ...it's hanging right there in front of your glorious beard!

Judge:
Aaaaaaaah! This... This is one of the wires from the bridge!

Phoenix:
When the lightning struck the bridge and set it on fire... ...one of the suspension wires came loose from its anchor. The criminal didn't have any time to waste. So they tied the wire around Elise Deauxnim's body... ...because there was simply no other way to move the body!

Godot:
...... Ha......! *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug*

Judge:
Mr. Godot!? Hmm... It seems that Mr. Godot is more focused on his coffee than answering my question. It seems that the odds of a rope being readily available were very high. So I suppose that it's not an impossibility after all!

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
"Possible" or "impossible"...? That's not the question we need to ask! There's only one question. "Did that really happen?" Trite! I wonder if you can prove what happened to us. Do you have any actual evidence that the body was swung over like a pendulum!?

Present Elise's Autopsy Report or Crystal Sphere

Present anything else

Phoenix:
Before I present my evidence, let me review what we know so far. According to this photo, one of the wires snapped. Looking at the map, we can see it's the one that was in front of the Inner Temple.

Judge:
So then, that was the spot where the criminal...!?

Phoenix:
Yes, precisely. Now let us consider the body's movement by looking at the overhead map again. If the body was pushed from this point here... ...it would drop on the opposite bank at approximately this point.

Judge:
D-Did you say drop?

Phoenix:
Well, they must have failed to catch the body on the other bank.

Iris:
What...!? What makes you think something like that happened!?

Phoenix:
Because I have evidence that suggests her body dropped some distance.

Iris:
Wh-What kind of evidence!?

Phoenix:
...Take a look at this autopsy report. It says here that her body fell about 10 feet after her death.

Judge:
Ten feet, huh...

Phoenix:
That's most likely the height difference between the two sides. The body over swung due to forward momentum but then came loose and fell about 10 feet. And then, as a result of the landing impact... ...this crystal sphere was knocked loose!

Iris:
...! That's...

Phoenix:
Yes, this blood-stained amethyst crystal... It's the one that came off of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff! And even more important is the place where this crystal sphere was found!

Judge:
In-Indeed... I believe it's already marked on this overhead map. The crystal was found... Aaaaaah!

Phoenix:
...Precisely, Your Honor. In the very spot where the pendulum would arrive if given the right amount of speed!

Judge:
This explains your theory quite well, Mr. Wright. You have provided us with a way the body could have been moved that night... An impressive deduction, Mr. Wright. ...Most impressive. M-Mr. Wright!

Godot:
I thought this cold coffee might help cool you down.

Judge:
Wh... What is the meaning of this, Mr. Godot!?

Godot:
That was a dark and bitter guess that you made, Trite. ...But you forgot about one thing.

Judge:
Oh? And what would that be?

Godot:
... The aroma.

Phoenix:
...Huh?

Godot:
A coffee's most reliable accomplice is its deep and profound aroma...

Phoenix:
Um... The rest of the court doesn't speak Coffeenese. Can you elaborate a bit more?

Godot:
If the criminal had sent the body to the other side like you say... ...then naturally, there must have been an accomplice laying in wait to catch it.

Judge:
An accomplice...!?

Godot:
...The criminal wasn't able to cross Dusky Bridge. So, who collected the body...? What do you have to say about that, Trite!?

Phoenix:
...!

Judge:
Mr. Godot is correct... This can't be the work of a single person! Well, Mr. Wright!? You know what you must do.

Phoenix:
...Yes, Your Honor. (The body couldn't have made it to Hazakura Temple without an accomplice!)

Judge:
...Very well then! If you please, Mr. Wright. Who was the person that received the body on the Hazakura Temple side?

Phoenix:
It can only be you... Sister Iris.

Huh...? Aaaaaaah! But I... I...

Phoenix:
...I don't see why you're so surprised. The only way to transport the body from Dusky Bridge is by snowmobile. But with her bad back, Sister Bikini could never pick up a body like that. ...You're the only one that could have managed it.

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Trite. Were you even listening to the witness's testimony...? On the night of the crime, this little cutie pie... ...was on clean-up duty in the Inner Temple Garden after the mother-daughter bloodbath.

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
I haven't forgotten. But have you, Mr. Godot? This witness was also seen at Hazakura Temple... ...desecrating the corpse of the victim.

Judge:
Hmm... Strange indeed... It's almost as if... ...on that night, the defendant was in two different places at the same time!

Phoenix:
...Sister Iris. Let me ask you something... Why didn't you mention it when you first gave your testimony?

Iris:
M-Mention what?

Phoenix:
The pendulum, of course. Using this sketch drawn by an eyewitness... I have established how the body was moved using the burnt-out bridge. Which means it's now a fact that this occurred, something you should've already known.

Iris:
N-No...! I... I had no idea! I-I didn't know anything about a pendulum!

Phoenix:
But the body couldn't have been passed along to the other side without your help! So you should have known about it! In fact, it'd be impossible for you to be clueless about this whole thing... ...unless you're not really Iris to begin with.

Iris:
What...!? H-How can you say that, Mr. Wright...?

Judge:
What...!? What kind of nonsense is this? You... You're saying this witness isn't Iris of Hazakura Temple...?

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
A-Are you serious, Trite...!? You... You mean... Th-This woman is...

Phoenix:
(There's no one besides Iris that could have received the corpse that night! Now I get it... Now I know why I've been sick to my stomach during this trial. Why her whole demeanor changed so suddenly from yesterday... ...and why she's trying to pin this murder on Maya...) The woman that's standing there at the witness stand... Her real name is...!

Sister Iris had a twin sister. ...And you're looking at her. Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.

Judge:
...... That name rings some bells. Distant bells, but bells nonetheless...

Godot:
Ha...! It's just your imagination, gramps. This file contains all the relevant data about Dahlia Hawthorne.

Judge:
... Oh yes, I remember now... That case... 5 years ago...

Dahlia:
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.

Payne:
The honor is all mine!

Judge:
No... The honor is all mine.

Judge:
B-But... According to this... Dahlia Hawthorne... ...is already dead! ...It says her execution was carried out last month!

Godot:
... So what? Death has no meaning in this courtroom!

Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!? Order! Order! Order!

Iris:
W-Wait a moment! How can you...? My sister...! She's already dead! Wh-What kind of...?

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
...You of all people should already understand. After all... The blood of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique flows within that body.

Judge:
The Kurain Channeling Technique...? Now where have I heard that...

Phoenix:
...That's right. You're not Dahlia Hawthorne herself. You're the spirit of Dahlia, currently inhabiting the body of a spirit medium!

Godot:
What an exciting story. Exciting, but quite impossible. You're asking us to buy that Dahlia Hawthorne just happened to be channeled by someone... ...on the very night of the murder, to a temple where her twin sister, Iris was...?

Phoenix:
Well, if you're going to put things that way, then... Yes.

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
We're supposed to believe a coincidence like that just happens!?

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Naturally it was no coincidence. The whole thing was part of a plan from the very beginning. It's all written right here in these instructions...!

Iris:
Ah...! Wh-What's that...!?

Phoenix:
These instructions were written by your mother, Morgan Fey! And part of the plan called for Dahlia Hawthorne to be channeled! That night... ...there were two Irises at Hazakura Temple.

Godot:
...T-Two of them?

Phoenix:
Even the time of the channeling was planned out. "As soon as you hear the lights out bell"... In other words, 10:00 PM. However, Iris was seen before dinnertime.

Judge:
That means the Iris that was at dinner was the real Iris.

Phoenix:
And the Iris who gave me this hood in the Main Hall was also the real Iris. Meaning that the Iris Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple... ...was someone else dressed as her! Namely, one Dahlia Hawthorne!

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Do you even know what you're saying, Trite? This whole "channeling the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne" business... Yes, it's true that you found plans that talk about it. ...However! There's one thing that's perfectly clear. The witness currently standing in the witness stand is the real Iris!

Phoenix:
Whaaaaat!?

Godot:
Calm down and remember what you know about the night of the crime. After meeting Sister Bikini, the Dahlia Hawthorne that had been channeled... ...would've been stranded at the Inner Temple due to the lightning strike. It was later that the body was moved by pendulum.

Phoenix:
...That's right.

Godot:
Naturally that would mean that the Iris that received the body was... ...the real Iris. Are you with me so far?

Phoenix:
...Yes.

Godot:
After being notified of what happened, the police came to Hazakura Temple's Main Hall. There they found Iris in her room and arrested her. And ever since, she's been under police supervision at the detention center.

Phoenix:
Y-Yes, I suppose... (I can't deny any of that...)

Iris:
Whew... Thank goodness. It looks like he's finally convinced...

Phoenix:
(But something still seems off... Way off...!) I'm still not convinced that the Iris here is the same one from the other night.

Godot:
Ha...! I suppose you're about to say something really ridiculous? Like, the real Iris and the spirit of Dahlia... ...somehow switched places?

Judge:
S-Switched places...!? To be perfectly honest... ...there are still quite a few things I don't understand, but I do know... ...that unless we confirm the witness's identity, we can't continue with this trial.

Phoenix:
(Iris doesn't have the spiritual power needed to channel Dahlia. Which means... ...they must have switched places somewhere.)

Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Since the time she was arrested at Hazakura Temple... ...have there been any chances for Iris to switch places with Dahlia Hawthorne?

Not a chance

There was one...

Phoenix:
...Your Honor! I think there might have been one chance.

Judge:
Oh? Explain yourself...

Phoenix:
Yesterday for a few minutes, Iris's whereabouts were unknown.

Godot:
Unknown...? What do you mean?

Phoenix:
What I mean is... There was a span of time in which Iris was able to move about freely, unsupervised.

Judge:
Well, who was it!? Who would give a murder suspect time to move about freely like that!?

Phoenix:
(I'm sorry... I know you didn't mean to... It wasn't your fault...) The person who gave Iris the chance to freely move about was...

E-Earthquake! Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might...

Edgeworth:
H-How could I have...? She fled... She escaped!

Phoenix:
We went to the Inner Temple right away. And it's true, Iris was already there. However... ...they had already switched places by that point in time. When I arrived at the Training Hall, I was met by none other than Dahlia Hawthorne!

Judge:
Th-That's quite enough already, Mr. Wright! Now see here! No judge in his right mind would consider the idea of "spirit channeling" and...

...Be quiet. It's been a long time... Mr. Judge.

Judge:

Dahlia:
Dahlia Hawthorne. And my current profession? Permanently retired.

Phoenix:
...

Godot:
Ha...! So you're not going to bother hiding your identity anymore, huh?

Dahlia:
...Why should I? After all, I'm dead. There's really nothing you can do to punish me!

Judge:
Wh-What is going on here...?

Phoenix:
(Dahlia Hawthorne... I never thought we'd meet again. And I never thought we'd meet like this... But this time, I'll end it! For her, and for myself...)

To be continued.
February 10, 1:06 PM
District Court
Courtroom No. 7

Judge:
...Now then, let's continue where we left off, shall we? Well, witness?

Dahlia:
Yes? How can I help you? ...Mr. Judge.

Judge:
Well... It seems that if we're to learn the truth... ...we'll need to hear your testimony.

Dahlia:
... I have no problem with that. But when you've seen what I have, sometimes the truth is better left unknown.

Phoenix:
...

Judge:
...In any case, let's hear your testimony! Tell us about the plan that was carried out that night!

Witness Testimony
-- The Plan --
Dahlia:
...The whole plan began with my death.
A stupid plan hatched by Morgan Fey to install her own daughter as the next Master.
But for it to work... Maya Fey would first have to die.
The idea was for me to kill Maya and then have the blame pinned on Iris.
The plan went wrong... but it seems to have succeeded anyway.
Judge:
S-So that means... Y-You really are...

Phoenix:
Holdit

Phoenix:
Wait a minute! Did you just say the plan was to kill Maya Fey...?

Dahlia:
Yes. You have a problem with that...?

Phoenix:
Don't give us that nonsense! There's no way that--

Godot:
Watch yourself, Trite! If you've got a problem, solve it during cross-examination! ...That's my rule.

Judge:
Mr. Godot is correct! And by the way... that's my rule as well!

Phoenix:
(To kill Maya...? Could it be true!?)

Present Mia Fey profile

Phoenix:
(I can't believe it! She meant to kill Maya... I've got to keep a cool head! And... I need to get more information out of her. It's the only way to understand this plan, and what she was after as well!)

Phoenix:
Could it be... ...that your actual goal had nothing to do with Maya Fey herself...?

Dahlia:
...As I said, none of you have the power to punish me anymore. Because I'm already dead. Well, I had the same problem, you see. You can't punish the dead... and you can't take revenge against them either.

Judge:
Y-You wanted to take revenge on someone?

Dahlia:
I was sentenced to die because of that woman... Mia Fey.

Phoenix:
(I somehow knew this was it...)

Dahlia:
...I wanted to send her a message. It was at her hands that I suffered my first humiliation... I wanted her to feel the same pain she made me feel! Sadly... when I realized revenge was impossible, I gave up.

Godot:
And the reason it was impossible...? Was it perhaps because Mia Fey had already died...?

Dahlia:
Yes. And I realized... there's only one way to take revenge against the dead.

Judge:
A-And how do you do that?

Dahlia:
Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my revenge against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!

Phoenix:
Just for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!

Judge:
... As they say, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless.

Dahlia:
...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me.

Phoenix:
Grrrr...!

Dahlia:
That night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple.

Phoenix:
(So... it was Elise Deauxnim who channeled her after all.)

Dahlia:
...That ridiculous head nun never noticed a thing. She left Maya Fey at the Inner Temple... ...and wobbled back clutching her poor old back.

Judge:
Wh-What did you do then...?

Dahlia:
That kid was easier to handle than I had hoped... I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...

Phoenix:
S-So then you... Y-You're saying you s-stabbed Maya!

Dahlia:
............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that.

Judge:
...What does that mean!? No clear memory...?

Dahlia:
I don't know... I think... I think I was stabbed.

Phoenix:
You were stabbed!?

Dahlia:
At the last minute, Maya Fey must have stabbed me. I'm sure of it.

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
That's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!

Dahlia:
Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote "Maya" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her.

Phoenix:
(I-I can't believe she was thinking of that until the bitter end...)

Dahlia:
...That's where my memory temporarily stops.

Judge:
It-It stops...?

Dahlia:
I don't have any memory of actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands. My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the Sacred Cavern surrounded by darkness.

Judge:
You were in the Sacred Cavern?

Dahlia:
...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there.

Godot:
But how did you wind up in there?

Dahlia:
...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself.

Godot:
Hmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie...

Dahlia:
I wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out.

Godot:
The trick lock stopped you, huh?

Dahlia:
I didn't know how to remove it.

Judge:
So then you're saying... ...you were actually confined against your will inside this Sacred Cavern...?

Dahlia:
Yes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it.

Phoenix:
Interrupted...?

Dahlia:
It was early in the morning, but someone came into the Training Hall.

Judge:
What!? Who!?

Phoenix:
Could it have been... Maya!?

Dahlia:
I thought the same thing. But I couldn't see.

Phoenix:
Why not!?

Dahlia:
If someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern.

Phoenix:
(That morning... only two people could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy.)

Dahlia:
Still, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late.

Godot:
What do you mean by that?

Dahlia:
...The flies had already started to gather.

Godot:
The bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?

Dahlia:
Naturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up.

Phoenix:
Lady Luck...?

Dahlia:
After that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself.

Phoenix:
...The real Iris?

Dahlia:
She said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded.

Phoenix:
What do you mean your plan had succeeded?

Dahlia:
I had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey.

Judge:
W-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions.

Dahlia:
But... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... Misty Fey... The picture book author...

Judge:
Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?

Dahlia:
Well, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was her body that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit.

Judge:
And that is...?

Dahlia:
Matricide. The sin of killing her own mother!

Phoenix:
Ugggh... NOOOO WAY!!

Judge:
Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?

Dahlia:
It's true that I was the one who attacked Maya Fey... But even so... ...the murderer who actually snuffed out Misty Fey's life was none other than... ...your darling little Maya!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
R-Ridiculous! That's nonsense...

Dahlia:
Are you sure about that? ...Just think about it. There's even evidence supporting these facts, isn't there?

Phoenix:
What...!? What do you mean? Wh-What is this so-called evidence!?

Dahlia:
...The fact that Maya Fey has disappeared is evidence enough, isn't it?

Phoenix:
Huh...?

Dahlia:
The idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be.

Judge:
Wh-Where...?

Dahlia:
Do I have to spell it out? ...The bottom of the Eagle River, where else?

Godot:
Ea-Eagle River...!?

Dahlia:
Maya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?

Phoenix:
Ooooh... Uuuuuhhhh...

Phone:
.........

Godot:
...Oops. Sorry, that's my phone.

Phoenix:
(What kind of ringtone is that...?)

Phone:

...*beep*...

Godot:
...Godot here. ......... ...OK. Thanks.

Phone:

...*beep*...

Judge:
W-Was it something important?

Godot:
They just finished removing the locks from the Sacred Cavern.

Phoenix:
That's great! What about Maya?

Godot:
... There was a woman in the cave...

Judge:
Was it Maya Fey...?

Godot:
It was the accused... Sister Iris.

Phoenix:
Huh...?

Dahlia:
Don't look so surprised. ...I locked her in there yesterday. I just got finished telling you that.

Phoenix:
So... what about Maya? Where is she?

Godot:
... There was no one else found inside the Sacred Cavern.

Phoenix:
N-No... It can't be...

Dahlia:
I told you, didn't I? She's dead.

Phoenix:
No... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

Judge:
It seems... ...that this case has come to an end... A tragic end... Sadly, it appears the killer of Elise Deauxnim, also known as Misty Fey... ...was her own daughter, Maya Fey. Overcome with guilt for what she had done... ...Maya Fey jumped to her death into the raging waters of the Eagle River!

Phoenix:
(It can't be...)

...Ha!...

Godot:
Trite... Have you ever heard this one? "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth." ...No matter how improbable it may seem.

Judge:
Wh... What is that supposed to mean, Prosecutor Godot...?

Godot:
According to this witness... ...Maya Fey threw herself into the Eagle River. However... is that really the truth?

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
Remember, this woman testified earlier that... ...the bridge was already on fire when the murder was taking place in the garden. Which means if Maya had thrown herself into the river... ...it must have been from the Inner Temple side, near the bridge.

Dahlia:
That's right! That's where she jumped from...

Godot:
But that's impossible. It's impossible to jump into the river from there!

Phoenix:
...! (Wh-What...!?)

Godot:
Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite. Just relax and think through the whole thing again.

Phoenix:
(So it's impossible...? Maya couldn't have thrown herself into Eagle River...?)

Judge:
...Well, Mr. Wright? Ms. Hawthorne claims Ms. Fey threw herself into the river from the Inner Temple side. Do you have any evidence that refutes this claim?

Present Hazakura Temple Map or Dusky Bridge Photo

Present anything else

Phoenix:
It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side... No one knows that better than this witness!

Dahlia:
What did you say...?

Phoenix:
Eleven years ago, you jumped into the very same river!

Dahlia:
...!

Phoenix:
Just take a look at this overhead map! As you can see... ...below the cliff on the Inner Temple side is a big rock shelf!

Judge:
Oh... Ooooh! Y-You're right!

Phoenix:
She wouldn't have reached the river if she had jumped off from there. In other words... If she had jumped, we should be able to see her body in this photo!

Dahlia:
Ah!

Godot:
Ha...! So you finally figured it out!

Dahlia:
You...! Nooooooooo!

Judge:
O-Order! Order!!

Dahlia:
You... You're just playing with me! Maya Fey's body is at the bottom of the Eagle River! There's nowhere else she could possibly be hiding!

Phoenix:
Ms. Hawthorne... Have you ever heard this one before? "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth."

Dahlia:
Yes, just a few minutes ago.

Phoenix:
...Maya Fey wasn't inside the Sacred Cavern. We now know that she didn't throw herself into the Eagle River.

Godot:
...Correct. That eliminates all the most likely possibilities.

Phoenix:
Now, although it seems improbable, there's still one other place she could be.

Judge:
Wh... What...!? What is this one possibility you are talking about...?

Dahlia:
Th-That's obviously a bluff! So where is her dead body then?

Phoenix:
(Finally... I think the pieces are falling into place... Normally the living have no way to punish the dead... But I think there is a way to give Dahlia Hawthorne the ultimate punishment.) ...Shall I tell you, Ms. Hawthorne? Shall I tell you where Maya is this very instant!? Maya Fey is...

in the Inner Temple.

in Hazakura Temple.

in this very courtroom.

Phoenix:
There's only one possibility left. Namely... she's right here in this very courtroom!

Dahlia:
Wh-What!?

Godot:
M-Maya Fey is here!?

Judge:
You say she's here in m-my courtroom!?

Phoenix:
...Dahlia Hawthorne. I seem to recall that you said... "I had misunderstood one thing, you see."

Dahlia:
So what!?

Phoenix:
But I think there's one more thing you misunderstood.

Dahlia:
What do you mean...?

Phoenix:
Tell me something. At this very moment... ...who is channeling Dahlia Hawthorne!?

Dahlia:
Wh-Why that... that's obvious! It's Pearl Fey! That pathetic, little, sniveling runt!

Phoenix:
...You're wrong. Pearls tried... but she couldn't do it.

Pearl:
I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened.

Phoenix:
Isn't there any explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit?

Pearl:
... It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit.

Dahlia:
Someone called me before Pearl did...? But who...?

Phoenix:
Pearls even tried again on the day after the crime. But she couldn't do it... What could that mean? I think the truth is becoming clearer to you right about now, am I correct?

Dahlia:
... Aaaah!

Phoenix:
It wasn't Pearls that channeled you! There was someone who called you before she could!

Present Maya Fey profile

Present anyone else

Phoenix:
...This is an easy one. Pearls couldn't do it, and Misty Fey is gone. There's only one possibility left!

Judge:
Come on already...! I can't stand the tension!

Phoenix:
Dahlia Hawthorne! The person channeling you right now must be... Maya Fey!

Dahlia:
Wh... WHAAAAAAAT!?

Judge:
B-But how could that be!? Remember what this witness, Dahlia Hawthorne, said about her goal!

Godot:
She said that her goal was to kill Maya Fey.

Judge:
Yes, that's right. But if Maya channeled the spirit of someone that was trying to kill her...! ...

Godot:
Ha...! Well, gramps? What would happen?

Judge:
... C-Could it be...?

Phoenix:
It looks like you finally understand, Your Honor.

Dahlia:
W-Well, I don't! What are you going on about!?

Phoenix:
What I'm going on about is the reason Maya channeled you... And there's only one reason. To protect herself from you!

Dahlia:
To... protect herself... ...from me?

Phoenix:
Yes. On the night of the crime, you were only interested in one thing.

Killing Maya Fey!

Phoenix:
The path to the Inner Temple was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run. So then the problem became... "Where would be the safest place to hide?"

Dahlia:
Ah... Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You mean... That's when she channeled me...?

Phoenix:
All along you thought you had been channeled by Pearls... That's why it never occurred to you... ...that Maya's hiding place... ...was you!

Dahlia:
N-No... No... DON'T SAY THAT! Y-You're saying that I... ...was played for a fool!? By that little whelp!?

Phoenix:
...

Dahlia:
Maya Fey killed herself! Isn't it obvious!?

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Sorry, but no... It would have been impossible for her to jump into the Eagle River. ...This was the only avenue of escape open to Maya. The only way that Maya could disappear from the Inner Temple...!

Dahlia:
I-I don't believe you...! A stupid little girl like that who has never been out in the real world... She could never have come up with a plan like that! Who could have ever given her such a brilliant idea!?

Phoenix:
... Well...

???:

...Me, of course...

Phoenix:
M... Mia!

Dahlia:
Mia Fey!

Mia:
It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne...

Godot:
... ...So it's true... It was you.

Mia:
...Yes.

Godot:
Ha...! You're something else...

Dahlia:
B-But what... what are you doing here...!?

Phoenix:
That hair... It's Pearls, right?

Mia:
Tell me something, Dahlia... I want you to think back to that night one more time. You had just cornered Maya in the Inner Temple's garden. And then... in the final moments of the fight, you lost consciousness.

Dahlia:
I was stabbed! By Maya Fey!

Mia:
Actually... Maya lost consciousness at the same time as you.

Godot:
...She did?

Judge:
Not terribly surprising since she was about to be killed.

Mia:
...When she woke up, she was in the Training Hall. That's when Maya decided she needed help... So she channeled me. She explained in a memo the situation she was in. She asked me what I thought she should do.

Dahlia:
She did that...? I can't believe it...

Mia:
Of course, I didn't have all the details. But... One thing was perfectly clear.

Judge:
And that was...?

Mia:
I knew that you couldn't be allowed to wander free.

Phoenix:
Free...? What do you mean?

Mia:
It was a race against time, so I wrote down two things that Maya had to do. Channel Dahlia Hawthorne as soon as possible... ...and lock herself in the Sacred Cavern until help arrived.

Phoenix:
(So it was Maya who put that lock on there...)

Judge:
Yes, but why did you order her to do those two things?

Mia:
If she hadn't done it... ...Dahlia Hawthorne would've been channeled by someone else. By one Pearl Fey.

Phoenix:
P-Pearls?

Mia:
Yes. Pearl didn't properly understand the plan. So all she was trying to do was follow her mother, Morgan Fey's instructions. If she had succeeded in channeling Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit... ...things would have turned out very badly, to put it mildly.

Godot:
......... ...So that's how it was. Dahlia Hawthorne would have used the body of Pearl Fey... ...to kill Maya at all costs.

Judge:
Y-Yes, it certainly sounds like that was the intent all along.

Dahlia:
H-How dare you!? I-I won't forget this...!

Phoenix:
Why not just admit it? ...Dahlia Hawthorne. Your little plan was nothing but a big failure.

Mia:
Yes... Another failure to add to the pile of shame, wouldn't you say?

Dahlia:
Wh-What do you mean by another!?

Phoenix:
Think about it, Dahlia. Remember all your past crimes? Not a single one of them was a success. They all ended in failure.

Dahlia:
What...!? How dare you...!

Phoenix:
11 years ago... The fake kidnapping... Your very first crime. You got your hands on a 2 million dollar diamond. But... ...after Terry Fawles escaped and went to meet with Valerie Hawthorne... ...the truth was exposed.

Dahlia:
Sh-Shut your mouth! That wasn't my fault! It was because of that stupid oaf of a prisoner and that weakling of a policewoman!

Phoenix:
And then... one year later. You tried to kill me.

Dahlia:
...!

Phoenix:
Well... I'm still alive, but... ...you wound up killing someone else. As a result, you were sentenced to death. ...It's one stupid move after another for you. But it's no longer funny.

Dahlia:
You...! Wipe that smug, happy-go-lucky smile off your face...!

Phoenix:
And now this! You've messed up again! You let Maya Fey escape. Even though she was right there in front of you!

Dahlia:
...Grr...Mmm...Nnnn... Grrr... Ahh! M... M... Mia F... F... Fey Mia Fey! Mia Fey! MIA FEEEEY! You... You... spinster!! I was supposed to kill Maya Fey like I swore I would! And if only you had gotten this spiky-haired jerk the guilty verdict... ...I wouldn't have been hanged to death!

Mia:
...... True.

Dahlia:
...!

Mia:
But I think you finally understand, Dahlia Hawthorne. ...You will never defeat me.

Dahlia:
Wh-What...!? What did you say!?

Mia:
Whether you're alive, dead, or somewhere in between, you will never defeat me. As long as I'm around, you're destined to lose for all of eternity!

Dahlia:
Grrr... Grrrr... Grrrrr...

Phoenix:
...I remember what you said earlier in the trial. You said there was no way we could punish you... ...because you were already dead.

Dahlia:
What about it!?

Phoenix:
Then you said... "Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever."

Mia:
...That's very true, Dahlia. And that's exactly the punishment you'll never be able to escape from.

Dahlia:
...!

Mia:
For all of eternity, you'll have to remain as Dahlia Hawthorne. A miserable, pathetic, weak creature who can never win at anything... And for you, there is no escape from that. No hope of freedom. Since the day you were executed... ...the narrow bridge that once stretched out in front of you has burnt to a crisp!

Dahlia:
...Y-You... OoOooOOh... ...Y-You'RE... wROnG... ...It... CAN'T... be... ...How... coULd... I... ...loSe... to... THe... ...likES... of... YOU...?

Phoenix:
It no longer matters! I don't care whether you win or lose anymore. The only thing I want... ...is for you to come out of Maya's body right now!

Dahlia:
...... ...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ...I'M... NOT... READY... ...NOT... READY... TO... GO...

Maya:
...Nick... ...Sis...

Judge:
Now then... I assume you are the real Iris...?

Iris:
...Yes. I was just rescued from the Sacred Cavern.

Judge:
I must say you and your twin sister are indeed identical from what I can see. In any case... It appears that everything has finally been cleared up. Mr. Godot. ...What happened to Dahlia Hawthorne?

Godot:
If you ask me, Your Honor... ...it looks like she went back to the hell she came from.

Judge:
Hmm... It seems that Misty Fey wasn't the only victim of this crime. Maya Fey, as well as the young Pearl Fey... ...were also victims of this wicked and selfish plan.

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
The tragedy of "Medium Valley" has finally come to an end, it seems. It would be best for everyone if no further attempt was made to channel that spirit again.

Phoenix:
............ Umm... Your Honor?

Judge:
Yes, what is it?

Phoenix:
About this whole "spirit medium" thing... It's almost weird how comfortable you seem to be with the concept now.

Judge:
... Well, to be frank, my younger brother is quite judgmental... He often criticizes me for not studying hard enough. That's why I made a concerted effort to study up on the Kurain Channeling Technique.

Phoenix:
(Hey! Isn't that the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!"!?)

Judge:
...I've seen quite a few things in my many years on the bench. And in all that time, I've finally learned this one thing. Each case is different, and takes place in its own world, if you will. In order to fully understand that world... ...first we have to immerse ourselves in it completely. And that's where... My brother and I used to differ.

Phoenix:
(Hmm, never thought of it that way...)

Judge:
...At any rate! It's time to pass judgment in the case of Iris of Hazakura Temple.

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
...You're a little too fast with that gavel, Your Honor.

Judge:
What do you mean by that, Mr. Godot!?

Mia:
This trial... It isn't over yet. ...That's what he means.

Phoenix:
W-What!?

Godot:
Trite... Remember what Miss Evil Spirit said in her testimony?

Phoenix:
Huh? Dahlia's testimony?

Dahlia:
I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and... ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that. I think... I think I was stabbed.

Mia:
...Just as Dahlia Hawthorne was about to attack Maya... ...she was stabbed and "killed" by someone.

Judge:
Y-Yes... That's right...

Godot:
The person that was ultimately killed was the spirit medium that channeled Dahlia... ...Elise Deauxnim, no, Misty Fey. But... who killed her? We still don't know who did it!

Phoenix:
Th-This isn't over!?

Godot:
Unless someone else is found guilty, the accused is still on trial. We can't let her walk until there is evidence that proves her innocence.

Phoenix:
N-No way...

Judge:
But... This court isn't prepared for any further testimony...

Godot:
The prosecution is ready to call our final witness!

Judge:
F-Final... witness!?

Godot:
This one will clear up the whole mystery... The mystery of "Who killed Misty Fey"!

Judge:
...Hmm, indeed!

Mia:
... Is it really alright... Mr. Prosecutor?

Godot:
... Of course it's alright... Madame Attorney.

Judge:
Very well then... Who is this final witness?

Godot:
Ha...! Isn't it obvious? There's one person who saw the whole event and will put the final dagger in this case.

Judge:
S-Someone who saw the murder take place...?

Godot:
...The very person who saw her mother killed in front of her own eyes.

Phoenix:
Y-You mean... Maya!? ...You can't! She can't testify after what she's just been through!

Godot:
We need to find the truth. The prosecution calls Maya Fey to the witness stand!

Judge:
...Very well. But first, we'll take a brief recess. ...We'll have to wait for Ms. Fey to recover before summoning her. Once we receive the doctor's permission, we will proceed with the trial!

Godot:
...Hey, Trite. I've got something to say to you, so listen up.

Phoenix:
...What is it?

Godot:
I don't think much of you as a lawyer. It's always the same with you. ...You somehow manage to just squeak by without even a faint understanding of the case. Some beautiful woman always seems to come dashing in at the last minute to save you.

Phoenix:
Y-You've got some nerve!

Godot:
...But that's not going to happen this time. This time... you're going to have to do this by yourself.

Phoenix:
...!

Judge:
That's enough! This court is now in recess!

District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 1

Iris:
I'm truly sorry about everything. You were working so hard to defend me... But I was missing all day, and we didn't even have a chance to talk...

Phoenix:
(...She's right. When I met "Iris" at the Training Hall yesterday... ...they had already switched places... and Iris was inside the Sacred Cavern.)

Iris:
...I wanted to at least be in the defendant's box today to root you on.

Phoenix:
W-Well, it wasn't you fault. You were locked up this whole time... There's something more important than that, though. I have to ask you... Why did you help your sister out as much as you did?

Iris:
Huh...?

Phoenix:
If you had tried to get help at the Sacred Cavern yesterday... ...you wouldn't have spent an entire day locked up in there.

Iris:
... My sister... I felt sorry for her. She was abandoned by our mother and never got any love from our father either.

Phoenix:
Yes, but... it was the same for you too, wasn't it?

Iris:
Yes, but at least I had Sister Bikini, who was like a mother to me. If only Dahlia had come with me to Hazakura Temple... I always... I always loved her... Dahlia was always so smart, so strong... She never complained about a thing. That's why I... That's why I promised her that I would help her.

Phoenix:
Are you talking about the fake kidnapping case 11 years ago?

Iris:
...Yes. I-I wanted to be useful to her in some way... B-But, as usual... I was too cowardly... At the last minute, I ran away. Because of that... Dahlia's half-sister, Valerie, ended up...

Phoenix:
(That was the case that wounded Mia so badly...)

Iris:
But... things didn't end there, of course. Some people suspected that my sister was involved in the murder.

Phoenix:
Some people...? You must mean...

Iris:
Yes, two defense lawyers. Mia Fey... and Diego Armando. After poisoning Mr. Armando, who was getting too close to learning the truth... ...Dahlia even tried to kill the person who had unknowingly hid the poison for her. You.

Phoenix:
(...That's right...) ...Iris. There's one more thing that I have to ask you.

Iris:
Yes, what is it?

Phoenix:
On the night of the murder... ...the person that cleaned up the corpse of the victim, Elise Deauxnim... Was it... Was it really you?

Iris:
... Yes... It was me. That night, after I rang the lights out bell... I went back to my room. At around 10:30, I received a call on my cell phone.

Phone:
......... ...*beep*...

"There's a problem... Come to the Inner Temple right away."

Iris:
I... I got on the snowmobile and headed for the Inner Temple. But...!

Phoenix:
The path to the Inner Temple was cut off... Right?

Iris:
Exactly.

Phone:
......... ...*beep*...

"We can't just leave the body here... ...Alright, let's do this as you said..."

Iris:
It was me... I was the one that received her body. The murder weapon had been left in her body so she wouldn't bleed too much. The staff that Mystic Elise always held...

Phoenix:
I knew it... So the actual murder weapon was the staff.

Iris:
...Yes, that's right. I brought the body back to Hazakura Temple on the snowmobile.

Phoenix:
But why... Why did you alter the body?

Iris:
...I didn't want anyone to know that the staff was the murder weapon. I didn't want to leave anything that would lead back to Misty Fey... So I dressed her in a robe and stabbed her with the Shichishito... I wiped the blood off the staff's blade and left it next to her on the ground.

Phoenix:
...Iris. Just tell me one last thing. Tell me the name of the person that called your cell phone. The real killer.

Iris:
... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... I can't do it... I can't say who did it.

Phoenix:
... I... I see...

Victim's Staff updated in the Court Record.

Bailiff:
...Defendant!

Iris:
...Y-Yes...

Bailiff:
The judge is calling you! He wants you to see you in his chambers. He has some questions about Dahlia Hawthorne.

Iris:
...Alright. ... Well then... I'll see you later... There's something I want to tell you later.

Phoenix:
Oh, um... OK... ("Something she wants to tell me"? So it's true... Iris cooperated with the real killer... Maybe even from the very beginning!)

Mia:
...Phoenix.

Phoenix:
Mia...! Umm... H-How is Maya doing!?

Mia:
Physically, I'm not worried. She'll recover completely. But emotionally, she's been hurt very badly by this case.

Phoenix:
I-I see... ...! You don't mean...! She's learned who Elise Deauxnim really was?

Mia:
...Yes. I went to the medical office and talked with her. I told her everything I knew.

Phoenix:
...But why?

Mia:
Maya is stronger than you think... I knew she could take it... All of it.

Phoenix:
What do you mean by that?

Mia:
I want you to figure that answer out by yourself. ...The trial is about to restart. The real killer... Do you know who it is yet?

Phoenix:
(Iris wouldn't tell me who called her. But still... I think that just maybe... I know who it was.) That night, the victim was killed in the garden of the Inner Temple. And the criminal wasn't just there by accident. Which means... ...that the killer knew of Dahlia's plan from the very beginning.

Mia:
...And one more thing. The victim was moved to the Hazakura Temple side by pendulum. In other words... the criminal couldn't cross the bridge. That means they were stuck on the Inner Temple side for almost an entire day.

Phoenix:
(Exactly. So the criminal... ...was someone that wasn't in Hazakura Temple the following day...!)

Mia:
... That's as much help as I can give you. The rest of the battle is yours to win... or lose.

Phoenix:
OK, I've got it. ...Thank you, Mia.

Phoenix:
(Finally... It's almost time to bring this case to an end. What exactly did Maya see anyway...? And who was it that actually killed Misty Fey? Whoever it was, I have to prove it... Me. All by myself.)

To be continued.
February 10, 3:36 PM
District Court
Courtroom No. 7

Judge:
Now then, before we proceed any further... ...I'm going to announce the results of the tests we had performed earlier.

Phoenix:
Tests...?

Judge:
Yes, tests. On the bloody dagger that was found stuck in the pine tree.

Phoenix:
Oh yeah! That! (I totally forgot about it.)

Godot:
That's the weapon that Maya Fey used when she fought with the victim.

Phoenix:
So what are the results!? Was it the victim's blood, or...?

Judge:
Due to time constraints, a full test wasn't possible. However... There's one thing we can say with certainty. The blood that was on this dagger was not the victim's blood! ...That is all. Now then, let's restart this trial.

Phoenix:
(So it wasn't Misty's blood on the dagger... Then whose was it...?)

Dagger updated in the Court Record.

Judge:
I'm sure both the defense and the prosecution know this, but... ...this trial is rapidly coming to a close. Both sides will need to show some firm evidence with their claims.

Phoenix:
I understand, Your Honor.

Godot:
From what I've heard... ...the witness is dangerously weak, physically speaking. So, let's finish this quickly.

Phoenix:
...Agreed.

Judge:
Very well! Please bring in the last witness!

Godot:
...Witness, please tell us your name and profession.

Maya:
Maya Fey. My profession is... Umm... I'm the assistant manager at Wright & Co. Law Offices.

Phoenix:
(Maya...)

Judge:
According to the magazine I have here... ...you're a spirit medium of the Kurain Channeling Technique...

Maya:
... I... I'm frightened. The Fey clan... I don't want any more to do with it.

Phoenix:
(Oh, Maya... The pain the Fey bloodline causes must be unbearable...)

Judge:
...Very well. Now then, Ms. Fey. When the event occurred... you were in the garden of the Inner Temple. And... You witnessed the moment of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. ...Is this correct?

Maya:
... I, umm... I... I didn't see anyth--

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Straighten up this moment, young lady!

Maya:
Huh...?

Godot:
Pick your head up and speak clearly. There's always time for crying later.

Maya:
B-But I...

Godot:
Your mother was killed right in front of your eyes! There's nothing you can do to change that fact.

Maya:
...!

Godot:
But there's something you can do... You can finish this. You've been watching the whole thing right? You've seen the witnesses come out and you've seen us squeeze the truth out of them. Now it's your turn. ...Let's hear your testimony. On the night of the crime... what exactly did you see happen!?

Judge:
Witness. If you please.

Maya:
...Yes, Your Honor.

I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.
Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...
I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.
I think I screamed, "Help me!"
Then something warm splashed over me...
That's when... I lost consciousness.
Judge:
Hmm... So you were struck on the head... I suppose it must have been this staff.

Phoenix:
Maya! The person who hit you... It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it!?

Maya:
I-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...

Phoenix:
Maya, think hard...

Maya:
Sorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!

Godot:
Ha...! Can't say it was an especially good night for young ladies to be walking around alone.

Judge:
It seems that it will be hard to determine the criminal through testimony alone. Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination...

Phoenix:

Maya:

Judge:
Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?

Phoenix:
To be frank, Your Honor, I think she is in shock and quite confused. That's why she hasn't noticed the huge problem with her testimony.

Maya:
H-Huh? What do you mean? What problem...?

Phoenix:
...Maya. On the night of the crime... that stone lantern was out of commission.

Maya:
Huh... What!?

Phoenix:

Sorry, but that's not going to cut it!

Maya:
N-Nick...

Phoenix:
...May I? Recall the witness's statement about her attacker. She said that she didn't know if it was a man or a woman, an adult or a child. ...And yet! The witness could describe a person that was standing behind her attacker... And she quite clearly described him as a man!

Maya:
Ah...!

Phoenix:
...In other words! That would have to mean that Maya actually saw our mystery person! Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of the attacker in front of her!

Maya:
N... NOOOOOOOOOO!

Judge:
Or-Order! Order! Order! What in the world does this all mean, Mr. Wright!? Are you saying Ms. Fey saw the real killer under pitch black conditions!?

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Trite! Do you have any idea what you're proposing? How could she have seen in the dark? There was no other light source at the scene!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
There are some things that you can only see in the dark, Mr. Godot.

Godot:
...!

Phoenix:
Maya, you did see who the killer was in the dark. And now... you're trying to cover for him.

Judge:
C-Cover...!? For the man that killed her mother...!?

Phoenix:
There's only one conclusion I can draw from this... You know who this man is!

Maya:
...... ... Please... Nick... I don't know anything... Please... I'm begging you...

Godot:
...Ha! You talk a good game, Trite. But let's see if you can walk the walk. It was pitch black. So what could the witness see? I'm calling your bluff!

Maya:
N-No, Nick! Don't...! P-Please! Stop...!

Phoenix:
(Maya is dead set on protecting this guy... The man who murdered Maya's long-lost mother...! But... I can't let him get away with it. I'm a lawyer. An officer of the court. I'm here to find the truth!)

Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily. I'm sure the court would like to see for itself how this is possible, yes?

What!? B-But how do you propose to show us something like that!?

Phoenix:
...It's easy. We just need to recreate the conditions of that night.

Judge:
C-Conditions...?

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense officially requests... ...that all the lights in this courtroom be turned off!

Judge:
... Wh... Wh... This is... ...But it can't be...!

Godot:

...Ha...
That was a nice bit of deduction... Trite.

Phoenix:
Well, everyone...? This is the man Maya saw on the night of the murder!

Judge:
Surely you must be shocked to hear yourself accused of such a thing! Why aren't you denying it!?

Ha...! Your Honor. You're asking the wrong person.

Judge:
Wh-What do you mean by that!?

Godot:
If you've got a question, ask the witness... That's one of my rules.

Phoenix:
Well, Maya!? How about it? What you saw that night... Was it 3 glowing red lights?

Maya:
...

Judge:
Well, witness? Answer the question.

Maya:

Phoenix:

...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.
By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...
The torches were lit... And the body was gone.
And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.
Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...
Judge:
Hmm... So it was after the crime took place that the witness came to think the killer was a man.

Maya:
Yes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...

Judge:
No need to apologize. It's as Mr. Godot said... You're utterly exhausted. It's only natural that you would be a little confused.

Godot:
...

Judge:
Also, if you consider the situation you described... ...it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume the criminal was a man. Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.

Phoenix:
(The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...)

Phoenix:
The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard. Then at the garden, the real scene of the crime... ...the snow that we suspect was covered in blood was scooped up and removed. It's reasonable to believe all this was done in an attempt to hide the true crime scene. However... There's still one matter that still seems somewhat odd.

Godot:
Oh? And what would that be?

Phoenix:
You must have figured it out by now, Mr. Godot... It's the message written in blood on the lantern.

Godot:
...!

Phoenix:
It was written very clearly on the white stone lantern. "Maya"...

Maya:
Ah...

Phoenix:
If the killer was so motivated to protect Maya from suspicion... ...then why didn't he wipe the writing off the lantern?

Judge:
Aaaaaaah! You're right! Order! Order! Order! B-But, Mr. Wright! Isn't it a fact that the killer was trying to cover up the crime scene...?

Phoenix:
Indeed. But it doesn't make much sense to move the body and remove the bloody snow... ...then not wipe off the most incriminating thing of all -- the bloody writing!

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
But if that's the case... ...do you have an explanation for the killer's mysterious behavior? Why would this killer move the body and remove all that snow... ...but then leave the bloody writing on the lantern...?

Phoenix:
(I don't know what the killer's plan was... ...but it's a fact that the killer left the writing on the lantern. There must be a reason for it!)

Judge:
Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion. Why did the killer leave the message written in blood on the lantern?

The killer wrote it.

To pin the crime on Maya.

The killer didn't notice it.

Phoenix:
...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice. "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth."

Godot:
Maybe you're not as dumb as I thought.

Phoenix:
The real killer wanted to disguise the fact that a crime occurred there. If that's the case... They wouldn't have left the bloody writing on the stone lantern on purpose! Therefore, it must mean that they didn't notice it...

Maya:
B-But... That doesn't make any sense! The torches were all lit and everything... There's no way any normal person would miss something as glaring as that!

Phoenix:
You're right... There is no way any "normal" person would.

Judge:
What...? What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright!?

Phoenix:
There's only one person involved in this incident... ...who could have missed seeing the bloody writing altogether.

Judge:
And who would that be!? Who is the person that could have failed to notice the bloody writing!?

Godot:

Phoenix:
This lantern was submitted as evidence today. I would like the court to think back to the moment it was first presented.

Judge:
Th-This lantern... There's something written on it! Wh-Why... It's written in blood!

Godot:
Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!

Phoenix:
...Mr. Godot. Just admit it. There are certain colors you can't see... Correct?

Godot:
...

Phoenix:
You can't see red on a white background, can you? ...That's right. We went through this once before. During the poisoning case at TrÃ©s Bien...

Godot:
This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. And somehow spilled coffee on.

Judge:
There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?

Godot:
Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?

Judge:
Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!

Godot:
That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!

Phoenix:
You could see the coffee on the white apron... ...But you couldn't see the ketchup. Because it was red.

Godot:
... Ha...! It's strange... In a black and white photo, those letters would have appeared black to me... I wonder... Why am I the only one that can't see them...?

Judge:
S-So then... Mr. Godot! Are you admitting it!? Are you admitting that you couldn't see the red writing on the lantern!?

Godot:
...Hey, gramps. Didn't you know? That's the reason why I don't drink red tea!

Phoenix:
(I wasn't sure about it until now, but... I just can't believe it... Prosecutor Godot is the murderer! But... There's no going back now. I've finally figured out the truth...!)

Phoenix:
...Mr. Godot. The defense at this time formally accuses you. You are the murderer of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, also known as Ms. Misty Fey!

Judge:
It's hard to believe this may be true. However... ...once again Mr. Wright has brought up a disquieting fact about you!

Godot:
Ha...! Just make sure you don't fill out the indictment in red ink, gramps. Come on... How does a little graffiti make me into the killer?

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
Besides, it's not like it's my name that's written there.

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
I'm certain that the killer wasn't able to see the color red!

Godot:
This is rich. Do go on, Trite.

Phoenix:
The answer is right there at the crime scene. In the snow...

Judge:
The snow? How so?

Phoenix:
Well, for example, why did the killer move all that snow...? Your Honor, you said it yourself. If they wanted to hide the bloody snow, why not take out just that area?

Judge:
Yes, why didn't they take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!?

Phoenix:
Yes. The killer couldn't see the red blood that had seeped into the snow. And so, he had to remove all of the snow! He couldn't be sure of where the blood had landed, so he removed the whole area!

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Isn't it more likely that the killer couldn't see the blood because it was dark?

Phoenix:
...Not a chance. The torches were all lit. They would have been able to see fine.

Judge:

Judge:
She didn't...? I'm afraid I don't follow...

Godot:
Are you senile, old man? We established this just a little while ago. After the murder, this witness was unconscious for a long time. Because she was channeling Dahlia Hawthorne.

Judge:
Oh... That's right...

P-Please, Your Honor! Let me add to my testimony! ...Nick! Please listen to me...!

Godot:
Ha...! Nicely done, Trite.

Judge:
Very well, let's hear the witness's testimony. Please tell us what happened at the Inner Temple after the murder.

Maya:
Yes, sir. After I woke up, I began channeling and my spirit "left me", as it were. But that little girl was there at the Inner Temple, too!

That's my little cousin! Pearl Fey.

Hmm... So when did you hear about this?

Maya:
Oh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.

Judge:
I'm terribly sorry... But what you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.

...

Maya:
Wh-Why do you say that!?

Hanging scroll...?

B-But! Mr. Godot is right! That scroll shows a picture of my mother!

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The morning after the crime, someone covered it with gravy.

Maya:
Gravy...? But why gravy, Nick?

Ah, that. It's the mark of the Master, correct?

Maya:
Exactly! So if you know the meaning of the mark...

Judge:
...Then you could guess that it was a picture of Misty Fey on there!

Phoenix:
True, but Mr. Godot described what was underneath like this. "Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes."

Maya:
Oh...

Phoenix:
Yes, it's possible that he knew what the crest meant. ...However! He couldn't have known that she was wearing Japanese clothing! Mr. Godot! On the day of the murder... ...you were hiding at the Inner Temple, long before the crime took place!

Godot:
Can I ask you just one little thing, Trite?

Phoenix:
...What is it?

Godot:
This whole theory of yours... It all rests on a certain assumption. That I knew beforehand that a crime was going to be committed.

Maya:
Th-That's right! Otherwise there's no reason for him to sneak onto the crime scene...

Phoenix:
... Of course Mr. Godot knew about the plan.

Maya:
Huh...?

Judge:
Wh-What did you say!? Is it really possible that another person knew of that plan!?

Present Burnt Letter

Present anything else

Phoenix:
...This crime was actually planned over a year ago. Morgan Fey authored the plan for her daughter's future... ...and these instructions were hidden somewhere in Fey Manor for a year... However, by the time little Pearls found these instructions... ...they had already been unsealed.

Judge:
Unsealed...?

Phoenix:
Yes. The killer had read these instructions long before Pearls ever found them. That's how he knew the crime was to take place at the Inner Temple!

Godot:
And you're saying this crafty killer... is me?

Phoenix:
You bet I am.

Godot:
But you just said that the instructions were hidden...

Maya:
Th-That's right! Mr. Godot couldn't have known where the instructions were hidden!

Phoenix:
If he really wanted to know, he had one great chance to find out.

Judge:
Y-Yes, and when was that...?

Phoenix:
...During a visit.

Maya:
A visit?

Phoenix:
Morgan Fey told her daughter, Pearl, about where the instructions were hidden... ...during one of her visits to the detention center. That would be the only time for someone to have learned where they were hidden.

Judge:
Ea-Eavesdropping on a visit at the detention center!

Phoenix:
Yes, it could be arranged if you were someone with easy access in and out of there. Like for example, a prosecutor such as Mr. Godot!

Godot:
...!

Judge:
Order! Order! Order! M-Mr. Godot...! You're under fire again!

Phoenix:
...This murder could not have been carried out without prior knowledge! And you...! You were the only one that could've acquired this information before the murder.

Godot:
...Humans are afraid of the dark. And yet... At the same time, we're fascinated and bewitched by it. Maybe that's why humans drink the darkness that is coffee.

Judge:
......

Phoenix:
Umm... Sorry for always asking, but what does that mean?

Godot:
It means there's a reason for everything. According to your theory, the killer in this case eavesdropped... ...on a conversation during a jail visit where he learned of a hidden plan for a crime. After discovering the plans, he hid in the Inner Temple and waited for the crime to occur. Then he ultimately took a person's life. ...And he did all of that just to protect this witness?

Phoenix:
That's right.

Godot:
If you're accusing me of this crime, I have to ask you... Why would I do this? This girl is nothing but a stranger to me. I've got no reason to go through that kind of trouble to protect her. I am what you see. I am certainly not the type to rescue the damsel in distress.

Judge:
Hmm... The killer's behavior is... certainly... extreme... for lack of a better word. Even considering that the killer wanted to protect this witness's life... ...his behavior is still a little too unnatural!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
However... ...you had a good reason didn't you, Mr. Godot? An unshakable reason that forced you to protect this witness at all costs!

Maya:
...... I knew it... You've figured it out, haven't you, Nick...?

Phoenix:
(Maya... I guess you were doing your best to cover for Godot... ...for the same reason, huh?)

Godot:
OK, Trite. I'm all ears. ...Let's hear it.

Phoenix:
It's very simple... Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you.

Judge:
Wh-What's this...!?

Phoenix:
There's one person who lies at the very center of this whole story. One person that ties you and Maya Fey together inextricably!

Present Mia Fey profile

Present anyone else

Phoenix:
There's a very good reason why Maya Fey's life is so precious to you! After all... She is Mia Fey's only sister.

Maya:
...!

Godot:
Mia... Fey.

Phoenix:
You once worked alongside her. That was when you... were a defense attorney.

Judge:
W-Wait a second here! Mr. Godot is... is a defense attorney!?

Phoenix:
With Your Honor's piercing intellect, you must have figured it out by now... The real name of this man who calls himself "Godot"... His real name is... Diego Armando. Isn't that right?

Godot:
The last time someone called me by that name... ...was over 6 years ago.

Judge:
Diego Armando... That name rings a bell...

Phoenix:
It should, Your Honor. All of this is related to a single case... A case in which a convict named Terry Fawles killed himself... Mia Fey's first time in court. The tragic outcome left a deep wound in her heart. She knew that behind it all was a heartless, scheming demoness in disguise. But in the end, Mia couldn't tear off that disguise. However, there was one man who reached out to help her. ...Diego Armando, a senior defense lawyer at the office where Mia worked.

Mia:
It's my fault! It's all my fault that Mr. Fawles killed himself!

Armando:
............... Mia... You can't cry yet. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.

Godot:
... I was moved by her... The way she put all her faith in her clients... That pure, sweet heart of hers... That's why... I could never forgive Dahlia Hawthorne. Mia and I thoroughly investigated that fake kidnapping incident. Then one fateful day, Dahlia wanted to meet with me... It had been 6 months since the trial... We met in the courthouse cafeteria.

Judge:
Ah...! I just remembered! 6 years ago! Right here in this courthouse! You were poisoned...!

Godot:
Even I didn't see it coming. Dahlia Hawthorne slipped some poison into my coffee.

Judge:
Some newspapers at the time called it a murder. But very little information about the case was released to the press...

Phoenix:
But you weren't dead at all!

Godot:
No official reports ever actually called it a murder. I was just in a deep, deep coma...

Phoenix:
I see...

Godot:
...My body shut down, and my life became nothing but a long, deep sleep. That woman's poison did a real number on my central nervous system... I lost my sight, and all of my hair turned white due to the damage it caused.

Maya:
That's terrible...

Godot:
Apparently it was a miracle that I ever regained consciousness. Five years had passed since I drank that poisoned brew... Then one morning, my eyes flew open... from the smell of a doctor's cup of coffee.

Judge:
F-Five years...!? You were asleep for 5 years!?

Godot:
And the worst possible news was waiting for me... ...Mia Fey was dead. From the very moment I opened my eyes... I had already lost everything I thought I had. The woman I loved had been murdered... And the woman I loathed had been sentenced to death.

Judge:
The woman you loathed...?

Godot:
The woman who had spiked my scalding hot coffee... Dahlia Hawthorne! Ha...! Good ol' Mia. She didn't let me down. She got her revenge before she checked out. In the end... There wasn't anyone waiting for me when I woke up.

Maya:
Th-That's so sad...

Godot:
For someone like me... For someone who had slept away their best days... ...there were only 2 reasons left to live. And it was for those 2 reasons that I decided to become a prosecutor.

Phoenix:
If I may ask... What were your 2 reasons to live...?

Godot:
The first was you, Trite.

Phoenix:
Huh...!? M... M-Me?

Godot:
If I hadn't drank that stupid poison... ...Mia Fey never would have died, much less the way she did.

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
You were the only one who was there to protect her! But you let her die. It was all your fault.

Phoenix:
I... It wasn't like that...

Godot:
I wanted to see for myself what kind of a man you really were.

Judge:
S-So that's why you became a prosecutor?

Godot:
My other reason for living... She goes by the name of Maya Fey.

Maya:
Huh? You mean me...?

Godot:
You were the only way I could make up for the sin of not saving Mia. One year ago, when the Kurain Village incident was resolved... ...it was obvious that Morgan Fey was planning something. Whatever her evil plan was, I was determined to stop it. My role as a prosecutor put me in the perfect position to do something about her.

Phoenix:
That's how you overheard Pearls's visit with Morgan at the detention center.

Godot:
I knew that the time was drawing near. Since I knew the plan, I thought I could foil it. My goal was to outwit the plan. I thought if I could do that... ...I could keep that girl from being caught up in it.

Phoenix:
(That makes sense... If Pearls had known that the actual purpose of the plan was to kill Maya... ...she never would have helped out.)

Godot:
Finally, the day of the plan was drawing near... I contacted both of my accomplices.

Judge:
Accomplices...?

Godot:
Iris of Hazakura Temple and... Misty Fey. I especially needed the help of Iris... She was to take the fall in my back-up plan in case we couldn't control Pearl Fey.

Maya:
B-But...! How did you contact my mother!? She had been missing for almost 20 years!

Godot:
Officially, yes...

Maya:
What!? What do you mean, officially!?

Godot:
You've heard about it, haven't you? About the strong ties between the main family and the government...

Phoenix:
(Now that you mention it... Bikini did say something to that effect... She said that the Master of Kurain had great authority...)

Godot:
Even without her official position, Misty Fey still wielded great influence... The police have been keeping an eye on her movements all this time. That's how I was able to contact her... Again, because of my position as a prosecutor.

Maya:
So my mother... was cooperating with you?

Godot:
Don't ever forget... ...no matter how far away from you she was, she never stopped thinking about you.

Maya:
Sh-She was always...

Godot:
That's why... I knew she would do anything to protect you. If you want to know how strong her resolve to protect you was, look at her staff.

Judge:
Her staff...? The one with the sword in it?

Godot:
The day the plan was to be carried out arrived soon enough... We met for the first time at Hazakura Temple. That's when your mother showed me her special staff... I realized it then... Just how far she was willing to go... She was ready to use that sword to protect you from Morgan Fey, if necessary. ...Yes! Even if it meant paying the ultimate price.

Maya:
M-Mother...

Godot:
That night... The night of the crime. There was just one way to stop Morgan's evil plan.

Phoenix:
You mean Pearls, don't you?

Godot:
We had to make sure she didn't channel Dahlia Hawthorne...

Elise:
...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?

Pearl:
Well, umm...

Elise:
If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.

Godot:
We thought we could prevent her from playing her part in Morgan's plan. But... She never showed up.

Maya:
She was worried and followed me to the Inner Temple...

Godot:
That was the thing we were most afraid of. And that's why... Misty Fey had to do the channeling herself. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne into her own body.

Judge:
What...!? What do you mean!?

Phoenix:
If she channeled the spirit first... ...then Pearls wouldn't be able to do it herself.

Maya:
...!

Godot:
As Master of Kurain, Misty Fey's power was supreme. So that's how it went down. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne so that Pearl Fey wouldn't be able to!

Maya:
Ah...! Whaaaaaaaat!?

Judge:
What...!? Is this true!?

Godot:
My role in the plan was to make sure no one was going to hurt Maya Fey. That's why... I hid myself at the Inner Temple. Just in case you needed to be saved from Dahlia Hawthorne.

Phoenix:
Godot...

Godot:
Anyway... That's all I'm going to admit to... Trite.

Phoenix:
Huh...?

Godot:
There's no doubt about it. You're a great defense lawyer. But... you're going to have to do the rest yourself.

Judge:
The background leading up to this incident has been laid bare. There's just one question remaining, Mr. Wright. "Who killed the victim?" There are only two possible suspects right now. Maya Fey... And I'm sad to say... you, Mr. Godot!

Godot:
Well, Trite... If you're the real deal... ...then finish this thing once and for all. Show us beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can finish this on your own!

Maya:
N-No, Nick...! P-Please don't!

Phoenix:
M... Maya...

Maya:
I... I heard the whole thing. From my sister... In the medical office...! That's why! That's why... I have to protect Mr. Godot...

Phoenix:
...

Maya:
I can't do it... I can't testify against him... After all... ...he's the man who put his life on the line to protect Mia... and me, too!

Phoenix:
Maya... I know that!

Maya:
N-Nick...

Phoenix:
But even so... It doesn't absolve him of his crime! ...Please, Maya. Testify.

Maya:
...!

Judge:
Ms. Fey. Your testimony please.

Phoenix:
This is the final testimony. Don't bother trying to hide anything, because I'll know. I want to hear the truth from your own lips...

Maya:
...... I understand. I'm sure you're right... I'm ready now, Nick...

Judge:
Alright, young lady... Tell us about the moments before you lost consciousness. What exactly happened at the time of the murder!?

Witness Testimony
-- The Time of the Murder --
Maya:
...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.
I thought I'd ask for help, but... just then I was splattered with blood!
She wasn't dead though... And she struck back at the enemy behind her.
Suddenly, the red lights went out and the whole area was dark.
...Just at that moment, there was a horrible scream!
Right after that... Dahlia collapsed and I lost consciousness.
Judge:
These red lights... I thought you said you don't remember seeing them!

Maya:
I-I'm sorry... I thought I saw them, but then they disappeared all of a sudden...

Godot:
Ha...! Things break, Trite... Even the best of theories.

Phoenix:
...

Godot:
Who was it that stabbed Misty Fey? It looks like you still can't prove it.

Phoenix:
(Maya is telling the truth this time, I know it... The rest is up to me!)

Judge:
...Well then, Mr. Wright! Proceed with your final cross-examination of the witness!

Phoenix:
(I've got to use this testimony to prove that Godot committed the murder! I really wish I didn't have to do it... But for some reason... I get the feeling that some part of Godot actually wants me to...)

Phoenix:
Naturally, the dagger the killer brought to the scene of the crime.

Judge:
Oh...! That's right! I forgot about that...

Phoenix:
This dagger was found at the crime scene, stuck into a pine tree.

Godot:
Yes, the detective found that this morning and brought it to me.

Phoenix:
Dahlia Hawthorne struck back at the killer with this! And she managed to wound him as well!

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
Just because he let out a scream doesn't mean that he was wounded. For all we know, the blood on the dagger could have been from the victim!

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
Have you forgotten that the blood has already been tested?

Godot:
...!

Phoenix:
Since we learned it wasn't the victim's blood, it must be the killer's blood! The killer must have a wound somewhere on his body!

Judge:
So you're saying the blood on this dagger belongs to the killer...?

Phoenix:
Exactly! A DNA analysis of the blood would prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt! And yes, Mr. Godot. It would prove that it's your blood!

Godot:
Nice theory, Trite.

Judge:
Order! Order in the court!

Phoenix:
(Is this the end...? Have I done it...? Even he won't be able to change the results of a scientific test!)

Godot:
...Ha! Let me ask you something, Trite. Let's just say that it turned out that I was the killer.

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
Do you really think I would be stupid enough to leave evidence like that?

Phoenix:
What...?

Godot:
Just think for a second. This dagger was found this morning by a detective and brought to me. There was already a bloodstain on it, correct? But even so... I was the one who brought this dagger here to the courtroom.

Judge:
Y-Yes... What does that prove?

Godot:
Well, if I really were the killer... ...I could've washed the blade off and then planted another person's blood on it.

Phoenix:
Th-That's... It can't be...!

Godot:
In any case, there's one thing I can guarantee, Trite. That blood... It doesn't belong to me. Not a chance!

Phoenix:
Whaaaat!?

Judge:
In any event, it seems to be established that the killer was wounded. Alright then, witness. Continue your testimony.

Holdit

Maya:
W-Wait a minute...!

Judge:
...What's the problem?

Maya:
Umm, I... I know I probably shouldn't say this, but... ...there's a big contradiction in Nick's explanation!

Phoenix:
M-Maya!

Maya:
Th-This dagger... You said that it wounded the killer.

Phoenix:
...That's right.

Maya:
But... But, but...! If Mr. Godot had really been cut with the dagger... ...his clothes should be bloody or have a rip in them, right!?

............
Phoenix:
...Umm, Maya? Maybe he just changed his clothes? That'd solve the contradiction pretty easily.

Maya:
What are you talking about? It's not that simple at all! Remember back to the day of the murder! Everyone that was on the Inner Temple side got trapped there!

Judge:
Ah! Th-That's right! And once the bridge was fixed and the police headed for the Inner Temple...

Maya:
...Mr. Godot was already there waiting for them! He never had a chance to change his clothes!

Phoenix:
Aaaaack!

Judge:
Order! Order in the court! What the witness says is true--

Phoenix:
Objection

Phoenix:
W-Well, maybe he brought a change of clothes with him!

Judge:
B-But... No one could have predicted the lightning strike that shut down the bridge! Why would anyone have brought a change of clothes!?

Phoenix:
Nngh...! (Did the judge take smart pills during the last recess?) Well then! Maybe the killer took off his clothes before he committed the murder! That way he wouldn't get any blood on them!

Godot:
Objection

Godot:
That's impossible, Trite. You know how cold it gets up there late at night!

Phoenix:
Eh...

Godot:
After a few minutes with no clothes on, you'd be frozen solid!

Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaah!

Judge:
Hmm... Hmmm... Hmmmm...

Godot:
Ha...! So that's all you've got... I knew you weren't tough enough to finish this.

Phoenix:
Urk...

Godot:
Right now... if Mia Fey were here...

Phoenix:
...!

Godot:
If Mia Fey were here... She would have closed the book on this case already.

Phoenix:
(If Mia Fey were here...?)

Godot:
So come on, Trite! Can you do it or not!?

Phoenix:
...

Judge:
How about it, Mr. Wright? You've accused Mr. Godot of being the killer. But can you prove it? Have you got even one piece of evidence!?

Phoenix:
... (The question isn't whether I can prove it or not... The fact is, I have to prove it! That's the only choice I have. I was taught that it's one of the rules of being a lawyer!) ...I can prove it. I'm going to bring your magnificent vengeance to fruition, just as you want it.

Godot:
Ha...! That's good... A fighter till the bitter end, Trite...

Phoenix:
...

Godot:
Since there's just one piece of evidence that can prove your point... ...why don't we go for the unlimited penalty?

Phoenix:
Are you trying to pressure me, Mr. Godot? Because it doesn't matter to me. I've got the one piece of evidence I need.

Godot:
G-Give me a break! You've got nothing, Trite!

Phoenix:
(So what do I do at a time like this...? It's simple! I've gotta think outside the box and approach this from a different angle!)

Judge:
Alright then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've got.

Phoenix:
...There's one thing I've demonstrated in the previous cross-examination. The killer was wounded. That was proven by the blood on the dagger.

Judge:
B-But... We decided it was impossible for him to have hidden such a wound! If he had been cut by a dagger, there should have been a bloodstain on his clothing.

Phoenix:
There's one place... One place the killer could have hidden his wound.

Judge:
Wh-What did you say!?

Maya:
H-hidden...?

Godot:
...

Phoenix:
(This is it! My last stand! I need to think about this from a different angle! I don't need to think about why there were no bloodstains on his clothing... I need to show how he hid the wound!)

Godot:
It's the end of the line! The final stop, Trite! Let's hear what you've got! Where's this location where you say the killer hid his wound!?

Present Godot profile

Present anything else

Godot:
...Ha! I don't know what you're talking about... And frankly, I don't need to know. What I do know is that you'll never be half the lawyer she was! Isn't that right, Trite...? ...! (Wh-What was that just now?)

...Mia?

Godot:
(It-It can't be! You're living on... through him...!?)

Phoenix:
Even as we speak, you're still hiding the wound! It's beneath your mask! During the fight, the red lights given off by the killer suddenly disappeared. Seconds later, the killer let out a scream. That's right. Your mask went flying off your face! Mr. Godot! Would you mind removing your mask? If you have a dagger wound under there somewhere... ...then I'd say this whole case is solved!

Godot:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!

Godot:
Just now... I saw her spirit in you.

Phoenix:
...?

Godot:
...... I never liked you. Six years ago... ...you helped the woman who put me to sleep by hiding her bottle of poison. And then... While I was sleeping... ...you let Mia die. But you didn't care. You just kept living your pathetic, happy-go-lucky life. You even had the nerve to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer. I could never forgive you. That's what I thought.

Maya:
Mr. Godot...

Godot:
But... I was wrong about you. I knew it from the very beginning. The truth is, the only person I could never find it in my heart to forgive... ...was me.

Judge:
Y-You, yourself...?

Godot:
I was the one that failed to protect Mia... ...Me and no one else. I tried to avert my eyes from the truth... to escape from the harshness of reality. I just couldn't face Mia's death head on, so I ran! I hid behind a mask. I threw away my true name. I couldn't even deal with being a defense attorney anymore, so I quit.

Phoenix:
But, but! You saved Maya!

Godot:
Yeah. That was my plan... Up until just now, anyway.

Maya:
Wh-What do you mean?

Godot:
Are you listening, Maya? If I had really wanted to save you... ...then there's one person that I should have gone and talked to right away.

Maya:
Wh-Who would that be...? Are you talking about Nick?

Godot:
But I didn't do it... I tried to get the help of Iris and your mother... But I closed my eyes to the most important man involved. Do you know why? The real reason?

Maya:
No... Why?

Godot:
I suppose... I wasn't really interested in saving you at all.

Maya:
Huh...!?

Godot:
I think I was just trying to salvage what's left of my own broken soul... I was trying to make up for the fact that I couldn't save Mia. Nothing more. That's why I let you walk right into a situation that I knew was dangerous. Forgive me...

Phoenix:
Y-You're wrong! You put your life on the line to save Maya!

Godot:
Was it really for Maya's sake...? Even I'm not really sure.

Judge:
Wh-What do you mean by that...?

Godot:
That night, in the darkness of the garden, when I saw her silhouette... A part of me must have known the truth... The truth that it wasn't really Dahlia Hawthorne standing there in front of me.

Maya:
...!

Godot:
It could have been Misty Fey... Or even that little girl. But I still picked up the blade... It was like I was dreaming! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in my mind at that point... Was I really motivated by the pure desire to protect Maya Fey? Or was it something else...? Was it my hatred for a woman who had stolen everything from me 6 years earlier...? Could it have been simply a desire for revenge? And now, I don't know anything anymore! I did learn something today, however. I finally realized that I was the arrogant one. I was just... chasing an illusion, a fantasy. The stupid fantasy of defeating you in the courtroom...

Phoenix:
...

Godot:
You were the one who made me realize my folly. You never ran away from Mia's death. Instead, you picked up where she left off, as a true defender of the people. In that one moment... I understood everything!

Phoenix:
Mr. Godot...

Godot:
I think you already know this, but if you don't... My name is... Diego Armando.

Maya:
M-Mr. Armando! I believe in you! I know you were trying to save me!

Armando:
Hmm... Thanks.

Phoenix:
Y-Your wound...! It's bleeding!

Armando:
...Ha! Did you forget already? In my world, the color red doesn't exist.

Phoenix:
...!

Armando:
These must be... my tears.

Judge:
Tears...?

Armando:
Ever since I woke up from my coma... ...I think I've been waiting for this very moment.

Maya:
M-Mr. Armando...

Armando:
You'd do well to remember this, Maya. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.

Judge:
This time... It really is all over, isn't it. ...Defendant.

Iris:
Yes, Your Honor.

Judge:
Although you weren't directly involved in the murder... ...tampering with the body and the crime scene is a serious offense in itself.

Iris:
I understand, Your Honor. Mr. Armando explained that to me very carefully... I knew the risk and I willingly cooperated anyway.

Judge:
...Very well. Before I hand down my verdict, is there anything you'd like to say?

Iris:
...... Well, there is one thing. I'd like to say something to Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
...!

Iris:
I want to... I want to apologize to you.

Phoenix:
Apologize? To me? For what?

Iris:
For the case 6 years ago, of course.

Judge:
I just remembered... Weren't you poisoned by your own lover?

Phoenix:
...Not exactly, but yeah, something like that. Even now... 6 years later, I can hardly believe it. She was going to do it... She was planning to kill me...

Iris:
...... It's not all that surprising. The two of you... You hardly knew each other.

Phoenix:
Huh...? What do you mean?

Iris:
You and my sister... You only met twice.

Phoenix:
...... Huh. W-We only met t-twice?

Iris:
The first time you met was on that fateful day... The day she poisoned Mr. Armando in the cafeteria of this very courthouse. The next time you met her was... six months later. You met her again on the day that she stole your cold medicine... ...and Doug Swallow was killed.

Phoenix:
N-N-No way! It just... It can't be true! I mean, during our whole relationship, we were...

Iris:
...... For those 6 months... ...the woman that you thought was Dahlia Hawthorne... ...wasn't actually my sister.

Phoenix:
(Huh? It wasn't Dahlia...?)

Iris:
... I hope one day you can forgive me... Feenie.

Phoenix:
You... Y-Y-You mean...?

Iris:
That's right... I lied to you... for 6 months.

Judge:
B-But why...!? Why would you do such a thing?

Iris:
Ever since she gave you the bottle that day... ...my sister was trying to get it back as soon as she possibly could. Because of the police investigation and their surveillance... ...she couldn't move about freely.

Phoenix:
So that's why you...?

Iris:
My sister... From the beginning, she was prepared for the worst.

Phoenix:
P-Prepared for the worst?

Iris:
She thought that you might somehow discover the truth. That's why she was always ready to deal with you at a moment's notice...

Phoenix:
(You mean she was ready to kill me, don't you...?)

Iris:
She already had so much to answer for, I didn't want any more sins on her soul. I begged her not to do it, and she agreed to give me a chance.

Phoenix:
And that's why... you came to me? You came to get the bottle pendant back from me in her place?

Iris:
But I couldn't get you to give it back... I failed at something even as simple as that. Six months passed and I still couldn't get it back from you. Finally, my sister couldn't wait any longer. She didn't consult me about her plans for you that day. ...It was the first time that had ever happened.

Phoenix:
That was a bit strange, wasn't it? Up until that day, you two were partners in crime, and she would confer with you...

Iris:
I think... she must have noticed.

Phoenix:
...? Noticed what?

Iris:
My feelings for you. If I had found out she was planning to kill you... ...I would have done whatever was necessary to stop her. Even if it meant her life... or mine.

Phoenix:
I-Iris...!

Iris:
After spending half a year by your side... ...my feelings towards you... They changed.

Phoenix:
...... I have something to say to you, too.

Iris:
Y-Yes?

Phoenix:
You really are the person I always thought you were. Even after Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... I still believed in you.

Iris:
...... Thank you.

Armando:
How many cups of darkness have I drank over the years? Even I don't know... I'll tell you though... Right now, this one here is the greatest cup I think I've ever had. Don't you think so... Phoenix Wright?

Phoenix:
Yeah... I think you're right.

Judge:
The purpose of this trial was to rule on the murder of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. At some point, I expect you will be tried for your role as an accomplice in this case.

Iris:
...I understand, Your Honor.

Judge:
Very well! On the charge of murder, I hereby find the defendant...

Not Guilty

Judge:
Court is now adjourned!

February 10, 4:51 PM
District Court
Defendant Lobby No. 1

Phoenix:
(So I guess it's all over... The way everything ended... Was justice really served...? The man who risked his life to save Maya is being sent to prison by my own hand...)

Mia:
Of course justice was served.

Phoenix:
M-Mia!

Mia:
...I'm proud of you, Phoenix. Your defense was... truly brilliant.

Phoenix:
B-But I couldn't save Mr. Armando! The man who cared so deeply for you...

Mia:
You're wrong, Phoenix. You did save Diego. You saved him in the only way possible.

Phoenix:
You mean... with that verdict...?

Mia:
... I think one day, you'll understand, too. Phoenix, I want you to remember one thing... You were as good out there today as any defense lawyer could ever hope to be. There's nothing more you can learn from me.

Phoenix:
M-Mia...!

Mia:
You've accomplished something I wasn't able to. I owe you a great deal. ...Thank you.

Phoenix:
Mia...

Mia:
I'm sure we'll meet again... someday... Phoenix.

Phoenix:
(I've handled lots of cases and seen a lot of things... And along this journey, I've found myself asking just one question... What does it really mean to defend someone? ...I suppose today's case produced one possible answer.)

Maya:
...Nick...

Phoenix:
M-Maya...

Maya:
I guess it's just like my sis said...

Phoenix:
Your sister...? Mia...?

Maya:
That night, when I channeled Mia to get her advice on what to do... This is what she wrote back in my notebook. "Don't worry. Phoenix will save everyone in the end."

Phoenix:
B-But...

Maya:
Come on! Cut it out with that gloomy face! Can't you see? Me, sis, and I'm sure Iris, too... We owe you for everything you have done for us, Nick!

Phoenix:
(Maya... How? How can you be so bright and chipper after all that's happened...? You were brutally attacked... You even saw your mother murdered...)

Phoenix:
Yeeeowch! F-Franziska!

von Karma:
Still a softy as always, Phoenix Wright...

Edgeworth:
Excellent work, Wright.

Maya:
Huh!? Mr. Edgeworth!? When did you get back?

Phoenix:
(Oh, that's right... I guess no one filled her in on that.) Edgeworth and Franziska have actually been helping me.

Maya:
Helping you...!?

Phoenix:
If these two hadn't been here on the first day of the trial... ...the defense wouldn't have gotten anywhere.

Maya:
Wow... But where were you, Nick?

von Karma:
I heard he fell into a river and caught a nasty cold which forced him to sleep all day.

Edgeworth:
Yes, he laid in bed shivering from his fever with Iris's hood pulled over his head.

Maya:
Oh, ouch! Talk about embarrassing, Nick. You definitely need more training! Anyway, thank you, Mr. Edgeworth! And you too... um... Franziska!

???:
I don't suppose...

Butz:
...there's room for me in this group hug, is there?

Maya:
Oh! Larry!

Phoenix:
What's with the, uh... longer than usual face?

Butz:
I realized something when I was reborn... ...I realized that Larry was never of any use to anyone. Not even once.

Maya:
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?

Phoenix:
What? You're asking me!?

Butz:
Well, Nick!? Is it true!? I've got a place in this world, right!?

Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, um... Y-Yeah, of course. ............

Butz:
I knew it. Everyone would be better off if I were gone for good.

Phoenix:
No, no, no! Umm, I... Oh yeah! Those portraits you painted! They were... really good. Isn't that right, Edgeworth!?

Edgeworth:
What!? M-Me?

Butz:
Why are you making that face!? Huh, Edgey!?

Edgeworth:
Oh, well, um, yes, indeed... I certainly can't say that it's lacking resemblance.

Butz:
Do you really mean it!? What about you, Franzy? Did I draw you well, too!? Waaah!

von Karma:
My beauty can't possibly be captured by a mere crayon!

Maya:
...*glare*

von Karma:
... Nevertheless, I recognize the effort you put into it and that's worth something.

Butz:
So then you'll do it!? Like you promised!? You're going to model for my next picture book, "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash"? Aaaaaah!

von Karma:
Don't get carried away!

Butz:
Well, how about that! I guess painting portraits is the only thing I'm good at. The painting of Pearl was pretty darn good too, if you ask me! Huh...?

Edgeworth:
Now that you mention it... I haven't seen her around.

Phoenix:
Pearls... (Where could she have gone? Normally she would have made a beeline for Maya...)

Maya:
Oh... I'll go look for her! Be right back!

Hey Pearly...!

Edgeworth:
...Wright. You seem to be uncharacteristically puzzled. I suspect you are wondering how Maya can be so cheerful despite all that has happened?

Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...

von Karma:
To be honest... I can't understand it either.

Phoenix:
(Franziska... That's right... She lost her father fairly recently as well...)

Edgeworth:
I think I understand how she feels. Maya is a much wiser person than she appears, and I think she realizes something... Now is exactly the time when she needs to be as strong as she can.

von Karma:
Wh-What do you mean by, "Now is exactly the time"...?

Edgeworth:
Maya wasn't the only one that was badly wounded by this incident. In fact, there was someone that was hurt far more deeply than she. I believe it's for that person that Maya is trying her best not to cry.

Phoenix:
(Someone who was hurt more deeply than Maya...) Edgeworth... I think I'm starting to understand, too.

Phoenix:
Owwwww!

von Karma:
Then tell me, Phoenix Wright! Who is Maya Fey being strong for...?

Present Pearl Fey profile

Present anyone else

Gumshoe:
Oh, hey! So this is where you all were! Wow, looks like we've got quite the bunch here toda-- YEOWCH! Wh-What was that for, sir!?

von Karma:
Sorry about that, Scruffy. ...My whip just seems to have a mind of its own.

Phoenix:
What's up, Detective Gumshoe?

Gumshoe:
Oh, you know. This and that. Anyway, congrats on your win! Let's go out tonight, pal! Dinner's on me! My salary's just sorta kinda gone down by a teeny-weeny bit, but it's alright! I made reservations at a first class French restaurant tonight! AAAAAAH!

von Karma:
Pretty good work, Scruffy. That whip was your reward.

Phoenix:
Umm... Detective Gumshoe. You said a first class French restaurant... You don't mean...?

Gumshoe:
TrÃ©s Bien, where else!?

Phoenix:
(I knew it... We're doomed.)

Gumshoe:
Come on! Let's go, everyone! Can't keep Maggey waiting, pal! Hey! You! Crybaby! You're invited, too!

Butz:
Oh... Forget about me. Pearl and I will be at the losers' shack eating potatoes.

Phoenix:
(You know... Maya is taking an awfully long time to get back... She's still out looking for Pearls...) Oh... Maya... What's wrong?

Maya:
Nick... What do I do...? Pearly... I can't find her anywhere!

Phoenix:
Huh...?

Gumshoe:
I'll bet she just went back home. Th-That's all!

Maya:
I thought so too, so I called the village... But no one has heard from her! This has never happened before!

Edgeworth:
As I figured... She has been badly hurt by this incident. She feels responsible for the tragedy that has befallen you, Maya.

Maya:
B-But... None of this was her fault! What... What should I do...?

Phoenix:
...... Detective Gumshoe.

Gumshoe:
Yeah, what is it, pal?

Phoenix:
Could you guys go on ahead?

Gumshoe:
But... But what about you!?

Phoenix:
Maya and I will... We'll join you guys once we find Pearls.

Maya:
Nick...!

Phoenix:
Don't worry about us, Detective Gumshoe. We may be a little late... But we'll definitely be there. We have a lot of celebrating to do tonight, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.

Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah, but you're the... AAAAAAAAAAAH!

von Karma:
Very well, Phoenix Wright. We'll go on ahead.

Edgeworth:
Don't keep us waiting, Wright.

Phoenix:
We won't...

Maya:
B-But where should we look!? Where could Pearly have gone...?

Phoenix:
Let's go, Maya. There's only one place I can think of that Pearls might have gone to...

February 10
Hazakura Temple
Main Gate

Maya:
Hazakura Temple...

Phoenix:
For Pearls, I bet this is a very important place. After all, it's where this whole incident started.

Bikini:
What's this? You're all back again so soon?

Maya:
Sister Bikini?

Bikini:
I thought we'd be eating mashed potatoes alone tonight.

Maya:
S-So she's here? Pearly is here...?

Bikini:
She's in the Training Hall. Why don't you hurry along and go see her?

Maya:
O-OK!

Maya:
Pearly's not here...

Phoenix:
Ah...! Maya! The hanging scroll!

Maya:
Ah! Someone cleaned it off...

Phoenix:
(It's got to be Pearls...)

Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya!

Maya:
P-Pearly...! Why... Why did you just leave like that?

Pearl:
Mystic Maya... Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Pearl:
I swore... I swore that I would never trouble the two of you ever again. Because... It's all my fault that... Mystic Maya's mother...!

Phoenix:
That's why you came here?

Pearl:
It's the least I could do... To pray for your happiness!

Maya:
You don't have to do that, Pearly. It wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. Of course I'm sad that my mother is gone... But... how do I say this? I... I'm still happy.

Pearl:
Y-You don't have to lie just to make me feel better!

Maya:
No, really... It's true... The only reason I'm still here at all is thanks to everyone who was there for me.

Pearl:
...!

Maya:
My sis, my mother, Mr. Armando, Nick... And... you. If even one of you weren't there, I'm sure I wouldn't still be alive right now. That's why... I have to be strong. For all the people that were there for me when I needed them. That's all I can really do.

Pearl:
M-Mystic Maya...

Bikini:
I'm impressed... You truly are the daughter of Mystic Misty.

Maya:
Sister Bikini...!

Bikini:
Your mother, Mystic Misty, was a strong woman indeed. I want to tell you what she said to me that night.

Misty:
After dishonoring the good name of Kurain, I don't have the right to face my daughter. But still... Maya is always in my thoughts. It's true... She'll always be with me, until the day I die...

Bikini:
Your spirit was with her... That's why your mother was so strong. Even at the end... I'm sure she had no regrets.

Maya:
......

Phoenix:
"She'll always be with me, until the day I die", huh...

Maya:
...?

Phoenix:
There's a rule or something all Masters are to follow, isn't there? To never take the charm off until the day you die...

Pearl:
Th-That's the Master's Talisman...

Phoenix:
The thing that Misty kept by her heart and would never take off... It wasn't the container that was important. Rather, it was the contents.

Bikini:
Th-That's...!

Pearl:
A photo?

Maya:
Ah...! M... ...Mother...

Phoenix:
(It's only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others. But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That's the true measure of what human life is worth. We defense attorneys are warriors who are constantly challenged by that question. Even when the battle is over, and the bonds that connect us are severed... We always return... Time and time again. Mia, Maya, Pearls, Mr. Armando... ...and Maya's mother, too... I learned that... from all of them.)

Phoenix:
Well... Shall we get going? Everyone is waiting.

Pearl:
Ah...!

Phoenix:
This is a day to remember. A day when a lot of things were finally put to rest. I think we should celebrate what we've overcome today.

Pearl:
B-But... I-I still can't...

Bikini:
...Oh, go on, sweetie. You can come back for training anytime.

Pearl:
Um... OK!

Maya:
Alright! I'm going to make a brand new start, too! Sister Bikini! I'll be back for more training! I promise!

Bikini:
I know, and I won't go easy on you just because you're the future Master. I'll make sure to prepare reservations for three for when you come back! Wa ha ha ho ho ho hee hee hee!

Maya:
Alright! We're going to have a great feast today, Pearly. You know why? Because training is a battle of endurance!

Pearl:
OK, Mystic Maya! I... I'll eat lots and lots of food tonight!

Phoenix:
...Um, you know. There's one thing I don't get... and probably don't want to, but...

Maya:
What is it, Nick?

Phoenix:
Reservations for training is fine and all... But why for three?

Maya:
Come on! What do you think? You're one of us, Nick! Next time you can train right alongside us!

Phoenix:
Huh?

Bikini:
I'll be waiting for you. Sister Bikini will take special care of you!

Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?

Maya:
It'll be great, Nick! We're going to do the Special Course, naturally!

Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?

Pearl:
That's a great idea! After all, Mr. Nick... ...you'd do anything for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you? Even walk on hot coals, right?

Maya:
We'll have a nice, big meal before we come next time! Right, Nick!?

Phoenix:
...... ...You know... I was wondering if I can say just one little thing...

Maya:
Sure! Of course you can!

Pearl:
Oh, I love this part! I can't wait to hear it...!

Bikini:
I'm getting goosebumps, too!

Phoenix:
Well then... Here goes nothing...

Phoenix:
Objection

Maya:
I'll really have to work extra hard now! Master of Kurain and the office manager of Wright & Co. Law Offices. And I have to be a good big sister to Pearly and Nick, too! Well, as long as I'm not locked up or captured or something like that.

Pearl:
So it's true! Mr. Nick really is Mystic Maya's knight in shining armor! He went through with the Special Course, all the way to the end! Actually, I heard there's a legendary, extra-special Ultra Course here, too. I think I'll surprise the two of them by making them a secret reservation...

Gumshoe:
Maggey bought me a brand new coat as a present, pal! I feel 10 years younger! I'll never take it off!

Byrde:
Yes, but somehow you just don't seem the same! I guess a dirty, shabby old overcoat is just more detective-like, sir.

Gumshoe:
Don't worry about it! In the name of love, a man will soil himself silly!

Andrews:
Mr. Wright, I am once again in your debt. Thanks to you, the Treasures of Kurain exhibit was a great success! I even got to see Ms. von Karma, who I hadn't seen for almost a year. She taught me how to use a whip, and said that I must show you what I've learned...

Ron:
Dessie and I started a company called, "Maskâ˜†DeMasque Consulting".

DesirÃ©e:
We're dedicated to stopping the evil plans of all the criminals in the city!

Ron:
Our motto is, "Cut it out, pleeeeeeeease!"

DesirÃ©e:
Pretty cute, huh!?

Ron:
Well, we also sell plans to the criminals as a kind of side-business... ...I wonder if that's OK. Sometimes I think maybe we're the worst criminals.

Viola:
Mr. Wright... I want to thank you for... exterminating... Don Tigre... I returned the $500,000... along with a tea set. A special thick tea... One I mixed with... my own two hands... I bet he's drinking it now... Win Through Compromise... Hee... Hee... Hee...

Kudo:
I'm just old and in the way! A wrinkly, grumpy, clown-nosed waste of flesh! At least, that's what I thought... But my grandkids had a birthday party for me the other day. Talk about embarrassing. 69 years old and I cried like a baby with a dirty diaper!

Basil:
As usual, we have an abundance of work to do. We've hired a new programmer to replace Glen Elg. I do hope everyone will get along. His name is... Adam Mada. As soon as I heard his name, I knew our brain circuits would align perfectly.

Bikini:
My, my, my. More reporters? Since the murder, we've made so much money, I hardly know what to do! I think the magazines like us because I provide such a nice visual. Especially in Spring. I can hardly wait for Iris to come back. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!

Iris:
...You've turned into such a respectable man, Feenie. It was so sweet of you and everyone else to come and visit me here the other day. Of course I was happy that you constantly had your eyes on me, but... ...I felt kind of bad when the little one slapped you so hard you got a nose bleed.

Oldbag:
What's this!? I'm back from a long and tiring vacation and no one is here to greet me!? I guess while I was gone, my little whippersnapper buddy quit and now I've got no one! And what kind of lonely, crazy security room is this supposed to be anyway!? What with all the flashing lights and switches, I feel like some sort of space alien! And now what am I going to do with all these macadamia nuts I brought back for everyone!? If I bring them over to Edgey-poo, I know exactly what he'd say the instant he saw them. "I really can't accept these, I'm afraid," or something just as painful to this fragile heart. Oh, when will I ever find a gentleman who will treat me like a refined lady?

Ray Gun:
*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*

Butz:
I finally found something I love to do! "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash" is gonna turn the art world on its head! I should have realized it sooner. Self-centered, lazy, anti-social... I'm an artist. A really good portrait artist! I'm not a loser after all!
