Trevor:
*whistling* Hey, man.
Michael:
Fuck... What do you want?
Trevor:
(Approaching Michael before sitting beside him)
I'm your friend, I don't want anything, man. Come on, your company's good enough, huh? Same as always.
Michael:
Yeah... Thanks. I really appreciate that.
Trevor:
So. Family ain't back yet, huh?
Michael:
Nope.
Trevor:
She's a goddamn fool, man.
Michael:
Despite all the chaos of these last few weeks, I think I've finally figured it out. I know, sounds ridiculous.
Trevor:
No. Actually, it does not sound ridiculous. Y'know? Because you, you're a killer. Y'know? You are a man of action! You do not sit on couches, you take scores! You're back man. We are back! Alright? All we gotta go do is bust out Brad, and then we're golden, man! Franklin, he makes us multicultural. Lester makes it cyber. We're like modern America. We just get ourselves a gay friend. Bam!
Michael:
No. It's not it. I got money, it just makes you miserable. I wanna make movies...
Trevor:
Great. That's great... and, uh... so where exactly does this leave me in this second act of your life?
Michael:
We're gonna do this last big job, and then we're gonna dissolve the partnership.
Trevor:
This is not a game to me! Alright? This is a fuckin' way of life.
Michael:
I got a fuckin' family!
Trevor:
Yeah, well, I ain't got nothin'! No one gives a fuck about me!
Michael:
I do.
Trevor:
Oh. Fuck you. I saw your grave. I mourned you. And then it turns out that everything I fucking thought about you was wrong. Everything! You're not dead. And you're not a man.
Michael:
Well, what the fuck are you?
Trevor:
I'm your fucking nightmare!
Michael:
Yeah, enough with your goddamn threats!
Trevor pauses with disgrace, walks away as an angry Michael sits back down. Trevor then gives himself several seconds to think about what Michael just said.
Trevor:
Let me... let me just ask you something. Alright? Something I've been, I've been thinking about. Up in North Yankton, exactly
who
was buried in your place?
Knowing full-well the truth, Michael sits back, concealing his guilty face with an unknowing one.
Michael:
I never gave it any thought.
Trevor:
You know what I'm thinking?
Michael:
I have no clue.
Trevor:
You treacherous piece of shit!
Trevor, realizing the truth, storms towards the door.
Trevor:
You're fuckin' dead! You're fucking dead!
Hopelessly, Michael runs after Trevor.
Michael:
Oh, fuck! Trevor! Hey, T!
The door slams, and the camera cuts to Trevor fleeing Michael's driveway in his car in rage.
If playing as Trevor...
Trevor:
(growling) Fuck!
If playing as Michael...
Michael:

*That's my car, you prick!
*Aw, great.
After leaving the mansion, Michael calls Trevor.
Trevor:
Fuck you.
Michael:
Hey, come on. Where are you going?
Trevor:
You know where I'm going. Fuck you!
Michael:
You don't need to go all the way to North Yankton to find out what I can tell you over a couple beers back at my house. Come on, we'll order pizza.
Trevor:
Fuck you! Fuck your pizza! Fuck everything it stands for!
Michael:
This is insanity.
Trevor:
Ho, no. No, it's clear and reasoned thought. Finally.
Michael:
Come on. Come back, we'll talk.
Trevor:
I'm not gonna listen to another one of your lies!
Michael:
Hey, I'll lay it all out for you. Everything. Turn around.
Trevor:
I'm going up there to see it for myself.
Michael:
You'll be disappointed.
Trevor:
(angry moan) I'll be something.
Michael:
It'll be an anti-climax. The grave's empty. Just a bag of sand, something like that. Just smoke and mirrors.
Trevor:
(angry moan) The lies! How do you do it, man? The game is up!
Michael:
I'm trying to save you a trip.
Trevor:
You've done me enough favors, buddy. Save your fucking breath.
Michael:
Trevor. Come on.
Trevor:
Fuck you, Michael. Soon enough I will.
Trevor hangs up the phone.
Michael:
Shit!
NOTE: The following phone call happens if the player started the mission with Michael.
After Trevor hangs up the phone on Michael, Michael calls Dave.
Dave
(Voice only):
Special Agent Norton.
Michael:
Shit. Davey. Shit, he knows. I think he knows.
Dave
(Voice only):
What, who?
Michael:
Think.
Dave
(Voice only):
Shit. Shit! How?
Michael:
I don't know how. He used his head.
Dave
(Voice only):
But... does he know... does he know it all?
Michael:
Hey, he's on his way up to Ludendorff to confirm his suspicions.
Dave
(Voice only):
Shit! Then what?
Michael:
Then who fuckin' knows what? I don't know! I'm going to go - see if I can reason with him.
Dave
(Voice only):
Well, I'd come but I - I - I...
Michael:
Yeah don't worry about it. This is between me and him. Besides, if it goes wrong up there, I'm sure you ain't far down his list.
Dave
(Voice only):
That's good to know.
As Michael enters the airport, Wei Cheng's men watch him from their car.
Wei Cheng's men:
(in Chinese) His boyfriend has arrived at the airport. We'll have people on whatever plane he boards.
NOTE: The following phone call happens if the player started the mission with Trevor.
After hanging up on Michael, Trevor will call Ron.
Ron
(Voice only):
Trevor? It's great to, ah...
Trevor:
There a plane I can use? Get me across country?
Ron
(Voice only):
Sure. Sure. We got one fueled up for a trip south of the border.
Trevor:
I'm taking it.
Ron
(Voice only):
Is everything okay, man?
Trevor:
Everything is
not
okay. Nothing has ever been okay. But I got to see it for myself. I'm going to see an old friend, alright? If you're where I think you are, buddy... I don't know why id didn't see it. I guess... I guess... I didn't want to. Fuck! Maybe I knew all along. I'm gonna find out for sure, and I'm gonna... do something about it. (angry moan) There was always something wrong with that job. What went down after. I guess I...I guess I wanted to believe. Fucking... fucking flea circus! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!
Ron
(Voice only):
I'm sorry, Trevor.
Trevor goes to the Sandy Shores Airfield and gets into a plane to fly towards North Yankton. He then gets a text message from Ron.
Ron
(Text only):
Shit, T. Theres sum Chinese guys looking for you, asking where ur flying. I think its Chengs ppl. I didn't tell where u was goin. I swear I didn't!
After flying to North Yankton, Trevor arrives as the cemetery. He walks up to Michael's grave.
Trevor:
Who you got in here, huh? As if I need to ask.
Trevor picks up the axe and swings.
Trevor:
Argh! (repetitive moaning and heavy breathing)
NOTE: The following happens if the player started the mission with Michael.
Michael arrives in Ludendorff by car, driving past the town's welcome sign. Along the way, Michael has flashbacks of the 2004 bank robbery, including quotes Michael said to Amanda and his family off-scene, as well as the events that took place during the failed heist.
Michael:
Listen, Amanda. We're going to move to Los Santos. Start over. I made a deal. The slate will be totally wiped clean.
(from Prologue): Alright, everybody pays attention, no one gets hurt!
Trust me, darling. Look at me, Amanda. It was the only thing I could do. Either everyone dies, or one guy gets out. I'm that guy!

(from Prologue): Slow and steady, T, slow and steady.
His name is Dave Norton, nice guy - realist. He gets the glory, I get out. It's not even a decision. Amanda, I don't have a choice. Do you wanna die here where it's always snowing? Or do you wanna go and live where it's always sunny?

(from Prologue): Alright, you wanna live? Tell me you wanna live. Work this out.
Some depot out of town, you don't need to know. Trust me, nothing is gonna go wrong. Nothing.

(from Prologue): Yeah, I hear ya! We gotta follow the plan - everything'll work out.
I did the deal, Amanda. It's over. Baby, we get out. Be happy. Be normal!

(from Prologue): It ain't supposed to go down like this.
We did it. Baby, we are home free. It's over.

(from Prologue): This is fucked, man! The thing is blown!
Just this one job, and everything is done...(strong echoing fades out)
Michael finds Trevor digging up the grave, and slowly walks towards him.
Michael:
Hey, you're wasting your time.
Trevor:
Is that why you flew out here? Huh? Tell me I'm wasting my time?
Trevor continues to break away the rubble and dirt.
Michael:
Go ahead, dig it up. I don't give a shit.
Trevor:
Yeah, it's what you look like, a guy who doesn't give a shit.
Michael:
Ah, this is ridiculous.
Trevor:
How long are you going to keep lying for, Mikey, huh? When's it going to stop? What happens in the dark, comes out in the light.
Michael:
Give it a rest, Trevor. There's nothing there!
Trevor gives it one last swing with the axe, then picks up the spade, ready to break open the casket.
Trevor:
This is it. Moment of truth.
Having broken open the casket, Trevor looks at the corpse with dismay. He throws the spade down, crouches down to the open hole and breaks away the dirt. Brad's face is revealed. Trevor struggles to contain his shock having predicted it. Shouting in rage, he stands up from the casket, glaring despairingly at Michael, who stands over the grave, not daring to look.
Trevor:
As if I didn't know...Brad.
Michael:
Look, we do what we got to do to survive. This thing, it didn't work out the way it was supposed to.
Trevor:
Oh, and how was that, huh? With Brad in the can and me in the ground? Or...or...or-or
both of us
in the coffin?
Michael:
Brad got shot. You saw it! He didn't make it. I got shot, I did. That's, that's it.
Trevor, having known the truth about what happens, jumps out of the grave and stands up to Michael.
Trevor:
I think the only thing that didn't go as planned was me showing up on your doorstep ten years later. Mikey. I mourned you.
Michael:
And I missed you, but I got a fucking family, Trevor. We were all gonna die. He
did
die.
Trevor and Michael quickly pull out pistols and point them at each other.
Trevor:
You reptilian motherfucker!
Michael:
I didn't want it to come to this.
Trevor:
Yes you did, you just don't have the fucking balls to do it, but I do.
Michael:
I've got more to lose than you.
Trevor:
Never a truer word has been spoken, brother. Now pull the fucking trigger. You ain't got the guts.
Michael:
Take the fucking shot!
Wei Cheng's men emerge from tombstones behind Michael, pointing their weapons at the pair.
Trevor:
Who is that?
Michael turns around, and Trevor sees the opportunity to fire, but the gun jams. He throws the gun at Michael and makes a break for it.
Trevor:
*clink* Fuck!
Michael:
Fuck!
Michael swings back round and fires at Trevor, who's breaking open the cemetery's rear gate.
Wei Cheng's men:
Trevor Philips, Mr. Cheng has requested a word.
Trevor escapes the cemetery, leaving Michael to defend himself from Mr. Cheng's men. He ducks behind a tombstone with his gun still drawn.
Michael:
Hey, ho, ho, I'm not the guy you're looking for.
Wei Cheng's men:
(in Chinese) Hey, he's over here, he's over here. (in English) Get the boyfriend.
Michael:
Boyfriend? Motherfucker.
Michael fights off Mr. Cheng's men as he makes his way back to the car. Along the way, a Burrito full of Mr. Cheng's men enters the cemetery.
Michael:
Who're your friends, T?
Wei Cheng's men:
Stop the van - go find him!
Michael fights off more of Mr. Cheng's men.
Michael:
You shoulda gone after the other guy! This is how many guys you send to kill Trevor Philips? Philips went that a way.
Wei Cheng's men:
We know you are weak and feminine.
Michael reaches his car and attempts to start it to no avail.
Michael:
Trevor... Fuck!
Triad Member #1:
(speaking in Chinese) Shit, there he is!
Wei Cheng's men reach Michael's car and hold him at gunpoint.
Triad Member #1:
(speaking in Chinese) Let me see your hands!
Triad Member #2:
You got nowhere to go, boyfriend.
Michael:
Alright, alright...
Triad Member #2:
Get out the fucking car.
Meanwhile, Trevor is flying back to San Andreas, heading to land his plane back at the airfield. He then gets a phone call from Wei Cheng.
Trevor:
Trevor Philips Industries.
Wei Cheng
(Voice only):
Mr. Philips, this is Wei Cheng. You know my eldest son, Tao.
Trevor:
Yeah. The X nut, backed out of a contract we agreed on. How is he?
Wei Cheng
(Voice only):
Still learning the ropes, thank you. My friends miss you in North Yankton. I was hoping we could talk.
Trevor:
(laughs) Was that your people? (in a mock Chinese accent) Of course, sorry I had to cut out.
Wei Cheng
(Voice only):
Your operation causes problem for me. I want to expand into Blaine County, but your business and your temperament prevent me from making inroads.
Trevor:
Ah, well, too bad. (in a mock Chinese accent) I don't know what you can do 'bout that.
Wei Cheng
(Voice only):
I've already done something. We have your lover.
Trevor:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My
lover?!
Wei Cheng
(Voice only):
Michael De Santa. You lived in your trailer together...with your maid...and then you were alone in that big house. Well, you are clearly very close. You know, how much will you give up for his safety?
Trevor:
(laughs) My lover? Yeah, right. That's a tough break. I'd never want to double cross a friend, and put him in danger, but you got to do what you got to do. My business ain't going anywhere.
Wei Cheng
(Voice only):
I'm serious about this.
He will die.
Trevor:
Tell him I love him dearly.
As Trevor lands the plane on the airfield, he receives a text message from Lamar.
Lamar
(Text only):
Eh, crazy man! Meet me at my crib. Me n Frank goin roll on tht last car for the rich dude. U in?

Wade:
And Trevor is...
Floyd:
Trevor... Trevor is a...
Trevor:
Trevor is a what?
Wade:
Trevor is... a good guy. He's like family, that's it ain't it, Floyd?
Floyd:
Tha-tha-tha-that's right, yes, Trevor. B-b-b-b-but the thing is, umm... I ain't been with that many women. I don't find it easy, and umm... and Debra, w-w-we're getting married so...
Trevor:
Oh, that's beautiful.
Floyd:
B-but I'm scared that she's gonna leave me. I mean this is her place and the fornicatin'... There's Mr. Raspberry Jam...
Floyd points at the teddy bear.
Trevor:
Whoa! Whoa! Now Mr. Raspberry Jam... He died a noble death. Bringing great joy to a... lonely man.
Floyd:
I ain't got a very big penis! Some girls laugh when they... When they look at it.
Trevor:
Well, show me.
Floyd:
Oh, no...
Trevor:
Show me, boy!
Floyd:
I-I-I-I-I-I-I don't want to.
Trevor takes off his pants and shows Floyd his penis.
Trevor:
Mine ain't nothin' special, but this boy gets the job done. Alright? Now, Wade here says that you work at the docks?
Floyd:
Umm, yes.
Trevor:
Look at me!
Floyd:
Can you just... put your Johnson away? Sir?
Trevor:
Ah, Jesus.
Trevor puts his pants back on.
Floyd:
Yes, I work at the docks.
Trevor:
And? Anything uh, interesting there for a man like me?
Floyd:
Well I mean I-I-I don't rightly... rightly know. What kinda person are you?
Trevor grabs Floyd by the collar.
Trevor:
Oh, I'm that kind of person, Floyd! I am that kind of person! Now, let's get you, Wade and that... little tormentor down there, to put these on.
Trevor gives Floyd and Wade boxes with dock worker outfit.
Trevor:
We... are going for a ride. Gentlemen, the gateway to America awaits!
They leave the apartment.
Trevor:
(speaking to Ron over the phone) Ron, we got an inside man at the Port of LS. I'm gonna send you some information. I need you on point to help plan things.
Ron:
I got it T, I really miss...
Trevor hangs up. Wade, Floyd and Trevor get in Trevor's truck.
Trevor:
Come on then, Floyd. What you got for me?
Floyd:
Like I said, I don't rightly know what we got. You're going to have to be more exact in your questioning, sir.
Trevor:
Err... we're looking for something to steal.
Floyd:
Sir, I stole a pencil in elementary school and I've been regretting it ever since.
Wade:
Floyd always was a stick in the mud.
Floyd:
Look, sir, please, just tell me what you want and I'll do my utmost to assist you in finding it.
Trevor:
Here's the problem. I don't know what I want. It's a bit, well, like pornography or a perfect turd, I can't quite describe it, but I'll know it when I see it.
Floyd:
You ain't aiding my comprehension.
Trevor:
Alright, alright. How's this? Two hundred and thirty six billion dollars worth of cargo came through The Port of Los Santos last year.
Wade:
He's real good with numbers.
Trevor:
I don't want to hijack a truck full of pineapples, Floyd. You need to give us the inside track on what's coming through.
Floyd:
We don't know what's in the containers. They certainly don't put price tags on 'em.
Trevor:
Have you noticed anything? Anything different? Anything that might indicate something...
Floyd:
Well, there's been all these Merryweather folks hanging around.
Trevor:
Merryweather Security Consulting? Private army to the New World Order?
Wade:
My butt's gone numb.
Trevor:
The folks waging outsourced shadow wars in twenty countries around the globe, and recently cleared to operate on US soil?
Floyd:
That, umm, sounds like them.
Trevor:
So, there's a private militia in the port. What are they guarding?
Floyd:
This one freighter. I guess now that you mention it, it ain't quite right.
Trevor:
A freighter. Perfect. Can I get on board?
Floyd:
No, no. They won't let you anywhere near it. They're kind of assholes about it actually. The other day my colleague, Ralph...
Trevor:
I don't give a shit about Ralph. We got to take a look. Is there anything else?
Floyd:
There's another bunch of Merryweather guys out by the navy warehouse. They got boats coming in and out. I heard they was testing something.
Trevor:
Alright. We'll take a look at that as well.
They arrive at the Pier 400.
Port Worker 1:
Go park and get to dispatch.
Floyd:
Uh, yep! Will do!
Trevor:
Go park and get to dispatch.
Trevor parks next to dispatch.
Port Worker 2:
Come on. Shift's about to start.
Floyd:
Here comes the supe'. I got to check in.
Trevor:
Remember, Floyd. This can go real wrong, real quick.
Union Boss:
We got a waste spillage, and I got a slot on the cleanup crew.
Trevor:
There is nothing that Wade here ain't gonna do for a warm meal.
Union Boss:
Hope you got a strong stomach, son. Get in there!
Trevor and Floyd walk away.
Trevor:
You gonna take me to see this freighter?
Floyd:
Yeah, it's over here.
Trevor:
You ever get helicopters coming in and out of here? You know those big sky crane things that can pick up a whole container?
Floyd:
Now, this is restricted airspace. They won't let anything out of here without clearance. Shoot it down if they have to.
Trevor:
So, how's a man in a hurry supposed to get in and out of this place?
Floyd:
Well, we got a port that's dredged to fifty feet.
Trevor:
What's the coast guard response like?
Floyd:
Well, they got cutters, forty five foot response vessels, air support... you're not gonna move much faster than them. 'Specially if you're carrying something.
Trevor:
Maybe I'll have to saddle you up and ride you across the Miriam Turner Overpass.
Floyd:
I just said they had the water surface real covered.
Trevor:
Okay.
Floyd:
That is the freighter I told you about.
Trevor:
What do you think they got on it?
Floyd:
We just stevedore them, we ain't meant to know what's in the containers.
Trevor:
But?
Floyd:
But these are marked military. Government.
Trevor:
Anything weird about that?
Floyd:
The government stuff is hot freight. Pulls up, goes right through. This stuff's... just been sitting here.
Trevor:
You are beginning to arouse my... curiosity.
Floyd:
Over there. Two o'clock. Looks like Forrest got on the wrong side of some Merryweather guys.
Port Worker 3:
You. You. We need two guys on the handler. Couple of containers in bay B got to be brought up to F. That ain't a question. Get on it. Now!
Floyd:
You drive and I'll spot.
Floyd and Trevor get on the Dock Handler.
Trevor:
How about I run that prick over in this thing?
Floyd:
I thought you wanted to 'scope' the place. We don't get the containers, they're gonna check your card. I'm getting nervous.
Trevor:
You're always nervous. Relax.
Floyd:
Not always, sir. Just around you. And it's just... cousin Wade's on his own. He better hold it together. Stick to the story.
Trevor:
He'll be fine. Boy's on a waste clearance crew. He's never happier than when he's neck deep in shit.
They approach the Bay B containers.
Floyd:
It's those containers. Bay B.
Trevor grabs the first container with the container handler
Floyd:
Now we got to bring it over to bay F.
Trevor:
I know why they call 'em handlers. Because they handle like a dream.
Floyd:
This ain't a toy, sit, it's heavy machinery.
Trevor:
Thank fuck I'm high as a kite.
Floyd:
You should not be operating this vehicle while under the influence.
Trevor:
I'll operate you under the influence if you're not careful.
The first container is moved to the Bay F.
Trevor:
You happy? Now, I'll get the other one for you. Me, anyway. I'm going to need a better view of that freighter.
Floyd:
I'm sorry, but this is as close as you goin' to get.
Trevor:
Nah, nah, nah. I need to take some pictures, send 'em to my guy, Ron. I'll need a proper view.
Floyd:
There's the cranes, but...
Trevor:
Cranes. Perfect.
Floyd:
Oh, shoot.
Trevor grabs the second container with the container handler.
Trevor:
Hey, whose dick you have to suck to get this job? Being a stevedore used to be a back-breaking work, now you're paid brain surgeon bucks to push an oversized shopping cart.
Floyd:
I did not fellatiate no one to get this job. Debra's old friends with the, well, with the...
Trevor:
Bluh... with the... with the... Say no more. You didn't fellate no one, but darling Debbie probably did, and she probably enjoyed it.
The second container is left at the Bay F.
Trevor:
Okay. It's up to the top of the crane for me.
Trevor climbs up to the top of a container crane.
Port Worker 4:
Hey, there ain't time to admire the view. I been waiting on a crane driver nearly an hour.
Trevor:
I'm not permitted to drive cranes, buddy.
Port Worker 4:
Hey, you need me to get your Union rep up here, right now? Sooner you get in the cab, sooner we can get out of here.
Trevor:
This is on you.
Trevor enters the crane cabin.
Trevor:
Alright, I'm here. What do I do?
Port Worker 4:
Pick up the containers down this the end, and put 'em on the trucks at the other end.
Trevor lines up the spreader and the container.
Port Worker 4:
That's lined up. Move the spreader down so it can grab the container.
Trevor attaches the spreader to the container
Port Worker 4:
It's hooked up. So, lift it high enough to clear that container stack, and move it to the other end. We need to go to the other end - bay five. Keep going, keep going. That's the truck. Ease her onto it. You want to line it up with the frame of the truck.
Trevor places the container onto the truck and lets it go.
Port Worker 4:
Truck is clear to go. And you said you wasn't qualified. Go back up the other end and start again. Line up the second red container at the end.
Trevor moves the second container onto the truck and lets it go.
Port Worker 4:
Alright. You're done. Break time.
Trevor:
How about this view, eh? I'm going to take some photos for the kids.
Trevor takes three photos of the ship and sends them to Ron. After that, he gets off the crane.
Floyd:
Trevor, you wanna see that warehouse? Come on. We can use the big rig.
Trevor and Floyd get in the loaded truck.
Floyd:
It's on the other side of Port City. So, they been guarding one of them dry docks. We can take a look at it, but no one's allowed round there.
Trevor:
Normal rules don't apply to us, Floyd. We're going in.
Floyd:
I don't know. Rules applied to me my whole life. I like rules.
Trevor:
And look at you. You're a failure. You're in a loveless relationship...
Floyd:
What do you mean, loveless? I love Debra.
Trevor:
If she loved you, she'd be here, wouldn't she? But she's not.
Floyd:
You know I'm insecure...
Trevor:
You've got a dead end job.
Floyd:
What? Dead end? No.
Trevor:
Floyd - it's dead end.
Floyd:
Being a unionized longshoreman's one of the best paying jobs in the country. You tell people round La Puerta that's what you do, they liable to rob you, they're so jealous.
Trevor:
No one's jealous of you, Floyd. They pity you. You're abused by that woman. You're abused by these slave drivers. I mean, I've never worked so had in my life.
Floyd:
It ain't so bad. I been doing this every day for ten years. Only usually with less of the criminality.
Trevor:
You're wasting your life, Floyd. It's lucky we turned up when we did. I'm saving you. From yourself.
Floyd:
We ain't heard from Wade.
Trevor:
What are you, his mother? He's fine.
Floyd:
A spillage shouldn't take this long to contain. There must be a lot of it.
Trevor:
Good. Keep him busy, while we get to work.
Trevor and Wade arrive at the Los Santos Naval Port.
Merryweather Guard 1:
Hey, hey, hey, hey! You can't come through here. It's restricted access.
Trevor:
(leaving the truck) No entiendo. No understand you. Huh? Manifesto. Manifesto say, deliver here.
Merryweather Guard 2:
Hey! Stop! (grabs Trevor by the neck) Where the fuck do you think you're going!? Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Multiple Merryweather guards surround Trevor and Floyd.
Merryweather Guard 3:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Merryweather Guard 4:
Hey! Hey, hey!
Merryweather Guard 5:
Back it up! Back it up!
Floyd:
He must have got confused. The guy don't speak English. He must have misread the manifest. It's all a misunderstanding.
Trevor:
He said... He said to go here.
Floyd:
The guy writing it must have...
Floyd is knocked down and attacked by guards. Trevor uses the opportunity to sneak into the guardhouse and steal the shipping manifest and leaves the Los Santos Naval Port.
Trevor:
Sorry, you're going to have to go it alone.
Ron calls Trevor.
Ron:
Trevor, these photos... you've really stumbled onto something. The ship... Merryweather.
Trevor:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Tell me about the ship. If we put a man with a gun on the bridge next to it, and get a guy on board, I think we got a good chance of taking over.
Ron:
Way it looks to me, there's a container below deck. They're guarding it for the government - keeping it off the books. Serious military technology, most like.
Trevor:
Yeah, of course. I just found a manifest. They're testing something out at sea, it's gotta be that. Now, get back to work. If the TPI conglomerate ain't thriving, there's only one man responsible.
Ron:
Of course, yeah, but I'll start pulling all the intel I can get on Merryweather at the same time. I got a file here somewhere.
Ron hangs up. Trevor arrives at the Floyd's apartment. Wade is sitting on the couch covered in industrial waste.
Trevor:
What in the name of all things holy?
Wade:
I-I-I tried to stop it, but it just kept... coming... and coming...
Trevor:
There, there, Wade. You're just not cut out for honest work, alright?
Wade:
Did you get what you needed?
Trevor:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, more or less, yeah. I just gotta figure out a place to plan this now. Alright, this'll do, huh.
Trevor takes Debra's portrait and throws it onto floor, breaking it.
Wade:
That woman ain't even fine. Ain't no one understands why Floyd lets her use him so.
Trevor:
Oh, it's low self-esteem, Wade. We gotta build him back up.
Trevor starts drawing the plan on the wall.
Trevor:
Now... And... There... Perfect!
Trevor starts explaining the plan. The camera points at various parts of the "planning board" during the explanation.
Trevor:
Alright, so, based on my observations, I'd say these Merryweather security cocksnots are sitting on something real valuable. I think they got two of these things, but we only need one. The first one is on that freighter, in a container below deck. They got guards all over that ship, so it's likely they're keeping it on ice. The air, land and sea routes into the port'll be locked down as soon as we make a noise. At these x's here. Which means we have to blow up the ship, and grab the thing underwater. Need a guy to plant the bombs, a guy to look out for him with a rifle, and a guy to grab teh thing, whatever it is, underwater. That means stealing us a submarine, of course, but you can find us one of them, can't ya?
Wade:
Huh?
Trevor:
Now, the other one is off the coast being tested. They're running the operation from the dock where I last saw your cousin. We'll need a submarine for that too, and probably a chopper, a big one. We go out there, look around underwater, locate it, bring it back here, and find out what it is.
Wade:
Here? To the condo?
Trevor:
Alright, so what do we think? Container ship, or whatever's offshore?
The player decides on the approach.
Trevor:
(If the player chooses the Freighter approach)
It's gotta be the container, right?
(If the player chooses the Offshore approach)
Offshore. Deep sea adventure. Got to be.
The player confirms their choice.
Trevor:

*You and Floyd can help. And we'll bring along Michael and his unpaid intern.
*You and Floyd can help. We'll get Michael involved and he can put us in touch with some local talent.
Trevor:
Okay! Alright!
Floyd gets in the apartment.
Floyd:
What is that smell?
Trevor:
Oh! We are going straight to the local Union Rep. Wade here was injured in the performance of his duties. Human waste has seeped into his very pores, and I am sorry to say this but, I don't think he's ever going to smell normal... again.
Floyd:
You can't go to the Union.
Trevor:
You are Union, alright, and you vouched for us, alright? Look at him, man! Smell him! Smell him!
Floyd:
Trevor! Trevor, I... You're planning a robbery on my place of work! You violated Mr. Raspberry Jam and... God alone knows what else!
Floyd notices Debra's broken portrait which was hidden by Wade until then.
Floyd:
You damaged Debra... look, my lady and my Union... that's all I got. So why don't we just, why don't we just let this all slide? Huh?
Trevor:
If you're comfortable... with what's happened to your cousin, then so be it, alright? But I would give him a bath and rinse him off.
Wade:
No! No baths!
