Mugman: What're we doing at the dock?

Cuphead: Oh, you'll see.

(They both walk through the dock, and Mugman is eating a candied apple.)

Cuphead: Tell me, Mugsy, you ever wish you were a pirate?

(They dodge a box being thrown and walk over a dead shark.)

Mugman: You know very well I do.

Cuphead: Well, all your swashbuckling dreams are about to come true, 'cause we're gonna have a high seas adventure!

(The camera zooms out to Captian Brineybeard's ship.)

Mugman: We don't know the first thing about sailing. We could end up dead!

(Cuphead snatches Mugman's candied apple.)

Cuphead: That, my little blue nosed friend, is why it's called an adventure!

(A seagull grabs Mugman's candied apple.)

Mugman: Ooh, my candied apple!

Cuphead: Adventure!

(Cuphead starts climbing aboard Brineybeard's ship but stops.)

Mugman: Wait. Wait. Wait wait wait, You can't just climb aboard someone's ship. You need permission first!

Cuphead: Only if the ship's painted red.

Mugman: The ship is painted red!

Cuphead: I wasn't finished. Painted red-purp-orange!

Mugman: (Angrily) Red-purp-orange isn't even a color!

Cuphead: So we're good then!

(Cuphead continues to climb on.)

Mugman: I refuse to board without permission.

Cuphead: Suit'cha self! Wow, so amazing! Mugman, you gotta see this!

Mugman: (Angrily) Not without permission!

Cuphead: Oh, look at this! I can't believe it!

(Mugman tries to resist himself.)

Cuphead: (Laughter) And one of these? I've always wanted one of these! Holy Toledo! Is that...? Mugman, you're missin' out! YOU could be havin' a high sea's adventure right now!

Mugman: (Enraged) Don't you think I want that!? NOT WITHOUT PERMISSION!!!

Cuphead: Well then, permission to come aboard!

Mugman: Yaaay! Haha.

WIP

Captain BrineyBeard: Bite your tongue! (He draws his sword) Or me sword will bite it for you!

Sword: You can bite it or I can bite it. But either way, its gonna get bit.

Kettle: Well, it's that time again, boys. [sprinkles food into the fish bowl] I'm off to my weekly mustache wax. Now, remember. Two rules while I'm gone. Number one, don't touch my radio. [He points to said radio, which is on a table] It is my most prized object after all. And of course, rule number two, no fighting!

[Kettle slams the door, but opens it to double-check. He closes the door and leaves. Cuphead and Mugman look at eachother then start fighting. Their fight cloud knocks into some of the furniture, which fortunately doesn't break. However, when they near the radio, they pause. The two carefully make their way around it, and continue fighting.]

Mugman: Hold it! [He yells, pausing the fight once more] Cuphead, why are we fighting again?

Cuphead: Uh, 'cause we're not supposed to?

Mugman: Right!

[They proceed to fight, until someone knocks on the door. Thinking it's Kettle, the brothers rush to the door, and open it.]

Both: Back so soon, dearest Kettle? [They notice a basket on their doorstep, with a note inside. They pick up the note, and read it] "Please take care of baby." [They exchange looks with each other, confused. They lower the note to see a baby, much to their adoration] Aw!

Mugman: How could someone leave something so precious? [He picks up the baby and heads back inside]

Cuphead: Uh, Mugman? [He follows Mugman inside, closing the door] What are we supposed to do with a baby?

Mugman: We show it love, of course. [He sits down] Just watch and learn. Hello, baby. My name is Mugman. Can you say Mu...

Baby Bottle: Mama.

Mugman: [squeals] That's right, baby! That's exactly right! Boop! [He boops the baby's nose, making him giggle]

Cuphead: Well, then, I guess that makes me Dada, doesn't it? [He picks up the baby] Right? Dada?

[Instead, the baby starts crying, much to Cuphead's concern. He begins to run around in a circle, screaming and panicking]

Cuphead: [yells] Mugman, why's it crying?!

Mugman: You need to burp him, Cuphead!

[Cuphead stops in front of his brother, and attempts to do so, but fails.]

Cuphead: I don't think it's working.

Mugman: Maybe he needs his diaper changed? [The boys freeze in disgust of that thought; Trying to change the subject] Or I could try burping him again.

Cuphead: Yeah, that's a great idea. [He hands the baby to Mugman.]

Mugman: It's all right, baby. [The baby's stomach rumbles, burps and then giggles.] Yeah. That's better.

Baby Bottle: Mama!

Cuphead: Hey, it worked! Boop!

[Cuphead pokes the baby's nose and it bites his finger.]

Cuphead: YEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!! Did you see that?! That thing bit me!

Mugman: [gasps] Cuphead! Baby is not a "thing." Baby is a baby. [The baby coos, then blows a raspberry at Cuphead] I think you two need to learn to get along while I prepare some baby food. [He sets the two of them down on the couch] And now, remember! All baby needs is love!

[Cuphead sits down awkwardly, looking at the ground, then at the baby, slightly smiling. Trying to make the baby laugh, he begins flicking his lips.]

Cuphead: Peekaboo! Peekaboo! Peekaboo! [The baby doesn't seem to be amused. He makes a funny face, but ends up getting milk sprayed in his face. It gasps] Now, baby, you know it's not polite to... [The baby sprays milk in his face again] Whoa! [The milk knocks him into the antique china, leaving him to catch the falling items; some with his hand, some with his foot. He places them back on the china]

Cuphead: Phew!

Baby Bottle: Mama!

[Cuphead notices the baby crawling into the closet]

Cuphead: Baby, no! [He runs after it, but once he opens the closet, a ton of junk collapses onto him, much to his pain. The baby comes crawling over the junk, sliding to the floor. Cuphead sticks his head out of the rubble, dizzy, with a bowling ball rolling around his head--falling into it. He then sees the baby ripping pages out of a book, emerging back into the mess, scrambling out of it.]

Cuphead: Baby! [The baby throws the book at him, falling on it's back and laughing.]

Mugman: [hears the laughing] I just knew they'd get along.

Cuphead: [annoyed] Now, baby... [He sees the baby shaking the radio, which Kettle specifically told them not to touch. He screams, saving the radio from falling] Phew! [angry] Bad baby! Bad... [notices it's gone] Baby?

Baby: Mama? [Cuphead gasps]

[The baby is seen on the shelf, slowly pushing the fish towards the edge.]

Cuphead: Don't do it. Easy... Easy... Oh, come on!

Mugman: Cuphead! Glass on the floor?! Baby could get hurt!

Cuphead: Well, baby broke the fish bowl!

Mugman: You were supposed to be watching baby!

Cuphead: That baby is not a normal... Wait. Where's baby?

Both: Baby!

Cuphead: Where'd it go?!

Mugman: How should I know?!

Both: There you are. Open up, baby! Open the door!

Cuphead: Mugman, you gotta listen to me. Something's wrong with that baby. We gotta get rid of it.

Mugman: Not a chance, Cuphead. Baby needs our love!

Cuphead: What it needs is a leash!

Mugman: Cuphead! The way you're talking, it's like you never even wanted a baby!

Cuphead: I didn't!

Mugman: Oh, well, then... I guess I'll do all the parenting myself.

Cuphead: Be my guest! Hmph!

Mugman: Baby? Would you be a darling and open the door for Mama?

Both: Elder Kettle's radio!

Mugman: No! Bad baby! Bad!

Baby: Mama.

Cuphead: [worried] Uh, I don't like that crazy glint in his eye.

Mugman: Oh, nonsense, Cuphead.

Cuphead: But...

Mugman: Calm down. Wait right there. I've had this bear since I was a tiny baby. It means the world to me. It was always there to cheer me up, and now it'll be there for you. I'm gonna kill that thing!

Cuphead: Mugman, no! It's a baby!

Mugman: It's not a baby! It's evil. It's gone!

Mugman: My eyes!

Cuphead: That's it! I'm calling for help. Hello, Operator? Get me the police! Hello? Hello? He cut the line!

Both: AAAHH!

Mugman: Now what do we do?!

Cuphead: Dresser.

Mugman: Huh?

Cuphead: Dresser!

Cuphead: Chair.

Mugman: No. Dresser.

Cuphead: No, chair!

Both: Baby, no!

Baby: Mama!

Both: No!

Kettle: Door ripped off its hinges? Piano on fire? Fishbowl shattered? Fish missing? Antique china in pieces? Dresser smashed into wall? More fire? Eh. Boys will be boys. My radio! My most prized object! [growls]

Both: Baby did it.

Baby: Mama.

Kettle: Aw! This little cutie-patootie? Oh! Bad baby!

Baby: Mama.

Kettle: Boys! Help!

Kettle: Okay. On three. One, two, three!

Both: Aw!

Baby: Mama.

Woman: So cute! "Please take care of baby." Oh! Let's get you inside.

Henchman: Uh, hey, boss, want some leftover congratulations cake? Uh, you look mad for somebody who just got that cup's soul. Congratulations, by the way.

Devil: I didn't actually get his soul yet, okay? I just said that to buy myself some time before Stickler finds out. I hate that guy.

Henchman: Oh! I know what'd make you feel better, boss. The Obliterator! It's a new ride down at the Inkwell Pier. They say it goes so fast, it'll tear the clothes right off of you.

Devil: The only thing that'll make me feel better is getting that cup's soul. He's gotta take that sweater off sometime.

Mugman: You're wearing that sweater forever!

Cuphead: But...

Mugman: No buts. That sweater's the only way the Devil can't get your soul. You can never take it off! Ever!

Cuphead: Eh. I ain't too worried about it.

Devil: Your soul is mine!

Mugman: He's never taking that sweater off!

Cuphead: Yeah. Give it up!

Devil: Never!

Devil: Give it to me!

Devil: Give me...

Devil: your...

Devil: soul!

Announcer: Will the fireproof pants of Dirk Dangerous be enough to save a flaming bank vault full of orphans? Tune in tomorrow for the stunning conclusion of Dirk Dangerous vs. Pyromaniac Pete!

Cuphead: So sweat-inducing!

Mugman: You wanna see something even more sweat-inducing?

Cuphead: Do I?

Mugman: It's a new ride! New, Cuphead, new! Says here it'll go so fast, it'll... something. I dunno. But it's new, Cuphead, new!

Cuphead: Oh! If we go now, we can get there before Elder Kettle wakes up from his nap.

Devil: Hand it over. Oh!

Cuphead: Would you get outta here? Elder Kettle can't see you.

Devil: Who is Elder Ket...

Cuphead: Would you cut that out?! Look, meet me around back.

Devil: Listen, you little shoehorn... Stupid cup making me go around the back. I'm the Devil! Nobody tells me what to...

Cuphead: Do you have any idea how much trouble we'll be in if Elder Kettle sees you here?!

Devil: You already are in trouble! You owe me your soul!

Kettle: Hey! What's with all the noise?!

Cuphead: Uh, nothing. That was just a large cat... man.

Kettle: Well, tell him I'm taking a nap! And another thing. Paint that fence! It looks terrible!

Cuphead: Thanks to your little tantrum, the fence is all burnt up!

Mugman: Yeah! What do you intend to do about that, huh?

Devil: Nothing! I'm the Devil!

Cuphead: Hmm... Tell you what. You paint the fence, I take off the sweater.

Mugman: Cuphead: Are you crazy?

Cuphead: Hold on. Let's see where I go with this. Well, what do you say?

Devil: Let's see. I paint the fence. You take off the sweater. I take your soul. Hmm... Painting the fence. Oh, yes. Oh!

Cuphead: Have you ever actually painted a fence?

Mugman: Looks like you have no idea what you're doing.

Devil: Is that so? Watch this. And on the one, and on the two, here we go.

Cuphead: This line! Hmm, say, Mugsy, hold my spot. I'm gonna go grab us some funnel cake.

Mugman: You don't like funnel cake.

Cuphead: You don't like knitting soul-saving invisible sweaters, but you made me one. The least I can do is buy you some funnel cake. Can I borrow five bucks?

Devil: And that is how you paint a fence! Unbelievable! Where did those two nitwits go?

Cuphead: There was a little powdered-sugar mishap.

Mugman: No problem! I never say no to extra sugar. Let's hope I don't eat any invisible sweater hairs.

Cuphead: You might. If I didn't take it off hours ago.

Mugman: You what?!

Cuphead: I took off the sweater.

Mugman: Well, where is it?!

Cuphead: Hmm... Looks like I don't remember.

Mugman: What happened to "never take it off"?!

Cuphead: Big deal. It's not like the Devil's around or anything. The Devil!

Mugman: Stay calm, Cuphead. He doesn't know you took the sweater off.

Cuphead: Oh, yeah!

Devil: I painted your little fence. Now, off with the sweater. Let's go.

Cuphead: How do we know you painted the fence?

Devil: I don't know. Go look! It's actually quite good.

Cuphead: Fat chance, buddy. We've been waiting in line all day to ride the Obliterator.

Devil: The what now?

Henchman: Hey, boss. It's the Obliterator, remember? It'll tear the clothes right off of you.

Devil: On second thought, I think I'll join you, boys. This ride looks like fun.

Cuphead: That's the spirit!

Mugman: Uh, hey, Cuphead. Maybe you should go back to the cottage? In case you forgot something you took off and need to put back on?

Cuphead: But it's almost time for the ride.

Mugman: I'll go. Always doing everything around here because he took off the sweater.

Cuphead: Hey, Devil. Wanna hear a joke?

Devil: I hear nothing.

Cuphead: What's worse than finding a worm in your apple? Finding half a worm in your apple. Get it? 'Cause that would mean you ate the other half? Get it? 'Cause it's only half of it in there? 'Cause you ate the other half?

Devil: Yes! I get it! Thank you!

Cuphead: You know what's worse than finding half a worm in your apple?

Devil: What?

Cuphead: Falling in a sewer. I saw a smile!

Devil: You most certainly did not.

Mugman: Where did he put it?! If I was Cuphead, where would I put an invisible sweater?

Announcer: Attention, Dirk Dangerous fans. Did our last sweat-inducing episode leave you sweatier than ever?

Cuphead: And then the banana says, "Thursday!"

Devil: How delightfully unexpected! You know, Cuphead, you're not so bad after all.

Cuphead: Thanks.

Devil: You're not wearing the sweater!

Cuphead: Uh... Am too!

Devil: Are not!

Mugman: You're right. He's not wearing the sweater. You are!

Devil: Well, that went just as I planned. Yow!

Henchman: Uh, sorry, boss.

Devil: And where is the sweater now?

Henchman: It's hidden away... in an undisclosed location.

Devil: Thank you, Henchman. Perfect. Without the sweater, I can just go and take that cup's soul any time I want! Yow!

Henchman: Uh, sorry, boss.

Cuphead: Wow! What a great day.

Mugman: Except I'm pretty sure the Devil's angrier than ever, and you no longer have the one thing that'll stop him getting your soul.

Cuphead: True. But, hey, I got the best brother in the world looking out for me. Really makes me feel so much less exposed.
