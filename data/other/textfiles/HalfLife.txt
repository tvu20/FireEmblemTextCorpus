Announcer: "Good morning, and welcome to the Black Mesa transit system. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. The time is 8:47 A.M. Current topside temperature is 93 degrees with an estimated high of 105. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times. This train is inbound from level 3 dormitories to sector C test labs and control facilities. If your intended destination is a high security area beyond sector C, you will need to return to the central transit hub in area 9 and board a high security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the retinal clearance system, you must report to Black Mesa personnel for processing before you will be permitted into the high security branch of the transit system. "Due to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in the Black Mesa compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the Black Mesa transit system. Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please, stay away from electrified rails and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives. " Words appear on the screen as the announcer continues: SUBJECT: Gordon Freeman Male, Age 27 EDUCATION: Ph.D., MIT, Theoretical Physics POSITION: Research Associate ASSIGNMENT: Anomalous Materials Laboratory CLEARANCE: Level 3 ADMINISTRATIVE SPONSOR: Classified DISASTER RESPONSE PRIORITY: Discretionary Announcer: "A reminder: that the Black Mesa Hazard Course decathalon will commence this evening at 1900 hours in the Level 3 facility.

If you feel you have been exposed to radioactive or other hazardous materials in the course of your duties, contact your radiation safety officer immediately. Work safe, work smart. Your future depends on it." The train stops at a long catwalk and a security officer walks toward it. Announcer: "Now arriving at sector C test labs and control facilities. Please stand back from the automated door, and wait for the security officer to verify your identity. Before exiting the train, be sure to check your area for personal belongings. Thank you, and have a very safe and productive day." Security Guard: "Mornin, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you're runnin late." Freeman steps into the airlock. Words onscreen announce the beginning of: ANOMALOUS MATERIALS Freeman walks up to the desk. There is a security guard and a scientist. Security Guard: "Hey, Mr. Freeman. I had a bunch of messages for you, but we had a system crash about 20 minutes ago, and I'm still tryin to find my files. Just one of those days, I guess. They were havin some problems down in the test chamber, too, but I think that's all straightened out. They told me to make sure you headed down there as soon as you got into your hazard suit." Freeman pushes a button, causing a computer terminal to pop up. Scientist: "Get away from there, Freeman! I'm expecting an important message!" Freeman pushes a button under the desk, setting off a security alarm. Scientist: "My God! What are you doing?!" Guard: "Hey, stop that! Come on, Gordon, are you trying to get me into trouble?" Freeman heads into the complex, overhearing some of the conversation between the scientists. Heading toward the test chamber, Freeman is stopped by the security guard. Guard: "Sorry, Mr. Freeman, I got explicit orders not to let you through without your hazard suit on." Freeman goes to the locker room and puts on his hazard suit. H.E.V.: "Welcome to the H.E.V. mark IV protective system for use in hazardous environment conditions. High-impact reactive armor activated. Atmospheric contaminant sensors activated. Automatic medical systems engaged. Defensive weapon selection system activated. Munition level monitoring activated. Communications interface online. Have a very safe day." The guard now allows Freeman through and uses the retinal scanner to open the door to the test lab. Guard: "Go right on through sir. Looks like you're in the barrel today." Gordon proceeds through the test lab and comes upon a group of three scientists. Scientist 1: "Ah, Gordon. Here you are. We just sent the sample down to the test chamber. " Scientist 2: "We boosted the anti-mass spectrometer 105%. Bit of a gamble, but we need the extra resolution." Scientist 3: "The administrator is very concerned that we get a conclusive analysis of today's sample. I gather they went to some length to get it." Scientist 1: "They're waiting for, Gordon, in the test chamber." The scientist unlocks the door for Gordon using the retinal scanner. He proceeds down an elevator and toward the test chamber. On the way there, a circuit board explodes near two scientists, who rush over to check it out. Scientist 4: "It's about to go critical!" Scientist 5: "What the hell is going on with our equipment?" Scientist 4: "It wasn't meant to do this in the first place." Gordon reaches the entrance to the test chamber, where two scientists are waiting for him. Scientist 6: "I'm afraid we'll be deviating a bit from standard analysis procedures today, Gordon." Scientist 7: "Yes, but with good reason. This is a rare opportunity for us. This is the purest sample we've seen yet." Scientist 6: "And, potentially, the most unstable." Scientist 7: "Now, now, if you follow standard insertion procedure, everything will be fine." Scientist 6: "I don't know how you can say that. Although I will admit that the possibility of a resonance cascade scenario is extremely unlikely." Scientist 7: "Gordon doesn't need to hear all this, he's a highly trained professional. We've assured the administrator that nothing will go wrong." Scientist 6: "Ah...yes, you're right. Gordon, we have complete confidence in you." Scientist 7: "Well, go ahead. Let's let him in now." The two scientists use retinal scanners to unlock the door, and Gordon enters the test chamber. Inside, the scientists communicate with Gordon over the intercom. Intercom 1: (feedback)"Testing, testing. (coughs) Everything seems to be in order." Intercom 2: "All right, Gordon. your suit should keep you comfortable through all this. The specimen will be delivered to you in a few moments. If you would be so good as to climb up and start the rotors, we can bring the anti-mass spectrometer to 80 percent and hold it there until the carrier arrives. Intercom 2: "Gordon, are you not hearing me? Climb up and start the rotors, please. Intercom 2: "Very good. We'll take it from here." Intercom 1: "Power to stage 1 emitters in 3,2,1. I'm seeing predictable phase arrays." Intercom 1: "Stage 2 emitters activating...now." Intercom 2: "Gordon, we cannot predict how long the system can operate at this level, nor how long the readings will take. Please, work as quickly as you can." Intercom 1: "Overhead capacitors to one oh five percent. Uh, it's probably not a problem, probably, but I'm showing a small discrepancy in... well, no, it's well within acceptable bounds again. Sustaining sequence." Intercom 2: "I've just been informed that the sample is ready, Gordon. It should be coming up to you any moment now. Look to the delivery system for your specimen." Gordon pushes the cart into the machine. Electricity begins arcing out of control all around the machine. Intercom 1: "Oh dear!" Intercom 2: "Gordon, get away from the-" Intercom 1: "Shutting down-no, attempted shutdown. It's not-it's not, it's not shutting down!" A huge explosion rocks the spectrometer, and the intercom cuts off in a scream. Gordon sees several flashes of an alien landscape, then comes to in the wreckage of the machine. The next chapter title comes up: UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES Scientist 1: "Why didn't they listen? We tried to warn them." Scientist 2: "I never thought I'd see a resonance cascade, let alone create one." Scientist 1: "Gordon, you're alive! Thank God for that hazard suit. I'm afraid to move him and all our phones are out. Please get to the surface as soon as you can and let someone know we're stranded down here. You'll need me to access the retinal scanners. I'm sure the rest of the science team will gladly help you." Guard: "Gordon! Man, am I glad to see you! What the hell are these things? And why are they wearin science team uniforms?" Announcement system: "Warning, high energy detonation detected in materials laboratory." "Warning, unauthorized biological force detected in maintenance area." "Warning, flooding detected on sublevel B." "Damage control team to Sector C immediately." "Biohazard warning in Sector B and C." "Attention: Sector C science personnel, please report status immediately." "Warning, Sector C elevator failure, do not use." Gordon finds an elevator that brings him up out of the test lab and into the: OFFICE COMPLEX Scientist 1: "Ah, Gordon. If I'd known it was you, I'd have let you in. Everyone's heading for the surface, but I think they're crazy. If we stay put, someone is bound to come rescue us." Scientist 2: "I'm not so sure I want to go to the surface. What if the world finds out what we were doing down here?" Scientist 3: "I just overheard a secure access transmission. Soldiers have arrived, and they're coming to rescue us. 'Course, I have my doubts that we'll live long enough to greet them." Guard 1: "Hey, what the hell are you doin down here? Get topside! I hear troops are coming in to save us." Guard 2: "Don't count on the cavalry finding us down here. Head for the surface. Elevators are out of order, but we can still climb." Scientist 4: (hanging from ladder) "I-I can't hold on much...longer. (falls) Yaaaaaah!" "WE'VE GOT HOSTILES" Announcement system: "Attention: Black Mesa announcement system now under military command." A security guard heads to the console to open the door, but is ambushed by an alien. With the door locked and the glass unbreakable, Gordon can only watch. Scientist 1: "For God's sake, open the silo doors! They're coming for us, it's our only way out! Oh my God, we're doomed!" Scientist 2: (running toward a Marine)"Rescued at last! Thank God you're here!" (The Marine then shoots the scientist.) Marine: "I killed twelve dumb ass scientists and not one of 'em fought back. This sucks." Scientist 3: "Well, so much for the government. Their idea of containment is to kill every one associated with the project. Judging by your hazard suit, I'd say you were part of what went wrong. Isn't that right? Now look, if anyone can end this catastrophe, it's the science team in the Lamba Complex at the opposite end of the base. With the transit system out, I couldn't tell you how to get there, but there's an old decommissioned rail system somewhere through here beyond the silo complex. If you can make it through the rocket test labs, you might be able to worm your way through the old tunnels to track down whatever's left of the Lambda team. You can trust them. You can trust all of us." BLAST PIT Loud banging noises are heard on the walls. Gordon comes across a scientist bleeding to death against the wall. Dying Scientist: "Fire the... rocket engine. Destroy the damn thing before it grows any larger!" Entering the rocket engine control room, Gordon sees a gigantic serpent-like alien break through the glass and grab a scientist in its jaws. Scientist (being eaten): "No! No, no! Get it off me! Get it off, get it off! Aaaaaah!" Guard 1: "Be quiet. This thing hears us." Guard 2: "Hey, hey! Over here! Eat lead, you outer space octopus!" The guard fires at the three-headed alien but is quickly killed by it. Gordon sneaks by the alien, activates the fan and the oxygen and fuel pumps on the second level, then heads down to activate the power generator. Scientist: "I hope no one expects me to go start up the generator. Smithers went down there and never came back." Gordon climbs up to the top of the generator where he finds a scientist. Smithers: "This is my hiding spot, and I'm not moving until the situation is drastically improved. Now go away, and don't tell anyone I'm here!" Gordon activates the generator, causing electricity to spark all over the room. Smithers: "Ah! Oh dear!" Scientist: "Excellent! Someone has restored all power. We'll have the engine up again in no time." Gordon fires the rocket engine, destroying the alien beneath it. Underneath the alien is an access shaft that eventually leads to the old rail system. POWER UP Several marines are firing at a giant hulking alien to no avail. Freeman moves past it and makes it up to the track control room. Inside is a wounded guard. Guard: "Mister, you can get the power on, that train'll take us straight to the surface. I would try it myself, but it's a long way down to the generator room, and there are... things in the way." Gordon goes down to the generator room, taking out a good number of Marines along the way. After activating the power, he heads back to the control room. Guard: "I'm never gonna make it. You better go on without me." To take care of the giant alien, Gordon lures it between two large conducting towers. Activating the power, the alien is electrified and explodes. Gordon then gets on the train to take him toward the Lambda complex. ON A RAIL Guard: "Freeman, I've been waiting for you. One of your scientist pals said to give you a message. You're supposed to take this old rail system up to some kind of satelite delivery rocket. I don't know where it is exactly, and the old guy was so worried about gettin outta here alive he didn't tell me. Main thing is, the military aborted the launch. So, when you do find the rocket, you'll have to get up to the control and launch it yourself. He said somethin about a Lambda team needing the satelite in orbit if they were ever gonna clean up this mess." Freeman makes his way through the rail system, fighting both aliens and Marines. Beside one of the bunkers is a message written on the wall: SURRENDER FREEMEN He makes it to the rocket launch area and overhears a conversation between two Marines. Marine 1: "So, who is this guy, Freeman?" Marine 2: "They say he was at ground zero." Marine 1: "Science team... You think he was responsible? Sabotage, maybe?" Marine 2: "Yeah, maybe. All I know for sure is he's been killing my buddies." Marine 1: "Oh yeah, he'll pay. He will definitely pay." Inside the launch control room, Freeman overhears a conscientious Marine complaining. Marine 3: "I didn't sign on for this shit. Monsters, sure, but civilians? Who ordered this operation anyway?" Gordon dispatches the Marines, and launches the rocket to deliver the satelite. APPREHENSION Scientist 1: "Did you see it? They said it was hauled from the Challenger deep, but I'm positive that beast never swam in terrestrial waters until a week ago. There's a tranquilizer gun in the shark cage, but I'm not sure it would work on this species. You're welcome to try." Scientist 2: "Gordon Freeman, it is you, isn't it? The science team has been tracking your progress with the Black Mesa security system. Unfortunately, so is the military. That suit of yours is full of tracking devices. Still, it's better than going naked in this place. It's cold in there. You'll have to hurry. It could sap your suit power in a matter of moments. If you're bent on reaching the Lambda complex, then you'll want to keep to the older industrial areas where the security system is full of holes. It's worked for me, so far." Guard: "Freeman, right? I've got a message for you. Make sure you don't--augh!" Freeman opens the surface access door, and heads out. Suddenly, the screen goes dark and sounds of a struggle are heard for a few seconds. Marine 1: "Get him!" Marine 1: "Hahaha... nice hit. Uh, all right, we got 'im." Marine 2: "Where are we takin this Freeman guy?" Marine 1: "Topside for questioning." Marine 2: "What the hell for? We got 'im. Let's kill him now." Marine 1: "Uh... and if they find the body?" Marine 2: "Body? What body?" Both laugh.Gordon wakes up in a trash compactor. RESIDUE PROCESSING Gordon makes his way through heavy industrial equipment. No dialogue in this section. QUESTIONABLE ETHICS Guard 1: "Hey, it's no good up there, it's all sealed off. The only way out, would be to find someone with scanner access who can open the front door. I'm pretty sure there's a few scientists hidin somewhere in the labs. Maybe with both of lookin, we can track them down, and get 'em to let us out. Guard 2: "What is this thing? Is it some kinda weapon?" Scientist 1: "Put that down, it's a prototype..." Guard 2: "Man, why aren't we usin it?" Scientist 1: "It's much too unpredictable. Don't let it overcharge!" Guard 2: "W-what do you mean overchar-" KABOOM Scientist 2: "A scientist! Thank God! Get us out of here before those military drones figure out where we're hiding." Scientist 3: "We all have retinal scanner access. Escort us to the lobby, and we can get out of the lab." Scientist 4: "You'll have to shut down the surgical unit first. Peters switched it on but I'm afraid he never made it back." Scientist: "Well, I'll let you out, but I'm warning you, it's hell out there. It's completely under military control. You'll have to sneak and fight your way from one end to the other. I don't expect you'll meet many of our peers along the way. But, if you do survive and somehow make it across the base, you'll end up at the Lambda complex, where the rest of the science team has taken shelter. I wouldn't venture there myself, but I will let them know that you are coming." SURFACE TENSION Dying Guard: "Help me. Help me. Somebody please help me, I'm dyin out here. Please... help... me." Scientist: "You're heading for the Lambda complex, aren't you? I was heading there myself until I wound up here, and, well, simply lost my nerve. Take one look through that door and you'll see what I mean. I'm going to wait out the catastrophe in here. If you intend to go on, then I beg of you: proceed with extreme caution." Radio: "Come in! Cooper, do you copy? Forget about Freeman. We're abandoning the base. If you have any last bomb targets, mark them on the technical map. Otherwise, get the hell out of there. Repeat: we are pulling out and commencing airstrikes. Give us targets or get below." "FORGET ABOUT FREEMAN!" Radio: "Forget about Freeman! We are cutting our losses and pulling out! Anyone left down there now is on his own! Repeat: if you are not already, you are-" LAMBDA CORE Scientist: "I apologize, Mr Freeman, but I couldn't risk opening that door until I was sure you'd scoured the area. This is the last entrance to the Lambda complex. Every other has been sealed off to contain the invasion. When we realized that you might actually make it here, we drew straws to see who should stay behind to let you through. Obviously, I drew the short one. My colleagues are waiting at the tip of the Lambda reactor. Waiting for you, I mean. The reactor is shut down right now, but you can activate it on your way up. You'll have to flood the core anyway to get into the teleportation labs. You're not authorized to know about those, but I can see you already know a great deal more than any one man is supposed to." Scientist 2: "Were you in weapons research too? I built the gluon gun, but I just can't bring myself to use it on another living creature. You don't look as if you have any trouble killing things." Scientist 3: "Freeman, isn't it? You'll need to activate both pumps to flood the reactor, and then that access pipe down there will take you on to the core. Time is short." Scientist 3: "Don't linger, Mr. Freeman. You've turned on the pumps. Take the access pipe, flood the core and get on up to the labs without delay." Scientist 4: "Gordon Freeman, you've finally found us." Guard: "So this is the guy. We thought you'd never make it." Scientist 4: "This is the supply depot for our first survey team. Quite a few handsome specimens were collected from the borderworld and brought back this way. Uh... before the survey members started being collected themselves, that is. We suspect there is an immense portal over there, created by the intense concentration of a single powerful being. You will know it when you see it. I hate to say this Gordon, but you must kill it." Guard: "Yeah, you'd better kill it." Scientist 4: "Of course, you owe us nothing, Mr. Freeman. But you've come this far. You know as much about these creatures as anyone." Guard: "Enough to know that if you don't wipe it out, there won't be much for you to come home to." Scientist 4: "Yes, so if you're willing, my colleague is waiting for you at the main portal controls. He will open the gates for you, Mr. Freeman. Do hurry." Guard: "Don't forget to gear up, and I'll cover you while you're waiting for that portal to warm up." Scientist 4: "This, Mr. Freeman, is a long jump module, created expressly for navigation in the world beyond. I certainly hope you received long jump training because once you're in Xen, you will need it. I would advise you to practice before crossing over." HEV: "Power assist movement activated." Scientist 5: "Hello, Freeman. I'm up here. Practice your long jump if you must, but hurry up." Scientist 5: "All right, I can open the portal now. The process is complicated, and once it is begun I must not be interrupted or I'll have to start all over again. Don't enter the beam until I give the OK. Understood? I will begin." Scientist 5: "Almost there, Freeman. Get yourself in position." Scientist 5: "Not yet, Freeman." Scientist 5: "It's ready! You must go, now!" Freeman jumps into the beam. XEN Freeman finds himself floating on one of several platforms. He uses the long jump module to enter the middle of the largest floating platform. He also spies a corpse wearing an HEV suit. In the middle of the platform, he activates a portal. No dialogue. GONARCH'S LAIR Gordon finds himself face to face with a gigantic spider type alien. He eventually manages to defeat it and find another portal. No dialogue. INTERLOPER Freeman moves through what appears to be an industrial complex populated with aliens. At the very top of the complex is another portal. Jumping in, he finds himself on top of more floating rocks with a bright red portal ahead of him. No dialogue. NIHILANTH Nihilanth: Frrrreeeeemmmmaaaaannnnn........ A huge freakish humanoid creature floats over Freeman. Using the various weapons at his disposal, Freeman takes out the crystals above the creature, shoots its head open, and destroys its brain. Everything goes dark for a moment, then Gordon wakes up face to face with a man in a suit and tie carrying a briefcase. All his weapons are gone. G-man: "Gordon Freeman, in the flesh. Or rather, in the hazard suit. I took the liberty of relieving you of your weapons. Most of them were government property. As for the suit, I think you've earned it. The borderworld, Xen, is in our control, for the time being, thanks to you. Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there. I am impressed. "That's why I'm here, Mr. Freeman. I have recommended your services to my eh-eh-eh-eh-employers and they have authorized me to offer you a job. They agree with me that you have limitlesssss potential. The scene shifts to a train very similar to the Black Mesa train that Gordon came to work in. "You've proved yourself a decisive man, so I don't expect you'll have any trouble deciding what to do. If you're interested, just step into the portal and I will take that as a yes. Otherwise, hm, well, I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning. Rather an anticlimax after what you've just survived. Time to choose." At this point, Gordon can either step through the door or not, resulting in two different endings. Ending 1, or "Gordon's an idiot" G-man: "Well, it looks like we won't be working together. No regrets, Mr. Freeman." SUBJECT: FREEMAN STATUS: OBSERVATION TERMINATED POST MORTEM: Subject declined offer of employment. Half-Life <credits> Ending 2, or "Do I get Dental?" G-man: "Wisely done, Mr. Freeman. I will see you up ahead." SUBJECT: FREEMAN STATUS: HIRED AWAITING ASSIGNMENT Half-Life <credits> -Scientist babble If you stick around the scientists long enough in the beginning of the game, they will begin conversing among themselves. This usually consists of a random question or statement coupled with a random response. If you listen long enough, you'll see that the accident shouldn't have been quite so unexpected. They've got missing tests, uncleaned equipment, and someone's eaten all the donuts! These are all the questions/statements I know of: Wouldn't it be fantastic to get some pure readings for a change? Is anyone else getting hungry? I hope those continued parameters are still nominal. Don't you think we should calculate those resonance dampening factors again? I am rather looking forward to this analysis, aren't you? You have no idea what is going on, do you? Have you seen my coffee cup? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yes, this all looks nominal. Aren't you a bit worried about that exponential cascade scenario we talked about? Have you been able to get the beverage machine to work yet? Do you know who ate all the donuts? You aren't going soft on that ethics issue again, are you? Someone's hidden my glasses again. I must remember to report that fluctuation. That's odd. Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties? This is all within theoretical limits. Are you running those tunneling rattis (not sure on that one) calculations again? All displacement modulators were tuned today, weren't they? And here are all the responses I could find: You know, you repeat yourself sometimes. I'm not at all sure. Shut up. Don't be ridiculous. Nnnnooooo. Yeeeesssss. It's inconclusive. I really don't know. Positively. I'm sure of it. I don't think so. Stop asking that question. Theoretically. You are completely wrong. Didn't you just ask me that? Who can say? Right. Kindly lower your voice.
