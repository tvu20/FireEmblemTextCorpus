But then their brother, Prince Michalis, succumbed to his lust for power. Despite his sisters\u2019 adamant opposition, he swore allegiance to Dolhr; and when Macedon\u2019s Dragoons took flight, the world suffered. Even now that the tides had turned, Michalis took position for one last stand. Dracoknights filled the sky end to end, eager to pluck Marth from the Earth."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Lord Gotoh, the League has begun its attack. I wish for you to move someplace safe until the fighting has ended."}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "Why not just end this folly now, Michalis?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "Folly? What folly?"}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "You loved your younger sister so much. It pains me to see you quarrel. If you and Minerva had worked as one, Macedon might have become a great kingdom- greater even than Archanea, perhaps. But instead, you let Gharnef trick you into destroying your family, and your kingdom with it."}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "...I cannot undo what is done. My father\u2019s blood will always be on my hands, just as Minerva\u2019s betrayal of her brother and country will be on hers. And Macedon has not been destroyed, not yet. So long as I carry Iote's Shield, the League\u2019s arrows cannot fell me."}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "Very well. And if you win? What then?"}, {"speaker": "Michalis", "line": "If I win, I will tell you. Right now, my only goal is to gut that Altean prince who leads the League.

You will not be able to break through Gharnef\u2019s Imhullu magic, not take Falchion from his clutches. Without Anri\u2019s sword, your battle with Medeus will be fraught with peril. If you still mean to face him, you will need all the strength you can muster, every advantage you can find. If you have weapons like the sword Mercurius or the lance Gradivus, the fight may not be lost... Hmm... I, too, may be able to help in some other way. Let me think on it. Regardless, your quest has just become more difficult than you realize. I hope you are ready."}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "You have the Lightsphere and Starsphere with you? Well done! Now I can create Starlight for you."}, {"speaker": "Gotoh", "line": "...There. It is finished. Take this with you; it is the only magic capable of breaking through Imhullu.
