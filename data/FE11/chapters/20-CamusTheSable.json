His peerless knights tamed their neighbors the barbarians in the kingdom\u2019s infancy, securing its place as one of the greatest of the Seven Kingdoms. However, the current king, Ludwik, was weak-willed and easily cowed: Dolhr had little trouble forcing him into an alliance. Now he had taken ill, even as Grust suffered its string of defeats at the hand of the League. The once mighty kingdom was poised to fall..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Nyna, we\u2019ll soon be launching the attack.

When the Dolhr-Grust allied forces seized control of Archanea, the entire royal family was killed, save me. I was given into Grust\u2019s custody- the custody of the Sable Order, to be more specific. I am told Dolhr wished for my execution- and with it the end of the holy lineage of House Archanea- and Grust was willing to comply."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "But you are not dead."}, {"speaker": "Nyna", "line": "That is right.
