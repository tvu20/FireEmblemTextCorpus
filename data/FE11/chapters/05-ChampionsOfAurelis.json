This kingdom alone had somehow resisted Dolhr\u2019s attempts to conquer it, but only by some miracle. By the time Marth arrived in Aurelis, much of its territory had already been carved up by Dolhr\u2019s ally Macedon. Still, the king\u2019s younger brother, Hardin, refused to give up without a fight. The people called him Coyote, and he intended to live up to the name. Since its founding, Aurelis and the holy kingdom of Archanea shared close ties and months ago Princess Nyna of Archanea had come to Hardin\u2019s aid. By his side, she had called on the people to fight- but few remained to answer. Macedon\u2019s finest soldiers were closing in. Nyna knew they were out of time\u2026"], "intro": [{"speaker": "Hardin", "line": "Princess Nyna, I\u2019ve spotted them!

Cripes, let me tell you what a shock THAT was! In a blink, this regular old feller turned into an enormous dragon! I mean, I ain\u2019t stupid. I\u2019d heard of the dragonkin before. I\u2019d just always assumed Manaketes looked somethin\u2019 like parakeets. Sheesh\u2026 \u2026What? Oh, this? I picked this stone up while I was there. Dunno what it is, but how often do you spy a glowin\u2019 red rock, ya know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019 But honestly, it\u2019s been kinda creepin\u2019 me out lately. You want it?
