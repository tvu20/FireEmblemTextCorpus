I fought to defend our palace from Dolhr but the enemy\u2019s strength was too great. We lost, and I was captured. Thankfully, they\u2019re not half as bright as they are strong, and I managed to slip away when they were not looking. I heard you were on your way to Pyrathi, and that Princess Nyna was with you, so I came here to offer my help. Let me fight with you to save my land, and I will use this silver bow to show you marksmanship unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen."}], "boss": [{"speaker": "Mannu", "line": "Foolhardy humans, defying a Manakete king!

I have come with a request from our mistress, the princess Minerva. She is planning to lead us against Dolhr in rebellion; however, hero hands are tied so long as the enemy holds her younger sister, the princess Maria, captive. Will you rescue Princess Maria from their clutches, that my Whitewing sisters and I might join in your fight?"}]}
