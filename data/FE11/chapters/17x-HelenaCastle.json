Marth took the League to Helena Castle in the north, an old fortress and key supply point during Dolhr and Grust\u2019s occupation. There he meant to seize the last of the enemy\u2019s gold and provisions but Grust would not give up the castle without a fight..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Enemy Soldier", "line": "Lord Dactyl, I\u2019ve brought the mage."}, {"speaker": "Dactyl", "line": "Good.

Just the tome and this ring..."}, {"speaker": "Dactyl", "line": "Ring? Let me have a look at that."}, {"speaker": "Etzel", "line": "No! Don\u2019t you- Grr, let me go!

Grust\u2019s garrison left their war chest when they fled. This much gold should buy plenty of equipment. Might I suggest, sire, you avail yourself of this opportunity to outfit your soldiers? Our next opponent will be Grust\u2019s Sable Order. By our scouts\u2019 reports, they march to meet us as we speak. Many say their knights are the strongest on the continent.

I have sworn to end it; that\u2019s the very reason all of us fight."}, {"speaker": "Etzel", "line": "And you think you can end it, just like that? From anyone else\u2019s lips that would sound absurdly naive. But I can tell you are sincere. Tell me, Prince, have you any need for an extra... spell slinger? I\u2019ve no taste for war, but I do have a fierce hunger for ending it. Let\u2019s usher in a new era, you and I."}]}
