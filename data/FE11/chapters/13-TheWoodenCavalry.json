Waiting for them at Fort Menedy were Grust's artillery regiment, the dreaded \u201cWooden Cavalry\u201d. Missiles crashed down, rocking the earth as the enemy ballistae rumbled forward.

The enemy ballisticians can strike from afar, but they're powerless up close. All we need to do is move in and silence them before they do too much damage. Watch!"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Young Man", "line": "Ballisticians are really only vulnerable to one type of weapon: the thunderbolt. Fresh out of thunderbolts?

They say some of Grust's soldiers would sooner rally under Archanea's banner than Dolhr's. But General Camus conquered us \u2018fore we could act, and Grust has had us under their thumb ever since. Here's hopin' you win this battle quick. We like bein' free, don't you know."}], "recruit-visit": [{"speaker": "Beck", "line": "Prince Marth, I presume? The name's Beck. I fought in the battle at Castle Deil. After my shameful defeat there, see, I took refuge in this village. And when I heard your army was marchin' this way, I readied my ballista, hopin' for another taste of battle. So how 'bout it, princey? Take me along! I'm packin' thunderbolts, see?
