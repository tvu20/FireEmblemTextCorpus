Land of the Manaketes. Before Medeus, the dragonkin had few dealings with the human realm, but when the Shadow Dragon came, everything changed. He sunk all Archanea into a cycle of war, in which heroes rose and heroes fell- always claiming his cause was just and the humans' deaths deserved. But now Medeus\u2019s empire was crumbling... He was nearing the end of his reign... even as Marth was nearing the end of his long quest."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Malledus", "line": "There, sire.
