@Intro 
Frey: Sire!
Marth: ...Frey! Abel! You're alive!
Abel: Yes, sire. Princess Elice bade us protect you. Sir Malledus stayed behind to accompany her.
Frey: Sire, we must be quick. Sir Jagen awaits us at the gates.
Abel: Blast! This will not do. How did Gra's soldiers ever make it this far?"
Marth: Jagen and the others will be caught like mice...We need to seize the gates and secure the area, immediately.

@Battle
Enemy Soldier: Now who's that who thinks they can sneak up on us? Ho ho... What's this? I spy the Altean prince. Oi, listen up, you lot! Bag the prince! Dead or alive, he'll fetch us as sweet a reward as the mind can conjure.
Marth: Hmm, they have archers... We need to take care they don't pick us off from afar.

@End 
Jagen: "Sire, it gladdens me to see you in one piece. It's not safe for you here; we must be away at once!
Cain: Prince Marth! Where are you? Answer me, sire!
Marth: Cain? ...That's Cain!
Marth: Cain, you're supposed to be in Gra! Why have you returned without- Yow! Those wounds...!
Cain: Sire, it's really you...I feared the worst. That his message would go undeliv...Agh...
Marth: In that state, I don't know how you even stayed ahorse. Those gashes must be treated at once-
Jagen: No, sire. Not until we've escaped.
Marth: ...Cain, I trust you can put off bleeding to death for just a while longer?
Cain: Of course, sir... I aim to please...

Malledus: Princess Elice! The enemy is nearly upon us! Gather your things, quickly!
Elice: No, Malledus. I am staying here.
Malledus: S-staying here?! What madness is this?
Elice: Too many people have died to keep Altea and its castle safe. I cannot abandon what so many lives have brought. With Father and Mother unaccounted for, I am the natural choice to remain with Altea's people. And besides, by staying, I can buy time for the rest of you to escape.
Malledus: Nonsense. Just gather your things, and-
Elice: Malledus. I am not suggesting. I am commanding. If something befalls Father, Marth will become the last person in the entire world worthy of wielding the Falchion. I want you to guide him, Malledus- even when the rest of us no longer can.
Malledus: Princess...I will try my best.
Elice: There's not much time. Go, Malledus. ...Go!
