still smarting from their bitter experience with gharnef and the dark magic imhullu prince marth and the league regrouped and marched south  home to altea once marths kingdom had been beautiful blessed with rich soil and clear waters now the eyes tended to notice instead the barren farms the ruins forlorn stares marth vowed to free altea from its torment without any further delay
youve done it marth were here thats altea beneath our feet  your home
countless days have passed since dolhr took my kingdom from me  days i would never have lived had it not been for my sister elices sacrifice and the sacrifices of so many others 
what became of your sister and the rest of your family what of them as well
my father as you know died in gra i last saw my mother and sister the day the castle fell i do not know if they still live but i hope that they do and if the enemy has them i will rescue them you can be sure of that
sire our preparations are complete we are ready to march
thank you
alteans and friends of the league join me now help me set altea free and ensure today is the last battle my people must endure
listen well because this is very important there are two villages in the northwest of altea the easterly village is home to a paladin named arran while the westerly village is home to a hero named samson theyre both fine men and warriors but their villages have been feudin for years you should probably resign yourself to the fact that youll only get one of them to join your ranks give it some thought the hero to the west or the paladin to the east
a vip card will gain you entrance to secret shops where are the shops well thats the secret
a lad named xane has been locked up in the eastern jail they say hes got some sort of amazing power wonder what it is
three orbs are enshrined at the fane of raman each brimming with power what sort of power none can say well except those who have wielded it right
the altean army welcome home its good to see you these years been nowt but dark days its about time we had something bright to look forward to
take care when usin a devil sword its a powerful blade to be sure  but it might just claim your life instead of your foes
princess elice was prepared to die that day the castle fell but she didnt they say instead of killin her the dark pontifex gharnef spirited her off somewhere oh our poor princess  i hope shes safe
my name is samson once i was a swordfighter of some renown but that was then and this is now im happy enough with my life here in the village but if you need another man i will fight unfortunately there has always been bad blood between our village and the next one over theyll have closed the gates to you the moment they saw you come here guess that means the paladin arran wont be fightin with you thems the breaks
sire my name is arran once i was a captain to many knights  but things change and i came to live here in this village if you need warriors for the coming struggle i would be honored to fight unfortunately there has always been bad blood between this village and our neighbors no doubt they closed their gates to you as soon as they saw you come here you wont be able to recruit the hero samson now im afraid
hey there princey thanks for settin me free the names xane i hail from a land few have heard of an even fewer have seen i wont trouble you with the details me and my folk have the power to transform into other people we can shape shift you see when doluna caught on they started threatenin me told me to join their army or face my doom hah well i wasnt about to waste my considerable talent on those evil coots you on the other hand youve got character say why dont we team up i do owe you for savin my hide and i think youll find my talents are quite considerable
well done rabble anyone else would be dead by now a shame you must end your campaign right here before your own gates
rrgh general camus  the rest  is in your  hands 
well done sire the enemy has ceased their resistance victory is ours
bravo marth on behalf of house archanea i wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations
thank you nyna but its still too soon to celebrate we havent freed the castle yet
sire your soldiers have assembled for the castle raid perhaps you could say a few words first 
altean warriors  brave comrades the road has been long but at last we have driven dolhr from my homeland there are not words to express my gratitude to you all you gave altea back to me thank you  thank you  an army of foes still haunt my castle i mean to kick them out ready my friends lets send these varlets scurrying
/***EOF***/
it never had much in the way of riches but neither did it have much trouble all that changed when a pirate crew fell upon the town and made it their hideout here in galder history records marths first steps toward freeing his homeland
prince marth i am ogma a mercenary of talys the king has bid me and my three men join your army cavalry has arrived from the west flying grusts standard they mean to take your life sire be careful
a pirate callin himself darros wants to talk to your prince says hes washed his hands of pillagin and plunderin and wants to fight for the good of all hah right  and im a farmer whos been sworn off rain 
curates gain experience whenever they use their staves
hammers smash right through heavy armor you should pick one up when you get the chance
oh mighty prince of altea please will you save sister lena shes gone up into the ghouls teeth to tend to the sick there we warned her i swear we did  lena is our angel if something befell her i  no i wont think of it take this gold weve 5000 pieces just promise youll use it to bring her home to us unharmed
ahoy prince marth i be darros a simple man o the sea ive had me fill o the piratin life and now i be lookin tstart anew what say ye make me yer matey and i swear tpull me load
castor it is you isnt it must even good men like you betray talys now
princess caeda oh im sorry but me mothers sick and the medicine dont buy itself see 
so you agreed to fight for the pirates in exchange for coin all right then if its gold you need take mine here this is all i have take it and go to your mothers side
but princess i betrayed you  ach ive been a fool forgive me princess let me fight for you now me life is yours
ogma
princess 
i never got to thank you for coming along with us theres no swordsman i trust more ive seen your strength
you dont need to thank me princess im just doing my job speaking of which your father would flay me if you came to any harm do me a favor and leave the dangerous fighting to me and my men
i dont need protecting ogma  ive got another job for you protect marth for me
but princess 
hes very important to me and the world  but mostly to me so do as i ask ogma keep him safe thats my first and last request
very well how could i say no to you
thank you ogma i knew youd understand all right i have to go but i hope we get to talk like this more youre a good listener
 princess

prince marth i am castor of talys i wish to add my bow to your strength
of course caeda told me about you
you know shes always been very kind to me sire even before i left talys and look how ive repaid her 
castor you can still show her your heart is true let the battles to come be what defines you
the gall of ye defyin me crew ill put an axe square between yer eyes ye aint leaving here alive i swear it on the rickety peg leg oshanty pete
augh  fiends ye be 
you have our gratitude sire for finally chasin those pirates away now as i hear it you plan to march on to aurelis thatll take you right up through the ghouls teeth with all due respect sire youre taking a great risk crossin those mountains thats soothsire territory the soothsires are fearsome bandits always raidin the villages and harryin what travelers dare pass by and the swordsman with em  goes by the name o navarre  hes a terror with a blade so they say if you go up there keep your wits about you  or you wont come back down
/***EOF***/
prince marth he said i do not doubt you love your sister something great but you must be patient  time is on your side if you stay here and grow stronger a time will come when you can help her so marth stayed in talys protected by its kind people and the years went by 
sire youve a visitor from the castle its princess caeda
caeda what is it you look white as a sheet
marth come quickly its the castle  galdrs pirates attacked from out of nowhere  they stormed the gates and cut down everyone in their path i fear for my fathers life 
steady caeda you did well to come find us alteas bravest knights arent about to hand talys to that flock of seafowl come well make for the castle now
villages will keep their gates open for prince marth but he must be quick – if a thief reaches a village before the prince does there may not be any more village left to visit
i hear you need a high weapon level to wield the strongest weapons another thing keep your fliers away from those enemy archers
a knight belongs on the front lines if you ask me that thick armor can take a lot of abuse so they should be up front protecting the other units
galder thats the harbor town west of talys out beyond the water these days a pirate by the name of gomer calls the shots there the whole towns at the mercy of his crew
a man of the staff by the name of wrys lives in the village south of the castle he was hopin to meet your prince
prince marth tis good you stopped by the villagers have collected 10000 gold pieces if it please you use the money to arm your warriors and rid our land of those pirates
i am wrys a humble curate i cannot fight but this staff i carry can heal your wounded take me with you and youll be very glad you did
the might of altea ye say now har ye sprogs look tbe a mite short omighty tme
rrgh  yell pay dog 
ah prince marth you have saved us in our hour of need please accept my thanks lad i believe you are ready if you wish to seek out allies in aurelis i will give you what soldiers i can to see you arrive there safely captain ogma is a fine swordsman brave and true i know he and his fighters will serve you well another thing during your travels you are certain to meet many who despise dolhr some may be hiding in villages other may have been captured or forced to fight against their will or better judgment it falls upon you to find these individuals and win them over your cause understood lad then go the time has come be patient steady strong i know you will do great things
/***EOF***/
having won the day and putting camus and his sable order to rout marth and the league moved on to the mountains in eastern grust to crush the last of the opposition the surviving grustian soldiers in a mad attempt to hang on to their lives took all the residents of a nearby village hostage to keep marth from striking however they could not have picked a worse village to harass 
have the villagers given up struggling yet
with that ogre on the loose hardly sir all of our soldiers together still cant contain him the other villagers have fled into the caverns out of reach
what grr enough of this the league will be here soon take your positions well deal with them first and cut that giant down to size later
ymir youre hurt
am i i hardly feel it
why would you try to take on an entire army just for our sake
because you treat me like a human being do i need another reason
ymir  thank you
ill be standing guard outside the cavern nobody will hurt you i swear it
who are you you dont seem to be one of grusts soldiers
you just keep your distance im not letting anyone near the villagers in here and that includes you
you wrong me sir im here to rout the last of grusts army to save you
yeah well they said the same thing when they led us down here and look where that got us im not fallin for the same lies twice
i speak the truth but if my word is not good enough so be it stand aside and watch us fight let the battle prove i mean what i say agreed either way you are in danger here take the villagers and hide until this is over
 so im supposed to just sit here when i could be fightin
just give me a chance to prove im here to protect you
 fine ill stay out of it for now but if i find youre lyin to me ill split you right down the middle
the villagers are countin on me i wont let you through
rrgh  im sorry  i tried 
well never surrender to you akaneian rabble long live grust
rebel  scum 
prince marth thank you those soldiers told us theyd protect us when they led us down here  but they were just using us as leverage hostages to keep you at bay if you hadnt shown up they might have just killed us outright in the end 
prince marth sorry i doubted you
well at least weve cleared up the misunderstanding
since you came to the villagers rescue how bout i help you out as a way of sayin thanks
you mean  join our army
im strongest in the land well second strongest at least i can hold my own in battle but if you dont want a monster in your ranks i understand 
monster youre a giant among men to be sure but a hero as well any warrior who can fend of an entire army is welcome among us
then count me in lets see how many more armies break themselves against me eh
/***EOF***/
the galloping of enemy destriers far away then closer  then far too close
aurelis at last the enemy will have sent their forces to meet us
grust dolhr grawere up against their standing armies and we must brace ourselves for it
sire i believe it prudent that we start taking time to prepare our troops before each battle we should select the warriors best suited for the situation and outfit them with the right weapons and items accordingly
all right thats sound advice  i believe ill take it
an unknown army to the south that must be the altean princeling and his band of lickspittles if they think well sit by and let them join forces with the aurelians then they have another think coming with this ridersbane ill litter the lea with their cavalry
weapons can be crafted of iron steel or silver each metal more powerful than the last youl need to raise your weapon level accordingly though before you can use them
middle aged man“when facing armored knights or generals youll want to arm yourself with a sword they call an armorslayer then theres the ridersbane which makes short work of cavaliers and paladins  but only knights and cavalry can wield it the rapier is effective against armored units and cavalry but you need to be a prince to wield that one also keep in mind that weapons wear down with use and eventually break
general bentheon who guards the castle was carrying a ridersbane last i saw keep your cavaliers away or that weapon could spell the end of ‘em
did you know you can use keys to unlock doors and lower bridges  you did ahem right of course you did
theres no terror like the dracoknight one false move when theyre flyin about and you can kiss your life goodbye
kind altean this kingdom is in dire need of a savior weve saved up 5000 gold and poured our prayers into every coin please use this money to answer them
aha prince marth we meet again
 huh merric merric is that you
well yes sire last i looked whilst studying magic in khadein i caught wind of a war brewing and decided to seek you out
i see  thank you then i need friends like you on the battlefield you will fight with us of course
of course ‘twould be a passing shame if you didnt get to see me flex a little magic muscle wait till i show you my latest excalibur
lena  where are you what i would give to hear your voice just once before i die 
lena  forgive your fool of a brother 
matthis is that you
lena what are you doing on a battlefield
i was attacked by bandits in the teeth while tending to the sick there and these people saved me the real question is what are you doing on a battlefield  least of all this one
im not here by choice sister of mine since you left macedon has only gotten worse and worse they forced me to enlist  you know i hate warfare but it was into the army or onto the chopping block
shame on you matthis if youre going to fight then at least fight for something you believe in medon has done terrible things marrying their might to doluna helping them torment people brother its not too late you could join alteas forces theyre good people you know prince marth would welcome you they all would
 all right then if im gonna to die id rather die as one of the dashing than one of the dastardly you know lena you always were the reliable one and now youre all grown up i thought for sure youd have already settled down with your one true love
t true love ive ive met no such man matthis
hmm is that so ill bet you havent  well you just be careful there are plenty of thieves out there who would steal a girls heart
you must be matthis sister lenas 
ack y youre prince marth aieee s s stay your rapier i beg you
 what has gotten into you
you mean you havent come to stick me like a pig for fighting under the macedonian standard
er no 
matthis“really
really and truly
oh uh right then  sorry about that little display i guess lena was right just goes to show not all princes are cut from the same cloth
marth“what do you mean
oh well our prince  prince michalis of macedon that is  hes strong and proud and an utter tyrant they say he put the soldiers who look the most scared in the front lines on purpose
hmm  prince michalis of medon 
dont worry sire i wont mistake you for him again altean princes i can trust
you can defy us yes  but you will never defeat us
w what 
prince marth you have our thanks for liberating the south castle youll find captain hardin protecting the king and the lady nyna at the northern fortress located in aurelis when you find him please be sure to give him this silver sword

the empire was finished the fires of war that had raged across archanea would die and light would come to take darknesss place but before any of that came to pass there were a few final moments of marths tale that need telling 
marth you did it its finally over
ive waiting a long time for this day and now im not entirely certain what to do with it 
marth  um we havent talked much since leaving talys but i thought do you know where you will be going
to altea of course war has left my kingdom in ruins i cannot waste another day i must return to help rebuild
so  i suppose that means you have bid talys farewell for good 
dont be silly caeda i need to at least go thank your father and tell him the fighting is done
my father  marth im not asking about my  never mind please excuse me 
marth did something happen i just passed caeda and she looked heartbroken 
no  well we were just talking and she asked me 
ha ha oh marth  how can a man who faced the shadow dragon be so desperate to avoid facing his own feelings
i  my  what i dont know what you are talking about
you wish to send caeda home to talys then and return to altea alone that is what you want
well thats where we both belong i dont see what my wants have to do with anything
clearly not marth if you have anything to say to caeda say it now love cannot always make the leap from heart to heart by itself sometimes you must speak it aloud and give it wings surely a great leader like you can muster the courage for that
 
caeda  might i er have a moment
 
i did not speak with my heart before when i said i would go to altea i  well i had meant  i hoped you would be at my side
 
as you said we have not spoken much since talys with you i felt i never had to say a word if the battle started to take its toll you were always there  close by  i would see you there so beaut  ahem so brave  and i would um  derive yes derive great strength derive   ugh why is this so difficult caeda im just trying to tell you i 
marth  shh me too  me too
well done marth our struggle is finally over you have saved our world
not just me many fought at my side  and died
marth  you loved her didnt you caeda
 she was the one i most wanted to keep safe but i failed and i have lost her forever  it occurs to me now that perhaps she was the one protecting me all along caeda  why did you take up arms with a fool like me
marth do not blame yourself  remember anri and artemis we are their descendants perhaps we were always meant to share their curse as well as their blood and  perhaps only the curse has exacted its price could our battle with the shadow dragon be won this peace we have made  we must cherish it marth we have both paid so dearly for it let us work together to ensure none must endure a tragedy like our again
so concludes the tale of falchion blade of light marth its wielder and his battle with the shadow dragon herein its events have been chronicled that none may ever forget
/***EOF***/
the long war had been fought archaneas many lands freed and now the league had cornered their archenemy within his castle they broke into four groups and stormed the four gates of dolhr keep  unaware that this was exactly what medeus was expecting bravely these warriors fate had chosen steeled themselves for one last struggle
we made it now we just have to find medeus 
i can sense it  a sinister will is at work here 
marth you have fought splendidly
lord gotoh what are you doing here
i washed my hands of humankind and their foolish ways long ago but you and your companions have convinced me that was a rash decision perhaps there is hope for you yet allow me to offer what help i can
you mean youll fight with us
yes i may lack the power to stop medeus but his minions are another story let this old man strike them down and clear a path for you  the gods have chosen you marth prince of light
come my friends we have a dragon to tame help me confine medeus to the shadows for all eternity and bring light back into the world
his last words were as follows “tell my son that i leave the future of altea and our continent in his hands”
your sister knows that you are the future of altea  nay the whole land
foolish humans you dare disturb me while i slumber oh how you will regret it as you die slowly painfully writhing in the fires of the inferno
nngh  defeated again  by humans know this altean prince  that light which surrounds you is only a temporary respite so long as the darkness in your hearts continues to sustain me  i cannot be  destroyed   rrraaahhh
hmm so  i am not the only dragon revived i had heard you perished the last time no matter youve recovered even less of your power than me this time you have no chance
/***EOF***/
aurelis was free but marth and his army  now known as the archanean league still had much work ahead of them they followed the middleroad south bound for archanea palace  a perilous route for it took them right into lefcandith valley and the jaws of trouble the countless fortresses lining the valley made it a veritable gauntlet and compounding the danger was the presence of the whitewings a knightly order led by princess minerva of macedon it would be a fierce battle
general harmein i cannot abide by these tactics of yours let me attack the rebels head on and keep my pride as a knight of macedon
ah you mean the same pride that cost us all those soldiers back in aurelis i think not princess if were to regroup we need to buy time my tactics are necessary the emperor himself has named me commander of this post either obey or accept the consequences your little sister maria is still under our word is she not what a shame it would be if we decided we could no longer care for her 
enough  i will obey but the altean knights are smarter than you give them credit for they will prevail here and you will regret having acting so rashly general
say did you happen to get a look at the axe wrapped in minervas princessly fingers no i suppose not otherwise youd not be standing here that axe is hauteclere the strongest axe of ‘em all nobody knows who made it or where but its said to rival even the three regalia archaneas mightiest weapons why if she got her hands on iotes shield thatun being macedons treasure see shed be nigh unstoppable
you there have you come across a young girl one by the name of tiki she must be found boy tiki is the last of the naga the divine dragon clan without her powers we cannot challenge the manaketes who serve medeus  me i havent the power i am a fire dragon yes  but in the name alone in name alone i lost my firestone in pyrathi without it i cannot do battle  you will be traveling much yes i wish to go with you perhaps together we can find tiki
fie enough ive no stomach for these cat and mouse tactics come whitewings we fly hyah
rrgh  i cant keep up the fight with these wounds  i must withdraw
i serve princess minerva not grust this battle is over
the commander left then ive no reason to stay
sorry general my place is with the commander
curse minerva and her pride grr no matter if i am to die here then i wont be dying alone
aaargh traitors every where 
prince marth i was wondering if we might talk about the manaketes
manaketes you mean the dragonkin
yes sire i was not sure how much knowledge you had of the manaketes the manaketes inhabited our continent long before the dawn of humanity however ordinarily their draconic disposition stayed suppressed their power sealed within special stones thus rather than terrorizing humankind they chose to live simple peaceful lives in the quieter reaches of the world however a century ago something changed medeus the shadow dragon surfaced in the dolhr region and created what would be a great empire there his forces invaded the human realm and in the blink of an eye he had subjected all of the land it was then in that darkest hour that a young man named anri appeared and rose against the shadow dragon in his head was a shining blade of light  falchion  which he plunged into medeus  and the tyrant was no more anri went on to found altea  and the rest i believe you know
yes malledus  is that what this was about i do know my own kingdoms history and i know what i must do now that medeus has revived and restored dolhr to its former might
you are anris last male descendant the only one who can wield falchion you must find the blade that was taken and put an end to doluna and its misguided manakete rulers
i will finish what my father started i will avenge him and bring light back into our world
/***EOF***/
the league had reached archanean soil so marth gave himself leave to recuperate in port warren a harbor town known for commerce coin alone kept the town free and they paid dolhr dearly in taxes to preserve their autonomy naturally then theirs was a warm welcome when the archanean league arrived marths soldiers were glad to rest there nestled between mountain and sea but their joy was spoiled by news that the enemy was fast approaching  as harsh an awakening as a rock beneath the pillow
prince marth i am caesar and this is radd we are hired swords in the service of port warren grust has gathered its knights by the fortresses to the north its dangerous for you to stay here thankfully the eastern castle has been left almost entirely unguarded thats the place to strike please be careful sire well be fighting with you all the way
they say a princess of macedon is being held captive inside castle deil thats odd dont you think why would dolhr imprison their own ally
i saw loads of enemy soldiers up by the northern fortresses theyll be pouring out of the gates any minute now youd better send someone to bar the exits before they do
i bear you no ill will but what can i say a wars a war
good day sir
ack
peace ive no wish to fight you my name is caeda i hail from talys
wh what are you talking to me for this is a battlefield
might i trouble you by asking your name good sir

 youre very kind caeda dare i say we dont have girls quite like you back in grust um perhaps i suppose i could aw heck im going with you
prince marth im roger a grustian soldier well at least i was im through fighting against you let me join your league
well certainly we need all the strong allies we can get but why the sudden change of heart
well er  theres this fetching girl named caeda who asked me to and uh  what can i say i think im in love try saying no to a girl who comes racing up to you in the heat of battle just to ask if you believe in love whew i mustve turned red as a strawberry heh heh 
  
w what are you doing all the way out here blast im finished 
long live grust nngff 
sire its too dangerous to stay here we must flee to pyrathi there are risks there too  the pyrathi king mannu is said to be a descendant of the dragonkin a manakete still weve no other recourse well just have to take our chances  keep your wits about you sire

tired from so many long battles marth and the league arrive at last in archanea princess nynas mother kingdom past the mountains lay the royal palace known to some as millennium court and within its walls awaited many treasures and captives the enemy had taken with each step marth draw nearer to one of the great waypoints on his journey
nyna soon the palace will be in sight i know this cant be easy for you
 when the palace fell many many good archaneans were killed the royal family my family were their bodies were hung before the gates as an example i cannot unpaint that vivid picture of my parents grotesquely changed i feel as though i should cry marth or scream but no tears come and i cannot chase away the sadness and rage   i cannot change the past i can only shape the future lead the way marth i am ready take me home
this here is knorda archaneas closest market town drop by the armories and vendors if youve an interest in rare goods
a gang of ruffians have rounded up some archanean folk and are holdin em over at the edge of town what a world its become that weve gotta be prisoners in our own land
three ancient weapons known as the regalia have been passed down through the generations of house archanea parthia the bow of flame gradivus the lance that pierces stone and mercurius the spectral sword only those blessed by the gods may lay hands on them  or so it goes
im sick of war if it aint the screams of battle youre hearin its the bawlin of the widows you all should go home to your loved ones if you ask me
watch out for the ballisticians they can fire their missiles quite a long ways if you see theyre usin a weapon called an arrowspate move your fliers out of there before their wings get clipped also ballisticians have a weapon called the thunderbolt which is particularly effective against other ballisticians
not everybody fighting for grust is a bad apple you know take my sweetheart jake hes got a heart of gold that one if you see him tell him annas worried sick about him course my jake wont talk to no one but the most beautiful of women thats just the way he is
i hope this warring is over and done with soon and i hope my jake is well

khadein  the school my father was a student there a long time ago
the school is beautiful–was beautiful until gharnef took over and changed everything i was blessed with wonderful teachers and i found a healthy mix of friends and rivals in the other aspiring mages

the secret shop didnt you know there are secret shops hidden all over the continent well theres one in altea too
oh really where exactly
if i told you it wouldnt be much of a secret now would it the entrance is disguised so you cant find it
disguised
and they dont let anybody in without a vip card so dont expect to waltz through the door by accident
but how do they stay in business
who knows last i heard they were desperate for customers
then maybe they should reopen as a tell your friends  shop
ha very clever anyway you should drop by when youre in the neighborhood
but i dont know  ugh never mind
burn  burn till your blood boils and your flesh cooks
emperor medeus i have failed you 
good news nyna weve wrested control of the gates from the enemy
then weve won
not quite yet we can enter the palace but dolhr still holds strong inside her walls also a number of knights are being held captive inside
loyal soldiers who fought for their kingdom and their people marth i wish to free them as soon as possible
i understand we should strike now then before enemy reinforcements can arrive i believe we have a good chance
thank you marth as always i am counting on you worry no more
/***EOF***/
a quiet prosperous kingdom famed for the flying beasts favored by dracoknights but then their brother prince michalis succumbed to his lust for power despite his sisters adamant opposition he swore allegiance to dolhr and when macedons dragoons took flight the world suffered even now that the tides had turned michalis took position for one last stand dracoknights filled the sky end to end eager to pluck marth from the earth
lord gotoh the league has begun its attack i wish for you to move someplace safe until the fighting has ended
why not just end this folly now michalis
folly what folly
you loved your younger sister so much it pains me to see you quarrel if you and minerva had worked as one macedon might have become a great kingdom  greater even than archanea perhaps but instead you let gharnef trick you into destroying your family and your kingdom with it
 i cannot undo what is done my fathers blood will always be on my hands just as minervas betrayal of her brother and country will be on hers and macedon has not been destroyed not yet so long as i carry iotes shield the leagues arrows cannot fell me
very well and if you win what then
if i win i will tell you right now my only goal is to gut that altean prince who leads the league my pride as macedonian king rests upon it
i see  then weve nothing more to discuss have we
the weight of his fathers murder threatens to crush him  poor boy poor fool
a great sage lives in the village to the north hes not very sociable though hardly anyone ever sees him
marth marth why did you not heed me why did you not bring the two orbs without them i cannot make starlight for you you will not be able to break through gharnefs imhullu magic not take falchion from his clutches without anris sword your battle with medeus will be fraught with peril if you still mean to face him you will need all the strength you can muster every advantage you can find if you have weapons like the sword mercurius or the lance gradivus the fight may not be lost  hmm  i too may be able to help in some other way let me think on it regardless your quest has just become more difficult than you realize i hope you are ready
you have the lightsphere and starsphere with you well done now i can create starlight for you
 there it is finished take this with you it is the only magic capable of breaking through imhullu use it to stop that fiend gharnef once and for all
made it this far have you dont gloat yet my dragoons and i still rule these skies
minerva i have missed you sister let us embrace one last time
michalis 
well strike a moments hesitation spells death on the battlefield i know i taught you better
you will not lay down your lance and walk the right path
dont be a child there are no right paths just mine and yours two that will never cross
very well then you leave me no choice embrace you i shall brother
m maria what are you doing here
the whitewings ha come to try and slay your king
the whitewings ha come to try and slay your king
the whitewings ha come to try and slay your king
ive been waiting for you altean whelp i swear on my crown you will die
aaagh i am finished forgive me my people
first general camus of grust  now prince michalis of macedon men of such promise  had the times been different the two might have led illustrious lives
yes prince michalis was a brilliant man with great things ahead of him but in the end the rashness of youth did him in
only because gharnef found his weakness and exploited it until we stop that fiend this spiral of misery will never cease
then shall we go to thabes lord gotoh said the city lies someplace far to the north of khadein
yes in the heart of the desert 
thabes is an old city  none in recent memory have gone there and returned alive within its walls remain many powerful apparatus crafted of long forgotten magic lord gotoh believes gharnef is harnessing their power and that is why he wields such influence over the continent
and he has imhullu as well  this will be a struggle
still gharnefs reign must end the world was so much more beautiful before he painted it red 
/***EOF***/
khadein city of magic ever since gharnef named himself ruler of this mecca for the magically inclined the sands surrounding it had run red many knights had tried to oust gharnef but what defense did they have against the mages the fiend had bent to his purpose one by one the heroes fell to blades unseen and fires within their armor and it was not long at all before khadeins wickedness outstripped its wisdom
what the dregs of archanea have come to challenge my kingdom ha ha ha  really do they think people have not tried before so long as i possess this imhullu magic they cannot snuff my life out no one can as for the white sage  he will trouble me no longer with the dragon goddess right where i want her in the fane of raman there is no way for gotohs starlight to disperse the shadows that guard me
fight gharnef are you mad youll never stop him his magic imhullu summons up foul spirits that protect him only the white sage gotohs magic can undo him the magic of starli  whoa there i need to hold my tongue he might be listenin with those wizard ears of his for all i know go on work a little magic yourself and disappear huh shoo
you think those clothes ometal will protect you from mages ha armor wont save you you need a barrier staff another thing about gharnef  here move in closer in case hes listenin you dont want to fight him head on he never stays put in khadein for very long anyway if he tries to attack you ride it out good things come to those who wait
you dare oppose me fool you must not value your life cower before the might of the magic imhullu once forbidden now unleashed
altean prince i fear you are not quite imposing enough to warrant my staying here but if its falchion you want come and take it i shall be waiting at the temple of thabes
no falchion the battle was for naught
 marth prince marth
huh who are you
my name is gotoh i am speaking to you from macedon through magic
gotoh the white sage
some have used that name yes you must listen to me as you suspect gharnef has made off with falchion with imhullu and falchion in the sorcerers grasp dolhr now must think twice before challenging him gharnef knows this and one day he plans to conquer dolhr and rule the entire world
is imhullu so powerful a magic then
yes the mage who wields it cannot be killed cannot be so much as scratched i was the magics guardian once knowing its forbidden power could work terrible evils so i kept it close but gharnef one of my two pupils  miloah being the other  took the forbidden tome and vanished now you are paying for my carelessness forgive me i wish to make amends by teaching you the only way to undo imhullus power
which is 
it is called starlight one blast is enough to break through imhullus shadowy protection but to cast the magic you need two orbs the lightsphere and the starsphere heed me marth when you find the lightsphere and starsphere bring them to me then i will give you the magic you seek then you will have starlight and with it gharnefs reign will end

after taking back the palace the league rode across akaneia freeing the greater part of the kingdom as they went  all except the west a landed knight there named horace who had betrayed akaneia to join doluna continued to stubbornly hold out against marths forces nyna could not fathom why such a fiercely loyal knight would turn to treachery but with her other knights calling for horaces blood she had no choice but to give in and ask marth to bring the traitor to justice
have you heard horace i am told the rebels just recaptured the palace that accursed akaneian wench never mind camuss pleas we should have put her to the sword with the rest of them 
 
hm something bothering you now dont tell me you are toying with the idea of rejoining your motherland because if you do i think you know exactly what will befall your people
yes youve made it quite clear i am an akaneian knight no longer i knew this day would come when i gave me lance to doluna i will not flinch
good then gather your soldiers and kill these rebels before they cause any more trouble
lord horace our soldiers are in position
good
shall we advance on the enemy
 no that wont be necessary well lure them in close then strike no one attacks unless the enemy makes a move first is that clear
lord horace i am marth of altea i ask that you lay down your arms 
is princess nyna safe
she is  and shes quite worried about you sir
so her highness is alive  the soldiers who died protecting her can rest in peace  now then prince marth draw your sword
what but lord horace
horacei chose to betray akaneia and now i must abide by that choice princess nyna has returned to the palace and akaneia is restored i have no regrets
lord horace who rules this land used to be a knight of akaneia after the palace fell though he bent his knee to the dolunian emperor and has been servin him ever since for that folks call him a traitor and say he tarnished his knightly brethrens reputation well thats a load of hogwash he broke his knightly oaths to protect us not cause hes some traitor please sire you have to help clear his name here lord horaces father bless him gave me this weapon as a gift long ago i know hed be glad to see it used to restore his sons honor
 are you with the league please sir im beggin ya you have to help lord horace hes always looked out for us small folk before and after he inherited the land hes a pillar of strength he is wed be dead if he hadnt made the tough choices he did the least we can do is rescue him from his plight now here ive got this magic tome one of our villagers found after the last battle on our soil you take it and find some way to save him promise
vexatious rebels ill skewer you like rabbits
nngh youll  pay 
what dejaniras been killed then  its over soldiers lay down your weapons no more akaneian blood shall be shed  mine shall be the last
bravo prince marth i yield spare the lives of my soldiers and treat my people kindly and you may do with me as you see fit
no wait please lord horace is a good man doluna threatened him said theyd raze the land corner to corner if he didnt comply so you see 
hush youve said enough
but lord horace 
horacei betrayed my fellow knights and besmirched their good name i will not dress up my sins as kindnesses i accept my punishment allow me to die a knights death
nynai will not
  princess nyna
horace i heard what you said and you have it quite right your crimes deserve death or worse
nyna what are you 
but i shall give you no knights death i shall give you a traitors life you say you will not dress up your sins i say you will not run from them either
your highness  are you saying you wish me to live
you did all in your power to protect these people that was honorable horace but if you die today no one will remember you for anything but your one act of betrayal your soldiers will have to bear that shame in your stead do you call that justice
 
starting today you shall prove to the world there was value in your actions show us a traitors worth show us what the soldiers who fought and died for you saw to be true
i  i do not know what to say
nynai have claimed your life horace you have no say you shall fight for us and you shall not die i forbid it
heh  very well your highness as you command 
nyna we have put down the western insurgence
and horace
marthi am sorry 
poor horace marth in his heart i do not think he truly wished to betray akaneia
nor i doluna must have threatened to do harm to his people
so horace capitulated to keep them safe  he acted to save lives yet the world will brand him a traitor that one word will come to define him  and none will ever know the traitors worth

the holy kingdom of archanea had come into being six centuries earlier when the regions numerous city states were unified under one monarch the first king adrah had fought valiantly to accomplish this wielding the three weapons he came to call his regalia  gifts from the gods some said the kingdom adrah forged was pronounced holy its kings were esteemed with archaneas aid six more independent kingdoms sprang up in their own time but archanea was always the greatest   and now marth was about to take his first walk through its historic palaces halls
bishop what do you make of this i hear shouting in the corridors
hmm princess nyna must have returned with an army in tow
an army really then we are saved
saved perhaps or doomed surely the enemy realizes we are more trouble alive than dead now
you do not take my meaning bishop by we i mean archanea archanea is saved if princess nyna has truly come to chase the enemy from our halls to free us then my death will have meaning
ho ho i admire your spirit child i always have but think how astram would grieve if you were to die
i i had hoped to see him one last time  to say goodbye that alone i regret
ah but you have not died yet midia hang on to hope
rebel pup you dare defy dolhr then writhe in the fires of bolganone
do not think you have won  dolhr is undying  nngh
marth thank you were it not for you i may never have seen the halls of my house again
i could not have done it alone nyna the whole archanean league fought tooth and nail this day
true and yet all the same  i have little doubt your exploits are the ones that will live on in song i have a gift for you to celebrate your achievements here this bow is called parthia it is one of the three regalia that have been passed down through house archanea the other two regalia  the sword mercurius and the lance gradivus are not here the enemy took them when they fled i am sorry i had hoped to give you all three and thus aid you in the battles to come 
your concern for me is more than enough nyna one day i will get your familys treasures back and use them to crush dolhr i swear it on this emblem of fire

the lightsphere and the starsphere marth and company set off to chiasmir and the fane of raman to find them but in their path stood a cohort of grustian knights known as the sable order the bridges across the strait would soon be choked with the brave and the dead 
prince marth i see them a cohort of grustian knights out on the far side of the bridge that must be the sable order 
marth i heard the enemy forces have been spotted
yes thats right the sable order it seems
really tell me who leads them
why does it matter
oh  no its just  they say the sable order is led by a brilliant general i was  wondering if he was riding with them today
you must mean general camus i am told dolhr is not very happy with him at the moment brilliant or not something about acting outside orders  theyll be keeping him on a short leash i dont expect well see him here
that  that is good news 
you know how the fane of raman is supposed to be protected by a fearsome guardian well i heard the “fearsome guardian” is nowt but a wee lass if thats true you have to wonder why shed stay all by herself in a dreary place like that mayhap she broke her mas favorite vase and got stuck there as a punishment ha ha right
ah youre prince marth i am est of the medonian whitewings  palla and catrias younger sister ive been looking for you initially i intended to join up with you along with my sisters but then i heard grust had made off with one of akaneias three regalia  the sword mercurius  so i flew there to get it back this is mercurius right here its lovely isnt it and powerful in the right hands i think youll find it a formidable weapon indeed
catria
est its about time you made it back i was so worried 
sorry  i wont leave you like that again we belong together anyway when the three of us surround an enemy were just about unstoppable
true  but even so i like having you somewhere i can keep an eye on you ha ha
hey whats that supposed to mean
hey palla im not slowing you and catria down am i
why would you say that
i dont know  you and she have so much more experience sometimes i  i just feel like im not pulling my load
ha ha  est  youre doing just fine there are no half whitewings or almost whitewings youre one of us because youre every bit as good as us have a little confidence
right confidence 
 feel better
uh huh thanks palla its funny  whenever i talk to you i calm right down promise youll always be there for me palla
i will  i promise
commander did anybody tell you i flew all the way to grust and brought back mercurius pretty spiffy huh
yes marth told me all about it very brave of you to undertake such a dangerous task alone well done est
hee hee you mean it thanks commander you should have seen the arrows whooshing past me left and right but im a whitewing right so i swooped down and let em have it just watch though ill find some way to top it
i dont doubt it i expect great things from you est
hee hee you mean it
you shall not pass not today not ever
you  shall  not  unnh 
weve made it across the strait
yes but the real battle may yet be ahead of us
malledus  can we be certain the lightsphere and the starsphere are in the fane of raman
yes sire but unfortunately they may not be all we find the fane is said to be guarded by a goddess one with fearsome powers those who defile her sanctuary are punished by fire none are spared from the blaze
perhaps we should reconsider marth 
perhaps  but if none are spared from the blaze where do the rumors come from besides we need those two orbs
well might i suggest you take in just a few able companions and let the sleeping dragons lie
sage advice ive no desire to tear apart a holy place whether the goddess is home or not  ill choose a handful of elite to search for the orbs with me

with the aid of the white sage gotohs powerful warp magic marth and company were transported to the faraway city of thabes once thabes was an advanced civilization but only its decay advanced now the league traced the lifeless streets to the temple at the citys heart somewhere within its walls gharnef was waiting and now marth must wrest falchion and his sister elice from the fiends grip
the temple of thabes  hes here  somewhere 
heh heh heh  come to play little marth
‘tis i gharnef i have been waiting for you
waiting
oh yes for you to dance around the continent collecting powerful weapons and killing off my competition thanks to you camus and michalis will trouble me no more you have my gratitude diligent prince
you  monster
tsk tsk dont spoil the moment now youre about to do me one last favor  die prince heh heh heh
thats what you think i have something else in mind
heh is that a threat if you mean to harm me first youll have to find me boy
and what is that supposed to mean
my prince several sorcerers have been sighted throughout the temple theyre  they all seem to be gharnef sire
heh heh fight boy fight wear yourself thin fighting puppets and shadows but the only way youll claim falchion is by defeating the real me heh heh ha ha ha ha
sire weve pinpointed where gharnef is keeping the magical apparatus that gives him his power
where
the tower of thabes atop this very temple
then we dont need to fight gharnef  if we find those apparatus
gharnefs power  a great deal of power  will be sealed forever
then lets hurry and seize the entrance to the tower
a word of caution sir stopping the apparatus will not undo imhullu power  only gharnefs he still has falchion in his keeping if you want the blade back you must defeat him now before seizing the tower
heh heh heh  you dare challenge me fool you must not value your life cower before the might of the dark magic imhullu
agh what  where did you get starlight  still you are a fool your power is not enough to defeat medeus  i shall be waiting in the pits of the inferno  for when he sends you to join me  heh heh ha ha ha
malledus quickly find the apparatus and shut them down
right away sire
 blast how  how did they find the apparatus all my power  still they are fools if they think they can defeat medeus with such cheap tricks  heh heh ha ha ha
gharnef is getting away sire shall we give chase
no  let him go without his magical apparatus he has no power left to abuse
sire we found princess elice up in the tower of thabes shes on her way to see you right  ah here she is
elice
marth oh look at you a man grown
sister i was so worried none had seen you since the castle fell i  i feared the worst
i was prepared for the worst if that was what it took to ensure your safety but they did not kill me gharnef spared my life
why would he spare you
marth have you heard of the staff of aum
the staff that brings back the dead it was lost to the world long ago or so the legend goes
yes but gharnef found it  in the resurrectory
the resurrectory what was it doing in a temple in the middle of dolhr
i could not say but that was why gharnef kept me alive he wished me to wield it the staff of aums power can only be channeled by women of royal blood marth you are going to dolhr are you not
yes i must settle things with medeus
then take me to the resurrectory along the way to claim the staff aum works but once but i will use it to revive a lost comrade
/***EOF***/
grust would harry the league no more marth led his forces on to macedon however macedons dragoons were ready to waylay them at the border countless reinforcements hovered within the fortresses waiting to strike would marth be able to lead the league safely through the gauntlet
princess minerva we will soon reach the macedonian border are you certain you wish to join the battle if youve any reservations about fighting your own countrymen 
if i did prince marth i would not have offered you my axe
but surely 
you have the wrong idea perhaps you think i wish to spare my brother and former vassals forgive them for seeing things differently
 dont you
i would be lying if i said i did not wish it were that simple but history needs to remember that when macedon went astray it was a macedonian who set things right
even if it means your own brother may die
since i was little i followed in michaliss footsteps whatever books he read i read whenever he practiced the sword i was close by watching learning  he was always a step ahead my hero something to aspire to even now some part of me loves him  i love him enough to spare him death on some strangers sword you see let him be punished by my hands
rebels you have strutted into the wrong kingdom this time
nngh i am but a pebble  in macedons unshakeable foundation 
 prince marth 
that voice lord gotoh is that you
i see you have made it to macedon you will find me in a village north of the macedon aerie their castle if you possess the lightsphere and starsphere have them in hand when you visit me here  ah yes i also have good news your sister elice is unharmed
what you are certain where is she now
thabes city of illusion gharnef took her with him when he fled i pray you rescue her soon
i will
but first bring me the two orbs without starlights mighty blast gharnef will only add your life to the list of things he has taken from you
/***EOF***/
the time to slip away had come still the prince could not quell the sadness in his heart for his sister elice
prince marth  sire sire are you listening
huh  oh malledus
get ahold of yourself sire i know how you grieve but the gra host that pursues us will not be interested we must keep moving and with all haste at that
i im sorry these thoughts are hard to put aside
from here we will cross out of altea and begin our escape to talys i trust you are prepared
talys  ive heard the name an island kingdom to the east isnt it
that is correct the king there was a good friend to your father  and perhaps more importantly a true friend it was princess elices wish that you seek refuge in talys should things ever go awry
me but not her 
ive arranged for a boat to take us from the northeast shore but to get there well first need to cut through a prison to the north i managed to come by a key to the premises let me hand it over
now on the road you may notice people who seem to be fighting for gra against their own wishes before you resort to your blade you should try talking to them first
boy i dont envy you the enemy horde is closing in on you fastern a bolt of thoron you and your friends had better hightail it on outta here
sometimes victory on a battlefield requires that someone you care about make a sacrifice but parting with one comrade may be the only way to meet another you need to accept your losses in life and move forward
my word arent you–no you cannot stay here run before their soldiers come back here this is the bow my granddaughter always used take it sire please promise youll stay safe 
enemies south of the prison
yes sir not many of em but the scouts say theyre a tough bunch all the same and guess whos with em 
 youre saying the prince is coming this way
yes sir how ought we proceed the main force ‘as yet to arrive and  to be honest sir  we need em
bah youre cowed too easily we can win if we set a trap
er a trap sir
the prince of altea will be ours just do as i tell you and well pluck this royal plum long before the main force can show up to steal all the glory heh 
you inside
grrrmph 
heh i thought altea was the great ‘ero anris kingdom didnt take moren a couple of days to break you now did it gaggles
mmph arrumph
whats the matter gaggles cant talk cause youre gagged gaggles ba ha ha ill letcha in on a little secret alteas little princeling is on ‘is way ‘ere right this moment
 
ooh but sad for you you look awful dangerous in the uniform  mister gra soldier ha soon as the prince sees you ‘ell say yow its an enemy ambush and thatll be the end of you
gugrrrmph
once the prince sticks you like a pig we get to call him marth the tyrant coz ‘e kills ‘is own countrymen
wont that be an ‘oot
rrrmph
so long gaggles better start praying to your ‘igher deity of choice
listen men your target is the prince find the prince of altea and bring me his head served on a shield
look there
no anri save us of all the places to be beset sire that is gras main force  and they are accompanied by the knights of grusts sable order our chances of routing them are slim im afraid and those of slipping away undetected afterward all but nil 
then weve no hope
i i can think of one strategy we could leave a decoy behind for when the enemy catches up
a decoy
its you theyre after sire were one of your men to stay behind disguised as you well the enemy ought to take the bait that would give you and the others time to escape
one of your men must make for that fortress on the south highroad he will act as a decoy by dressing as you and luring the enemy force away
but malledus how will he find his way back to us
sire he may not you must part with one of your comrades there is no other way
 well i will find a way you cannot expect me to agree to to abandon one of our own to a death at the hands of the enemy surely there must be another way 
forgive me sire but this is our only chance you know as well as i do that you must not die here today
no sire get back here one of your other men must take that position
look its its prince marth
oh yeah whos that then that bloke over there is dressed in the same clothes could be either of em
simpletons use your heads one of them ran the other didnt what does that tell you easy the one who stayed behind is trying to buy time for the one who fled
so er the one who took off is 
the real prince you idiot yes hie troops after him put that craven whip to the sword
wait quickly malledus we must head south and rescue him
no sire we have to press on
press on insert name might be dying back there
if he were then why would you be so selfish as to let him die in vain honor him by allowing his life and his choice to mean something
  
 all right
i will honor him  i will go
the prince fled south bah seems the plums fallen too far from our tree  no matter open the north door we can still crush the altean rabble he left behind 
blast that archer was on our side
they killed the captive heh heh  what fools hie lets give them the punishment fools deserve open the north door lure them out and strike them down
all but the prince have been slain good open the north door the little whelp is ours now
sire there is a village over yonder its residents may be willing to help why dont you try paying them a visit
prince marth make haste sire
draug is that you what are you doing here
draug sir the enemy has crossed the border from the west theyll be upon us soon
right were on our way sire this is norne she heard wind of our struggles and wishes to fight for altea
prince marth tis an honor by your leave though ill be savin the curtsy bobbin for later quickly sire
this is the wrong prince no you dare make a fool of me kill him make this faux prince suffer
may i suffer for my sins 
yow its an enemy ambush
rrrgmph mrph
huh youve been gagged here ill get that  wait i know you youre one of our archers er 
gordin sire my name is gordin the enemy captured me and left me in this mortifying state
i see well im glad youre unharmed but im afraid we cannot stay here a moment longer stay behind me and 
i can fight sire if you have a bow i could use i would be honored to fight at your side
heh these old bones are still good for something farewell my prince live and grow strong 
glory to altea land of my birth farewell sire fortune protect you 
good  alteas hope is restored farewell sire fortune protect you 
count this knight honored to die in the service of his prince live sire and grow strong 
i was dead anyway till you came sir  if im to die again at least let me die for you fortune protect you sire 
and so marth and his knights left altea heavy of heart and bleary of eye 
look sire see how altea shrinks on the horizon 
aven 
i beg your pardon
i am a craven powerless to save my sister to staunch my kingdoms wounds to ease my peoples fears 
this was your only recourse sire but surely one day you will be able to set things right 
surely why do words of such conviction smack so much of uncertainty when spoken not surely jagen assuredly gra will pay for their acts today though allow me to wallow in this pain to feel every awful twist of it i never want to forget
sire 
i will return altea your prince will return to you one day

long ago medeus king of the dragonkin conquered the continent of archanea beginning an age of fear and despair for all its people that tyranny was broken however when an unlikely hero intervened a young man hailing from the altea region appeared with a divine blade in hand he stood against the shadow dragon and struck him down for some time after the land enjoyed an age of peace however after a centurys passing the shadow dragon returned he forged an alliance with a fiendish sorcerer who sought to rule the world and their combined might toppled kingdom upon unsuspecting kingdom
again darkness threatened to engulf the continent it fell upon the king of altea sole descendant of the dragon slayer hero to sally forth with the divine blade and fulfill his blood destiny
his son prince marth remained at home with the boys mother his elder sister and a garrison manned by alteas neighbor and ally gra thus the boy applied himself to the ways of both pen and sword until one day 
his sister stayed behind to buy his freedom
prince marth  are you awake beggin your pardon sire but the princess has asked to see you
elice is she all right
she seemed to be sire but her words implied a certain urgency she bade you dress quickly and wait by the throne
 has something happened
its our forces off in gra sire there seems to ave been some sort of incident but  well im not privy to the specifics
i see  thank you ill be there shortly
my sister said she would meet me by the throne

weve not many soldiers left this is hard to bear i know but the castle is lost we must face that i will look for mother and join you as soon as i can you find jagen and get away from here  far away understand
 all right but promise you wont be long
goodbye marth may you live long

grust had caught the league unawares forcing them to flee to pyrathi but the kingdom of pyrathi seldom made contact with the outside world and their king mannu was wroth when he heard of the leagues unexpected visit there were whispers mannu was a dragonkin  rumors soon to be proved true
interlopers barbarous filth they dare dig their heels and hooves into this hallowed ground i will kill them for this  one by one  then turn the crimson grass beneath them into their pyre
your best chance of stopping a manakete lies in what they call a wyrmslayer its a type of sword and i hear one is enshrined in the eastern palace
prince marth i am jeorge an archanean sniper i fought to defend our palace from dolhr but the enemys strength was too great we lost and i was captured thankfully theyre not half as bright as they are strong and i managed to slip away when they were not looking i heard you were on your way to pyrathi and that princess nyna was with you so i came here to offer my help let me fight with you to save my land and i will use this silver bow to show you marksmanship unlike any youve ever seen
foolhardy humans defying a manakete king tremble now and feel the last quickening of your heart
what  slain by this fangless coward and his minions
prince marth i am catria of the whitewinged order of macedon i have come with a request from our mistress the princess minerva she is planning to lead us against dolhr in rebellion however her hands are tied so long as the enemy holds her younger sister the princess maria captive will you rescue princess maria from their clutches that my whitewing sisters and i might join in your fight
/***EOF***/
trace a line around the continents north eastern plains and you have aurelis this kingdom alone had somehow resisted dolhrs attempts to conquer it but only by some miracle by the time marth arrived in aurelis much of its territory had already been carved up by dolhrs ally macedon still the kings younger brother hardin refused to give up without a fight the people called him coyote and he intended to live up to the name since its founding aurelis and the holy kingdom of archanea shared close ties and months ago princess nyna of archanea had come to hardins aid by his side she had called on the people to fight  but few remained to answer macedons finest soldiers were closing in nyna knew they were out of time 
princess nyna ive spotted them the altean army is on the far side of the river
theyre here at last prince marth has come for us
so it seems now what say you we turn this battle around im going to take my men east to join our might with marths together we will retake the castle stay here my lady and wait for the good news
a castle like ours must be chock full o royal treasure ah but only a thief could get inside chests locked that tight 
the shops in port warren feature wares both rare and beautiful be thrifty with your gold now if youve any plans to venture that way later also keep in mind that shops keep only a limited stock of some items once theyre sold out you cant buy any more
word has it that the enemy is mustering its forces in the fortresses nearby youd better hurry and send units to bar their exits
well gday there son  why the wide eyed stare aincha never seen a country village before you know speakin o rare sights i once went to pyrathi where i saw me a real live manakete cripes let me tell you what a shock that was in a blink this regular old feller turned into an enormous dragon i mean i aint stupid id heard of the dragonkin before id just always assumed manaketes looked somethin like parakeets sheesh   what oh this i picked this stone up while i was there dunno what it is but how often do you spy a glowin red rock ya know what im sayin but honestly its been kinda creepin me out lately you want it go on ‘n take it sheesh 
oh  master wendell teacher
well hello merric what a surprise good to see you havens blown yourself up yet

hmm  its khadein lad the land is not as you remember it that fiend gharnef seized power and now hes draped the city in darkness i fear khadein is doomed  i could not stay and serve him so i snuck out alone
very brave of you sir hmm  why dont you join us then if gharnef is helping dolhr then hes a bitter enemy of ours as much as he is to yours and khadeins we couldnt possibly leave the city in his clutches and im sure the prince would be pleased as pie to have magic as robust as yours in his arsenal
hmm you do know how to argue a point ive no taste for war but war is what ive been served come merric well fight together tell your prince of altea that wendell is at his service
prince marth i am wendell a pontifex of khadein city of magic our pleas for peace have failed and khadein has been taken over by one of the other pontifices his name is gharnef and he and the many mages who swear allegiance to him have allied themselves with dolhr prince marth i ask you now please lend me your help in thwarting his vile ambitions
prince marth i am wendell a pontifex of khadein city of magic our pleas for peace have failed and khadein has been taken over by one of the other pontifices his name is gharnef and he and the many mages who swear allegiance to him have allied themselves with dolhr prince marth i ask you now please lend me your help in thwarting his vile ambitions
lord hardin i am marth of altea ive come to offer what help i can
and i very gratefully accept it stories of your exploits travel fast young prince i feel as though ive gained a thousand allies in one
ive heard a few stories of you as well coyote it will be an honor to fight alongside such a courageous man
ive left princess nyna someplace safe for now we need to decide who will command here i was hoping it would be you
me but sir hardin you are far more qualified 
tsk princess nyna would not be pleased to hear us nitpicking over who will be listed in the history books take command so we can oust this macedonian scum and be done with it
you are sure
make no mistake lord marth i consider myself an exceptionally good judge of character if i thought you acted out of selfishness or ambition i would not extend the offer i have you have my trust
lord hardin thank you that is an honor if you dont mind me saying so  i feel as though ive made a good friend we share the same ideals i think
that we do may our friendship be a long one
princess minerva bade me guard this castle in her absence you shall not take it so long as i stand
heh  you think youve won wretch far from it 
prince marth your arrival could not have been better timed please accept our gratitude princess nyna of archanea is en route from the fortress i am sure she will wish to meet you the battle is not won yet though many of the enemy continue to hold out within the castles halls stay wary

the samsooth mountains whose gashing peaks rose up and divided the peninsula since before anyone could remember the mountains had belonged to bandits blights on the land whose acts of plunder kidnapping and arson knew no bounds out of fear their victims gave these peaks another name the ghouls teeth while the bandits who ruled atop the teeths craggy crowns took a name as well the samsooth sires or soothsires 
hey cmon lena shake a leg we need to get out of the teeth and we need to do it yesterday rumor has it the knights of altea are at the foot of the mountain we wont get a better chance its just a little bit farther stick with me

uh uh honey no can do i didnt betray my boys back there so you could zap me on out of here alone forget the staff ill come back later and get it for you myself all right right now though i need you to run tick tack now move that frock
 
take care around mercenaries theyre quite skillful if youre unlucky they may drop you at stroke
units with high skill deal more frequent critical hits units with high speed have an easier time avoiding enemy attack
hunters are stronger than archers but they also have weaker defenses keep them out of close range combat
oh ho ho dont you look young and full of life such a warm smile here deserves a nice reward here take this axe—this evil abomination of an axe beware its blade drinks blood and devours flesh id hate to see you come to any harm”
will it be tears or blood you weep first
fools

dolhr had little trouble forcing him into an alliance now he had taken ill even as grust suffered its string of defeats at the hand of the league the once mighty kingdom was poised to fall 
nyna well soon be launching the attack if you have something to tell me  now is the time to do it
all right marth as you wish when the dolhr grust allied forces seized control of archanea the entire royal family was killed save me i was given into grusts custody  the custody of the sable order to be more specific i am told dolhr wished for my execution  and with it the end of the holy lineage of house archanea  and grust was willing to comply
but you are not dead
that is right i was not put to the sword the sable orders captain came to my defense his name  was camus
 
camus protected me knowing he risked incurring the wrath of the shadow dragon he was the one who eventually arranged for my escape to aurelis
 i had no idea that certainly explains dolhrs displeasure with him
i hated him too at first but in time i found my hatred tempered by the compassion he showed me my feelings  changed and now all i wish is to see him again  but not if it means you and he must fight
nyna  do you  i cannot make any promises but i will do what i can i hope you can accept that
thank you marth i could not ask for more
ah prince marth welcome welcome tell me have you seen my granddaughter lena is she well if she happens to you would you see she gets this hammerne staff its a staff of repairing passed down through our family im certain shell make good use of it of course not all items can be repaired be sure to caution her about that
general camus can you hear me it is i marth of altea i must speak with you please show yourself
prince marth i am camus of grust
general i have no wish to fight you you know this battle is pointless surely you must
so long as grust continues to support dolhrs ambitions it does not matter what i know or think i am a knight i have a duty to fight for my motherlands glory till the very end
but surely 
prince marth there is nothing you can do or say i am party to your fathers murder are you a man or not draw your sword
stop camus
princess nyna 
nyna what are you doing here this is the middle of the battlefield
i know i know  but please camus listen to me  camus you gave me back my life and marth he gave me back my kingdom i do not wish to see that the two of you fight it is  it is unbearable please camus fight with us we need your strength  i need it
i am sorry princess
what but camus
were my heart my master i would do exactly as you say but what sort of knight abandons his kingdom  his king  now when they need him the most would you have me toss away the life i have built as if it meant nothing at all
no camus i  i dont know 
i have lived as a knight and i intend to die as one there are no other roads left for me to walk farewell my princess i shall never forget our days together at the palace few though they were i pray you meet someone who can bring joy back into your life
no victory here can give grust back her glory
this too must be fate
general lorenz my name is caeda i hail from talys my father has told me quite a bit about you
princess caeda my look what a lovely young woman youve grown into your father was a good friend to me many years ago
general i heard you opposed grust forming an alliance with dolhr why didnt you try to stop it
you think i did not try princess our king is meek in the end dolhr proved better at cowing him than i did
but sir surely you know that dolhr intends to use manaketes to conquer humankind you must act now  for grusts sake if not the worlds join us general lorenz we can put an end to this battle right now
hmm what you say makes sense enough but i serve grust i cannot simply betray my country
ah but what makes a country
pardon
is it one man  your king or is it the countless innocent people who make their home here
well thats  hmm 
my father has a saying “a kingless country is a country still but a king without subjects rules naught but hills” if you disobey your king to ensure his subjects safety how is that a betrayal you are protecting his reign
protecting his reign  aha ha ha ha ha ahh that mad logic i feel as though ive shed twenty years and im talking to your father again you win princess i yield i will join you in the interests of king and country har
general lorenz hold
what you are marth the altean prince 
yes sir the king of talys told me much about you he said you opposed grust forming an alliance with dolhr right from the very start
thats right
then fight with us with your help we can defeat dolhr
forgive me prince marth but am i to just abandon my country then
 
i know yours is the just cause still i wish to remain a grustian general right to the end i am fighting here because that is the way for me to honor my kingdom
forgive me general but  is it really
pardon
since you are a grustian general then surely you fight for grusts future first and foremost but tell me from where you are standing now do you see any future for your country
 i shall have to learn to mask my misgivings better if you can pluck them from my heart so easily you are quite correct if i care what becomes of grust then i cannot continue to stand by dolhr so i will stand by you instead prince  and hope the future is a bit easier to spot from there
prince marth i am general lorenz of grust i have decided to join you in the interest of my fellow grustians
i am honored general thank you caeda tells me you and her father were close
yes how the princess has grown though sharp as a tack that one such a change from when she was  now what am i saying caeda has always been clever even as a wee girl she knew how to wrap her elders about her little finger
you knew caeda when she was little
oh yes the mischief she got into well those are stories for another day first weve a battle to finish
so we do sir
with this lance gradivus i am all but invincible a pity you had to waste your life
nyna  fare  well 
forgive me nyna i was unable to reunite you with your general
no marth i  i should not have made such a selfish request i am sorry so terribly sorry 
 
the worst part marth  the worst part is i knew it would come to this ever since i gave you the emblem i just knew  have you heard the story of artemiss curse
no 
the last time the fire emblem changed hands to save house archanea it was not without cost there was a princess named artemis who loved your ancestor anri with all her heart he loved her as well  but when medeus appeared the two were parted forever she cursed the fire emblem  called it the end of war but also the end of love now the emblem has changed hands again and i am the one who is cursed 
nyna 
look at me so quick to fall apart  you lost loved ones in altea and took it so bravely but i cannot be so brave  please  leave me for a moment this is too much to bear i need to  to confront my feelings 
 say no more nyna  princess i will step out send for me if you need anything
thank you marth 
ahh  camus camus  ahh  no  oh why 
nyna  princess
i am told camus has not been found perhaps he still lives i know how selfish it is to wish it  but if he cannot be with me then i must cling to the hope his life has not been cut short it is all i have left

the archanean heroes hurried to altea but they would not go unchallenged waiting for them at fort menedy were grusts artillery regiment the dreaded “wooden cavalry” missiles crashed down rocking the earth as the enemy ballistae rumbled forward had marth and the league any hope of triumphing over such firepower
grusts artillery our opponent is mighty
nonetheless we must face them head on they stand between us and altea
that hunger for danger worries me marth humanitys hopes rest on your shoulders i would sooner not see them crushed
which humanitys hopes or my shoulders  have a little faith nyna the enemy ballisticians can strike from afar but theyre powerless up close all we need to do is move in and silence them before they do too much damage watch
ballisticians are really only vulnerable to one type of weapon the thunderbolt fresh out of thunderbolts then youll just have to dart in and hit ‘em at close range
we and our countrymen wanted to fight for archanea you know not just us neither they say some of grusts soldiers would sooner rally under archaneas banner than dolhrs but general camus conquered us ‘fore we could act and grust has had us under their thumb ever since heres hopin you win this battle quick we like bein free dont you know
prince marth i presume the names beck i fought in the battle at castle deil after my shameful defeat there see i took refuge in this village and when i heard your army was marchin this way i readied my ballista hopin for another taste of battle so how bout it princey take me along im packin thunderbolts see the enemy ballisticiansll never know what hit em
hello my lover
midia  midia my sweet can it really be you i feared you were dead
oh astram how could you not have heard archanea is free the altean army came and liberated the palace along with all the hostages within now we fight as one come with us astram you neednt dance to dolhrs fiddle any longer
ive a mind to break their fiddle for all the evils they have wrought
now you can we can take them together
that we can  midia i am sorry i left you alone i will not make that mistake again
no you certainly wont now that i have you back youll find me exceedingly reluctant to let you go
ooh  yes i can see that just take care you dont crush me instead of dolhr
you are prince marth
correct sir astram
 forgive my lack of courtesy but you and i need to be clear on a certain point
oh
while i have decided to lend you my sword my allegiance lies with princess nyna not you my lord i will follow your orders but should i learn you have been false to her or that you are manipulating her  heads will roll
well sir astram in the interest of keeping my head atop my shoulders let me suggest this fight with me watch me and then judge for yourself whether i am worthy of your skill and of your help
   hmm very well your orders then lord marth
hmph care to see what steel the wooden cavalry is really made of
nngh  so the prince can fight  but  your victories are numbered  general camus and his sable order will be upon you rabble very  soon  and you will die  on the lance  of the greatest warrior  alive 
spectacularly done marth  does something ail you i thought you would be happier
today there was this commoner  she mentioned grust was divided about the war some of its people wanted to fight with altea she said ever since i lost my father and kingdom ive held nothing but hate in my heart for gra and grust but not once did i give any thought to what must have been going on in their heads
and now you find your hate for them has been lessened
no  the hate remains i will never forget the pain they inflicted upon me the rage i felt yet now at least i can tell you its not just hate not anymore
not all evils are wrought of evil purposes perhaps this sounds naive but a true leader needs to look at his opponent and see more than just an enemy

thus prince marth escaped altea castle with sir jagen and company at his side however this success would mean little to him once he learned the cost the boys woes were just beginning
cain how are your wounds you should rest
these scratches its my pride youre wounding sire  anyway we must talk theres a reason ive returned  sire i am i am to deliver to you his majestys last words
last words you dont mean father 
my condolences sire the king died valiantly on the fields of gra the traitors took from him the divine blade falchion and gave no quarter to those of our soldiers who remained 
i i see so theyre all dead father too 
his last words were as follows tell my son that i leave the future of altea and our continent in his hands he must rise now where i have fallen as falchions rightful heir he has been born into greatness  now he must be great
 father i will try 
 sire i i cannot bear this failing to protect his majesty then leaving my brothers to die slinking away like some coward this indignity is too much to bear one day i will repay them in kind i will avenge the fallen i swear it
cain you speak for us both when that day comes we will punish them together gra dolhr all of them
sire we ought to pay a visit to these homes outside the castle
your countrymen love you perhaps they have knowledge that may serve us
just ‘cause you see an enemy over yonder doesnt mean you should go runnin up to him like a fool lure one out then take ‘im down then go out and lure the next thats how we did it when i was a lad
sir jagen is a paladin the champion of altea ive never met him but i hear hes strong as an ox despite his age still you cant have a champion like him do everything thats not fair to all your would be future champions let our other units fight and gain experience or you may find yourself in a real fix down the line
if you get hurt rest a spell at a fort a short stay there and youll be feeling hale as ever
javelins and hand axes are versatile weapons that let you attack both up close and from a short distance away
weapons arent indestructible you know when a weapons durability reaches 0 thats it no more weapon so be sure to keep an eye on those numbers
look sire not all of gras might harries the castle theyve left soldiers here outside
elice will have no plans to escape  lets seize that fort across the water perhaps we can squash enemy reinforcement at the source
mages that will complicate things they dont need to get as close to do us harm well need to approach carefully
there that ought to do for the enemy soldiers around here malledus why arent you with my sister did you leave her someplace safe
 princess elice will not be joining us she has elected to stay at the castle
hold sire where are you going
where do you think
stop sire consider for a moment why the princess would go as far as to lie to you to ensure your escape your sister knows that you are the future of altea  nay the whole land
 
im our future 
sire  you must live drink deeply now of these injustices sup on these slights they serve remember them one day you will lead us back here to avenge the fallen and reclaim altea in their names
 then it seems my life is no longer mine to hazard
in your veins flows the blood of a hero  the blood of anri you are a son of house archanea and sole heir to falchion  our only hope of defeating medeus emperor of dolhr sire weret in my power i would have you choose you own path but im afraid your path has chosen you
  
his last words were as follows tell my son that i leave the future of altea and our continent in his hands he must rise now where i have fallen as falchions rightful heir he has been born into greatness  now he must be great
/***EOF***/
sire
 frey abel youre alive
yes sire princess elice bade us protect you sir malledus stayed behind to accompany her
sire we must be quick sir jagen awaits us at the gates
blast this will not do how did gras soldiers ever make it this far
jagen and the others will be caught like mice we need to seize the gates and secure the area immediately
now whos that who thinks they can sneak up on us ho ho  whats this i spy the altean prince oi listen up you lot bag the prince dead or alive hell fetch us as sweet a reward as the mind can conjure
hmm they have archers  we need to take care they dont pick us off from afar
sire it gladdens me to see you in one piece its not safe for you here we must be away at once
prince marth where are you answer me sire
cain  thats cain
cain youre supposed to be in gra why have you returned without  yow those wounds 
sire its really you i feared the worst that his message would go undeliv agh 
in that state i dont know how you even stayed ahorse those gashes must be treated at once 
no sire not until weve escaped
 cain i trust you can put off bleeding to death for just a while longer
of course sir  i aim to please 
princess elice the enemy is nearly upon us gather your things quickly
no malledus i am staying here
s staying here what madness is this
too many people have died to keep altea and its castle safe i cannot abandon what so many lives have brought with father and mother unaccounted for i am the natural choice to remain with alteas people and besides by staying i can buy time for the rest of you to escape
nonsense just gather your things and 
malledus i am not suggesting i am commanding if something befalls father marth will become the last person in the entire world worthy of wielding the falchion i want you to guide him malledus  even when the rest of us no longer can
princess i will try my best
theres not much time go malledus  go

dolhr  land of the manaketes before medeus the dragonkin had few dealings with the human realm but when the shadow dragon came everything changed he sunk all archanea into a cycle of war in which heroes rose and heroes fell  always claiming his cause was just and the humans deaths deserved but now medeuss empire was crumbling  he was nearing the end of his reign  even as marth was nearing the end of his long quest
there sire up on the mountains to the south you can see dolhr keep
and inside is medeus king of the earth dragons  the one they call the shadow dragon  why doesnt he leave the keep and face us
i recall lord gotoh saying his return is not yet complete only within the keeps walls can he maintain dragon form
really  then we have the advantage 
to dolhr keep then let us put a stop to this war
nestled in the mountains far to the southeast is a holy temple known as the resurrectory use the staff of aum there and they say you can call a departed friend back from beyond the river of death
princess elice youre safe
oh my merric is that you i havent seen you in ages  so youve been fighting with the league thank you for keeping marth safe
well i did learn a spell or two in khadein here princess get behind me ill face the enemy for us both
youll  face the  aha ha oh merric
whwhats so funny princess i was quite serious ill have you know
ha ha forgive me merric its just i remembered you when you were little  you were always a bit delicate oftentimes i had to nurse you back to health remember
but that was– i couldnt– yes
and look at you now such a brave strong man a far cry from the old merric but you dont have to pretend i know youre far too sweet to mow down hordes of enemies and  i think i prefer it that way
you  you do
this land all of it  it belonged to us then you humans took it defiled it
rrgh  emperor  medeus  forgive your servants weakness 
emperor the enemy has broken through the gates
that impudent boy  have the guards take their positions the keep must be defended
at once
hmph youll find an earth dragon like me harder to tame than gharnef brat come and face me ill tear the ground asunder and send you straight down to hell
marth  can you hear me
lord gotoh
i know you mean to challenge medeus but you and your companions havent the power to win
what why not because i failed to retrieve falchion
you also failed to save the divine dragon girl
i  did not mean for anything to happen to her 
you can put your heart at ease tiki is not dead she has merely returned to her slumber still without her powers  we must take other steps  select a handful of your best warriors i must send you into an unseen dimension
an  unseen dimension my lord
a place outside the confines of our world there you will find a tower and once in the tower you must pass its keepers test if your strength and your need are great enough the towers master will answer  and then perhaps your fortunes will be changed for the better

gras betrayal of altea years earlier had come as a shock of course until that day they attacked marths kingdom in the name of dolhr gra had been a trustworthy neighbor and ally while the altean army was out on an expedition gra struck from the rearm annihilating the altean soldiers killing marths father king cornelius and stealing falchion the blade of light it was a crushing blow much time had passed since that sad day and much had changed now it was marths turn to descend on gra bastion and face king jiol the man who had robbed him of his father
king jiol theyre ‘ere the league is outside the bastion
league how dare you call them that i see naught but a prince of ghosts and his pack of rebels
b beggin your pardon sire but everybody calls em the league now altea and aurelis and archanea the league of as you might say
shut up you idiot hmmm so the princeling has returned and he leads all the might of archanea with the fire emblem in hand did you send to dolhr for reinforcements like i asked
of course sire macedons pegasus knights are on their way
pegasus knights how am i supposed to stop the lea  those rebels with a handful of of winged ponies send another messenger tell them we need camuss sable order or or michaliss dragoons blast i deserve the same protection as the rest of the empire betraying altean was gharnefs idea let let him fight the brat dont just stand there do something i dont want to die
at level 10 some units can change class  move up in the world you might say cavaliers become paladins mercenaries become ‘eroes and err  well i forget the rest
with a silver card you can buy from shops at ‘alf price sounds like somethin out of a dream eh
you must be prince marth of altea i have a favor to ask of you this magic tome belongs to bishop boah of archanea general volzhin of dolhr has been keeping it stashed away but it found its way into my hands you might say i would appreciate greatly if you could return it to the good bishop in my stead one other thing  please take care of princess nyna i am counting on you to keep her safe  i must go now but our paths will cross again you can be certain of that
greetings prince marth i am palla of the whitewinged order of macedon my younger sister and i parted ways with macedon the moment we heard princess maria was free until now we had fought for dolhr against our will  but no longer you have freed us to do what our hearts tell us is right i wish to fight with my mistress princess minerva my lance is hers and yours still sire i fear for my youngest sister est she flew to grust some time ago and has yet to return if the three of us  catria est and i  are reunited we can serve you all the better i hope est is safe
hail prince marth ‘tis me catria we meet again my elder sister and i heard our mistress princess minerva had joined your ranks so we absconded from macedon to come and look for you here i will fight my hardest for you sire you need only give the command
grrr  altean rabble i should have killed you stragglers back when i had the chance
thus falls  the mighty kingdom  of gra 
well done marth altea is just a step away now you can take back your home
yes and take it back i shall but 
something is wrong what troubles you
falchion isnt here
the divine blade was it supposed to be
yes when one of my knights returned from the battle where my father cornelius fell he said gra had stolen falchion and if we are to defeat dolhr and the shadow dragon medeus we need that blade
prince marth
did you find it malledus
no it seems gharnef made off with it
gharnef then to find falchion

not all of the leagues soldiers took catria of the whitewings at her word some insisted her plea was a ruse a trap concocted by princess minerva herself marth doubted that though he had seen the woman in lefcandith valley and she did not strike him as a sort of conniving menace his followers feared as the brunt of grusts might drew closer marth led the league to castle deil determined to attack the citadel and rescue the young macedonian princess maria
princess minerva what brings you here youve left your post not very wise might i remind you poor conduct on your part could have repercussions on how comfortable your sister remains
i am aware of my sister thank you  i did not come to make trouble just let me see maria for a little while shes only a child general think of what she must be going through
impossible im afraid she is a hostage if your sisters well being concerns you then start following orders
general grave news the rebel army has been sighted east of castle deil
what why in creation would the rebels come here blast order the dragoons to sortie and dont forget to send word to the main army we need reinforcements
rebels  then marth has arrived 
you know once there were three great magi in our world miloah the master of aura gharnef the dark pontifex and gotoh the white sage but now miloah is gone  if only there were somebody left powerful enough to stop gharnef 
that medonian princess minerva  she doesnt seem like a bad sort i have a sister too and if somebody threatened to hurt her  well im just sayin you cant always judge people based on their actions
oh you must be prince marth my hes so dashing  thank you for rescuing me please be sure to tell my sister i am free shell be grateful for the news now then shall we be off im coming with you of course  no protesting i wish to help
greetings prince marth i am minerva of macedon thank you for saving my sister marias plight forced me to treat you as an enemy when i knew you were not suffice to say i am deeply sorry for that  the whole world has gone mad most of macedon fights for dolhr now my own brother michalis leads them and on their hands is the blood of their king my father they must be stopped i must stop them still i fear for my soldiers whom i can no longer protect especially the three whitewing sisters palla catria and est dolhr worried we would rebel and forced us to separate if they knew i was safe they would join your ranks in a heartbeat we are yours to command sire let us help you defeat dolhr and repay them for sullying macedons honor

theyre a force  to be reckoned  with  rrgh 
marth have you ever heard of pontifex miloah
the one who defended archanea with the power of aura of course he and his magic are famous but i read miloah died in a battle with gharnef soon after the fiend sold his soul to dolhr 
alas miloah did die  but his daughter linde yet lives i am told she inherited her fathers skill with aura magic  but since the battle with gharnef none have seen her wherever she is it cannot be pleasant  marth please find linde with her father gone we are the only family the girl has left

after shattering macedons main force outside aurelis castle marth next led his army into the castles halls to liberate the kingdom a number of treasures slept in aurelis castles nooks and crannies but how to extract them before they could fall into enemy hands “only a thief could open chests locked that tight” grumbled one of marths men but we dont have any thieves with us  do we
what the rebels are inside the castle grrr very well armored units intercept the intruders archers defend the throne thieves you go gather up the treasure while i make preparations to withdraw you have your orders dont let those rebels anywhere near this chamber

me ive washed my hands of thievery and joined the forces of justice
ohhh really justice so then this wouldnt have nothin to do with some new lady friend you always did have a soft spot for a pretty face and the right features 
wha  can it you little fink i said its about justice im entitled to have moral crisis now and then  you know what just for that you are gonna work for me startin right now
what do i have to  well all right you drive a hard bargain but what can i say i missed ya chief just make sure i get a cut out of the haul
 wow really a prince you say thanks for springin me im rickard just a small time thief mind you but ive got big aspirations i broke in here to clean the place out and instead it was me that got my cloak cleaned  since you saved my hide i guess the least i can do is lend my services in return

blast theyre upon me why didnt those idiot soldiers stop them
rrgh  why  
prince marth  at long last i am nyna of house archanea ‘tis archaneas burden to protect the world of crisis  a duty i have striven to fulfill but dolhr has laid waste to my kingdom and now i find myself powerless to stop the world from falling into ruin marth  please pick up the banner where i have let it fall lead your might against dolhr and free us all
of course princess nyna altea swore fealty to archanea long ago a vow we have always kept and as you know it is in my blood – house alteas blood – to destroy medeus just as anri did before me
thank you marth then let me give you this this crest is called the fire emblem house archanea bestows it only upon a true champion one we believe has the power to save the world with it you gain the right to open treasure chests across the land and wield the precious items within i know you will use them well never give up marth fight until the day you restore light to our world

the league had routed hollstadts knights and recaptured most of the kingdom but there was still the castle to deal with before altea would be free the mage dragon morzas remained entrenched within its walls unlike general camus who preceded him morzas had been a cruel warden slaughtering many innocent alteans at the slightest provocation marth roiled to think such a monster still sat upon his noble fathers throne
kee hee hee  wretched altean whelp stumbling home to the slaughter  what fool throws away a life already so preciously bought your mother liza is dead i killed her myself your sister elice lives only because gharnef wanted her so what will become of you little prince will you run for your life a second time or will you stay this time to die emperor medeus would not put me on this throne if he thought you could remove me from it kee hee hee 
kee hee  witless human none defy a mage dragon and live to speak of it
grrf  i stand  corrected b ut you still lack the power  to defeat medeus 
marth any word have you found your family your sister
 my sister was taken by gharnef she is no longer here  and my my mother is  she is dead slain by that dolhrian dragon 
  marth i am truly sorry 
i thought there would be something some part of my old life i would be coming back to i fought so hard 
you fought wonderfully marth
 sire might i have a moment
all the moments you want malledus what is it
your people have gathered outside the castle they are overjoyed to be free again sire and would like very much to see their prince
all right then ill go at once
marth perhaps you should let that wait just until you are able to share their joy with them we could send someone in your stead 
no that would not do today is a momentous day for my kingdom and my people i must celebrate with them now not later anything else would be a disservice to those who died to save altea i am a prince before i am a son or a brother come malledus let us go greet my people
“glory to marth our prince of light glory to our star and savior” marth smiled down at his people and waved the great commanders last victory of the day was commanding his tears not to flow

marth did as gotoh instructed and chose soldiers for his journey into the unseen what lay within the tower in this alternate world to test him marths heart wavered but with neither the divine blade falchion nor the divine dragon girl to aid him the towers master was his last hope of defeating medeus gotoh had told marth to find a coffin so while most of his companions remained in the material world to battle doluna marth and his chosen few scoured the tower to search of a mysterious savior
this must be the tower lord gotoh spoke of 
sire its teeming with soldiers  who are they they fly no recognizable banner
they are the keepers whose test i must pass
you mean to fight them then
gotoh says we must prove ourselves very well well seize the tower follow me
sire look stairs beneath the throne where could they lead
 do you think this is the coffin
there are no others and look these markings around it are the same pattern we saw in the fane of raman 
hmm youre right 
we found a dragon girl in the fane  i wonder if these symbols huh
sire the coffin  its opening
what no it must be some kind of trap or  or some kind of  er 
 woman could she be the master gotoh spoke of
 who are you
my name is marth prince of altea and you my lady
me my name  is nagi
nagi  i was sent here to find you by a man named gotoh
gotoh  i know that name but from where i cannot recall
youve lost your memory
i  cannot say for certain but your voice  i heard you calling did you rouse me from my sleep
i  er  not on purpose
your soul  called out to me begging for my help for this blade 
that thats falchion how did you get it
i cannot remember  but you need it i know that and you need my powers
your  powers my lady
take me with you i must  finish what i started  i think i must fight with you
/***EOF***/
at long last altea was free again marth took the league to helena castle in the north an old fortress and key supply point during dolhr and grusts occupation there he meant to seize the last of the enemys gold and provisions but grust would not give up the castle without a fight 
lord dactyl ive brought the mage
good hold him up
 nngh 
well then have you been persuaded to fight for us
 never id rather die
youd rather die ha as if a spell slinging vagabond like you has any choice in the matter enough strip him of all his possessions and lock him up someplace perhaps we can use him later
theres not much to strip him of milord just the tome and this ring 
ring let me have a look at that
no dont you  grr let me go dont you touch ursulas ring
wha  what are you  yaagh
o oi take your hands off lord dactyl
rrgh  please not the ring  give it back
unhand me you filthy maggot
nngh  unnh 
take this wretch away now
at once milord
hmph all that for some tawdry ring  hmm that gives me an idea 
ive brought him milord
good ive had a change of heart i am considering giving that ring of yours back
 
but you must face the league for us how much considering i do hinges on how well you fight
 and how am i to fight unarmed my lord
hmm  ah yes well you can have your little book back but you know what the consequences will be if you betray us 
for now ill just have to feign obedience 
sorry i mean you no harm but neither have i any wish to die here
blast where have those indolent guards gone
unnh  gwaaah
prince marth grusts garrison left their war chest when they fled this much gold should buy plenty of equipment might i suggest sire you avail yourself of this opportunity to outfit your soldiers our next opponent will be grusts sable order by our scouts reports they march to meet us as we speak many say their knights are the strongest on the continent well want to be well prepared
youre prince marth arent you i wish to thank you
 who are you
my name is etzel i am a traveling sorcerer those grustian cowards stole a ring from me and were it not for you i might never have seen it again
the ring must have been very dear to you then
its all i have to remember my wife by she got caught in the fighting back when gra betrayed altea 
those were dark days you have my deepest sympathies i lost my father in the same battle
will there be no end to this bloodshed
there will etzel i have sworn to end it thats the very reason all of us fight
and you think you can end it just like that from anyone elses lips that would sound absurdly naive but i can tell you are sincere tell me prince have you any need for an extra  spell slinger ive no taste for war but i do have a fierce hunger for ending it lets usher in a new era you and i

oh and what is that
we must defeat grust once and for all if we march south without finishing them off we have our rear exposed
then you mean to invade
yes and this time general camus will be there to meet us i am sure of it camus the sable they call him many extol him as the most able warrior alive it will be a fierce battle  but one we cannot avoid
you are certain we must face him
we have crippled grust but they will regroup and stand in our way again no we need to stamp this fire out before the wind catches it and starts spreading it anew
very well but before you attack there is something i must tell you later though  not yet i must sort my feelings out first
