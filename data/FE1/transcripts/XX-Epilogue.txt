@Opening 
Medeus is defeated. The Dolhr Empire once again fades into darkness. After three long years of battle across Archanea for Marth and his friends... Light breaks upon the land, and the darkness recedes. And after a long journey Marth can finally put down his sword.

@Dialogue 
Caeda: Marth... at long last, we can return to Talys!
Marth: Yes, we can. And I must report to your father. But after that, I will immediately head to Altea...
Caeda: Yes...
Marth: War has brought my land to ruin. We must not waste any time in rebuilding.
Nyna: Oh, Marth. Hehe. I see you are not one to speak easily of what is most precious to you. You are a hero! This is a challenge you must not shrink from! Hurry and tell her.
Marth: Princess Nyna! I- I would never... Well, how shall I put- Caeda?
Caeda: Oh! Y-yes?
Marth: Would... would you journey to Altea with me?
Caeda: Why... yes! I would love to.

Nyna: Prince Marth, your remarkable struggle has come to an end. You have saved us all. The cost of that victory, however... For you, it was far too much to bear. I am sorry.
Marth: Princess Nyna... It is my fault that Caeda was killed, not yours. Do not apologize. I will soon... No, as long as I do live... I will never forget her.
Nyna: It is as I suspected. Do not blame yourself... Perhaps for us, this victory could only come at the cost of those we loved. Sad as it may be, it is the fate the Fire Emblem has borne across generations...
