so this is your country altea
yes dolhr has occupied it for two years now i escaped to talys only thanks to my sister elices help and in my place she was captured by dolhr i have no idea where she is now i vow that i will do whatever i can to rescue her all right everyone it is time to take back altea let us begin
i have something very important to tell you listen well in the northwest of this land you will find two villages a paladin named arran dwells in the western village in the easterly one there is a hero named samson both of them are fine men the problem is the feud between their villages due to this rivalry you can only add one of them to your ranks think hard about this before visiting either village
i heard a rumor that the prison to the east holds a young man called xane he isnt from around here thats not all i hear he holds a wondrous power
i am very glad to see that the altean army has returned now this country can return to the peaceful days of old
princess elice was taken away somewhere by a bishop called gharnef how sad for the prince i hope shes all right
if you intend to use the devil sword be careful its a powerful weapon but a danger to its owner
i am arran once i was a knight captain i left that life behind me but if you have true need of my strength i will join you the feud between these two villages is bitter if our neighbors hear you visited us they will bar their gates if you had hoped to recruit the hero samson i am sorry
im samson i used to be famous as a gladiator thats behind me now im just living my life here if you need me though ill head out with you the feud between these two villages is bad if our neighbors hear you visited us theyll close their gates if word gets around you wont be able to recruit arran
hey there prince thanks for saving me the names xane i come from a faraway land my people can transform into anybody dolhr found out and demanded i join them i refused id never help those villains id be happy to help you fight them though
soldiers of altea and everyone who has lent us your strengthyou have my gratitude thanks to you we have finally taken our country back from dolhr many enemies still remain inside the castle however do not drop your guard

prince marth im ogma a mercenary of talys the king ordered me to join your forces i brought along my three most trusted men welcome to galder the port town thats been overrun by pirates pirates arent all you will have to worry about weve spotted soldiers from grust too keep your wits about you
theres a pirate who goes by the name of darros hes looking to meet the prince word is he wants to turn over a new leaf and fight for the people you should seek him out and listen to what he has to say
a curate can earn exp simply by withstanding the attacks of a foe
hammers are effective against knights it would be wise to purchase one
prince of altea i beg of you save the cleric lena we tried to stop her but she left the safety of the village to bring aid to the poor and sick she set out toward the ghouls teeth some time ago and has yet to return i cant tell you how much lenas help meant to us shes like an angel it isnt much butwe can offer you 5000g to aid in your efforts to rescue her please do what you can to save her
prince marth i am darros a simple man of the sea i want to leave the life of a sea dog behind if you need my help ill give it gladly please let me fight alongside you
please forgive me princess caeda i have no choice i must get my hands on some money
you are castor of talys why are you fighting us
princess caeda i am sorry my mother is ill to afford her medicine i would do anything even this
i see the pirates pay you well it it may not be much but i offer you what i can take it and buy medicine for your mother
you would aid a traitor like me you are so kind oh princess caeda forgive me from now on i will dedicate my life to you
thank you for taking care of those ruffians prince marth thanks to you peace has returned to galder in order to reach aurelis you must cross the ghouls teeth it is a dangerous road you will find fearsome bandits called the soothsires there they prey on travelers and raid nearby villages i have heard of a skilled swordsman called navarre in their employ whatever you do do not let your guard down i will pray for your safety

our tale beginswith the shadow dragon the blade falchion and the 

shadow dragon and the blade of light
prince marth princess caeda has alighted from talys castle
caeda whats wrong did something happen
prince marth what a relief talys castle is under attack from pirates of galder after a fierce fight they have taken the castle i beg you please save my father
dont worry caeda the brave knights of altea stand ready pirates are no match for us lets head back to the castle and rescue the king
villagers have their gates open so that the prince can visit dont make them wait once a thief attacks a village thats it theres no saving it
you cant use strong weapons if you dont have a high enough weapon level thats just common sense and dont forget that your fliers need to be careful around foes with bows
there is a village south of the castle a priest named wrys awaits the prince there
galder its a port town south of the isle of talys a man by the name of gomer has taken control of the city its lousy with pirate scum
if you are injured stop at a fortress youll feel better after a short rest behind strong walls
it is good that you have come prince marth i have here 10000g that the villagers gathered take it please use it to equip yourselves save this land from these rampaging pirates of galder
i am wrys a humble curate i cannot fight but this staff i carry can heal the wounded please allow me to join you
prince marth you have done well to make it here safely you have my thanks so you plan to travel to aurelis in that case though they are few in number my soldiers will join you from captain ogma down they are all brave warriors and should serve you well that is not all heed me now as you travel through these lands you may find many who cannot tolerate the tyranny of dolhr some are hiding in villages others have been taken prisoner and some must work with the enemy you must seek these people out and work together heed the call the time has come set foot on your path but be vigilant you face many dangers

after a hardfought battle marth and the altean forces finally arrive in the kingdom of aurelis marth hopes to join his forces with aureliss army but first he will have to rout the foes blocking his path faroff foreboding sounds of warhorses begin to drift towards marths army from the direction of the lea

a sword known as an armorslayer can make quick work of knights and generals ridersbane is effective against cavaliers but remember that not all units can use lances dont forget the rapier all knightly units fear it only the prince can wield one keep in mind that weapons wear down with use in the end they will break
weapons can be made of iron steel and silver in that order they are weak stronger and strongest to use stronger weapons you need a higher weapon level dont forget
general bentheon who guards the castle holds a ridersbane cavaliers are in grave danger from that weapon do not let them approach the castle
stand in front of a door or bridge and use a key you will be able to proceed
wyvern knights make for fearsome foes give them an opening and your life is forfeit
kind altean please find some way to save this land its not much but my people have gathered 5000g to fund your war effort use it wisely
prince marth finally we meet again
merric is that you what a surprise
i was studying magic in khadein when war came i left the city then and have been looking for you
im glad you sought me out we could use someone with your talents in our army will you join us
of course i will i learned a strong spell in khadein called excalibur i will demonstrate it in battle
lenawhere have you gone even if it could be just once morei had hoped to see you again
matthis is that you its me your sister lena
lenawhat are you doing here on the field of battle
i was captured by bandits but the alteans saved me what about you why are you part of this army
i know you fled macedon because you do not love prince michalis but things are even worse there now he must have it out for me because i was pressed into the army now im stuck here i dont want to fight but the punishment for desertion is even worse
dont be a coward you must stand up and choose the path you believe in macedon has joined forces with dolhr and the people suffer for it its mortifying brother it is not too late join the altean army they will welcome you with open arms they are truly wonderful people
i understand if i am to die i should do it honorably and with style i suppose it wont be any less strict here though after all i have a sister who can say no to a prince on that topichave you found a man that you do like
er no no theres no one
hmm well youre still young youll find love just avoid thieves and scoundrels
prince marth i thank you for recapturing the castle to the south captain hardin is guarding the king and princess nyna in a fortress to the north if you meet up with hardin please give him this silver sword

medeus is defeated the dolhr empire once again fades into darkness after three long years of battle across archanea for marth and his friends light breaks upon the land and the darkness recedes and after a long journey marth can finally put down his sword

marth at long last we can return to talys
yes we can and i must report to your father but after that i will immediately head to altea
yes
war has brought my land to ruin we must not waste any time in rebuilding
oh marth hehe i see you are not one to speak easily of what is most precious to you you are a hero this is a challenge you must not shrink from hurry and tell her
princess nyna i i would never well how shall i put caeda
oh yyes
would would you journey to altea with me
why yes i would love to
prince marth your remarkable struggle has come to an end you have saved us all the cost of that victory however for you it was far too much to bear i am sorry
princess nyna it is my fault that caeda was killed not yours do not apologize i will soon no as long as i do live i will never forget her
it is as i suspected do not blame yourself perhaps for us this victory could only come at the cost of those we loved sad as it may be it is the fate the fire emblem has borne across generations
/***EOF***/
to make it this far marth it is the measure of a true hero
sage gotoh why have you come to this place
men are foolish and i had sworn to let the affairs of the world proceed without me but watching your struggles i came to think perhaps i was too hasty in my judgment i cannot defeat medeus on my own but i will happily lay his minions to rest go forth he who has been chosen by the goddess alteas prince of light cast the shadow dragon back into the darkness bury him in the earth he crawled out from
rebels that dare disturb my repose be consumed by the flames of hell
me defeated by humans mere humans take this to heart altean prince inheritor of the light one day i will rise anew never forget as long as there is light the darkness can never be extinguished

i do not agree with your strategy general harmein as a knight of macedon i have my pride i wish to fight them headon a fair battle
many of the soldiers of macedon were lost in aurelis surely you understand this we must regroup in the castle and stall for time the king has put his faith in me i would ask that you do the same after all if you do not trust the empireyour little sister maria is the one who will suffer the consequences
 i understand i will leave this matter in your hands i doubt you can defeat alteas knights with your schemes however i expect that you will end up regretting this though she is feared by all i have heard that she is very beautiful and kind i wonder if anyone can help her
the warrior minerva is actually a princess from macedon it is said that she fights for the dolhr empire because they are holding her sister hostage
excuse me have you met a young girl by the name of tiki she is the last of the naga the divine dragon clan there is no one but she who can defeat the manaketes serving medeus im so old that i dont have much fight left in me but without my stone i cant become a dragon at all ill come along with you so please help me find tiki
this fighting is more than i can stomach palla catria est lets get out of here
prince marth it is time i tell you the legend of the manaketes a long long time agothe manaketes arrived in archanea they were of three clans the divine dragons of naga the mage dragons of basilisk and the fire dragons of salamander the divine dragons were the most powerful they stopped the others from conquering mankind they carried stones that allowed them to conceal their true selves by taking human form the dragonkin lived in peace with humans until the arrival of medeus an earth dragon medeus used his great power to destroy the divine dragons and found the dolhr empire he launched attacks on the human lands and conquered them though the humans fought bravely there was nothing they could do against medeus but the young warrior anri faced medeus he gripped a sword that shone brightly the blade of light falchion after a fierce battle he at last defeated medeus yes my prince you do recognize this young mans name he is indeed anri the first king of altea it has been 100 years since thos dark days and now medeus has appeared once again prince marth you are the chosen one the last of anris line your father king cornelius was defeated before he could accomplish his task it is up to you now

maria and minervas home macedon is the birthplace of wyverns it was known as a bountiful land of peace that changed when prince michalis aligned his goals with those of dolhr against minervas wishes he turned macedons wyvern knights to war striking fear into hearts across many lands as marth and his allies approach the amassed wyverns blot out the sun

marth you have done well to make it here i am gotoh as instructed you have brought me the lightsphere and starsphere i now grant you the only magic capable of countering imhullu starlight take it and bring an end to the wickedness of the dark pontifex gharnef
marth you have not heeded my words i require the starsphere and lightsphere both without them i cannot create starlight for you i do not think you can defeat gharnef if you cannot claim falchion from gharnef you have little hope of defeating medeus if you still wish to try you must gain much in experience and reach the pinnacle of your strength that is not all you must also gather mighty blades like gradivus mercurius and the devil axe unless you make these preparations medeuss defeat is scarcely possible this is the harshest road to victory are you truly willing to walk this path think long and hard on this decision choose wisely
damn you minerva i will not be put down now quake in terror before my wyvern knights

to obtain the lightsphere and starsphere for gotoh marth and his army must enter raman but waiting for them at the chiasmir bridge is grusts fearless sable order of knights these powerful knights block marths path forward the stage is set for battle

you must be prince marth i am est of macedon we finally get to meet i went and retrieved the sword mercurius that grust stole from archanea it is not for us that i obtained it its for you please make use of it
somehow we triumphed over dolhrs defenses but the fane of raman is also dangerous it is said that a terrifying goddess waits within to incinerate all intruders
i do not wish to provoke her wrath but we are in need of those orbs perhaps we should send a small force maybe then the fanes guardian would not strike

oh master wendell yes its you
ah merric how have you been lad you certainly look well

there are mercenaries about be careful theyre so skilled that they can fell you in one blow
hunters are stronger attackers than archers but theyre weaker in defense they should avoid closerange combat at all costs
improve your skill and youll have a better chance at landing critical hits increase your spd meanwhile and youll find it easier to dodge enemy attacks
you youngsters sure do have stamina since you made it all the way up here what say i give you this axe not bad eh not so fast this devil axe consumes the lives of those who wield it if i were you i wouldnt use it in battle mark my words
i feel bad killing you but it was your mistake to come here now die

greetings prince marth i am minerva of macedon for saving maria you have my thanks i had no choice but to be your enemy i regret that very much still many in macedon do support dolhr including my elder brother michalis to me though dolhr is responsible for my fathers death i seek revenge for that i must also worry aobut my troops however especially the three whitewings palla catria and est dolhr feared our rebellion and separated us if they knew i was safe they would happily join your ranks how i detest dolhr for trampling macedon underfoot please allow us to join your fight
prince marth do you know of the archbishop of archanea miloah
i have heard he was a great man and the wielder of aura a powerful spell he protected archanea it is my understanding that he fell fighting gharnef who has allied with dolhr
that is so but he had a daughter named linde it is said she inherited the magic of aura unfortunately we do not know where linde is now no one does i fear that something terrible has befallen her please seek her out her father is no more so we must protect her now for archaneas sake
