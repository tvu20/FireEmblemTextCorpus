@Intro 
Nyna: So this is your country, Altea...
Marth: Yes. Dolhr has occupied it for two years now. I escaped to Talys only thanks to my sister Elice's help. And in my place, she was captured by Dolhr. I have no idea where she is now. I vow that I will do whatever I can to rescue her! All right, everyone! It is time to take back Altea! Let us begin!

@Visit 
Old man: I have something very important to tell you. Listen well! In the northwest of this land, you will find two villages. A paladin named Arran dwells in the western village. In the easterly one, there is a hero named Samson. Both of them are fine men. The problem is the feud between their villages... Due to this rivalry, you can only add one of them to your ranks. Think hard about this before visiting either village.

Man: I heard a rumor that the prison to the east holds a young man called Xane. He isn't from around here... That's not all... I hear he holds a wondrous power.

Woman: I am very glad to see that the Altean army has returned. Now this country can return to the peaceful days of old.

Woman: Princess Elice was taken away somewhere by a bishop called Gharnef. How sad for the prince... I hope she's all right.

Young man: If you intend to use the Devil Sword, be careful. It's a powerful weapon but a danger to its owner.

@Recruit-Visit 
Arran: I am Arran. Once, I was a knight captain. I left that life behind me, but if you have true need of my strength, I will join you. The feud between these two villages is bitter. If our neighbors hear you visited us, they will bar their gates. If you had hoped to recruit the hero Samson, I am sorry.

Samson: I'm Samson. I used to be famous as a gladiator. That's behind me now. I'm just living my life here. If you need me, though, I'll head out with you. The feud between these two villages is bad! If our neighbors hear you visited us, they'll close their gates. If word gets around, you won't be able to recruit Arran.

%Marth,Xane
Xane: Hey there, Prince! Thanks for saving me. The name's Xane. I come from a faraway land. My people can transform into anybody. Dolhr found out and demanded I join them! I refused. I'd never help those villains! I'd be happy to help you fight them though!

@End 
Marth: Soldiers of Altea, and everyone who has lent us your strength...you have my gratitude. Thanks to you, we have finally taken our country back from Dolhr. Many enemies still remain inside the castle, however! Do not drop your guard!

Ogma: Prince Marth, I'm Ogma, a mercenary of Talys. The king ordered me to join your forces. I brought along my three most trusted men. Welcome to Galder, the port town that's been overrun by pirates. Pirates aren't all you will have to worry about. We've spotted soldiers from Grust too. Keep your wits about you.

@Visit 
Woman: There's a pirate who goes by the name of Darros. He's looking to meet the prince! Word is he wants to turn over a new leaf and fight for the people. You should seek him out and listen to what he has to say.

Woman: A curate can earn EXP simply by withstanding the attacks of a foe.

Man: Hammers are effective against knights. It would be wise to purchase one!

Villager: Prince of Altea, I beg of you... Save the cleric Lena. We tried to stop her, but... she left the safety of the village to bring aid to the poor and sick. She set out toward the Ghoul's Teeth some time ago and has yet to return. I can't tell you how much Lena's help meant to us. She's like an angel. It isn't much, but...we can offer you 5,000G to aid in your efforts to rescue her. Please, do what you can to save her!

Darros: Prince Marth, I am Darros, a simple man of the sea. I want to leave the life of a sea dog behind. If you need my help, I'll give it gladly! Please, let me fight alongside you.

%Caeda,Castor
Caeda: You are Castor of Talys! Why are you fighting us?
Castor: Princess Caeda... I am sorry. My mother is ill. To afford her medicine, I would do anything. Even this!
Caeda: I see... The pirates pay you. Well, it it may not be much, but I offer you what I can. Take it, and buy medicine for your mother.
Castor: You would aid a traitor like me? You are so kind... Oh, Princess Caeda! Forgive me! From now on, I will dedicate my life to you.

@End 
Villager: Thank you for taking care of those ruffians, Prince Marth. Thanks to you, peace has returned to Galder. In order to reach Aurelis, you must cross the Ghoul's Teeth. It is a dangerous road. You will find fearsome bandits called the Soothsires there. They prey on travelers and raid nearby villages. I have heard of a skilled swordsman called Navarre in their employ. Whatever you do, do not let your guard down. I will pray for your safety.

Jagen: Prince Marth! Princess Caeda has alighted from Talys Castle.
Marth: Caeda, what's wrong? Did something happen?
Caeda: Prince Marth! What a relief. Talys Castle is under attack from pirates of Galder! After a fierce fight, they have taken the castle. I beg you, please save my father!
Marth: Don't worry, Caeda. The brave knights of Altea stand ready. Pirates are no match for us! Let's head back to the castle and rescue the king!

@Visit
Old man: Villagers have their gates open so that the prince can visit. Don't make them wait! Once a thief attacks a village, that's it. There's no saving it.

Young man: You can't use strong weapons if you don't have a high enough weapon level. That's just common sense. And don't forget that your fliers need to be careful around foes with bows!

Woman: There is a village south of the castle. A priest named Wrys awaits the prince there.

Man: Galder? It's a port town south of the isle of Talys. A man by the name of Gomer has taken control of the city. It's lousy with pirate scum!

Woman: If you are injured, stop at a fortress. You'll feel better after a short rest behind strong walls.

Villager: It is good that you have come, Prince Marth. I have here 10,000G that the villagers gathered. Take it. Please, use it to equip yourselves. Save this land from these rampaging pirates of Galder!

Wrys: I am Wrys, a humble curate. I cannot fight, but this staff I carry can heal the wounded. Please allow me to join you.

King of Talys: Prince Marth! You have done well to make it here safely. You have my thanks. So, you plan to travel to Aurelis? In that case, though they are few in number, my soldiers will join you. From Captain Ogma down, they are all brave warriors and should serve you well. That is not all. Heed me now. As you travel through these lands, you may find many who cannot tolerate the tyranny of Dolhr. Some are hiding in villages. Others have been taken prisoner. And some must work with the enemy... You must seek these people out and work together! Heed the call! The time has come! Set foot on your path, but be vigilant! You face many dangers.

@Opening
After a hard-fought battle, Marth and the Altean forces finally arrive in the Kingdom of Aurelis. Marth hopes to join his forces with Aurelis's army. But first, he will have to rout the foes blocking his path. Far-off, foreboding sounds of warhorses begin to drift towards Marth's army from the direction of the lea...

@Visit
Old man: A sword known as an armorslayer can make quick work of knights and generals. Ridersbane is effective against cavaliers, but remember that not all units can use lances. Don't forget the rapier. All knightly units fear it. Only the prince can wield one. Keep in mind that weapons wear down with use. In the end, they will break.

Young man: Weapons can be made of iron, steel, and silver. In that order, they are weak, stronger, and strongest. To use stronger weapons, you need a higher weapon level. Don't forget!

Young man: General Bentheon, who guards the castle, holds a ridersbane. Cavaliers are in grave danger from that weapon. Do not let them approach the castle!

Old man: Stand in front of a door or bridge and use a key. You will be able to proceed.

Old man: Wyvern knights make for fearsome foes. Give them an opening and your life is forfeit.

Villager: Kind Altean, Please... Find some way to save this land. It's not much, but my people have gathered 5000G to fund your war effort. Use it wisely.

Merric: Prince Marth! Finally we meet again.
Marth: Merric? is that you? What a surprise.
Merric: I was studying magic in Khadein when war came. I left the city then and have been looking for you.

Merric: Of course I will. I learned a strong spell in Khadein called Excalibur. I will demonstrate it in battle!

Lena: Matthis, is that you? It's me! Your sister, Lena!
Matthis: Lena...what are you doing here on the field of battle?
Lena: I was captured by bandits, but the Alteans saved me. What about you? Why are you part of this army?
Matthis: I know you fled Macedon because you do not love Prince Michalis. But things are even worse there now. He must have it out for me because I was pressed into the army. Now I'm stuck here... I don't want to fight, but the punishment for desertion is even worse.
Lena: Don't be a coward! You must stand up and choose the path you believe in. Macedon has joined forces with Dolhr, and the people suffer for it. It's mortifying. Brother, it is not too late. Join the Altean army. They will welcome you with open arms. They are truly wonderful people.
Matthis: ...I understand. If I am to die, I should do it honorably, and with style. I suppose it won't be any less strict here though... After all, I have a sister who can say no to a prince! On that topic...have you found a man that you do like?
Lena: Er, no... No. There's no one.
Matthis: Hmm. Well, you're still young. You'll find love. Just avoid thieves and scoundrels!

@Dialogue 
^start
Caeda: Marth... at long last, we can return to Talys!
Marth: Yes, we can. And I must report to your father. But after that, I will immediately head to Altea...
Caeda: Yes...
Marth: War has brought my land to ruin. We must not waste any time in rebuilding.
Nyna: Oh, Marth. Hehe. I see you are not one to speak easily of what is most precious to you. You are a hero! This is a challenge you must not shrink from! Hurry and tell her.
Marth: Princess Nyna! I- I would never... Well, how shall I put- Caeda?
Caeda: Oh! Y-yes?
Marth: Would... would you journey to Altea with me?
Caeda: Why... yes! I would love to.

Nyna: Prince Marth, your remarkable struggle has come to an end. You have saved us all. The cost of that victory, however... For you, it was far too much to bear. I am sorry.
Marth: Princess Nyna... It is my fault that Caeda was killed, not yours. Do not apologize. I will soon... No, as long as I do live... I will never forget her.
Nyna: It is as I suspected. Do not blame yourself... Perhaps for us, this victory could only come at the cost of those we loved. Sad as it may be, it is the fate the Fire Emblem has borne across generations...

Gotoh: To make it this far, Marth... It is the measure of a true hero.
Marth: Sage Gotoh! Why have you come to this place?
Gotoh: Men are foolish... and I had sworn to let the affairs of the world proceed without me. But watching your struggles, I came to think perhaps I was too hasty in my judgment. I cannot defeat Medeus on my own. But I will happily lay his minions to rest. Go forth, he who has been chosen by the goddess... Altea's prince of light! Cast the Shadow Dragon back into the darkness! Bury him in the earth he crawled out from!

Medeus: Rebels that dare disturb my repose... be consumed by the flames of hell!

Minerva: I do not agree with your strategy, General Harmein. As a knight of Macedon, I have my pride. I wish to fight them head-on. A fair battle.
Harmein: Many of the soldiers of Macedon were lost in Aurelis. Surely you understand this? We must regroup in the castle and stall for time. The king has put his faith in me. I would ask that you do the same. After all, if you do not trust the empire...your little sister, Maria, is the one who will suffer the consequences.
Minerva: ... I understand. I will leave this matter in your hands. I doubt you can defeat Altea's knights with your schemes, however... I expect that you will end up regretting this. Though she is feared by all, I have heard that she is very beautiful and kind. I wonder if anyone can help her.

Malledus: Prince Marth. It is time I tell you the legend of the manaketes. A long, long time ago...the manaketes arrived in Archanea. They were of three clans. The divine Dragons of Naga, the Mage Dragons of Basilisk, and the Fire Dragons of Salamander. The Divine Dragons were the most powerful. They stopped the others from conquering mankind. They carried stones that allowed them to conceal their true selves by taking human form. The dragonkin lived in peace with humans until the arrival of Medeus, an earth dragon. Medeus used his great power to destroy the Divine Dragons and found the Dolhr Empire. He launched attacks on the human lands and conquered them. Though the humans fought bravely, there was nothing they could do against Medeus. But the young warrior Anri faced Medeus! He gripped a sword that shone brightly: the blade of light, Falchion! After a fierce battle, he at last defeated Medeus. Yes, my prince. You do recognize this young man's name. He is indeed Anri, the first king of Altea. It has been 100 years since thos dark days. And now Medeus has appeared once again. Prince Marth! You are the chosen one. The last of Anri's line... Your father, King Cornelius, was defeated before he could accomplish his task. It is up to you now!

Roger: Wh-What? What kind of question is that?
Caeda: I apologize. You look very kind, and I thought we might have a chat. Would you mind telling me your name?
Roger: Er, well... The name's Roger. Roger of Grust.
Caeda: Roger, I want you to thing about something... Those who cry because of war. We in the Archanean League wish to put an end to fighting, to this sadness. Surely you can understand this.
Roger: Of course I do. I don't fight because I enjoy it... But I can't betray my homeland.
Caeda: Is there someone precious to you in Grust?
Roger: My parents have passed on, and I am unmarried... But betraying my homeland is out of the question!
Caeda: So what I ask is impossible?
Roger: I am sorry to say so, but yes.
Caeda: And I am sorry to hear it. I do understand. Still, I was glad to speak. You are the man I expected.
Roger: Oh, you're leaving, then...
Caeda: I must. If I stay with you too long, your comrades might think you a turncoat.
Roger: You are too kind... Why can't I meet someone like you in Grust? Hey... Wait a moment. I... I don't want you to leave. I am on my own, so...I will join you.

@End 
Malledus: Prince, if we stay here, we'd be putting ourselves in danger. We must head to Pyrathi with haste. There are rumors that the Pyrathi king, Mannu, is a descendant of the dragonkin, however. This is also reason for concern. But we have no choice. Please, be cautious.

With a string of hard-fought battles behind them, Marth and his army finally arrive in Archanea, Nyna's home. Beyond the mountains lies the bastion of Archanea that has stood for 1,000 years: the Ageless Palace. It's golden walls have seen so many treasures stolen and so many of its people lost... Marth and his allies have journeyed far, and now one of their primary goals is in sight!

Man: This here is Knorda. You're in Archanea now! Don't forget to drop by the armories and the shops. You should find some good stuff if you look around!

Young Man: At the edge of town, there's a slave market. If you look, you'll see that it's full of kids pulled from who-knows-where...

Woman: I apologize... Since Archanea fell, this town has become desolate. It's not safe to walk outside with all the ruffians about!

Woman: I hate war... It's always the women and children who suffer. You should stop fighting. Get back to those you love as soon as you can. Parthia, the bow of flame, Gradivus, the lance that pierces stone... And the magic blade that can only be wielded by the chosen, Mercurius. Those that obtain them are said to be blessed by the gods.

Old man: Three weapons have been passed down by the royal family of Archanea.

Anna: Grust's army has good people in it too. Take my boyfriend, Jake. He's a kind man. If you run into him, will you tell him that Anna is worried about him? Just... There's one more thing. He probably won't want to talk to a man. Send a woman to talk to him. OK?

Ruffian: You lookin' to buy a slave? All's I have left are some scrawny brats, but I'll cut you a deal.

Linde: I...I don't have anywhere to go.
Marth: You're a girl, aren't you? Yet you're disguised as a young boy.
Linde: I am the daughter of Archbishop Miloah. I disguised myself to escape from Gharnef. But I was caught by a slave merchant when I ran away.
Marth: So you're the archbishop's daughter! It's good that we found you. Princess Nyna has been worried sick! From today, we will stand beside you. I will not let anything like this happen to you again.
Linde: Prince Marth, let me fight at your side. I have the Aura tome my father entrusted to me... If Princess Nyna allows me to help, I will use it. I want to take revenge for what Gharnef did to my father. I must defeat him.

Jake: Oh, you heard about me from Anna? That's good! What did she have to say?
Caeda: She said that if you fought for the people of this land, she would follow you anywhere.
Jake: Really?! Well, honestly... I don't like seeing the people of this land suffer like this. All right. I've made up my mind! I'm ready to fight for you, and for Anna! I'll show you what I can do!

As Marth and his allies approach, the amassed wyverns blot out the sun.

Gotoh: Marth! You have done well to make it here. I am Gotoh. As instructed, you have brought me the Lightsphere and Starsphere. I now grant you the only magic capable of countering Imhullu, Starlight. Take it and bring an end to the wickedness of the Dark Pontifex, Gharnef.

Gotoh: Marth! You have not heeded my words! I require the Starsphere and Lightsphere both. Without them, I cannot create Starlight for you. I do not think you can defeat Gharnef... If you cannot claim Falchion from Gharnef, you have little hope of defeating Medeus. If you still wish to try, you must gain much in experience and reach the pinnacle of your strength. That is not all... You must also gather mighty blades like Gradivus, Mercurius, and the Devil Axe. Unless you make these preparations, Medeus's defeat is scarcely possible. This is the harshest road to victory. Are you truly willing to walk this path? Think long and hard on this decision. Choose wisely.

He aims to rule the world! As long as he wields Imhullu, he cannot be challenged. However, there is one way to defeat him. Bring me the Lightsphere and the Starsphere.

Catria: Prince Marth, I am Catria of Macedon's Whitewings. I have come to you with a secret request. Princess Minerva's forces are planning to rebel against Dolhr. However, the princess's younger sister, Maria, has been taken hostage by Dolhr so we cannot act. We beg of you, please help us save the young princess!

@Intro 
Hardin: Princess Nyna, the Altean Army has apapeared on the opposite side of the river.
Nyna: Oh, Hardin, have they really? So Prince Marth has come...
Hardin: Finally, we can build a force to fight back. Princess, it is dangerous here. Please wait for the prince inside the fortress. Together with Altea, we will retake the castle!

@Visit
Old man: There are many treasures within the castle walls. However, if you do not have a thief in your army, you will not be able to open the chests!

Woman: I hear that the shops in Port Warren sell many rare items. If you plan to travel there, don't waste your gold beforehand!

Woman: Many foes wait inside the fortresses, ready to enter the battle. Block them so they can't get out!

Young man: Boy! What's that look on your face? Haven't you ever seen a backwoods village like this before? Speaking of rare sights... When I was last in Pyrathi, I saw a manakete! An old man stood there, but suddenly, he turned into a dragon! What a shock... Truth told, I was scared out of my wits at the sight of it! I've heard rumors about the dragonkin, that some survived to this day. Still, I never thought I'd see a manakete with my own eyes! What are you looking at? Oh, this? I picked it up on my trip. It's unusual, this glowing stone... I have no idea what it's for, so you can have it! It makes me uncomfortable anyway. What a nice young man! I hope we can speak again.

%Marth,Wendell
Wendell: Prince! I am Wendell, a bishop of Khadein. We are a peaceful people. But our pleas were met only with cruelty by Gharnef as he seized the city. Thanks to his dark influence, many mages have now allied themselves with Dolhr. Please, with the strength of your forces, find a way to put an end to Gharnef's ambitions.

%Merric,Wendell
Merric: Oh! Master Wendell? Yes, it's you!
Wendell: Ah, Merric! How have you been, lad? You certainly look well.
Merric: I was able to find Prince Marth of Altea! And I have joined his army as well. We are fighting the tyranny of Dolhr! Why are you here, Master?
Wendell: How can I say this... Sadly, Khadein has fallen into darkness. A fiend called Gharnef has seized control. He has turned the city toward the shadow... I could not bear to serve him, so I fled on my own.
Merric: What awful news! Master, please... Consider lending us your strength. If Gharnef serves Dolhr, he is our enemy! We will find a way to take Khadein back. I know the prince would be overjoyed to have so great a bishop as you as an ally, Master.
Wendell: Hmm... Though I deplore violence, I cannot see another path... Very well, Merric. I will join your fight. Please let the prince know I am at his service.

Lena: I am sorry, but...I have lost my precious Mend staff. Until I find it, I cannot leave. Don't worry about me, Julian! You should flee while you can. I can use my Warp staff to send you somewhere safe.
Julian: I can't let you do that. If I leave you here, then why did I betray the bandits and rescue you? We can worry about your staff later! I promise I'll come back for it. Let's get while the getting's good. Focus on that!

@Visit
Young Man: There are mercenaries about. Be careful. They're so skilled that they can fell you in one blow!

Man: Hunters are stronger attackers than archers, but they're weaker in defense. They should avoid close-range combat at all costs!

Man: Improve your Skill and you'll have a better chance at landing critical hits. Increase your Spd, meanwhile, and you'll find it easier to dodge enemy attacks.

Old Man: You youngsters sure do have stamina. Since you made it all the way up here, what say I give you this axe? Not bad, eh? Not so fast! This Devil Axe consumes the lives of those who wield it. If I were you, I wouldn't use it in battle! Mark my words!

Marth: I wish to avoid a battle with you, General Camus. Fighting you would serve no purpose. Princess Nyna wants to see you too. Forget the quarrel between us and lay down your weapon.
Camus: It is too late for words, Prince. My homeland has joined the cause of Dolhr. As a knight of the glorious land of Grust, duty demands that I fight to the last. By defeating me, you will avenge your father as well. Let our blades meet gallantly!
Nyna: Camus, wait! I beg you, wait! I cannot bear the thought of you and Marth fighting. If you would only lend us your strength... Please...
Camus: I am sorry, Nyna. If it were possible, I would... But my homeland is on the brink of ruin. I cannot betray my people. Though our time together was short, it meant much to me. I hope that you find happiness... Now, farewell.

@Visit 
Old man: It's good to see you, Prince Marth! Is my granddaughter Lena in good health? Please... give her this staff, Hammerne. It has been passed down in our family for generations. It can repair some weapons and items, but not all. Be sure to tell her to be careful when using it.

Caeda: General Lorenz, I am Caeda of Talys. My father told me much of you.
Lorenz: Princess Caeda! You have grown into a beautiful young lady. Yes, your father was a great help to me.
Caeda: General... You did not truly want to become an ally of Dolhr, did you? Why then did you not put a stop to the alliance?
Lorenz: Grust's king is a coward. He fears the power of Dolhr.
Caeda: Dolhr's aim is to conquer all of mankind with an army of manaketes. For the sake of all of the innocents, including those in Grust, we must put a stop to that ambition. Stop fighting us. Instead, join us!
Lorenz: My feelings have not changed... I fought only because I was ordered to. But it may be time to act. Very well, Princess. It is painful for me to betray my homeland, but I will join you in this fight!

Camus: I pity you, for as long as I wield Gradivus, you have no hope of defeating me. Retreat and avoid this fate.

Camus: My dear... Nyna... Farewell...

@End 
Marth: Princess Nyna... I am sorry. I could not do what you asked.
Nyna: Marth... It is I who should apologize for putting you through this. In truth, since the moment I entrusted the Fire Emblem to you, I knew this would happen. I saw that once the royal family was restored by the Fire Emblem, I would lose something precious to me. Our land has a legend of the emblem, Artemis's Curse, that foretold this...

@Opening 
Marth and his companions hurry to Altea but are met by Grust's mighty regiment of ballisticians. This fearsome mechanical force is known as the Wooden Cavalry. Huge metal-clad boxes stalk the battlefield, clicking and clanking... Can Marth rise to meet this challenge?

@Visit
Man: We were part of Archanea's fighting forces. We were defeated by General Camus, however... Grust has taken control. I hope we can be free of them now!
Man: Thunderbolt is the only weapon effective against ballistae. If you want to attack, you will have to draw close.

Astram: What wonderful news! I will resume my fight against Dolhr!
Midia: We can be together again! Promise me that you will never leave my side.
Astram: Midia... In the time since we last met...
Midia: Yes, Astram? What is it?

@Opening 
Dolhr... A land veiled in mystery, the kingdom of manaketes. Our story began with the revival of Medeus, the Earth Dragon, here in this realm... The land of Archanea has a long history of war, of tragic tales that are born and then fade... As time passes on, Medeus's ambition for a world controlled by manaketes is threatened. Marth and his army at last draw near to the end of their long march...

Gra had always been a staunch ally to Altea. But as Altea fought Grust, Gra backstabbed Altea. Altea's army was taken by surprise. King Cornelius and Falchion disappeared in the ensuing chaos. Two years have elapsed since that tragedy... Marth has finally arrived at Gra Bastion to confront the treacherous King Jiol, who has barricaded himself in.

Young man: They say that shops will all give you half off if you have a silver card... Sounds too good to be true if you ask me!

Young man: I heard that once you reach LV.10, you can change jobs! Cavaliers can become paladins, mercenaries can become heroes... There's more but I forgot!

???: Are you Prince Marth of Altea? I have a request of you. This tome belongs to one Bishop Boah of Archanea. Heimler of Grust got hold of it. It has come to be in my possession. Please return it to the bishop for me. One more thing... Watch over Princess Nyna. Your attention to this would put my mind at ease. I shall take my leave of you. We will meet again...

Palla: I am pleased to meet you, Prince Marth. I am Palla of the Whitewings. As soon as we heard that Princess Maria was safe, my sister Catria and I left Macedon. Just as she promised you, Catria and I will join your fight alongside Princess Minerva. However, our youngest sister Est still has not returned from Grust. If she makes it back, the three of us will show you how we can light up the battlefield together!

%Marth,Catria 
Catria: Hello, Prince Marth. It has been a while. Do you remember me? I am Catria. I was waiting for Princess Minerva's order before joining your army. I look forward to fighting together. I will do all that I can.

@Boss 
Jiol: You Altean rabble! I should have ground you into the dust when I had the chance!

@End 
Malledus: We searched every inch of the castle but could not find the blade of light... As the rumors suggest, Gharnef must have taken it to Khadein.
Marth: I see... Without Falchion, we cannot hope to defeat Medeus. Altea is so close...but we must go to Khadein instead. Disappointing, but I have to tell the troops.

Maria: Ah... You must be Prince Marth! (Wow! He's so dashing!) Thank you for saving me! You have to tell my older sister that I am safe! She must be worried... One other thing... I would like to join you, Prince. Let me stay by your side! Oh, please don't say no!

%Marth,Minerva
Minerva: Greetings, Prince Marth. I am Minerva of Macedon. For saving Maria, you have my thanks. I had no choice but to be your enemy. I regret that very much. Still, many in Macedon do support Dolhr, including my elder brother Michalis. To me, though, Dolhr is responsible for my father's death. I seek revenge for that. I must also worry aobut my troops, however. Especially the three Whitewings: Palla, Catria, and Est. Dolhr feared our rebellion and separated us. If they knew I was safe, they would happily join your ranks. How I detest Dolhr for trampling Macedon underfoot. Please, allow us to join your fight.

@End 
Nyna: Prince Marth, do you know of the archbishop of Archanea, Miloah?
Marth: I have heard he was a great man and the wielder of Aura, a powerful spell. He protected Archanea. It is my understanding that he fell fighting Gharnef, who has allied with Dolhr.
Nyna: That is so. But he had a daughter named Linde. It is said she inherited the magic of Aura. Unfortunately, we do not know where Linde is now. No one does. I fear that something terrible has befallen her. Please, seek her out. Her father is no more, so we must protect her now. For Archanea's sake!

Rickard: Thanks for saving me! Hey, wait a second... Aren't you the prince of Altea? My name is Rickard. I am but a humble thief. I came to loot this castle but ended up getting caught. Since you helped me out, I'll return the favor!

%Julian,Rickard
Julian: Rickard? It can't be! What are you doing here?
Rickard: Julian! It's been too long since I've seen you, Chief. I came to this castle to steal a few things. And wouldn't you know it...I got a little sloppy. And what brings you here?
Julian: Me? As of today, I've washed my hands of thievery. I'm on the side of what's good and just.
Rickard: Ha! I bet I know the truth behind this change of heart. Beauties have always been your weak point.
Julian: N-not a chance! The spirit of justice awakened within me! Look, don't worry about it. Just join up with us!
Rickard: There you go again, trying to make up my mind for me. Since you're the one asking... Well, why not? It's settled! I'll lend you a hand. But I'll take a cut of the loot as payment!

Nyna: You must be Prince Marth. You have done well to make it here. I am the princess of Archanea, Nyna. Though Archanea has long protected this world, Dolhr overwhelmed us, throwing all into chaos. I cannot fight. Marth, I beg you... Please, lead the forces of good and defeat Dolhr! You must liberate all of the lands Dolhr has occupied!
Marth: Of course, Princess Nyna. Altea's allegiance to Archanea is steadfast. Moreover, as the prince of Altea, it is my destiny to defeat Medeus.
Nyna: I thank you, Marth. I will now entrust you with this treasure... The Fire Emblem is given to one with the strength to save the world when my royal family cannot. With this, you will be able to open chests containing invaluable treasures. The battles you face will test your every skill. But fight as hard as you can. Return light to this world!

Nyna: Prince Marth... Before we head on to Grust, I must tell you something. You know of General Camus, the captain of the famous Sable Order of Knights... I was captured by the Sable Order when they occupied Archanea two years ago. Dolhr intended to utterly destroy the Archanean royal family. But that man, Camus, protected me. He stood up to Medeus when I could not. Knowing Medeus's elite guards would come, Camus helped me find sanctuary in Aurelis. He has won many victories for Dolhr, but that no longer matters to them... because of what he did for me. When I was a prisoner, I hated him... but my feelings have changed considerably... I hope that you will not cross swords with him... I wish to see him again.
