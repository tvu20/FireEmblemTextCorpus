Beyond the mountains lies the bastion of Archanea that has stood for 1,000 years: the Ageless Palace. It's golden walls have seen so many treasures stolen and so many of its people lost... Marth and his allies have journeyed far, and now one of their primary goals is in sight!"], "visit": [{"speaker": "Man", "line": "This here is Knorda. You're in Archanea now! Don't forget to drop by the armories and the shops. You should find some good stuff if you look around!"}, {"speaker": "Young Man", "line": "At the edge of town, there's a slave market. If you look, you'll see that it's full of kids pulled from who-knows-where..."}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "I apologize... Since Archanea fell, this town has become desolate. It's not safe to walk outside with all the ruffians about!"}, {"speaker": "Woman", "line": "I hate war... It's always the women and children who suffer. You should stop fighting. Get back to those you love as soon as you can. Parthia, the bow of flame, Gradivus, the lance that pierces stone... And the magic blade that can only be wielded by the chosen, Mercurius.

From today, we will stand beside you. I will not let anything like this happen to you again."}, {"speaker": "Linde", "line": "Prince Marth, let me fight at your side. I have the Aura tome my father entrusted to me... If Princess Nyna allows me to help, I will use it. I want to take revenge for what Gharnef did to my father.
