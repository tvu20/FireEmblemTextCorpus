Dolhr has occupied it for two years now. I escaped to Talys only thanks to my sister Elice's help. And in my place, she was captured by Dolhr. I have no idea where she is now.

Let us begin!"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Old Man", "line": "I have something very important to tell you. Listen well! In the northwest of this land, you will find two villages. A paladin named Arran dwells in the western village. In the easterly one, there is a hero named Samson. Both of them are fine men. The problem is the feud between their villages... Due to this rivalry, you can only add one of them to your ranks. Think hard about this before visiting either village."}, {"speaker": "Man", "line": "I heard a rumor that the prison to the east holds a young man called Xane. He isn't from around here...
