Really, do they think people have not tried before? So long as I possess this Imhullu magic, they cannot snuff my life out. No one can. As for the White Sage... He will trouble me no longer. With the dragon-goddess right where I want her, in the Fane of Raman, there is no way for Gotoh's Starlight to disperse the shadows that guard me."}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Man", "line": "You can't hope to fight Gharnef!

Gharnef is too much for you. Listen to me if you want to defeat him! Gharnef and Miloah were both my students. But Gharnef stole Imhullu from me and disappeared. I believe he has Falchion as well\u2026 With both Falchion and Imhullu, he fears nothing, not even Dolhr. He aims to rule the world! As long as he wields Imhullu, he cannot be challenged. However, there is one way to defeat him. Bring me the Lightsphere and the Starsphere. If you can do this, I will grant you the one and only spell that can defeat him, Starlight!"}]}
