A land veiled in mystery, the kingdom of manaketes. Our story began with the revival of Medeus, the Earth Dragon, here in this realm... The land of Archanea has a long history of war, of tragic tales that are born and then fade... As time passes on, Medeus's ambition for a world controlled by manaketes is threatened. Marth and his army at last draw near to the end of their long march..."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Malledus", "line": "There, sire.
