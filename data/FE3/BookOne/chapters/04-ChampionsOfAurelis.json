This kingdom alone had somehow resisted Dolhr\u2019s attempts to conquer it, but only by some miracle. By the time Marth arrived in Aurelis, much of its territory had already been carved up by Dolhr\u2019s ally Macedon. Still, the king\u2019s younger brother, Hardin, refused to give up without a fight. The people called him Coyote, and he intended to live up to the name. Since its founding, Aurelis and the holy kingdom of Archanea shared close ties and months ago Princess Nyna of Archanea had come to Hardin\u2019s aid. By his side, she had called on the people to fight- but few remained to answer. Macedon\u2019s finest soldiers were closing in. Nyna knew they were out of time\u2026"], "intro": [{"speaker": "Hardin", "line": "Princess Nyna, the Altean Army has apapeared on the opposite side of the river."}, {"speaker": "Nyna", "line": "Oh, Hardin, have they really?

When I was last in Pyrathi, I saw a manakete! An old man stood there, but suddenly, he turned into a dragon! What a shock... Truth told, I was scared out of my wits at the sight of it! I've heard rumors about the dragonkin, that some survived to this day. Still, I never thought I'd see a manakete with my own eyes! What are you looking at? Oh, this? I picked it up on my trip. It's unusual, this glowing stone... I have no idea what it's for, so you can have it! It makes me uncomfortable anyway. What a nice young man!
