@Opening 
The holy kingdom of Archanea had come into being six centuries earlier, when the region's numerous city-states were unified under one monarch. The first king, Adrah, had fought valiantly to accomplish this, wielding the three weapons he came to call his regalia- gifts from the gods, some said. The kingdom Adrah forged was pronounced holy; its kings were esteemed. With Archanea's aid, six more independent kingdoms sprang up in their own time. But Archanea was always the greatest - and now, Marth was about to take his first walk through its historic palace's halls.

@Intro 
Midia: Bishop Boah, do you hear the confusion the palace? Do you think something is afoot?
Boah: Perhaps Princess Nyna was able to recruit an army and has returned...
Midia: Do you really think so? We might be saved!
Boah: Perhaps, but the enemy won't let us go without a fight... And without our weapons, we are helpless.
Midia: But this is the perfect chance to rid Archanea of its foes! I am willing to take that chance, no matter what might happen to me.
Boah: Your fighting spirit is so strong, my dear! But if you perished, Astram would surely weep.
Midia: Yes... I do wish I could see him once more before the end. But if I cannot...
Boah: If that is your wish, Midia, you must fight as hard as you can and never give up!

@Boss 
Volzhin: Rebel pup! You dare defy Dolhr? Then writhe in the fires of Bolganone!

Volzhin: Do not think...you have won... Dolhr...is undying... Nngh!

@End 
Nyna: You have my gratitude, Prince. It is all thanks to you that I was able to return to my home. This shining bow is called Parthia. It is one of three weapons passed down by the royal family. Our enemies have stolen the lance Gradivus and the sword Mercurius. If you can obtain these weapons, their great power will make your fight that much easier...
