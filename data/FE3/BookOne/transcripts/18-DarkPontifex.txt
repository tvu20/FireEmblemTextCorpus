@Opening 
With the aid of the White Sage Gotoh’s powerful Warp magic, Marth and company were transported to the faraway city of Thabes. Once, Thabes was an advanced civilization; but only its decay advanced now. The League traced the lifeless streets to the temple at the city’s heart, somewhere within its walls Gharnef was waiting, and now, Marth must wrest Falchion and his sister, Elice, from the fiend’s grip.

@Intro 
Gharnef: So you've finally arrived, young prince... I have been waiting for you! Yes, I have waited...and I am ready to strike! Once you are dead...this world is mine! Hee hee hee! And I need not fear Medeus at all! With Falchion and Imhullu in my grasp, none can oppose me! Not even that dragon! You have journeyed far to meet me in combat... But can you find the real me? If you cannot... Falchion will never be yours!

@Boss 
Gharnef: You must not value your life very much… I will show you the true terror of the darkest of magic, Imhullu!

Gharnef: Gah! Starlight... Too powerful... I am undone! Know this, young prince... You may have the strength to best me... But Medeus? Ha! I will await you in hell!

@End 
Elice: Oh, Marth! I have missed you so. Look at how you've grown. Father would be so proud!
Marth: Elice! I am glad to see you safe! After I heard that Gharnef had taken you, I was so worried...
Elice: Gharnef kidnapped me to secure the spell of revival, Aum, that Gotoh gave me. There is a temple in southern Dolhr where this staff can be used to revive an ally... If there is one precious to you who has lost their life, let's travel to Dolhr and revive them. Let's go! To Dolhr!
