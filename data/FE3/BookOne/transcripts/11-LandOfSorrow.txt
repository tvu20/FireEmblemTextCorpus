@Opening 
Gra's betrayal of Altea years earlier had come as a shock, of course, until that day they attacked Marth's kingdom in the name of Dolhr, Gra had been a trustworthy neighbor and ally. While the Altean army was out on an expedition, Gra struck from the rearm annihilating the Altean soldiers, killing Marth's father, King Cornelius and stealing Falchion, the blade of light. It was a crushing blow. Much time had passed since that sad day, and much had changed. Now it was Marth's turn to descend on Gra Bastion, and face King Jiol, the man who had robbed him of his father.

@Intro 
Enemy Soldier: King Jiol, they're ‘ere! The League is outside the Bastion!
Jiol: League? How dare you call them that! I see naught but a prince of ghosts and his pack of rebels.
Enemy Soldier: B-beggin' your pardon, sire, but everybody calls 'em the League now. Altea and Aurelis and Archanea...The League of A's, you might say!
Jiol: Shut up, you idiot! Hmmm...So the princeling has returned. And he leads all the might of Archanea, with the Fire Emblem in hand...Did you send to Dolhr for reinforcements like I asked?
Enemy Soldier: Of course, sire. Macedon's pegasus knights are on their way.
Jiol: Pegasus knights?! How am I supposed to stop the Lea- those REBELS with a handful of...of winged ponies! Send another messenger! Tell them we need Camus's Sable Order, or...or Michalis's Dragoons! Blast...I deserve the same protection as the rest of the Empire! Betraying Altean was Gharnef's idea! Let...let him fight the brat! Don't just stand there, DO something! I don't want to die! Do you understand?
Enemy Soldier: Yes, your highness...

@Visit 
Young man: They say that shops will all give you half off if you have a silver card… Sounds too good to be true if you ask me!

Young man: I heard that once you reach LV.10, you can change jobs! Cavaliers can become paladins, mercenaries can become heroes… There's more but I forgot!

Camus: Are you Prince Marth of Altea? I have a request of you. This tome belongs to one Bishop Boah of Archanea. Heimler of Grust got hold of it. It has come to be in my possession. Please return it to the bishop for me. One more thing… Watch over Princess Nyna. Your attention to this would put my mind at ease. I shall take my leave of you. We will meet again…

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Palla 
Palla: I am pleased to meet you, Prince Marth. I am Palla of the Whitewings. As soon as we heard that Princess Maria was safe, my sister Catria and I left Macedon. Just as she promised you, Catria and I will join your fight alongside Princess Minerva. However, our youngest sister Est still has not returned from Grust. If she makes it back, the three of us will show you how we can light up the battlefield together!

%Marth,Catria 
Catria: Hello, Prince Marth. It has been a while. Do you remember me? I am Catria. I was waiting for Princess Minerva's order before joining your army. I look forward to fighting together. I will do all that I can.

%Midia,Astram 
Midia: Astram! So this is what you've been up to...
Astram: Midia! You're really here! I'm so glad you're safe. I've missed you...
Midia: It seems you don't know yet... Altea's army has liberated the capital. We were set free and have joined their fight. There is no need to cooperate with the enemy any longer!
Astram: What wonderful news! I will resume my fight against Dolhr!
Midia: We can be together again! Promise me that you will never leave my side.
Astram: Midia... In the time since we last met...
Midia: Yes, Astram? What is it?
Astram: I can't help but notice how you've matured while we were apart...

@Recruit-Battle 
Astram: I’m sorry… This is for my lover… Forgive me…

Astram: Midia… Forgive me…

Catria: Wait, I’m looking for Lord Marth.

Catria: Why…

Palla: Wait, I’m looking for Lord Marth.

Palla: How ruthless...

@Boss 
Jiol: Grrr... Altean rabble! I should have killed you stragglers back when I had the chance!

Jiol: Thus falls... the mighty kingdom... of Gra... My daughter... Sheena... you must... for me...

@End 
Malledus: We searched every inch of the castle but could not find the blade of light… As the rumors suggest, Gharnef must have taken it to Khadein.
Marth: I see... Without Falchion, we cannot hope to defeat Medeus. Altea is so close…but we must go to Khadein instead. Disappointing, but I have to tell the troops.
