@Opening 
One thing could always be said about Galder Harbor, the mainland port nearest Talys: it never had much in the way of riches, but neither did it have much trouble. All that changed when a pirate crew fell upon the town and made it their hideout. Here, in Galder, history records Marth’s first steps toward freeing his homeland.

@Intro 
Ogma: Prince Marth, I'm Ogma, a mercenary of Talys. The king ordered me to join your forces. I brought along my three most trusted men. Welcome to Galder, the port town that's been overrun by pirates. Pirates aren't all you will have to worry about. We've spotted soldiers from Grust too. Keep your wits about you.

@Visit 
Woman: There's a pirate who goes by the name of Darros. He's looking to meet the prince! Word is he wants to turn over a new leaf and fight for the people. You should seek him out and listen to what he has to say.

Woman: A curate can earn EXP simply by withstanding the attacks of a foe.

Man: Hammers are effective against knights. It would be wise to purchase one!

Villager: Prince of Altea, I beg of you... Save the cleric Lena. We tried to stop her, but... she left the safety of the village to bring aid to the poor and sick. She set out toward the Ghoul's Teeth some time ago and has yet to return. I can't tell you how much Lena's help meant to us. She's like an angel. It isn't much, but...we can offer you 5,000G to aid in your efforts to rescue her. Please, do what you can to save her!

Castor: Please forgive me, Princess Caeda! I have no choice. I must get my hands on some money...

%Caeda,Castor
Caeda: You are Castor of Talys! Why are you fighting us?
Castor: Princess Caeda... I am sorry. My mother is ill. To afford her medicine, I would do anything. Even this!
Caeda: I see... The pirates pay you. Well, it it may not be much, but I offer you what I can. Take it, and buy medicine for your mother.
Castor: You would aid a traitor like me? You are so kind... Oh, Princess Caeda! Forgive me! From now on, I will dedicate my life to you.

@Boss
Gomer: The gall of ye, defyin' me crew! I'll put an axe square between yer eyes! Ye ain't leaving here alive. I swear it on the rickety peg leg o'Shanty Pete!

Gomer: Augh... Fiends, ye be...

@End 
Villager: Thank you for taking care of those ruffians, Prince Marth. Thanks to you, peace has returned to Galder. In order to reach Aurelis, you must cross the Ghoul's Teeth. It is a dangerous road. You will find fearsome bandits called the Soothsires there. They prey on travelers and raid nearby villages. I have heard of a skilled swordsman called Navarre in their employ. Whatever you do, do not let your guard down. I will pray for your safety.

@Intro
Jagen: Prince Marth! Princess Caeda has alighted from Talys Castle.
Marth: Caeda, what's wrong? Did something happen?
Caeda: Prince Marth! What a relief. Talys Castle is under attack from pirates of Galder! After a fierce fight, they have taken the castle. I beg you, please save my father!
Marth: Don't worry, Caeda. The brave knights of Altea stand ready. Pirates are no match for us! Let's head back to the castle and rescue the king!

@Visit
Old man: Villagers have their gates open so that the prince can visit. Don't make them wait! Once a thief attacks a village, that's it. There's no saving it.

Young man: You can't use strong weapons if you don't have a high enough weapon level. That's just common sense. And don't forget that your fliers need to be careful around foes with bows!

Woman: There is a village south of the castle. A priest named Wrys awaits the prince there.

Man: Galder? It's a port town south of the isle of Talys. A man by the name of Gomer has taken control of the city. It's lousy with pirate scum!

Woman: If you are injured, stop at a fortress. You'll feel better after a short rest behind strong walls.

Villager: It is good that you have come, Prince Marth. I have here 10,000G that the villagers gathered. Take it. Please, use it to equip yourselves. Save this land from these rampaging pirates of Galder!

@Boss
Gazzak: The might of Altea, ye say, now? Har! Ye sprogs look t’be a mite short o’mighty t’me.

Gazzak: Rrgh... Ye'll pay, dog...

@End
King of Talys: Prince Marth! You have done well to make it here safely. You have my thanks. So, you plan to travel to Aurelis? In that case, though they are few in number, my soldiers will join you. From Captain Ogma down, they are all brave warriors and should serve you well. That is not all. Heed me now. As you travel through these lands, you may find many who cannot tolerate the tyranny of Dolhr. Some are hiding in villages. Others have been taken prisoner. And some must work with the enemy... You must seek these people out and work together! Heed the call! The time has come! Set foot on your path, but be vigilant! You face many dangers.
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
With the aid of the White Sage Gotoh’s powerful Warp magic, Marth and company were transported to the faraway city of Thabes. Once, Thabes was an advanced civilization; but only its decay advanced now. The League traced the lifeless streets to the temple at the city’s heart, somewhere within its walls Gharnef was waiting, and now, Marth must wrest Falchion and his sister, Elice, from the fiend’s grip.

@Intro 
Gharnef: So you've finally arrived, young prince... I have been waiting for you! Yes, I have waited...and I am ready to strike! Once you are dead...this world is mine! Hee hee hee! And I need not fear Medeus at all! With Falchion and Imhullu in my grasp, none can oppose me! Not even that dragon! You have journeyed far to meet me in combat... But can you find the real me? If you cannot... Falchion will never be yours!

@Boss 
Gharnef: You must not value your life very much... I will show you the true terror of the darkest of magic, Imhullu!

Gharnef: Gah! Starlight... Too powerful... I am undone! Know this, young prince... You may have the strength to best me... But Medeus? Ha! I will await you in hell!

@End 
Elice: Oh, Marth! I have missed you so. Look at how you've grown. Father would be so proud!
Marth: Elice! I am glad to see you safe! After I heard that Gharnef had taken you, I was so worried...
Elice: Gharnef kidnapped me to secure the spell of revival, Aum, that Gotoh gave me. There is a temple in southern Dolhr where this staff can be used to revive an ally... If there is one precious to you who has lost their life, let's travel to Dolhr and revive them. Let's go! To Dolhr!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
To obtain the Lightsphere and the Starsphere for Gotoh, Marth and the others headed for Chiasmir's Fane of Raman. At the Chiasmir strait, the Sable Order fought valiantly to keep Marth’s army from reaching Chiasmir, but in the end Grust’s knights buckled: the world’s mightiest only in song. The League marched on to the Fane of Raman, a holy sanctuary built by the divine dragoons to house their most priceless treasures. Here another story was set to begin...

@Intro 
Malledus: Your highness, please be careful inside the Fane of Raman. The goddess of this temple possesses fearful might. She will incinerate any and all intruders.
Marth: Hmm... I suppose we shouldn’t be intruding this sanctuary... But this temple holds the objects that I must seek. We must try not to provoke the temple’s guardians. I will only bring in a couple of soldiers with me.

Gharnef: Tiki... princess of the long-departed Naga clan... Incinerate all those who would disgrace the Fane of Raman! Don't forget that I saved you from Medeus after Bantu abandoned you!

@Recruit-Battle 
Tiki: N-no... Don't... Don't come near me!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Bantu,Tiki 
Bantu: Tiki! I've been looking everywhere! It seems Gharnef is controlling you... Now...wake up!
Tiki: I... I... What... What happened? Where am I?
Bantu: Back to your senses, are you? Good! How do you feel?
Tiki: It was so scary... A terrible nightmare... that wouldn't end!
Bantu: Oh, Tiki! I am so sorry. It's all my fault this happened! But you're all right now. I won't leave you again... I promise.
Tiki: Yes, please promise! Don't leave me alone ever again! Promise me that you won't...

@Recruit-Battle 
Tiki: N-no! Please! Come no closer!

Tiki: Ban-Ban... Wh-why did you leave me?

@End 
Gotoh: Marth, can you hear me? I await you in the village north of the Macedon Aerie... Yes, I am near! If you indeed obtained the orbs, then bring them to me with haste! Without Starlight, you have no hope of taking Falchion back from Gharnef. Gharnef has retreated to Thabes, the city of illusion. Without a doubt, he has taken Elice there with him! I have protected your sister till now, but I cannot protect her forever... Hurry! Save Elice!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The League had reached Archanean soil, so Marth gave himself leave to recuperate in Port Warren, a harbor town known for commerce. Coin alone kept the town free and they paid Dolhr dearly in taxes to preserve their autonomy. Naturally, then, theirs was a warm welcome when the Archanean League arrived. Marth's soldiers were glad to rest there, nestled between mountain and sea, but their joy was spoiled by news that the enemy was fast approaching- as harsh an awakening as a rock beneath the pillow.

@Intro 
Caesar: Prince Marth, we are mercenaries hired to protect Port Warren. Grust has gathered its forces in the northern fortresses. They have put the port to siege. It's very dangerous here. But there is a castle to the east that looks a bit safer. We should make it our target. Let's head out there together without delay!

@Visit
Woman: Many foes wait inside the fortresses, ready to enter the battle. Block them so they can't get out!

Woman: I've heard tell that a princess of Macedon is being held captive in Castle Deil. Macedon and Dolhr are supposed to be allies! I wonder what happened...

Old man: To defeat dragons, you must use a Dragon Killer sword.

Villager: In the coliseum, you will be rewarded with gold and experience if you win. But if you die, you lose your life. If you want to enter, you should be mentally prepared.

@Boss 
Kannival: W-what are you doing all the way out here? Blast, I'm finished...!

Kannival: Long...live...Grust! Nngff...

@End 
Catria: Prince Marth, I am Catria of Macedon's Whitewings. I have come to you with a secret request. Princess Minerva's forces are planning to rebel against Dolhr. However, the princess's younger sister, Maria, has been taken hostage by Dolhr so we cannot act. We beg of you, please help us save the young princess!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Aurelis was free, but Marth and his army- now known as the Archanean League still had much work ahead of them. They followed the Middleroad south, bound for Archanea Palace- a perilous route, for it took them right into Lefcandith Valley and the jaws of trouble. The countless fortresses lining the valley made it a veritable gauntlet and compounding the danger was the presence of the Whitewings, a knightly order led by Princess Minerva of Macedon. It would be a fierce battle.

@Intro
Minerva: I do not agree with your strategy, General Harmein. As a knight of Macedon, I have my pride. I wish to fight them head-on. A fair battle.
Harmein: Many of the soldiers of Macedon were lost in Aurelis. Surely you understand this? We must regroup in the castle and stall for time. The king has put his faith in me. I would ask that you do the same. After all, if you do not trust the empire...your little sister, Maria, is the one who will suffer the consequences.
Minerva: ... I understand. I will leave this matter in your hands. I doubt you can defeat Altea's knights with your schemes, however... I expect that you will end up regretting this. Though she is feared by all, I have heard that she is very beautiful and kind. I wonder if anyone can help her.

@Visit 
Old man: The warrior Minerva is actually a princess from Macedon! It is said that she fights for the Dolhr Empire because they are holding her sister hostage.

Auntie: The port of Warren seems to have lots of rarities for sale. If you’re going there, don’t go overboard with your shopping.

Villager: If you equip heavy weapons you will be slowed down by them. So equipping light but weak weapons is also a good way of fighting.

@Recruit-Visit
Bantu: Excuse me... Have you met a young girl by the name of Tiki? She is the last of the Naga, the Divine Dragon clan. There is no one but she who can defeat the manaketes serving Medeus. I'm so old that I don't have much fight left in me, but without my stone, I can't become a dragon at all. I'll come along with you, so please help me find Tiki.

@Battle 
Minerva: This fighting is more than I can stomach. Palla, Catria, Est... Let's get out of here.

@Boss 
Harmein: Curse Minerva and her pride! Grr, no matter. If I am to die here, then I won't be dying alone!

Harmein: Aaargh...Traitors...every...where...

@End 
Malledus: Prince Marth. It is time I tell you the legend of the manaketes. A long, long time ago...the manaketes arrived in Archanea. They were of three clans. The divine Dragons of Naga, the Mage Dragons of Basilisk, and the Fire Dragons of Salamander. The Divine Dragons were the most powerful. They stopped the others from conquering mankind. They carried stones that allowed them to conceal their true selves by taking human form. The dragonkin lived in peace with humans until the arrival of Medeus, an earth dragon. Medeus used his great power to destroy the Divine Dragons and found the Dolhr Empire. He launched attacks on the human lands and conquered them. Though the humans fought bravely, there was nothing they could do against Medeus. But the young warrior Anri faced Medeus! He gripped a sword that shone brightly: the blade of light, Falchion! After a fierce battle, he at last defeated Medeus. Yes, my prince. You do recognize this young man's name. He is indeed Anri, the first king of Altea. It has been 100 years since thos dark days. And now Medeus has appeared once again. Prince Marth! You are the chosen one. The last of Anri's line... Your father, King Cornelius, was defeated before he could accomplish his task. It is up to you now!
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
The long war had been fought, Archanea’s many lands freed, and now the League had cornered their archenemy within his castle. They broke into four groups and stormed the four gates of Dolhr Keep- unaware that this was exactly what Medeus was expecting. Bravely, these warriors fate had chosen steeled themselves for one last struggle.

@Intro 
Gotoh: To make it this far, Marth... It is the measure of a true hero.
Marth: Sage Gotoh! Why have you come to this place?
Gotoh: Men are foolish... and I had sworn to let the affairs of the world proceed without me. But watching your struggles, I came to think perhaps I was too hasty in my judgment. I cannot defeat Medeus on my own. But I will happily lay his minions to rest. Go forth, he who has been chosen by the goddess... Altea's prince of light! Cast the Shadow Dragon back into the darkness! Bury him in the earth he crawled out from!

@Boss 
Medeus: Rebels that dare disturb my repose... be consumed by the flames of hell!

Medeus: Me? Defeated? By humans... Mere humans... Take this to heart, Altean prince, inheritor of the light... One day... I will rise anew... Never forget... As long as there is light... the darkness can never be extinguished!

@Narration 
Medeus is defeated. The Dolhr Empire once again fades into darkness. After three long years of battle across Archanea for Marth and his friends... Light breaks upon the land, and the darkness recedes. And after a long journey Marth can finally put down his sword.

@Dialogue 
Caeda: Marth... at long last, we can return to Talys!
Marth: Yes, we can. And I must report to your father. But after that, I will immediately head to Altea...
Caeda: Yes...
Marth: War has brought my land to ruin. We must not waste any time in rebuilding.
Nyna: Oh, Marth. Hehe. I see you are not one to speak easily of what is most precious to you. You are a hero! This is a challenge you must not shrink from! Hurry and tell her.
Marth: Princess Nyna! I- I would never... Well, how shall I put- Caeda?
Caeda: Oh! Y-yes?
Marth: Would... would you journey to Altea with me?
Caeda: Why... yes! I would love to.

Nyna: Prince Marth, your remarkable struggle has come to an end. You have saved us all. The cost of that victory, however... For you, it was far too much to bear. I am sorry.
Marth: Princess Nyna... It is my fault that Caeda was killed, not yours. Do not apologize. I will soon... No, as long as I do live... I will never forget her.
Nyna: It is as I suspected. Do not blame yourself... Perhaps for us, this victory could only come at the cost of those we loved. Sad as it may be, it is the fate the Fire Emblem has borne across generations...
/***EOF***/
@Opening 
Dolhr... A land veiled in mystery, the kingdom of manaketes. Our story began with the revival of Medeus, the Earth Dragon, here in this realm... The land of Archanea has a long history of war, of tragic tales that are born and then fade... As time passes on, Medeus's ambition for a world controlled by manaketes is threatened. Marth and his army at last draw near to the end of their long march...

@Intro 
Malledus: There, sire. Up on the mountains to the south, you can see Dolhr Keep.
Marth: And inside is Medeus, king of the earth dragons- the one they call the Shadow Dragon. ...Why doesn’t he leave the keep and face us?
Malledus: I recall Lord Gotoh saying his return is not yet complete; only within the keep’s walls can he maintain dragon form, where the power of the seal does not affect...
Marth: Power of the seal?
Malledus: Yes. I don’t really understand either, but it seems it was created by the deities to protect humans from the evil dragon tribes. In this world there exists something known as the "Binding Shield".
Marth: I have heard of this as well. It is mentioned in the legends of the guardian god, Naga. But I thought it was all just a myth. If the Binding Shield truly exists, then why has Medeus appeared?
Malledus: Oh, that I... Anyway, now is our chance, before he resurrects completely. 
Marth: Yes. We've come all this way, and we're so close to returning peace. To Dolhr Keep, then! Let us put a stop to this war!

@Visit
Old man: A temple sits atop the mountain to the south. Deep inside, a central pillar stands... In front of it, Aum can be used to restore a life. Yes! Use it there, and you can greet a fallen friend.

@Boss 
Xemcel: This land, all of it- it belonged to us! Then you humans took it...defiled it!

Xemcel: Rrgh... Emperor... Medeus... Forgive your servant's weakness...

@Opening 
The League had routed Hollstadt's knights and recaptured most of the kingdom, but there was still the castle to deal with before Altea would be free; the mage-dragon Morzas remained entrenched within its walls. Unlike General Camus who preceded him, Morzas had been a cruel warden, slaughtering many innocent Alteans at the slightest provocation. Marth roiled to think such a monster still sat upon his noble father's throne.

@Intro 
Morzas: Kee hee hee... So, Marth! You've come crawling back to your homeland... just to die! I am Lord Medeus's most formidable servant... Morzas of Basilisk! You're too late! TOO LATE! Your mother, Liza, has already breathed her last! And your sister, Elice, is in Gharnef's hands now! It's all my doing! If that angers you, why don't you see if you can defeat me? Kee hee hee!

@Boss 
Morzas: Kee hee... Witless human! None defy a mage-dragon and live to speak of it!

Morzas: Grrf... I stand... corrected...B ut you still lack the power... to defeat Medeus...

@End 
Malledus: Well done, Prince! With this, Altea has been liberated. The people are so happy... Just listen to all that cheering! Do you hear them? "Glory to Marth, the prince of light!"

In the distant past, the continent of Akaneia was invaded by the Durhua Empire, led by the Mamkute King, Mediuth.
The people lived in fear and despair.
The Holy Kingdom of Akaneia, which had always guarded the world, was also destroyed by the horrific power of the Dark Dragon.
The world was facing ruin.
However... A miracle occurred.
Anri was a youth from the town of Aritia.
He went on a perilous journey to obtain the divine sword of light, Falchion.
And used it challenge and defeat the Dark Dragon, Mediuth.
With Mediuth’s fall, the Durhua Empire was vanquished.
The Kingdom of Akaneia was restored, and the world entered an age of peace.
Taking lead from the Kingdom of Aritia, many other countries also began to rebuild themselves.
But, 100 years after the war with Durhua.
After many years had passed, Mediuth resurrected at Durhua.
He allied with the neighbouring kingdoms of Grunia and Macedonia, and restored the Durhua Empire.
Also he joined forces with Khadein’s Archbishop Garnef, who shared the same ambitions of ruling the world as him, and launched an attack on the Kingdom of Akaneia.
Akaneia fought to the death, but under Grunia’s General Camus and Mediuth’s might they suffered terrible losses.
Aside from Princess Nina, the royal family was wiped out.
Aritia’s King Cornelius, who possessed the bloodline of Anri, left to defeat Mediuth.
He took the Falchion, the divine sword of legends, to battle, but was betrayed by Aritia’s ally, Gra, and died in battle.
Following him, the Kingdom of Aritia also fell.
Prince Marth, just 14 years of age, managed to escape with the help of his elder sister, Princess Ellis.
And he fled to the distant island country of Talis...

@Opening 
When journeying in from the borderlands, one particular peril would spring to mind: the Samsooth Mountains, whose gashing peaks rose up and divided the peninsula. Since before anyone could remember, the mountains had belonged to bandits, blights on the land whose acts of plunder, kidnapping, and arson knew no bounds. Out of fear, their victims gave these peaks another name: the Ghoul’s Teeth; while the bandits who ruled atop the Teeth’s craggy crowns took a name as well: the Samsooth Sires, or Soothsires...

@Intro
Julian: Hey, Lena! Things are looking bad. We had better beat it! Sounds like the knights of Altea have arrived. This is our cue to get out of here! We're almost there, so come on!
Lena: I am sorry, but...I have lost my precious Mend staff. Until I find it, I cannot leave. Don't worry about me, Julian! You should flee while you can. I can use my Warp staff to send you somewhere safe.
Julian: I can't let you do that. If I leave you here, then why did I betray the bandits and rescue you? We can worry about your staff later! I promise I'll come back for it. Let's get while the getting's good. Focus on that!

@Visit
Young Man: There are mercenaries about. Be careful. They're so skilled that they can fell you in one blow!

Gra's betrayal of Altea years earlier had come as a shock, of course, until that day they attacked Marth's kingdom in the name of Dolhr, Gra had been a trustworthy neighbor and ally. While the Altean army was out on an expedition, Gra struck from the rearm annihilating the Altean soldiers, killing Marth's father, King Cornelius and stealing Falchion, the blade of light. It was a crushing blow. Much time had passed since that sad day, and much had changed. Now it was Marth's turn to descend on Gra Bastion, and face King Jiol, the man who had robbed him of his father.

@Intro 
Enemy Soldier: King Jiol, they're ‘ere! The League is outside the Bastion!
Jiol: League? How dare you call them that! I see naught but a prince of ghosts and his pack of rebels.
Enemy Soldier: B-beggin' your pardon, sire, but everybody calls 'em the League now. Altea and Aurelis and Archanea...The League of A's, you might say!
Jiol: Shut up, you idiot! Hmmm...So the princeling has returned. And he leads all the might of Archanea, with the Fire Emblem in hand...Did you send to Dolhr for reinforcements like I asked?
Enemy Soldier: Of course, sire. Macedon's pegasus knights are on their way.
Jiol: Pegasus knights?! How am I supposed to stop the Lea- those REBELS with a handful of...of winged ponies! Send another messenger! Tell them we need Camus's Sable Order, or...or Michalis's Dragoons! Blast...I deserve the same protection as the rest of the Empire! Betraying Altean was Gharnef's idea! Let...let him fight the brat! Don't just stand there, DO something! I don't want to die! Do you understand?
Enemy Soldier: Yes, your highness...

Camus: Are you Prince Marth of Altea? I have a request of you. This tome belongs to one Bishop Boah of Archanea. Heimler of Grust got hold of it. It has come to be in my possession. Please return it to the bishop for me. One more thing... Watch over Princess Nyna. Your attention to this would put my mind at ease. I shall take my leave of you. We will meet again...

If she makes it back, the three of us will show you how we can light up the battlefield together!

With a string of hard-fought battles behind them, Marth and his army finally arrive in Archanea, Nyna's home. Beyond the mountains lies the bastion of Archanea that has stood for 1,000 years: the Ageless Palace. It's golden walls have seen so many treasures stolen and so many of its people lost... Marth and his allies have journeyed far, and now one of their primary goals is in sight!

Woman: I apologize... Since Archanea fell, this town has become desolate. It's not safe to walk outside with all the ruffians about!

Woman: I hate war... It's always the women and children who suffer. You should stop fighting. Get back to those you love as soon as you can. Parthia, the bow of flame, Gradivus, the lance that pierces stone... And the magic blade that can only be wielded by the chosen, Mercurius. Those that obtain them are said to be blessed by the gods.

Old man: Three ancient weapons known as the Regalia have been passed down through the generations of House Archanea: Parthia, the bow of flame; Gradivus, the lance that pierces stone; and Mercurius, the spectral sword. Only those blessed by the gods may lay hands on them- or so it goes.

Old man: No person can defend themselves against the breath of a dragon. Any armour is useless, so fighting head on is very dangerous.

Ruffian: You lookin' to buy a slave? All's I have left are some scrawny brats, but I'll cut you a deal.
Marth: Look at these poor children! What a vile man you are. If you value your life, you'll unchain them immediately and get out of my sight!
Ruffian: It's the Altean army! I'm done for!
Marth: What a horrible ordeal you all must have suffered... But it's all right now. You can return to your homes. You there, why haven't you left?
Linde: I...I don't have anywhere to go.
Marth: You're a girl, aren't you? Yet you're disguised as a young boy.
Linde: I am the daughter of Archbishop Miloah. I disguised myself to escape from Gharnef. But I was caught by a slave merchant when I ran away.
Marth: So you're the archbishop's daughter! It's good that we found you. Princess Nyna has been worried sick! From today, we will stand beside you. I will not let anything like this happen to you again.
Linde: Prince Marth, let me fight at your side. I have the Aura tome my father entrusted to me... If Princess Nyna allows me to help, I will use it. I want to take revenge for what Gharnef did to my father. I must defeat him.

Jeorge: Greetings, Prince Marth! I am Jeorge, a sniper of Archanea. I was captured when Archanea was defeated, but, with effort, I escaped. I have been awaiting you. I hear Princess Nyna is under your protection. I wish to join you. With my silver bow in hand, I will expend every effort to set my land free.

After shattering Macedon’s main force outside Aurelis Castle, Marth next led his army into the castle’s halls to liberate the kingdom. A number of treasures slept in Aurelis Castle’s nooks and crannies but how to extract them before they could fall into enemy hands? “Only a thief could open chests locked that tight,” grumbled one of Marth’s men. But we don’t have any thieves with us. ...Do we?

@Intro
Emereus: The rebels have made it into the castle? Impossible! Grr... Well, we will show them! Knights, form up and rush the intruders! Archers, defend the throne! Thieves, loot the castle's treasures and prepare to withdraw! Hear me! Do not let them set one foot into this chamber! Not one!

%Marth,Wendell
Wendell: Prince! I am Wendell, a bishop of Khadein. We are a peaceful people. But our pleas were met only with cruelty by Gharnef as he seized the city. Thanks to his dark influence, many mages have now allied themselves with Dolhr. Please, with the strength of your forces, find a way to put an end to Gharnef's ambitions.

%Merric,Wendell
Merric: Oh! Master Wendell? Yes, it's you!
Wendell: Ah, Merric! How have you been, lad? You certainly look well.
Merric: I was able to find Prince Marth of Altea! And I have joined his army as well. We are fighting the tyranny of Dolhr! Why are you here, Master?
Wendell: How can I say this... Sadly, Khadein has fallen into darkness. A fiend called Gharnef has seized control. He has turned the city toward the shadow... I could not bear to serve him, so I fled on my own.
Merric: What awful news! Master, please... Consider lending us your strength. If Gharnef serves Dolhr, he is our enemy! We will find a way to take Khadein back. I know the prince would be overjoyed to have so great a bishop as you as an ally, Master.
Wendell: Hmm... Though I deplore violence, I cannot see another path... Very well, Merric. I will join your fight. Please let the prince know I am at his service.

%Marth,Rickard
Rickard: Thanks for saving me! Hey, wait a second... Aren't you the prince of Altea? My name is Rickard. I am but a humble thief. I came to loot this castle but ended up getting caught. Since you helped me out, I'll return the favor!

%Julian,Rickard
Julian: Rickard? It can't be! What are you doing here?
Rickard: Julian! It's been too long since I've seen you, Chief. I came to this castle to steal a few things. And wouldn't you know it...I got a little sloppy. And what brings you here?
Julian: Me? As of today, I've washed my hands of thievery. I'm on the side of what's good and just.
Rickard: Ha! I bet I know the truth behind this change of heart. Beauties have always been your weak point.
Julian: N-not a chance! The spirit of justice awakened within me! Look, don't worry about it. Just join up with us!
Rickard: There you go again, trying to make up my mind for me. Since you're the one asking... Well, why not? It's settled! I'll lend you a hand. But I'll take a cut of the loot as payment!

Nyna: You must be Prince Marth. You have done well to make it here. I am the princess of Archanea, Nyna. Though Archanea has long protected this world, Dolhr overwhelmed us, throwing all into chaos. I cannot fight. Marth, I beg you... Please, lead the forces of good and defeat Dolhr! You must liberate all of the lands Dolhr has occupied!
Marth: Of course, Princess Nyna. Altea's allegiance to Archanea is steadfast. Moreover, as the prince of Altea, it is my destiny to defeat Medeus.
Nyna: I thank you, Marth. I will now entrust you with this treasure... The Fire Emblem is given to one with the strength to save the world when my royal family cannot. With this, you will be able to open chests containing invaluable treasures. The battles you face will test your every skill. But fight as hard as you can. Return light to this world!

@Opening 
Still smarting from their bitter experience with Gharnef and the dark magic Imhullu, Prince Marth and the League regrouped and marched south- home to Altea. Once Marth's kingdom had been beautiful, blessed with rich soil and clear waters; now the eyes tended to notice instead the barren farms; the ruins; forlorn stares. Marth vowed to free Altea from its torment without any further delay.

@Intro 
Nyna: So this is your country, Altea...
Marth: Yes. Dolhr has occupied it for two years now. I escaped to Talys only thanks to my sister Elice's help. And in my place, she was captured by Dolhr. I have no idea where she is now. I vow that I will do whatever I can to rescue her! All right, everyone! It is time to take back Altea! Let us begin!

@Visit 
Old man: I have something very important to tell you. Listen well! In the northwest of this land, you will find two villages. A paladin named Arran dwells in the western village. In the easterly one, there is a hero named Samson. Both of them are fine men. The problem is the feud between their villages... Due to this rivalry, you can only add one of them to your ranks. Think hard about this before visiting either village.

Young man: Psst... If you have a VIP card, you can access a members-only shop. Its location is a secret. Even I don't know it!

Man: I heard a rumor that the prison to the east holds a young man called Xane. He isn't from around here... That's not all... I hear he holds a wondrous power.

Woman: I am very glad to see that the Altean army has returned. Now this country can return to the peaceful days of old.

Woman: Princess Elice was taken away somewhere by a bishop called Gharnef. How sad for the prince... I hope she's all right.

Young man: If you intend to use the Devil Sword, be careful. It's a powerful weapon but a danger to its owner.

Middle-aged Man: Three orbs are enshrined at the Fane of Raman, each brimming with power. What sort of power, none can say. Well, except those who have wielded it, right?

@Recruit-Visit 
Arran: I am Arran. Once, I was a knight captain. I left that life behind me, but if you have true need of my strength, I will join you. The feud between these two villages is bitter. If our neighbors hear you visited us, they will bar their gates. If you had hoped to recruit the hero Samson, I am sorry.

Samson: I'm Samson. I used to be famous as a gladiator. That's behind me now. I'm just living my life here. If you need me, though, I'll head out with you. The feud between these two villages is bad! If our neighbors hear you visited us, they'll close their gates. If word gets around, you won't be able to recruit Arran.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Marth,Xane
Xane: Hey there, Prince! Thanks for saving me. The name's Xane. I come from a faraway land. My people can transform into anybody. Dolhr found out and demanded I join them! I refused. I'd never help those villains! I'd be happy to help you fight them though!

@Opening 
Heeding Catria's request, Marth heads to Castle Deil in order to save the captive Princess Maria of Macedonia. Not all of the League's soldiers took Catria of the Whitewings at her word. Some insisted her plea was a ruse, a trap concocted by Princess Minerva herself. Marth doubted that, though; he had seen the woman in Lefcandith Valley, and she did not strike him as a sort of conniving menace his followers feared. That woman had the same expression as his elder sister... A tragic and painful one. In Minerva, Marth saw the figure of his older sister, Elice, who was still missing after being captured by the Empire in his place. As the brunt of Grust's might drew closer, Marth led the League to Castle Deil, determined to attack the citadel and rescue the young Macedonian princess, Maria.

@Intro 
Zharov: Princess Minerva, what brings you here? You've left your post: not very wise. Might I remind you, poor conduct on your part could have repercussions on how...comfortable...your sister remains.
Minerva: I am aware of my sister, thank you. ...I did not come to make trouble. Just let me see Maria, for a little while. She's only a child, General. Think of what she must be going through.
Zharov: Impossible, I'm afraid. She is a hostage. If your sister's well-being concerns you, then start following orders.
Enemy Soldier: General! Grave news! The rebel army has been sighted east of Castle Deil!
Zharov: What?! Why in creation would the rebels come here? Blast...Order the Dragoons to sortie! And don't forget to send word to the main army. We need reinforcements!
Minerva: Rebels...? Then Marth has arrived...

@Visit 
Old man: There were three great bishops in this land. Miloah, the Master of Aura. Gharnef, The Dark Pontifex. And Gotoh, the White Sage. But now that Miloah has been defeated, no one can stand up to Gharnef.

Old man: The levin sword... It is said that they who wield it can loose lightning that will crush even heavy armor.

Man: Snipers are skilled bow users. If you carelessly let them get close, you could get killed.

Old man: Beware of ballistae near the northern fort. They can attack from far away.

Maria: Ah... You must be Prince Marth! (Wow! He's so dashing!) Thank you for saving me! You have to tell my older sister that I am safe! She must be worried... One other thing... I would like to join you, Prince. Let me stay by your side! Oh, please don't say no!

%Marth,Minerva
Minerva: Greetings, Prince Marth. I am Minerva of Macedon. For saving Maria, you have my thanks. I had no choice but to be your enemy. I regret that very much. Still, many in Macedon do support Dolhr, including my elder brother Michalis. To me, though, Dolhr is responsible for my father's death. I seek revenge for that. I must also worry aobut my troops, however. Especially the three Whitewings: Palla, Catria, and Est. Dolhr feared our rebellion and separated us. If they knew I was safe, they would happily join your ranks. How I detest Dolhr for trampling Macedon underfoot. Please, allow us to join your fight.

Nyna: That is so. But he had a daughter named Linde. It is said she inherited the magic of Aura. Unfortunately, we do not know where Linde is now. No one does. I fear that something terrible has befallen her. Please, seek her out. Her father is no more, so we must protect her now. For Archanea's sake!

@Opening 
It was General Ordwin, one of the Three Heroes of the War of Liberation, who put Grust on the map. His peerless knights tamed their neighbors the barbarians in the kingdom’s infancy, securing its place as one of the greatest of the Seven Kingdoms. However, the current king, Ludwik, was weak-willed and easily cowed: Dolhr had little trouble forcing him into an alliance. Now he had taken ill, even as Grust suffered its string of defeats at the hand of the League. The once mighty kingdom was poised to fall...

@Intro 
Nyna: Prince Marth. About Grust, there is something I wish to tell you. You should know that Grust's famous knights are led by General Camus. When the Dolhr-Grust allied forces seized control of Archanea three years ago, the entire royal family was killed, save me. I was given into Grust’s custody- the custody of the Sable Order, to be more specific. I am told Dolhr wished for my execution- and with it the end of the holy lineage of House Archanea- and Grust was willing to comply. Camus protected me, knowing he risked incurring the wrath of the Shadow Dragon. He was the one who eventually arranged for my escape to Aurelis. Afterwards, he was only held captive until recently, because he had won many victories for Dolhr. I hated him, too, at first. But in time, I found my hatred tempered by the compassion he showed me, my feelings... changed. If possible, I don't want to fight against him. All I wish is to see him again... 

@Visit 
Old man: It's good to see you, Prince Marth! Is my granddaughter Lena in good health? Please... give her this staff, Hammerne. It has been passed down in our family for generations. It can repair some weapons and items, but not all. Be sure to tell her to be careful when using it.

@Recruit-Battle 
Lorenz: No victory here can give Grust back her glory.

Lorenz: This, too, must be fate.

@Recruit-Talk 
%Caeda,Lorenz
Caeda: General Lorenz, I am Caeda of Talys. My father told me much of you.
Lorenz: Princess Caeda! You have grown into a beautiful young lady. Yes, your father was a great help to me.
Caeda: General... You did not truly want to become an ally of Dolhr, did you? Why then did you not put a stop to the alliance?
Lorenz: Grust's king is a coward. He fears the power of Dolhr.
Caeda: Dolhr's aim is to conquer all of mankind with an army of manaketes. For the sake of all of the innocents, including those in Grust, we must put a stop to that ambition. Stop fighting us. Instead, join us!
Lorenz: My feelings have not changed... I fought only because I was ordered to. But it may be time to act. Very well, Princess. It is painful for me to betray my homeland, but I will join you in this fight!

%Marth,Est
Est: You must be Prince Marth! I am Est of Macedon. We finally get to meet! I went and retrieved the sword Mercurius that Grust stole from Archanea. It is not for us that I obtained it. It's for you! Please make use of it.

@Battle 
Marth: General Camus, I have no wish to fight you. You know this battle is pointless; surely you must! Nyna also wants to see you. Please forget about the past, and drop your sword.
Camus: Prince Marth... It's already too late. So long as Grust continues to support Dolhr’s ambitions, it does not matter what I know or think. I am a knight; I have a duty to fight for my motherland’s glory till the very end. And besides, I caused your father's death. Why don't we just end everything here?
Nyna: Wait, Camus... I beg of you. I do not wish to see that the two of you fight. It is... it is unbearable. Please, Camus, help us... no, help me.
Camus: I am sorry, Princess. Were my heart my master, I would do exactly as you say. But... Betraying my homeland, right as it nears ruin, is something that I cannot do. Nyna... Our days together may have been short, but I was very happy
Camus: ...Farewell. I pray for your happiness.

@Boss 
Camus: I pity you, for as long as I wield Gradivus, you have no hope of defeating me. Retreat and avoid this fate.

Camus: My dear... Nyna... Farewell...

@End 
Marth: Princess Nyna... I am sorry. I could not do what you asked.
Nyna: Marth... It is I who should apologize for putting you through this. In truth, since the moment I entrusted the Fire Emblem to you, I knew this would happen. I saw that once the royal family was restored by the Fire Emblem, I would lose something precious to me. Our land has a legend of the emblem, Artemis's Curse, that foretold this...

Khadein, city of magic... This hallowed place is now under Gharnef's control. No warrior, no matter how brave, can stand up to the spells of Khadein. Though they may try, one by one...they will inevitably fall. Has this place truly sunk into shadow?

@Intro 
Gharnef: What? The dregs of Archanea have come to challenge my kingdom? Ha ha ha... Really, do they think people have not tried before? So long as I possess this Imhullu magic, they cannot snuff my life out. No one can. As for the White Sage... He will trouble me no longer. With the dragon-goddess right where I want her, in the Fane of Raman, there is no way for Gotoh's Starlight to disperse the shadows that guard me.

@Visit 
Man: You can't hope to fight Gharnef! His evil magic Imhullu protects him. Only Gotoh's Starlight can break his evil spell... But you didn't hear this from me! Get out of here!

Young man: Strong armor is no use against magic. Have a curate use the spell Barrier instead or Pure Water!

@Boss 
Gharnef: You must not value your life very much... I will show you the true terror of the darkest of magic, Imhullu!

Gharnef: I don't have time to play with you, little prince! If you want Falchion, you'll have to come to Thabes!

@End 
Gotoh: Can you hear me, Prince Marth? I am the sage Gotoh. Through magic, I have reached out to you. Gharnef is too much for you. Listen to me if you want to defeat him! Gharnef and Miloah were both my students. But Gharnef stole Imhullu from me and disappeared. I believe he has Falchion as well... With both Falchion and Imhullu, he fears nothing, not even Dolhr. He aims to rule the world! As long as he wields Imhullu, he cannot be challenged. However, there is one way to defeat him. Bring me the Lightsphere and the Starsphere. If you can do this, I will grant you the one and only spell that can defeat him, Starlight!

Trace a line around the continent’s north-eastern plains, and you have Aurelis. This kingdom alone had somehow resisted Dolhr’s attempts to conquer it, but only by some miracle. By the time Marth arrived in Aurelis, much of its territory had already been carved up by Dolhr’s ally Macedon. Still, the king’s younger brother, Hardin, refused to give up without a fight. The people called him Coyote, and he intended to live up to the name. Since its founding, Aurelis and the holy kingdom of Archanea shared close ties and months ago Princess Nyna of Archanea had come to Hardin’s aid. By his side, she had called on the people to fight- but few remained to answer. Macedon’s finest soldiers were closing in. Nyna knew they were out of time...

@Intro 
Hardin: Princess Nyna, the Altean Army has apapeared on the opposite side of the river.
Nyna: Oh, Hardin, have they really? So Prince Marth has come...
Hardin: Finally, we can build a force to fight back. Princess, it is dangerous here. Please wait for the prince inside the fortress. Together with Altea, we will retake the castle!

@Visit
Old man: There are many treasures within the castle walls. However, if you do not have a thief in your army, you will not be able to open the chests!

Woman: I hear that the shops in Port Warren sell many rare items. If you plan to travel there, don't waste your gold beforehand!

Woman: Many foes wait inside the fortresses, ready to enter the battle. Block them so they can't get out!

Young man: Boy! What's that look on your face? Haven't you ever seen a backwoods village like this before? Speaking of rare sights... When I was last in Pyrathi, I saw a manakete! An old man stood there, but suddenly, he turned into a dragon! What a shock... Truth told, I was scared out of my wits at the sight of it! I've heard rumors about the dragonkin, that some survived to this day. Still, I never thought I'd see a manakete with my own eyes! What are you looking at? Oh, this? I picked it up on my trip. It's unusual, this glowing stone... I have no idea what it's for, so you can have it! It makes me uncomfortable anyway. What a nice young man! I hope we can speak again.

Matthis: Lena?! What are you doing on a battlefield?
Lena: I was attacked by bandits in the Teeth while tending to the sick there, and these people saved me. The real question is, what are YOU doing on a battlefield- least of all this one!
Matthis: I’m not here by choice, sister of mine. Since you left, Macedon has only gotten worse and worse. They forced me to enlist- you know I hate warfare, but it was into the army or onto the chopping block.
Lena: Shame on you, Matthis. If you’re going to fight, then at least fight for something you believe in. Medon has done terrible things: marrying their might to Doluna, helping them torment people...Brother, it’s not too late. You could join Altea’s forces. They’re good people you know. Prince Marth would welcome you. They all would.
Matthis: ...All right, then. If I’m gonna to die, I’d rather die as one of the dashing than one of the dastardly. You know, Lena, you always were the reliable one and now you’re all grown up...I thought for sure you’d have already settled down with your one true love.
Lena: T-true love? I’ve...I’ve met no such man, Matthis.
Matthis: Hmm, is that so? I’ll bet you haven’t... Well, you just be careful. There are plenty of thieves out there who would steal a girl’s heart.
Lena: Huh? But...
Matthis: Well, Lena, don’t push yourself too hard. I’ll just go and say my farewells to the Macedonian army.

@Opening
Maria and Minerva's home, Macedon, is the birthplace of wyverns. It was known as a bountiful land of peace. That changed when Prince Michalis aligned his goals with those of Dolhr... against Minerva's wishes. He turned Macedon's wyvern knights to war, striking fear into hearts across many lands... As Marth and his allies approach, the amassed wyverns blot out the sun.

@Intro
Michalis: Lord Gotoh, the League has begun its attack. I wish for you to move someplace safe until the fighting has ended.
Gotoh: Mmm... I understand. But Michalis, you truly are a fool.
Michalis: ...! Why did you call me a fool!?
Gotoh: You loved your younger sister so much. It pains me to see you quarrel. If you and Minerva had worked as one, Macedon might have become a great kingdom- greater even than Archanea, perhaps. But instead, you let Gharnef trick you into destroying your family, and your kingdom with it.
Michalis: ...I cannot undo what is done. My father’s blood will always be on my hands, just as Minerva’s betrayal of her brother and country will be on hers. And Macedon has not been destroyed, not yet. So long as I carry Iote's Shield, the League’s arrows cannot fell me. Right now, my only goal is to gut that Altean prince who leads the League. My pride as Macedonian king rests upon it!
Gotoh: I see... Then we’ve nothing more to discuss, have we? Go! Michalis, go and punish yourself, for the crime of killing your own father!!

@Visit 
Man: A great sage lives in the village to the north. He keeps to himself though! I've never met him. Nobody has!

Gotoh: Marth! You have done well to make it here. I am Gotoh. As instructed, you have brought me the Lightsphere and Starsphere. I now grant you the only magic capable of countering Imhullu, Starlight. Take it and bring an end to the wickedness of the Dark Pontifex, Gharnef.

Gotoh: Marth! You have not heeded my words! I require the Starsphere and Lightsphere both. Without them, I cannot create Starlight for you. I do not think you can defeat Gharnef... If you cannot claim Falchion from Gharnef, you have little hope of defeating Medeus. If you still wish to try, you must gain much in experience and reach the pinnacle of your strength. That is not all... You must also gather mighty blades like Gradivus, Mercurius, and the Devil Axe. Unless you make these preparations, Medeus's defeat is scarcely possible. This is the harshest road to victory. Are you truly willing to walk this path? Think long and hard on this decision. Choose wisely.

@Boss
Michalis: Damn you, Minerva! I will not be put down! Now, quake in terror before my wyvern knights!

@Opening 
The holy kingdom of Archanea had come into being six centuries earlier, when the region's numerous city-states were unified under one monarch. The first king, Adrah, had fought valiantly to accomplish this, wielding the three weapons he came to call his regalia- gifts from the gods, some said. The kingdom Adrah forged was pronounced holy; its kings were esteemed. With Archanea's aid, six more independent kingdoms sprang up in their own time. But Archanea was always the greatest - and now, Marth was about to take his first walk through its historic palace's halls.

@Intro 
Midia: Bishop Boah, do you hear the confusion the palace? Do you think something is afoot?
Boah: Perhaps Princess Nyna was able to recruit an army and has returned...
Midia: Do you really think so? We might be saved!
Boah: Perhaps, but the enemy won't let us go without a fight... And without our weapons, we are helpless.
Midia: But this is the perfect chance to rid Archanea of its foes! I am willing to take that chance, no matter what might happen to me.
Boah: Your fighting spirit is so strong, my dear! But if you perished, Astram would surely weep.
Midia: Yes... I do wish I could see him once more before the end. But if I cannot...
Boah: If that is your wish, Midia, you must fight as hard as you can and never give up!

Nyna: You have my gratitude, Prince. It is all thanks to you that I was able to return to my home. This shining bow is called Parthia. It is one of three weapons passed down by the royal family. Our enemies have stolen the lance Gradivus and the sword Mercurius. If you can obtain these weapons, their great power will make your fight that much easier...
