@Opening 
A stone bridge leading up the tall rocky mountain. This stone bridge seems to stretch to the heavens, as it spirals around. From the rocks fearful roaring and breathing sounds can be heard, as if the mountain was alive. The Dragon's Table... It is asn ancient ruin of the dragon tribe, and the place where the Divine Dragon King, Naga, sealed away the Earth Dragons. Now, after a period of 600 years, the Earth Dragons are currently awakening, and countless evil demons are being born...

@Intro 
Marth: What is this strange air? It feels like it's full of evil spirits.
Jagen: That is true... My body appears to be frozen. These are the evil spirits of the Earth Dragons. Your highness, it seems we can't have everybody enter ahead. Since we don't know what will happen, please choose carefully who to take with you.
Marth: I hope to at least take the people who are worried about the four sisters.
Jagen: Mmm... There's no avoiding that. But how many people will survive? I bet this will be a fierce battle.

Gotoh: Prince Marth. The altar is probably full of crazed barbarians and Mage Dragons that have lost their mind. They are being controlled by Gharnef's magic, and will definitely attack you. The dark priests that serve Gharnef also have fearful power. As this battle lengthens it will become fiercer, but don't stop and keep charging forwards! You must defeat Gharnef, and recover from him the divine Falchion sword that was stolen from Altea. Without the Falchion, you won't be able to defeat Medeus...

@End
Jagen: Your highness, the wall in front of us has collapsed!
