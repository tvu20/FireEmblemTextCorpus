@Intro 
Gharnef: Come, boy, you want to stop me again? This time I won't spare you!!
Marth: Gharnef, give my sister and the others back!! Where have you taken them!?
Gharnef: Hahahaha... Those clerics are going to become sacrifices for the resurrection of the Shadow Dragon. They are lost forever. Soon the Earth Dragon King, Medeus, will be reborn in his true form, and we require the clerics as live sacrifices. However their souls shattered because they couldn't stand the pain. Not even I can help them now. Thanks to them, the Shadow Dragon will awaken. He no longer fears even the power of the Binding Shield. It's a shame that everything's already over. Marth... You will die here!!!

@Boss
Gharnef: Hahahaha... Let me show you the might of my Imhullu spell...

Gharnef: Haha... It's already too late... This world is done for... Urgh.

@End 
Jagen: Your highness, there's a stairway leading up!!
