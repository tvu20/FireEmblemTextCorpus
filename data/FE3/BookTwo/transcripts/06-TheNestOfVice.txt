@Opening
Grust has been liberated.

All that remains is Olbern Keep, where General Lang remains barricaded. Lang used his influence to steal belongings, daughters, and lives from the people of Grust. Was there ever a man as cruel as he is?

"I cannot forgive him. I shall take him down without fail!" Prince Marth raised his sword to the skies and ordered firmly: "Altean knights, charge!!"

@Intro 
Lang: Heh heh heh... So the Alteans have come. Reinforcements are arriving soon; if we can hold out a little longer, we can make a pincer attack. Swordsman Navarre. When they open that door, you make your move. There is no need for restraint; slice them to pieces!
Navarre: Yeah... sure. Though the knights of Altea are hardly worthy enemies.
Lang: Oh-ho! That's my Navarre. They say not even Ogma of Talys is your equal.
Navarre: What? Ogma?! N... Naturally... A guy like him is no match for me.
Lang: I see. Glad to hear it. Then I'll leave this place in your capable hands, Navarre!

@Recruit-Talk 
%Caeda,Samuel
Caeda: Navarre, please hear me out! Lend your sword to our case, just once more!
Navarre: What? Who are you? I'll have no business with women or children... But, there's a first for everything... (Whoa, she's smoking!) What business do you have with me?
Caeda: ...... Y-you're not Navarre! Who are you?
Samuel: Yikes, I've been exposed, huh? I'm actually a stingy mercenary known as Samuel. Somehow, I keep getting mistaken for this famous "Navarre" swordsman guy. I got tired of it after a while, so I decided to pose as him and got myself hired. But I don't like this General Lang guy either. If you're alright with it, I'll lend you my sword.
Caeda: Yes... You'll do just fine...

%Ogma,Samuel 
Ogma: Navarre... You bastard...
Navarre: Stay away... This evening, my killing edge hungers for blood...
Ogma: Do you mean to kill me, no matter what? Hmph, very well. I knew that we'd have to settle our score eventually.
Samuel: Wait... Stay your blade! ...I'm no Navarre, I'm just a sham. I... it's me, Samuel. Have you forgotten, Ogma?
Ogma: Samuel?! Samuel, the gladiator from Knorda?
Samuel: Yes, I was a slave gladiator at the time, and you really helped me out. Even when everyone was making their escape, you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught...
Ogma: ......
Samuel: I heard everything from my friends. How you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse. How, by chance, the young Princess Talys, tears in her eyes, stood up for you and saved you. And that's why you swore your blade to Talys. Or rather... to the princess...
Ogma: Enough... Say no more! No more. It's in the past now... No more...
Samuel: ...Ogma... Anyway, I want to repay you! I'm following you from now on, okay?

@Recruit-Battle 
Navarre: I pity your soul. But I can at least grant you a quick death. Take this! My killing edge!!

Samuel: Doh, I shouldn't have said that I was Navarre...

@Boss 
Lang: W-wait, please! I'm sorry... Please forgive me... I've only done as the Emperor ordered me to. I didn't agree with him, but I had no choice. So... so please, s-spare my life... I'll do anything you say. Yes... Just like this... Mwahaha! You shouldn't have let your guard down! You fool... Now die!

Lang: Urgh... Impossible... I have been defeated...

@End 
Marth: Lord Wendell! Thank goodness you're unharmed.
Wendell: Lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned. Even though I told him that I must fulfill a mission assigned to me by Archsage Gotoh...
Marth: A mission from Lord Gotoh?
Wendell: That's correct... You have seen the "Starsphere"--the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface. In order to pierce Gharnef's shadowy veil, Lord Gotoh created a sacred spell named "Starlight" from that orb.
Wendell: Unfortunately, the strain on the Starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards, which scattered into the sky. Lord Gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power, and that if even one of them is lost, the world will fall into irreparable ruin. By any means possible, we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the Starsphere.
Marth: Is... Is this a joke? That the world could just end... This is all very hard to take in. But aren't these the star shards? If so, we already have a few. After we retake Altea, we'd be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs.
Wendell: Of course... Your country was only just invaded by the Empire... I understand, Prince... I too shall fight to restore Altea, then. Thinking about it, my meeting with you is like a sign from Lord Gotoh himself. In that case, I shall surrender myself to fate. But, please, let's stop by the Fane of Raman. We may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple.
Marth: Understood. If it's the Fane of Raman, we can go there on our way to Altea!
