Can we win with just our troops?"}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "Why didn't you tell me earlier? Call Jeorge back to the castle this instant!

You can't be planning to defect to Altea..."}, {"speaker": "Jeorge", "line": "No, that's not an option. If I were to defect now, I'd drag the entire platoon down with me.

Please, defeat General Lang! As long as that man lives, peace is but a fleeting dream."}, {"speaker": "Elder", "line": "Ohh, if isn't Prince Marth! I wonder how my granddaughter Lena is faring, hm? What, you don't know? I see... Th-then... Do you still want this Hammerne staff? At least, if Lena's pupil Marisha were around, I'm sure she could use it...
