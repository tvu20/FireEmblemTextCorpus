The first obstacle in Anri's Way: the Desert of Death. With its scorching sun, raging sandstorm, savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns that soar and dominate the skies.

And that was so that he could rescue Princess Artemis\u2026 Although it will be long, I would like to describe the legend of Anri. 100 years ago\u2026 The ruler of this continent, the Holy Kingdom of Archanea, was destroyed by the dragon tribe.Humans were enslaved and lived each day in despair. Some people wielded weapons to fight back, but they couldn\u2019t defeat the dragon tribe, and many people died. Also, the humans\u2019 only hope, the Archanean royal family, was wiped out, and so the world lost all hope. However, at that time, at a small city called Altea. It was discovered that the princess of Archanea was hiding there. The angered Dolhr Empire sent soldiers to Altea, aiming to capture the princess. That princess\u2026 Artemis was prepared to give up her own life to save the citizens. However the citizens of Altea swore that, even if they were completely annihilated, they would protect the princess. Knowing that the princess was still alive, the citizens of Pales gathered a liberation army, and continued the fight against the Dolhr Empire. The leader of the liberation army, Duke Cartas, fought with the royal shield, given to him by Artemis. As a result, he received enormous support. Thanks to his efforts, the war finally began to become in their favour. But then, the king of the Earth Dragons, Medeus, finally moved out. The dark breath of Earth Dragons possessed horrendous destructive power and had the effect of halving the enemy\u2019s strength. Under such a dire situation it was thought that Altea\u2019s resistance wasn\u2019t going to hold out. Then, at that time, a Sage appeared and told the people that at the Ice Dragons\u2019 Temple, to the distant north, was a sword blessed by the deities. With that sword, the Earth Dragons could be defeated, but it definitely wasn\u2019t an easy task to reach the temple\u2026"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "So Anri, to save his beloved Artemis, left on a journey to obtain the sword?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Yes, that\u2019s right.

But you've certainly grown since last time. I'm glad to see you're well."}, {"speaker": "Tiki", "line": "Yeah... But I was so lonely.

I was ordered, by Gato, to wait here for you. While I was waiting I got more and more angry, wondering why I had to do something so boring. So I thought I\u2019d think of a prank to pull on you. But, my Tiki impression was pretty good wasn\u2019t it? Huh, what\u2019s with the anxious face? Well, shall we get goin'?
