Thanks to the efforts of Prince Marth, the Kingdom of Altea, devastated by war, finally begins to stabilize. The knight Jagen, who succeeded the ill Morodof, became the prince's tactician and helped him rule the country, by his side. Afterwards, Princess Caeda was welcomed to Altea, and her marriage with Prince Marth was announced. The citizens were happy for the pair's fortune and Caeda was passionately welcomed to the country. However... Nearing the day of the wedding, a letter suddenly comes from the imperial palace, containing an imperial order.", "\"Dear Prince Marth of Altea, At the Kingdom of Grust, occupied by Archanea, a huge rebellion has broken out. I request for your country to subdue Grust. Your highness, please send Altea's full army immediately, to quell Grust's rebellion.\" -Emperor Hardin.", "The Kingdom of Archanea is the sovereign state to Altea, and its orders must be followed. The helpless Marth orders the knight Cain to protect his kingdom. And he leaves, along with Jagen and the others, to an expedition to Grust."], "intro": [{"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Jagen, we\u2019ve finally arrived. Is that the rebels\u2019 fortress?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "I just saw the occupation army\u2019s commander, General Lang. You should ask him directly."}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "So you are Lord Marth. Currently the situation is relaxed. We have already subdued most of the rebels. All that remains is this fortress. Since you are here, I will leave the job of defeating the rebels\u2019 leader, General Lorenz, to you."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "What?! General Lorenz leads the rebels?! What would possess him to rebel of all things?!"}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "Who knows? I haven't the foggiest idea, and frankly I don't care. Prince. You are to kill General Lorenz, and reclaim the children of the Grustian royal family that he's hiding. While you do that... We will slaughter the families of those who participated in this rebellion and raze their homes to the ground."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Are you insane?! They're innocent civilians!"}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "\"I-insane\"!? Young man, are you questioning my orders?! Perhaps Altea, too, plans to rebel against Archanea...?"}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Of course not! That's not..."}, {"speaker": "Lang", "line": "Prince Marth, your tiny country means absolutely nothing to me. Your rude behaviour is merely an irritation. Do not forget that I have the power of the empire behind me: I can crush weak, pesky insects like you any time I wish."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "\u2026Jagen, what\u2019s going on? Why has Hardin handed over this country to such a man\u2026?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "General Lang was once a noble of Archanea. However, in the previous war, he supported the Dolhrian Empire. I heard that he stole from other people, to add to his own wealth. I fear he has continued his ways at Grust, and caused suffering to its people. So General Lorenz\u2019s rebellion is completely understandable."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "Jagen! How can you say things so casually? If we don\u2019t inform Hardin of the truth, more innocent people will be killed."}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Your highness, I understand your feelings. However, Lorenz\u2019s rebellion is a fact. First, we must see how we can help him. Basically we should listen to what the citizens have to say, so we can affirm what has happened to this country. Then your highness can talk to General Lorenz personally."}, {"speaker": "Marth", "line": "But the rebels don\u2019t know that we\u2019re from Altea. Can we reach the fortress safely?"}, {"speaker": "Jagen", "line": "Don\u2019t worry. Most of the rebels have already fled. All that remains is Lorenz, and the children in the fortress. Blocking our path are only bandits, who have taken advantage of the confusion to raid villages. They are no problem for us. You can order Alen to defeat them in one blow if you want. However, your highness, we have some fresh recruits in our army that could use some fighting experience. To them, bandits are relatively strong foes. So be careful not to push them too much. If possible, I would have liked to fight as well, but my body is not what it used to be. I will stay by your highness\u2019s side, as your tactician. Well, your highness, we should go!"}], "visit": [{"speaker": "Villager", "line": "After the last war, Princess Nyna let this country keep its sovereignty under the rule of General Lorenz. However, as soon as Hardin became emperor, General Lorenz was banished and Lang's troops came crawling in. Lang stole everything from us. He stole our gold, of course, but he even stole our food and our loved ones... Ah... If only General Camus were here! Then we wouldn't have to live in fear of people like Lang!"}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "There aren't any young girls left in this country. They were all taken away by the imperial troops. They say General Lang keeps the really pretty ones to himself. What a dark, insane chapter in Grust's history..."}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "The late King Grust had two children. Princess Yuliya and Prince Jubelo. They're still young. Maybe thirteen, or fourteen; cute little twins, both of them. In the last war, Gharnef, the Dark Pontifex, kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king. They were taken to Khadein, the city of magic, and locked away in a pitch-black room. At great personal risk, Pontifex Wendell saved them. He took them to a monastery to protect them."}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "General Lorenz took the royal children from Lord Wendell and raised them in Grust. The empire demanded their extradition, but Lorenz was afraid they would be killed, and hid them. The empire branded Lorenz a traitor, and sent General Lang here. Lang did horrible things to find the royal children. That's why we rose up. But, we lost. And now Lang is going to kill everyone in this entire country!"}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "I heard that General Lorenz lived in Talys when he was young. Talys wasn't unified at the time, so there were a number of noble houses contending for control. Lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch of one house, and together they unified Talys into one country. Lorenz and that patriarch--now the king of Talys--remain close friends to this day."}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "I only saw him briefly, but that knight, Arran, looked awfully pale. You know, he's probably hit the wall, so to speak. I doubt he'll get any stronger, no matter how much he fights..."}], "recruit-visit": [{"speaker": "Villager", "line": "Oh...

You're... Are you really ten?"}, {"speaker": "Marisha", "line": "No... I'm a grown woman, but Granny lied so that I wouldn't be taken away by the soldiers. Lang's soldiers are all monstrous. But you're different. You have very sweet eyes. Please, take me with you. I want you to take me away from this country, and take me to yours."}, {"speaker": "Villager", "line": "It's not safe for her to stay here. Please take her with you, and protect her. You can marry her, too, if you like. Marisha is a beautiful, good-natured lady, just like me! I'm sure she'll make a fine wife."}, {"speaker": "Marisha", "line": "No-no-no!
