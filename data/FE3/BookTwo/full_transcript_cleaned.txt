a stone bridge leading up the tall rocky mountain this stone bridge seems to stretch to the heavens as it spirals around from the rocks fearful roaring and breathing sounds can be heard as if the mountain was alive the dragons table  it is asn ancient ruin of the dragon tribe and the place where the divine dragon king naga sealed away the earth dragons now after a period of 600 years the earth dragons are currently awakening and countless evil demons are being born 
what is this strange air it feels like its full of evil spirits
that is true  my body appears to be frozen these are the evil spirits of the earth dragons your highness it seems we cant have everybody enter ahead since we dont know what will happen please choose carefully who to take with you
i hope to at least take the people who are worried about the four sisters
mmm  theres no avoiding that but how many people will survive i bet this will be a fierce battle
prince marth the altar is probably full of crazed barbarians and mage dragons that have lost their mind they are being controlled by gharnefs magic and will definitely attack you the dark priests that serve gharnef also have fearful power as this battle lengthens it will become fiercer but dont stop and keep charging forwards you must defeat gharnef and recover from him the divine falchion sword that was stolen from altea without the falchion you wont be able to defeat medeus 
your highness the wall in front of us has collapsed
/***EOF***/
marth and the others once again moved out from altea and headed towards the imperial capital of millennium court but along their way they passed through the kingdom of gra a land allied to archanea in the previous war gra sided with the dolhr empire which resulted in their king jiol dying in battle and the destruction of the kingdom the country was once a part of altea but they sided with archanea after listening to hardins orders hardin found king jiols daughter princess sheena and allowed her to ascend the throne and he then ordered reinforcements from gra sheena received wild support from the citizens of gra to them sheena was their only hope the youths all volunteered to become soldiers they were happy to move out and have the chance to defeat their bitter enemy altea but their dreams were shattered in an instant  before the fast approaching altean elites gras soldiers lost all morale and fled for their lives
princess sheena it seems the altean army has arrived
really  its already the end samson i have brought you much trouble i need to watch the final days of my kingdom of gra you may leave now
princess isnt it already enough shouldnt you despise king jiol for forcefully taking your mother isnt that why you hid at millennium court and stayed away from this country right now you are just being tricked by hardin and being used by him
perhaps i heard that the people of gra wished for the restoration of the country and thats why i agreed to help him however hardin is only interested in using us he would just throw us away like rubbish the moment we became useless to him still i will not leave how can i just abandon those fighting for my sake
impossible  how can our fresh recruits resist alteas elites  fine if youre staying i will also stay to the end this could be interesting
samson  why are you doing this arent you mercenaries only interested in being paid with gold i no longer have money to give you 
i dont know why either its just  sometimes men feel like there are things that they must do also i want to see how that kid fights this battle if he truly is a hero perhaps your mind may be changed 
hardin sent troops here to prevent gra from rebelling the archanea soldiers are the only ones that can still fight
princess sheena is the child of king jiols second wife but she is different from the king she is a very kind person the princess is prepared to sacrifice her life for her soldiers is there no way to save her
the soldiers here are all foreigners theres nobody else to protect this country because the knights of this country all died right now the actions of the archanea soldiers are deplorable their just the same as thieves  those lowlifes
ah  please leave me i already have nothing to give you
ah please dont get us wrong we arent here to steal
but didnt you all come here from altea for revenge
no we dont want to fight gra because gra and altea were originally like one family
is that true  then i will give my most important treasure  to  you
you  you dare treat my citizens like that  die
forgive me citizens of gra
prince marth  i thought you were a noble person but youre just a murderer  you disappoint me
sheena 
you are princess sheena its great to see you safe i dont view gra as an enemy gra and my country were originally one country the country may have divided after anris death but we always got on well as allies but in the previous war i felt deeply regretful about things turning out the way they did princess sheena please allow us to be friends once again i dont want to fight gra
prince marth  once i heard that you didnt attack my fleeing soldiers i was really surprised you truly are the second coming of king anri i trust you please  treat the citizens of gra  as if they were your citizens i will hand my whole country to your care  prince marth
thats great sheena now i can finally leave without worry
samson  can you not leave 
you dont need me anymore from now on prince marth will protect you
dont leave i dont want you to leave 
huh what why keep me it doesnt seem like you  fine if you say you need me i wont go anywhere else i will protect you wherever you may go is that fine with you
yes 
lord marth if this battle continues it will become meaningless and will only give more time for hardin
mmm i was thinking the same if we keep heading east more needless blood will be spilt so i have decided a different route for us to go how about we go directly south from menedi and enter millennium court from adria pass
you want the troops to cross that dangerous mountain path its too dangerous 
i am already prepared for danger besides we were able to conquer the dangerous anris way so this should be easy in comparison 
 thats a fair point if we can cross it we can attack the enemy from the rear understood well try that
/***EOF***/
come boy you want to stop me again this time i wont spare you
gharnef give my sister and the others back where have you taken them
hahahaha  those clerics are going to become sacrifices for the resurrection of the shadow dragon they are lost forever soon the earth dragon king medeus will be reborn in his true form and we require the clerics as live sacrifices however their souls shattered because they couldnt stand the pain not even i can help them now thanks to them the shadow dragon will awaken he no longer fears even the power of the binding shield its a shame that everythings already over marth  you will die here
hahahaha  let me show you the might of my imhullu spell 
haha  its already too late  this world is done for  urgh
your highness theres a stairway leading up
/***EOF***/
  isnt that my sister and the others who are they protecting  damn  thats  is that medeus 
wait if the princesses are in the way your highness sword will be unable to strike we must think of something fast otherwise the earth dragons will awaken and then they will be in even more pain
what should i do  how can i save them please tell me jagen
that  not even i know to defeat medeus there is probably no other way except to 
  what you want me to kill them
that is one way the princess cannot suffer any more taking their life is also a way of saving them
jagen are you seriously telling me to make this decision
as leader there are times when you must make painful decisions that is what i meant
jagen thats enough i understand i will not give up there must be some other way until the very end i will not give up
those who oppose  lord medeus  must die 
maria please open your eyes its me minerva be strong

elice great youve finally awakened its alright now im here oh  but marth  and the others are watching  this is embarrassing elice no matter what happens i wont leave your side again  okay
miss lena wake up its me julian what should i do i know im a man with no merits but for you i will do anything i dont have any other wishes i just want to see you smile miss lena smile im begging you miss lena 
oh  julian  you did come i believed that you would definitely come so thats how i could endure the horrors that i faced  julian im sorry i always acted like a spoiled brat to you
no  just hearing miss lenas words is enough for me
julian can you listen to a request of mine
huh oh please ask as long as i can do it 
from now on just call me lena it seems so impersonal when you call me miss lena because were going to return to macedon to live together
huh  miss lena  oh  no  i meant le  na  do you really mean that 
mmm  i believe the deities will forgive me because of my  love for you
ah minerva sister 
ah camus 
ah merric 
ah julian 
i  have resurrected  stupid humans  i will kill you all 
hahaha  its not over yet your naivety  will destroy you  those sisters will be sacrificed  they will become my blood and my flesh  and give me power
gwa  why  why have i  been defeated  so easily   is this  the power  of nagas  binding shield  but  humans dont forget  as long as greed lives on in your hearts  you will lose the shield and i will rise from the earth once again  remember  th is 
marth courageous prince of altea because of your efforts the dark earth dragon medeus has finally been completely destroyed medeuss servants the earth dragons have also vanished into the darkness as long as the binding shield exists they wont awaken anymore marth descendant of anri and the chosen prince of light you have saved mankind and you have saved our dragon tribe 
marth i dont have to go back to the ice dragons temple anymore im so happy i really like everybody i definitely dont want to live all by myself at that lonely place again its really  like a dream im so happy so very happy marth i really like you
really tiki  for how long do you plan on hogging marth honestly marth if you dare to show even the slightest happiness caeda wont forgive you
marisha youre talking nonsense again however marth really does look happy 
he can finally put to rest his heavy burden lord marth has always been carrying such a heavy responsibility it must have been hard on him but caeda has also had it hard there are so many people around marth that finding a chance to even talk to him is difficult you must have been lonely
mmm  it doesnt matter as long as marth is safe i wouldnt wish for anything else i once prayed to the deities since marth had such an important mission i prayed that if they decided his life was to be taken to take my life in his place  that was all i could do
  ah caeda truly cant be beaten but you dont have to wait any longer because lord marth is about to return to your side look caeda marth is looking over there use your courage
marth 
caeda its finally over im sorry for making you suffer
no i couldnt help you one bit  im the one that should be sorry
dont be silly its only because i had caeda that i was able to reach this day things will be more difficult from now onwards the seven kingdoms of archanea are going to be unified and everybody is going to hand responsibility to me but such a task i cannot possibly do by myself caeda i hope you can help me i really need you
i  when i left talys island i already swore an oath no matter where you went i would be by your side no matter what happened i would have faith in you so no matter what hardships there are i can endure them because marth  i lov 
and so the tragic war of heroes finally came to an end the seven kingdoms were unified by prince marth the united kingdom of archanea was established and peace reigned the tales of the heroes were remembered by future generations archaneas hero saga  this is the story of the brave warriors who saved archanea 
/***EOF***/
soon after reclaiming the fane of raman marths army fears pursuit from the archanean army and escapes towards chiasmir bridge however a new enemy attacks the altean army upon reaching the central islet
the archanean army is coming from the north well be surrounded like this
the situation is desperate can marth and his friends overcome the many perils
sire youre safe
sir cain you made it
im truly glad that you came back unharmed cain
yeah somehow i managed to shake off the enemy and escape here but the enemy is already approaching from the north
dont worry we will crush them
no not this time hardin is being protected by a mysterious power we cant lay a finger on him so even if we fight him now we havent a chance of winning please head to the northwestern fortress theres a boat across the river which we can use to escape to the khadein desert
sire the free company to the south will probably make their move soon indeed nows not the time to fight for the time being lets do as cain suggests and make our escape after that well think of something 
i see  i dont like it but we havent a choice  everyone hurry to the northwest fortress
if ya ask me archersll always get along well with archers
oh look if it isnt prince marth long time no see lad it seems so noisy out i wonder whats happened
ah bantu fancy meeting you in a place like this how is tiki
oh she is no longer by my side lord gotoh took her to the ice dragons temple again
the ice dragons temple wheres that ive never heard of such a place 
its in the icy lands far north of here but its no place for humans besides the hero anri no man has been there yet
anri are you perchance referring to the realm of the gods from anris legends
im not at liberty to say anything more if you want to know more you should ask lord gotoh anyhow i have a favor to ask of you my precious firestone was stolen by thieves if you can get it back for me ill show you how it works thank you prince marth
heh heh heh  prince marth its been far too long
hardin  why did you attack our country what would compel you to do such an act i  i cant believe this have you really changed this much
prince i am the ruler of this continent and the emperor of archanea i will show no quarter to anyone who opposes me that includes you prince  i must destroy this foul world  it is beyond salvation traitors playtime is over you will all die here all soldiers attack do not leave a single traitor standing
master please wait
hm  gordin long time no see you seem to have gotten a little sturdier but has your bow arm improved any
yes at the moment i  they call me alteas master of bows its thanks to you master that ive been able to progress this far
and did you come here because you wanted to challenge your old teacher
n no its not like that   i might be asking the impossible but id like you to fight alongside us again sir
  
please master
i pledged allegiance to princess nyna but as for hardin  ive had it with him taking other countries by force executing rebels without reason the archanean army i see now is just a collection of hired thugs theres not even a shred of chivalry left to return the kingdom of archanea to what it was once before  i must take it upon myself to turn my bow against my homeland gordin convey that to prince marth
thank you master
you traitors ill show you the might of mercurius
midia  my love 
you wouldnt have needed to die if you hadnt come so close fools 
what fools 
rebel soldiers  come to die have you ill show you the terror of gradivus
please hurry sire the enemy is closing in on us
but everyone is still fighting i cant just leave them behind
dont worry everyone will escape safely and reunite with you at khadein now sire to the boat

marth followed xane and continued heading directly north there he faced walls of towering mountains  as well as sheer cliffs and deep valleys  then after passing countless mountains  suddenly a scorching heat surrounds everyone magma flowing like rivers and sounds of roaring block their passage this is truly a fearful sight
this place  its incredible  i feel as though im burning up just by standing here
this is flame barrel  the fire dragons graveyard its where the fire dragons whove degenerated into savage beasts come to wait for their death
degenerated you say  what do you mean by that
im not sure if youre aware but the dragon tribe is dyin those who dont confine their true dragon form in a stone eventually lose all reason and become monsters
so thats why they become manaketes xane if you know something about the dragon tribe please tell me
if you really wanna know  tens of thousands of years ago the dragon tribe settled down on this continent and created a civilization they possessed intellect and abilities far exceedin those of humans but suddenly outta nowhere their day of destruction came at first they couldnt bear children then they began to lose their minds goin berserk one after the next the elders warned that the end of dragons as a species was approachin there was no longer any way to prevent it however there was one way they could survive to discard their identities as dragons and live on as humans the dragons fell into a panic those who believed the elders sealed their forms within stones and became humans but those who couldnt throw away their pride as a dragon those who adamantly refused to become human  they eventually lost their minds and became naught but beasts 
those fire dragons before us 
yeah theyre a livin example and its not just them there are many others but theyve all gone feral now theres no way for them to go back  worse still theyve been manipulated and degraded like cattle by the fire clans who rule over this valley well princey whadya say we get out of here the clansmen around here aint friendly if we hang around well end up as bait for their dragon pets
phew and that be the end of the fire dragons valley how you doin princey
im fine  i think xane i believe you said that there were other feral dragon tribes
yeah in addition to this valley theres the wyverns dale the ice dragon shrine and the dragons altar 
the dragons altar
its a dragon graveyard in the mountains of macedon there the earth dragons sleep a long time ago  thousands of years ago in fact  the mighty earth dragons lost their minds and attacked the humans course the humans barely stood a chance most were annihilated and the rest pushed into the desolate corners of the continent and then  the divine dragon naga strongest of them all waged a war for humanity it was a fierce battle but naga emerged victorious in the end and sealed the earth dragons below dolhr in a deep sleep and so that the power of the seal would not wither she created the shield of the five orbs and placed it in the fane of raman
i see  i understand now in other words our guardian deity naga depicted in legend was the divine dragon that saved humanity but then what about the divine sword falchion
naga took pity on you humans with no way of protecting yourselves so she created it from one of her fangs then together with the shield she sealed it in the fane and had the remainin dragon houses watch over humanity she put the newly born tiki to sleep and thus ended her 5000 year life cause of all this gotohs tryin his best to carry out nagas order
wait xane  are you telling me 
yes gotoh is a divine dragon what you thought it was just me
wa wait xane i still dont understand what exactly did you mean
phew my throat is really dry i cant stand the heat anymore marth lets hurry along

marth was unable to reunite with princess minerva and so in order to help ogma and the grustian royal children he decided to visit wendell who was once the childrens guardian

damn  this cant be good  weve been spotted kids weve got no choice were going to have to cut through do not leave my side

well if it isnt castor what brings you to a place like this
ah prince marth erm  actually i need money for medicine for me sick mother but i couldnt find any work in talys so i moved here instead

and just who the hell are you are you in league with the pirates
i am sirius a mere traveler
oh i see im a little bit worked up right now sorry about the mix up

im taking care of them do you know them
no i dont  but i do know that as things stand you wont escape with them as i understand it the altean army should arrive here provided you reach the southern village please allow me to distract the bandits while you make your escape to safety
i see so prince marth is here eh got it thanks ive got to ask though why help a group of complete strangers like us
i want to save the children that is  all
i see  sirius  you said your name was sirius right lets meet again after we both get out of here theres someone i need to take care of  the guy in charge of grusts occupation commander lang i want to avenge a man named lorenz  you  join me  if ive got you on my side then ill be that much stronger

touch me and ill strike you down
how foolish of me 
im sorry  i wasnt thinking gahaha just kidding ill be smashing your pretty head in
i wont  forget this
marth
caeda did something happen why are you here
marth  altea  altea was attacked by the imperial army the archanean league  gra and aurelis ambushed us our forces were annihilated and we lost the castle 
wh what did you say this cant be happening altea is  jagen whats going on
this is terrible beyond words  that which i feared the most has come to pass emperor hardin likely heard langs story and had us branded traitors
i refuse to believe it hardin would never attack altea youre telling me that he believed lang and truly thought that i wished to instigate a rebellion never
no i agree with you sire this attack was too soon it happened far too quickly for an attack of this scale a great number of preparations had to have been in place it is likely  that the grust campaign was a setup as was the situation in macedon its quite simple really they had you leave altea with your elite knights in tow and then proceeded to attack our weakened defenses hardin had this planned right from the start
thats preposterous are you implying that hardin  with no provocation whatsoever  decided to attack his fellow nation are you seriously suggesting this was all an elaborate trap no i wont accept it  hardin  why
sire  princess caeda what of the others is princess elice safe
elice she  she gave herself up in order to let me escape with this message marth  im so sorry she wanted me to warn you no matter what  sniff 
caeda  dont cry i understand just knowing youre safe makes me happy i should be the one apologizing i shouldnt have left  you neednt have to go through this we will take back altea even if we have to fight hardin we will reclaim our homeland

once upon a time the region of macedon was a territory under dolhrian rule a century ago the dragonkin rulers sent many slaves to these wild forests to excavate ruins and build a country many slaves were forced to work to their limits barely fed and then slaughtered
a young man stood up against such tragic conditions iote was his name he and his companions fled to the forests and fought astride wyverns to free the slaves after dolhrs demise the slaves established their own country in these now abundant lands and the hero iote was chosen as their first king and so was born the kingdom of macedon later feared as the domain of dracoknights
however the might macedon was stripped of prince michalis said to be the second coming of iote and is now on the brink of losing princess minerva the so called red dragon
julian good news catria finally brought the altean army for us were going to join their ranks to help save princess minerva please take lena and escape to safety quickly
no can do palla lenas disappeared  im not leaving by myself
what lena as well  princess maria is missing too why is it only clerics 
anyway im staying in the village to see if i cant find any information sorry palla give my best to prince marth
this is just between you and me but i heard that armory is in league with the rebels if youre going to enter you should be careful not to get jumped
i wonder whats going to happen to macedon they say that prince michalis is dead and princess maria is nowhere to be found  on top of that they say that princess minerva has been captured and that her life is in peril i just hope  that this country doesnt end up like grust 
you know a little while ago a paladin came here said he was on a journey he was wearing a mask but im sure that underneath he was a good person he was kind yet wrapped in a veil of sorrow i wonder if ill ever see him again 
the pegasus knight trio must be lonely without est and i was such a fan of their triangle attack too  oh est  come home already will ya
have you noticed the large drawbridge behind this village normally its separated by the river but if you use this key here you can cross the bridge just once you cross the drawbridge the enemies on the other side will come and attack you at once if you want to advance safely you might be better off taking the long detour that goes right around the mountain here take the key no matter which path you take do take care of yourself mkay
hey prince its been a while hasnt it its me julian
julian id heard that youd gone to macedon with lena but to think wed cross paths here  how is lena of course shes with you right
well er how should i say this  lena suddenly up and vanished  i  i dont know what to do
wait julian tell me what happened in detail
lenas been missing since last night the villagers speak of some sort of strange priest prowling around lately it seems that somehow lena was taken by this man
a priest  julian as it turns out princess maria has gone missing as well i have a terrible feeling about this anyway staying here wont solve anything come with us im worried for lena too well all help to look for her
prince marth  thank you nothing would please me more
hey cut it out why must you always insist on pointing your sword at us i pity lena for having to put up with your stupidity
oh its you julian are you still trying to worm your way into lenas good books no way i wont hand my cute lil sister to a thieving rat like you
you can relax  lena and i would never work out but even if its just a little i wanted to help her in any way i could
ooh you finally realized where you stand attaboy julian
er thats not the kind of thing i want to be hearing from you  well whatever if youre worried about lena then come with me
oh alright thanks you see they forced me to join the rebel army but you know i hate fighting alright lil brother lets join forces and look for our cute lil lena
lena  where are you what i would give to hear your voice just once before i die 
lena  f forgive  your foolish big brother 
d damn it  why is the altean army here  youre all going down with me die
the altean knights  as i expected 
sire the rebels have fled the castle but i regret to inform you that princess minerva was nowhere to be found
what could have happened she was supposed to be held inside the castle 
oh hoh i knew this task was unworthy excellent work prince marth well take care of macedon from here now let us discuss your next mission
general lang what in the world do you want this time
well you see  my castle was attacked and the grustian prince and princess were kidnapped the perpatrator fled to macedon it seems prince marth you are to capture him and return the children to me
youre asking me to send those children to their doom
youre in no position to defy me now off to work you go my prince
you  your rudeness towards my liege has gone too far  shut up prince marth is not your minion
what did you say know your place altean soldier marth it seems that your countrymen are devoid of manners
 i apologize on hisher behalf but it is as kris says general lang i will no longer follow your orders from here
sire 
what do you mean to defy my orders i see  i see as i suspected it was your doing the person who kidnapped grusts prince and princess was the mercenary ogma on your orders no less
i didnt know of this but if i had the choice i would have done exactly as you suggested back at grust even though they were meant to be our enemies i should have helped those children
you you clearly speak words of treason perhaps i should report this to the emperor
do as you will but youre not the only person who intends to visit the palace i will speak to emperor hardin and princess nyna and inform them of your crimes forgive me jagen but i cannot stand for this any longer
i understand you have endured well until now lang my liege might forgive your frequent rudeness to him but i will not come draw your sword even though i jagen am old and senile i will not lose to the likes of you
wh  what did you say damn you  ill remember this once the emperor gets wind of this ill crush your puny little altea
jagen  youre a bag of surprises to think youd stand up against lang like that
sire are you underestimating me in my old age bwahaha  im not about to let youngsters like kris hog all the glory just yet still ill admit it was somewhat foolish to contest with lang even if he did push my lord at every turn
sire sir jagen what is our next plan of action
according to lang ogma is on his way to macedon he probably intends to visit the village where lord wendell resides
understood but i worry about lang  i pray that nothing bad shall happen

it is the second month of the third year in the history of the empire  archaneas holy city of pales is in the midst of a time of mysterious silence archanea because of a civil war begun by the paladin midia has arrested many capable knights however archanea still has twice the military power of altea to fill the streets of pales with it has already been nearly a whole year since the expedition to grust and now at long last the final battle which would decide the fate of both countries was about to begin 
i should have expected no less from archanea they have such a powerful army we wont be able to get close so easily
hardin is gambling everything on this one battle and he appears to have gathered the entire army of archanea here but any knights with a conscience already joined the coup and have nearly all been executed all that remains are just weak mercenaries so you dont need to fear them right now many people hearts have already swayed from hardin and the citizens welcome us as their liberation army this should give us confidence like no other anyway this is the last battle although it might take time please take care while advancing
i understand lets go jagen i am worried about midia
emperor hardin was once a kind man but he suddenly changed into such a frightening emperor  ah  if i say things like this i will get killed as well
midia is the pride of archanea she was the daughter of th highest officer of archanea duke owen this rebellion only came about because she could not stand and watch us suffer no matter what you must rescue her
we thought that nyna and hardins marriage would finally bring peace to the world yet this happened oh deities  what should we do 
midia is really pitiful she only just retired as a knight to live together with astram and now she has been separated again shes still a young girl its so sad what can you do to help her 
the archanea army has changed the troops are all bloodthirsty savages now what is going on with this country
oh this is so sad those that opposed emperor hardin have all been killed  could the emperor be possessed by a demon 
prince marth i am roshea of the aruelis knights i have king aureliss permission to come here and am awaiting your highness orders i am truly sorry for the battle at the pass to apologize to you i will join and fight alongside your army marth please watch over me
what  our archanea has been defeated but as long as im here i wont let you enter the castle
glory to the emperor 
oh lord marth ive been waiting for you
boah youve suffered a grave wound  what happened
mmm  it was truly frightening  i suppose the archanea royal family is indeed under a curse you should know about hardin and nynas marriage two years ago to restore archanea a king was required and only two people were suitable king aureliss younger brother hardin and alteas prince marth you  those were the choices and we pleaded for nyna to make the final decision originally she wanted to wait a while longer but we begged for her to make up her mind immediately in the end she said that choosing prince marth as her husband would hurt princess caeda so she finally decided on hardin
wait a second wasnt that a little harsh on nyna i understand that archanea needed a king but nyna she already 
you are referring to grusts lord camus but that would be unspeakable  unthinkable in fact princess nyna was the sole successor of the royal bloodline of archanea i felt bad as well but for this country we had no other choice however lord hardin was very happy compared to ascending archaneas throne he seemed happier about the fact that nyna chose him for her husband
i also understand hardins feelings he could sacrifice his own life for nyna but did he know about camus if he did i dont believe he would be so happy
mmm  of course we kept that a secret and we also persuaded nyna to hide it as best as she could but lord hardin was a very sensitive man he quickly found out that nynas heart had no place for him he felt very painful  he locked himself in his room and didnt allow anybody to see him taking advantage of his broken heart gharnef appeared he took on the guise of a merchant to approach hardin and showed him the darksphere the distraught hardin was quickly consumed by the orb from that day on he completely changed it was because i was only focused on restoring this country that i committed such a horrendous mistake please forgive me prince marth 
i cant believe all that happened   where is nyna now
when hardin discovered that she had taken the fire emblem he had her confined in her room after that she would still communicate in secret with me however hardin found out and then wounded me he also handed nyna over to gharnef
gharnef 
mmm  gharnef had always wanted to take nyna he said that the resurrection of the dark dragon required the blood of noble clerics  and so  he took nyna  to use her as a live sacrifice  lord marth im already done for i will give my thoron and physic to you i beg of you please rescue nyna even if archanea is destroyed it no longer matters  i only wish for nyna to be safe

seeking the lightsphere marth and his friends headed for the tower of thabes
thabes is an ancient city buried under the sands along with many treasures the legend of thabes city of illusion lured many adventurous men to the desert however in the end  not one of them ever returned as the sages once said  stay clear of mamorthod the desert of death there lies the cursed dark city
jagen where in the world are we 
this is the path depicted in the anri saga the first obstacle in anris way the desert of death with its scorching sun raging sandstorm savage clansmen of the sands and wyverns that soar and dominate the skies as the city of illusion shimmers in the distance we can only stand and gaze  or so the legend has it
so anri came through here as well and by himself too 
thats right king anri began his travels here to obtain the divine sword falchion and that was so that he could rescue princess artemis  although it will be long i would like to describe the legend of anri 100 years ago  the ruler of this continent the holy kingdom of archanea was destroyed by the dragon tribehumans were enslaved and lived each day in despair some people wielded weapons to fight back but they couldnt defeat the dragon tribe and many people died also the humans only hope the archanean royal family was wiped out and so the world lost all hope however at that time at a small city called altea it was discovered that the princess of archanea was hiding there the angered dolhr empire sent soldiers to altea aiming to capture the princess that princess  artemis was prepared to give up her own life to save the citizens however the citizens of altea swore that even if they were completely annihilated they would protect the princess knowing that the princess was still alive the citizens of pales gathered a liberation army and continued the fight against the dolhr empire the leader of the liberation army duke cartas fought with the royal shield given to him by artemis as a result he received enormous support thanks to his efforts the war finally began to become in their favour but then the king of the earth dragons medeus finally moved out the dark breath of earth dragons possessed horrendous destructive power and had the effect of halving the enemys strength under such a dire situation it was thought that alteas resistance wasnt going to hold out then at that time a sage appeared and told the people that at the ice dragons temple to the distant north was a sword blessed by the deities with that sword the earth dragons could be defeated but it definitely wasnt an easy task to reach the temple 
so anri to save his beloved artemis left on a journey to obtain the sword
yes thats right but i think thats enough for today we still have a long road ahead of us 
mar mar its been aaages its me tiki ive wanted to see you for so long
huh  tiki you came to welcome us oh i see  youve been living with lord gotoh havent you but youve certainly grown since last time im glad to see youre well

sire weve driven away the thieves but the temple was completely ransacked anything that wasnt nailed down is gone
really even raman temple has been reduced to ruins this is a frightful age were in
yes im sure even guardian deity naga would be furious tis truly the end of civilzation
jagen do you know the legend of naga
yes only vaguely however its said that a thousand years ago  when there was not one king in the lands people lived in small villages one day terrible monsters descended and the humans were massacred pushed to the brink of extinction the few who survived prayed to the gods for salvation the gods heard their prayers and a gigantic warrior was sent down to earth the warrior carried a gleaming blade of light in his right hand and in his left hand a shield embedded with five orbs then after a fierce battle he eradicated the monsters and returned to the heavens he was our guardian deity naga and this temple is dedicated to him he was the avatar of the gods our guardian deity  your highness you should know that line from the first chapter of the raman bible
with the blade of light and the five orbs  that is the legend of naga 
well then sire we have to cross the chiasmir bridge soon we must hurry if the enemy takes it getting across will be nigh impossible
alright then inform the whole army we cross chiasmir bridge at once make sure no one falls behind

saint archanea is the largest country on the continent its golden capital of millennium court has bathed in 600 years of proud history under the attack of alteas allied army it fell in just one day the citizens of archanea welcomed them as liberators and supported them to their fullest they also mentioned of their hatred towards hardin and his personal guards everybody now calls hardin the dark emperor this was in hatred of hardin the murderer of countless people if possible fighting would be avoided but it as already reached this stage  marth ra

midia even you betrayed me archaneas paladins have lost their touch
you fool dont you see it what youre doing isnt normal where did you take nyna to bring her back to us now
nyna that woman betrayed me i just wanted to destroy grust and she had to go and give the emblem to that boy  those who betray me must die midia youre no exception
if you want to take my life go ahead but hardin  do you know how much suffering youve caused because of your stupid jealousy just open your eyes and see
stupid jealousy  haha  you can say what you like this world is corrupt and full of annoying people is this kind of world even worth anything it would be far better for it to be destroyed midia you shall watch here  as prince marth dies by hand
marth  as a servant of the empire you dared to invade millennium court i am disappointed in you so alteas prince of light is just a lowlife
hardin your are being controlled by the darksphere and have lost your just heart please you must return to normal
hahaha  you are so naive marth i attacked altea solely because of my hatred of you in the previous war it was only because you were the descendant of anri that nyna gave the emblem to you and chose you to become the leader of the alliance prince of light  what nonsense if you hadnt received my support you would have died long ago so dont act all big marth from that day on i hated you i kept silent for nyna but i knew i would have to deal with you eventually this has nothing to do with the orb

your highness i apologize for interrupting you but gotoh has come
huh gotoh please call him here
marth you have done well you have all five orbs in your possession because of your efforts the lost binding shield has finally been restored
yes the five orbs have attached onto the royal shield  so this is the binding shield but gotoh what should i do next after seeing gharnefs expression it seems he really has taken my sister and the others i cant just leave them
mmm  i understand your feelings  but you must first restore the seal on the earth dragons those beasts will soon awaken from their slumber when they appear from the ground they will burn everything and create hell on earth go marth send the awakened earth dragons back into the darkness of the seal
marth its finally over now the world is safe look the princesses are over there

this truly is an unimaginably treacherous journey 5000 meters  no higher than that looking down a sea of clouds can be seen they have reached the summit of the cold mountain peak breathing is difficult  dizziness is felt  their vitality is fast approaching its limits
xane weve already climbed this high its so cold  even breathing is hard
were almost there look can you see over there thats the ice dragons temple where gotoh is
but that was quite a shock tiki is actually the daughter of the divine dragon king also both gotoh and you are divine dragons
ah  when the divine dragons fought the earth dragons they over exhausted their dragonstones and so practically became extinct aside from naga only gotoh me and the just born tiki survived however after the war we discarded our dragonstones so we could no longer become dragons again even so i still have knowledge and power that exceeds that of humans gotoh followed nagas orders to protect humans but thats got nothing to do with me i dont like humans they scorned the manaketes even though they had lost their power and treated them like filth i can fully understand why medeus and the others hated humans so much the earth dragon king medeus tricked his own tribe and became a manakete by himself he used to follow nagas orders and guarded the dragons altar however the once docile humans finally achieved power and became aggressive they even started to attack the manaketes that lived in peace the manaketes were angered by the betrayal of humans and gathered at the dolhr region they formed their own kingdom of manaketes and began a war to conquer the humans to save the humans gotoh handed the falchion to anri and he created an academy of magic at khadein but whoever won wasnt any of my concern
then why are you helping me im also a human 
youre different from the others you dont seem like an unreliable person either 
mmm  thank you xane
dont  dont be silly ill get embarrassed anyway lets head to the temple but be careful of the ice dragons although theyre also wild dragons they will instinctively try to protect their temple poor guys 
hey xane gotoh didnt really mention anyting about the five orbs but i thought they were very important do you know anything about them
gotoh was afraid of shocking you so he didnt say anything i will tell you however after ive told you youll probably think it was better off not knowing the orbs rest on the shield that seals the earth dragons  basically they are part of the shield of seals since ancient times the divine dragons have passed down these sacred jewels each possessing different powers to put it simply the shield is just a pedastal and the five orbs are what creates the power of the seal so if any one of the orbs is lost the seal will weaken
hmm is that so but how come the orbs were scattered
because the shield was broken the shield of seals was displayed at the fane of raman and it was stolen by somebody who ended up breaking it 
when did that happen
around 600 years ago to recover the shield gotoh spend many years searching the lands in the end he only found the five orbs with the shield nowhere to be seen not only that but the five orbs which he painfully collected were scattered again after raman was attacked in the previous war
really  so that was why gotoh was looking for the lost jewels  the orbs
yep the starsphere lightsphere and geosphere  as well as the darksphere and lifesphere the lightsphere is in gotohs possession that starsphere was shattered and the darksphere was given to hardin by gharnef
the geosphere is in altea and all that remains is the lifesphere
ah  anyway lets enter the temple from now on i will also help you fight well lets go

khadein is an independent city state taking orders from no foreign nation the archmage has many pontifices under him governing according to their counsel in the previous war pontifex gharnef allied with dolhr and dragged khadein into war and the city suffered great damage as result as khadein had lost all its pontifices wendell became its archmage and started rebuilding the city however wendell left on a journey to fulfill a mission given to him by gotoh he then left khadein in the care of two young men they were two skilled and promising young mages  merric and arlen
merric its time to put an end to this
wait arlen why do we have to fight we were both master wendells pupils were friends are we not why do you despise me so
i was master wendells disciple before you and i was the stronger one even so master wendell gave you excalibur he should have given it to me clearly i was the only one worthy to be his successor yet he 
but i have no intention of succeeding master wendell i hold no ill feelings for khadein but once i finish studying i plan to go home back in altea there is somebody i must protect for the rest of my life  so arlen please why dont you join us so we can take back altea
altea you say why should we help a country that rebelled against the empire and attempted to invade their fair nation the mage corps of khadein have sworn allegiance to emperor hardin oh i see  i knew it was you  you dragged the altean army here
no thats not how it is
shut your mouth traitor i wont listen to your lies any longer your excalibur and my thoron well put them to the test
arlen what are you doing
master wendell 
you still dont understand my decision do you indeed as a mage your power surpasses mine but you lack compassion that is why i did not grant you excalibur
  compassion 
i had decided that you were to be my successor when the time came to think you would harbor a grudge towards me  does that not make you the same as gharnef
the same as gharnef  teacher what are you saying
arlen listen to me  gharnef along with pontifex miloah were lord gotohs best pupils but lord gotoh saw gharnefs weakness and so he left khadein and the aura tome to pontifex miloah gharnef overcome by jealousy stole the darksphere from lord gotoh and created the imhullu tome as a result  his heart was trapped within the darksphere for all eternity wrath and envy led him to ruin do you understand now arlen 
 teacher   teacher im so sorry i  i was wrong please  find it in your heart to forgive me
arlen you will use that power of yours for the good of the people understand
marth  do you hear me
lord gotoh yes i can you are speaking to me through magic are you not lord gotoh i must ask what has happened to cause hardin to suddenly change so much
hmm  the darksphere is the culprit  hardins soul is trapped within the darksphere 
the darksphere what on earth is that
light star earth life and darkness  in this world there exist five sacred orbs the darksphere is that which complements the lightsphere in battle it possesses the enemys mind negating their attacks but the darksphere also amplifies wrath and envy and can turn their owner into a demon hardin must have obtained the darksphere from somewhere  and now his heart has been lost to it
but why he should have been happy after his union with beloved princess nyna so why the envy
prince  humans are never simple creatures  in any case the only object that can overcome hardins darksphere is the lightsphere if you want to do something about him then you had best come and get it from me
huh really lord gotoh if we have the lightsphere then we can save hardin
well  if his heart is not completely consumed then perhaps
lord gotoh please lend the lightsphere to me
if you come in person to the ice dragons temple where i reside then you shall have it but that will be no easy task so marth do you have the courage to walk the path that anri walked
yes i do i will go please allow me to go i must have the lightsphere

once there was a war known as the war of shadows an epic battle between prince marths heroes and the dolhrian empire which ended with the defeat of the earth dragon king medeus the warriors who had united under the fire emblem returned to their own lands devoting themselves to the reconstruction of their homelands among the nations that made up the seven kingdoms of archanea gra and grust were devastated altea aurelis macedon and talys were left deeply scarred and even the mighty kingdom of archanea was undergoing restoration
however in the palace still shaken by war one important event took place hardin the younger brother of king aurelis was married to princess nyna becoming the twenty fourth king of house archanea after ascending the throne hardin aggressively restored the country in the twinkling of an eye and formed a powerful army by gathering many soldiers he then proclaimed the restoration of the holy archanean empire and himself emperor
one year has passed since the war with dolhr the world seemed to be moving towards an era of peace however unbeknownst to man the cogs of destiny had started spiraling out of order
/***EOF***/
leaving painful memories behind marth and his companions left grust they landed in macedon their new mission to rescue princess minerva after the war of shadows macedon was led by minerva who exiled the oppressive generals and attempted to reform the military however the influential general rucke opposed minervas peace seeking ways he assembled the exiled officers to instigate a coup detat caught unprepared minerva was captured by ruckes followers and his rebel army seized control of macedon then they dispatched powerful dracoknights to guard the countrys forested borders
prince marth thank goodness youve come to macedon
catria i received word that there was a rebellion in macedon are you unharmed
yes im fine my older sister palla and i managed to escape somehow but princess minerva was captured by the rebels prince marth please  you have to rescue princess minerva at this rate her life will be in danger
of course i will help her catria please take us to where she is
yes my lord but first we have to break through these woods general rumels dragon knight squad is lurking within this area if we approach from the front well be easy pickings for them
i see so youre suggesting we flank them from the left or right thank you catria leave it to us
warrens a bit of an idiot just cause they paid him well he went ahead and joined the rebel army ahh to think a fool like him was once acquainted with the fair catria 
look out for those pilfering thieves if they take off with your precious treasure you wont ever get it back never let them escape from your sight
because of the last war every nation has been forced to lead hard lives the only well off country is archanea ruled by emperor hardin
some dirty thieves took our village treasure the lady sword and ran off with it only women can wield the incredible power of that sword please prise it back from their filthy hands
beware when dracoknights are around even from a far off distance they can move all at once and swoop down on you
warren even a good man like you has sided with the rebel army 
catria the white huh its been a while you know im just a common hunter if they pay me enough ill do anything
warren listen to me princess minerva endeavored to create a country where its people could live at ease she exiled soldiers and generals of ill repute to accomplish that goal but general rucke despite knowing this roused the soldiers into a coup detat cant you see hes just trying to make this country into his own and you can honestly say youre okay with that
 i see well i dont like the military acting as if they owned the place  alright then if youre going to help the princess then so will i
no hard feelings i dont have anything against you but this is the way i live forgive me
damn it  i shouldve seen this coming 
taste the terror of macedons fearless dracoknight squad
general rucke i leave the rest to you 
sire we found someone most unusual confined in one of the fortress rooms
hm  linde how did you wind up in a dangerous place like this
sire do you know this woman
yes this is linde her natural talent for magic helped us a great deal in the last war
prince marth thank heavens what a pleasant surprise meeting you here i desperately needed to see you again so i set out to find you but the macedonian soldiers found me suspicious and they dragged me to this fortress 
is that so im glad youre safe but why were you looking for me shouldnt you be by princess nynas side
i was requested by princess nyna to deliver you this
huh this  this is the fire emblem the royal heirlom of archanea the emblem shield
the fire emblem  i heard that in the last war princess nyna entrusted you with it sire 
indeed i looked after this as archaneas representative in the last war but why give this to me now especially at a time when archanea has so much influence under emperor hardins reign in this peaceful age why is princess nyna giving me the champions proof 
i dont understand either princess nyna didnt explain why just that i had to give it to you  i remember her eyes seemed so sad  i think she may have been crying 
princess nyna crying what on earth has been happening  linde after this battle ends i will go see princess nyna until then i want you to remain with us
yes prince marth
/***EOF***/
marth barely succeeded in escaping disembarking in the desert of khadein he elected to await his subordinates safe arrival
khadein the city of magic is a sanctuary for mages many prospecting mages come here and undergo rigorous training magic relies on containing natures energies in tomes and staves freely manipulating these energies to harness great power a few centuries ago a lone sage founded an academy here teaching magics secrets however instead of bringing happiness magic was soon used as a tool of war and a thing to be traded the sage was disappointed and vanished from the pages of history though there is no confirmation some say that was the archsage gotoh currently advanced magic like aura cannot be made without the orbs power and their use is restricted to a few chosen ones those conditions are set by their creator and they can only be inherited by those who qualify
khadein the city of magic  the proud sanctuary of sorcery
minerva if you wait in this village you will most certainly run into marth i dont like him but he is indeed noble join forces with him
brother what are you going to do now wont you come with me 
i have no intention of doing that i only wish to find maria and bring her home to macedon
youve changed brother  or should i say youve returned to how you used to be as i thought back then you were being controlled by gharnefs dark magic
no no magic could bend my will i wished to crush the arrogant archanea and establish macedonian supremacy over this continent but father without bending his ear to me distanced himself from me and later had me banished
are you saying thats why you murdered father what a fool you were  didnt you realize that was gharnefs plotting all along yes father was strict with you but it was only because he loved you why couldnt you see that
enough minerva do you take me for a fool after i was defeated i wandered the gap between life and death when i had come to in front of me i was maria  her eyes full of tears  praying to the gods while i treated her like a pawn maria she shed tears for me  minerva im going now i have to save maria at least that can be my atonement
michalis 
jagen everybody appears to be safe thats great to see
but your highness what should we do next
hmm  i want to go home to altea but if we cant prevail against hardin then we cant go back what in the world are we supposed to do 
please wait a second i just received some news
 
sire its an emergency i have just come into some new information the khadein mage corps has launched an offensive against us it seems khadein has allied with the empire
what even khadein means to be our enemy  merric what are you 
at this rate it seems we have no choice sire we need to break into the sanctuary but you must be prepared to make sacrifices if we dont hurry archaneas pursuit force will reach our rear and well be trapped
i understand weve no choice everyone lets break into the sanctuary but avoid needless fights if possible
a swordslayer will demonstrate your might against a mercenary or a hero you should definitely get one if you can
from here on north you wont see no more shops if youre going that way you should stock up now
the person commanding khadeins mage corps is a young man named arlen hes not a bad man but he can be a bit uncooperative seems he regards his old rival merric with disdain hmm  i reckon only lord wendell could talk some sense into him
huh princess minerva why are you here
my brother  michalis he helped me
really thats good to hear i was so worried once i heard that prince michalis had taken you but for him to rescue you what in the world happened
maria saved michaliss life shes kind unlike myself  marias kindness was able to touch the heart of even a man like michalis
but isnt that what you wanted thats why you deliberately avoided killing michalis am i wrong princess
hmm  
i can understand no one can sever the ties between family so easily princess please lift your spirits i would like you to fight with us again just like before i would like macedons strength and yours in order to put a stop to hardins designs
i will not forgive intruders upon our holy sanctuary earth show your fury bolganone
arlen  was this really what you wanted 
the atmosphere inside the building seems somewhat strange
indeed something seems to be happening lets go jagen im worried about merric

the surprising truth from xane was a shock to marth tiki was created as the daughter of the divine dragon king naga and slept in the temple because of the kings will the kings fear of tikis power was that of a loving mothers if tiki was to awaken her tremendous power would eventually cause the destruction of the world  that is what the divine dragon king feared however bantu the kings servant became attached to tiki after watching over her for a period of hundreds of years becamesic he awoke her from her sleep and took her away so tiki only had 10 human years worth of memory  that is so sad tiki  marth was too bewildered to think
this is the ice dragons temple anris final destination 
yes it was here that anri obtained the falchion which he used to defeat medeus with then encouraged by the citizens of altea he became their first king
but in the end he wasnt able to be with artemis  why werent they loving together
the nobles of archanea didnt want anri a former peasant to become their own king instead they encouraged the princess to marry the leader of the liberation army duke caldas princess artemis was unable to refuse the bearer of the fire emblem must give their life to the royal family that is a saying passed down unflinchingly by the archanea royal family the princess didnt tell anri anything and accepted caldass engagement
how could she  that was unfair to anri
what was worse was that the princess died immediately after giving birth to her newborn prince also king anri never married in his life the kingdom of altea was succeeded by his younger brother king marcelus  that is to say your highnesss great grandfather
such a tragic tale  so that was artemiss fate all because of the curse of the fire emblem 
marth you must stand in front of this wall only then will the door open
prince marth you finally came i should have expected nothing less from the one who possesses the heroic bloodline of anri to reward your courage i will hand the lightsphere to you with this the darksphere will lose its power and it will no longer be impossible to fight hardin also about the starsphere shards 
what you found all the shards thank you then the starsphere can be restored please wait a moment 
marth this is the starsphere you can take this with you as well
huh gotoh why are you giving such an important item to me
the only person that can restore the shield of seals is you  the shield itself has chosen you
 
you still dont understand the emblem shield youre carrying is the stolen shield of seals to be honest it was only recently that i noticed its exterior had completely changed  after stealing it from the fane of raman the thief removed its jewels and sold them off as treasures the money was used to fund an army which along with three stolen weapons was used to conquer the world the thief that went on to become the king of archanea had the shield which brought him such good fortune it became the emblem of his royal family now do you understand marth it is what you are carrying archaneas fire emblem
 what   the first king of archanea was originally a thief is that true  in that case i can kind of understand the curse of the fire emblem  then gotoh  if i can collect all five orbs can i restore the shield of seals
mmm  but please hurry up the shield has already been broken for 600 years  it is almost time for the earth dragons sealed underneath macedon to awaken from their slumber those evil earth dragons number several hundreds  no several thousands once they awaken there will be nothing that we can do  i will leave tiki in your care you can find her in the room to the right that divine dragon child should be able to help you battle the earth dragons but i will state clearly if the shield of seals is not restored tiki will be destroyed
huh  why is that 
that child is still developing without the shield of seals she will begin to degenerate eventually she will become wild and attack humans i made her sleep because i felt sad for her but if the shield of seals is restored i will no longer have to worry because the shield will protect tiki marth please take care of tiki you must rescue that child from the path of ruin
is that so you couldnt find them all  theres nothing you can do about it  please hand your collected shards to me tiki is sleeping in the room to the right but since the shield isnt restored i cant let you see her that child is still developing without the shield of seals she will begin to degenerate eventually she will become wild and attack humans i cannot allow tiki to awaken again it is for her own good  marth once youve obtained all the treasures head to the room to the left i will be waiting for you 
tiki are you alright 
uh 
tiki its me marth hey open your eyes
 marth    oh marth you came you came to see tiki
yes i hadnt seen tiki in a long time are you feeling well
uh  no the bishop told me that i had to sleep again but i dont want to  because when i sleep im always alone during my sleep i dreamt many nightmares there i became a wild dragon like those poor fire dragons and ice dragons i attacked humans and i killed them no  no  when i awoke i was all alone in the dark room  i felt so strange but also very scared  so very scared  but i couldnt leave that room i cried many times and then uncle bantu would come to comfort me as usual one day he took me away and took me to a human village living in that village was very fun and everybody treated me well  in the short time until i was discovered by gharnef i felt really happy i dont want to sleep anymore  i feel that if i close my eyes once more i will be unable to open them ever again i dont want that i want to live with everyone i dont want to sleep again
tiki its alright now i will protect you so dont cry 
really  i wont need to see those scary dreams again
thats right once the shield is restored tiki can live together with the rest of us dont worry believe in me
ah im so happy thank you marth
is that so  so tiki was that happy it must have been hard for her living like that although it was to protect that child i did many bad things she must hate me  marth you may leave i will use my magic to send you to altea instantly
gotoh arent you coming along with us
oh  i have something to investigate right now you see gharnef has already began to act
gharnef  but isnt he dead
yes his body was destroyed but his vile spirit lives on in the darksphere he has also awakened the evil priests that served him and they appear to be planning something terrible
really  i see gotoh well well move out then
mmm  once i find anything i will contact you immediately good luck marth verything is in your hands please rescue dragons and humans from the path to ruin
marth you may leave i will use my magic to send you to altea instantly
gotoh arent you coming along with us
oh  i have something to investigate right now you see gharnef has already began to act
gharnef  but isnt he dead
yes his body was destroyed but his vile spirit lives on in the dark orb he has also awakened the evil priests that served him and they appear to be planning something terrible
really  i see gotoh well well move out then
mmm  once i find anything i will contact you immediately good luck marth everything is in your hands please rescue dragons and humans from the path to ruin
/***EOF***/
under the guidance of archsage gotoh marth and the others headed to macedons north to the wyverns dale it is an undeveloped region populated with wyverns and ruled by barbarians but there is no time to stop because the fate of the world is in marths hands
jagen where is this is this macedon or dolhr
were right at the countries border this is where macedons wyverns are born however these lands are ruled by savage barbarians even macedons soldiers are afraid to enter here
so this is the wyverns dale  anyway jagen we need to hurry i feel like something is going to happen to my sister and the others i have a bad feeling
on the other side of the mountains is a small hill called the dragons table recently there have been eerie roaring sounds coming from there grandfather and the others are afraid a demon is about to awaken you mustnt get to close to that place
this is the wyverns dale dont go any further otherwise i fear youll be burnt to death by the wyverns
prince michalis what are you doing here and youve suffered a grave wound what happened
 marth   i have been waiting  for you 
huh
 take this 
  this is the starlight tome youre giving it to me
thats right  gharnef  only with this spell can he be harmed i managed to take it back from his possession 
gharnef where is he now
the dragons table  ha  i was careless  i could be  defeated by gharnef  marth  good luck  im already finished if minerva is still around  tell her to  in my place  rescue maria 
michalis
your highness  i leave marias fate to you  urgh
so this is the dragons table where the divine dragon naga sealed away the earth dragons  but wasnt medeus the guardian of the atlar 
medeus could not tolerate the humans actions against the manaketes so he gathered the other dragon tribes and formed the dolhr empire to destroy mankind first he was defeated by anri and second by you but earth dragons cant be destroyed easily due to their powerful life force  medeus is now sleeping in the altar
hes going to resurrect again
no even an earth dragon shouldnt wake within a hundred years medeus is now changing his form when he next awakens he will become a fearful shadow dragon  no  could it be  so thats why  why gharnef 
huh what is it gotoh
prince marth i finally understand why the clerics have been taken gharnef plans to use them to resurrect medeus to awaken a dragon requires the life force of females with pure and noble blood gharnef knew about this so he went to capture the clerics mmm  marth we must hurry the clerics are in grave danger medeus  he is going to resurrect once again
/***EOF***/
grust has been liberated
all that remains is olbern keep where general lang remains barricaded lang used his influence to steal belongings daughters and lives from the people of grust was there ever a man as cruel as he is
altean knights charge
heh heh heh  so the alteans have come reinforcements are arriving soon if we can hold out a little longer we can make a pincer attack swordsman navarre when they open that door you make your move there is no need for restraint slice them to pieces
yeah  sure though the knights of altea are hardly worthy enemies
oh ho thats my navarre they say not even ogma of talys is your equal
what ogma n  naturally  a guy like him is no match for me
i see glad to hear it then ill leave this place in your capable hands navarre
navarre please hear me out lend your sword to our case just once more
what who are you ill have no business with women or children  but theres a first for everything  whoa shes smoking what business do you have with me
   y youre not navarre who are you
yikes ive been exposed huh im actually a stingy mercenary known as samuel somehow i keep getting mistaken for this famous navarre swordsman guy i got tired of it after a while so i decided to pose as him and got myself hired but i dont like this general lang guy either if youre alright with it ill lend you my sword
yes  youll do just fine 
navarre  you bastard 
stay away  this evening my killing edge hungers for blood 
do you mean to kill me no matter what hmph very well i knew that wed have to settle our score eventually
wait  stay your blade  im no navarre im just a sham i  its me samuel have you forgotten ogma
samuel samuel the gladiator from knorda
yes i was a slave gladiator at the time and you really helped me out even when everyone was making their escape you stayed behind to distract the guards and ended up caught 
  
i heard everything from my friends how you were dragged out to the square and whipped until you looked like a corpse how by chance the young princess talys tears in her eyes stood up for you and saved you and thats why you swore your blade to talys or rather  to the princess 
enough  say no more no more its in the past now  no more 
 ogma  anyway i want to repay you im following you from now on okay
i pity your soul but i can at least grant you a quick death take this my killing edge
doh i shouldnt have said that i was navarre 
w wait please im sorry  please forgive me  ive only done as the emperor ordered me to i didnt agree with him but i had no choice so  so please s spare my life  ill do anything you say yes  just like this  mwahaha you shouldnt have let your guard down you fool  now die
urgh  impossible  i have been defeated 
lord wendell thank goodness youre unharmed
lang accused me of collaborating with the rebels and had me imprisoned even though i told him that i must fulfill a mission assigned to me by archsage gotoh 
a mission from lord gotoh
thats correct  you have seen the starsphere  the holy orb with the twelve constellations etched on its surface in order to pierce gharnefs shadowy veil lord gotoh created a sacred spell named starlight from that orb
unfortunately the strain on the starsphere was so severe that it shattered into twelve shards which scattered into the sky lord gotoh told me that this world has long been guarded by five orbs of mysterious arcane power and that if even one of them is lost the world will fall into irreparable ruin by any means possible we must gather the twelve star shards and restore the starsphere
is  is this a joke that the world could just end  this is all very hard to take in but arent these the star shards if so we already have a few after we retake altea wed be glad to help you find the remaining shards and orbs
of course  your country was only just invaded by the empire  i understand prince  i too shall fight to restore altea then thinking about it my meeting with you is like a sign from lord gotoh himself in that case i shall surrender myself to fate but please lets stop by the fane of raman we may be able to find some star shards in the ancient temple
understood if its the fane of raman we can go there on our way to altea
/***EOF***/
one year has passed since the war of darkness ended thanks to the efforts of prince marth the kingdom of altea devastated by war finally begins to stabilize the knight jagen who succeeded the ill morodof became the princes tactician and helped him rule the country by his side afterwards princess caeda was welcomed to altea and her marriage with prince marth was announced the citizens were happy for the pairs fortune and caeda was passionately welcomed to the country however  nearing the day of the wedding a letter suddenly comes from the imperial palace containing an imperial order
dear prince marth of altea at the kingdom of grust occupied by archanea a huge rebellion has broken out i request for your country to subdue grust your highness please send alteas full army immediately to quell grusts rebellion  emperor hardin
the kingdom of archanea is the sovereign state to altea and its orders must be followed the helpless marth orders the knight cain to protect his kingdom and he leaves along with jagen and the others to an expedition to grust
jagen weve finally arrived is that the rebels fortress
i just saw the occupation armys commander general lang you should ask him directly
so you are lord marth currently the situation is relaxed we have already subdued most of the rebels all that remains is this fortress since you are here i will leave the job of defeating the rebels leader general lorenz to you
what general lorenz leads the rebels what would possess him to rebel of all things
who knows i havent the foggiest idea and frankly i dont care prince you are to kill general lorenz and reclaim the children of the grustian royal family that hes hiding while you do that  we will slaughter the families of those who participated in this rebellion and raze their homes to the ground
are you insane theyre innocent civilians
i insane young man are you questioning my orders perhaps altea too plans to rebel against archanea 
of course not thats not 
prince marth your tiny country means absolutely nothing to me your rude behaviour is merely an irritation do not forget that i have the power of the empire behind me i can crush weak pesky insects like you any time i wish
 jagen whats going on why has hardin handed over this country to such a man 
general lang was once a noble of archanea however in the previous war he supported the dolhrian empire i heard that he stole from other people to add to his own wealth i fear he has continued his ways at grust and caused suffering to its people so general lorenzs rebellion is completely understandable
jagen how can you say things so casually if we dont inform hardin of the truth more innocent people will be killed
your highness i understand your feelings however lorenzs rebellion is a fact first we must see how we can help him basically we should listen to what the citizens have to say so we can affirm what has happened to this country then your highness can talk to general lorenz personally
but the rebels dont know that were from altea can we reach the fortress safely
dont worry most of the rebels have already fled all that remains is lorenz and the children in the fortress blocking our path are only bandits who have taken advantage of the confusion to raid villages they are no problem for us you can order alen to defeat them in one blow if you want however your highness we have some fresh recruits in our army that could use some fighting experience to them bandits are relatively strong foes so be careful not to push them too much if possible i would have liked to fight as well but my body is not what it used to be i will stay by your highnesss side as your tactician well your highness we should go
after the last war princess nyna let this country keep its sovereignty under the rule of general lorenz however as soon as hardin became emperor general lorenz was banished and langs troops came crawling in lang stole everything from us he stole our gold of course but he even stole our food and our loved ones  ah  if only general camus were here then we wouldnt have to live in fear of people like lang
there arent any young girls left in this country they were all taken away by the imperial troops they say general lang keeps the really pretty ones to himself what a dark insane chapter in grusts history 
the late king grust had two children princess yuliya and prince jubelo theyre still young maybe thirteen or fourteen cute little twins both of them in the last war gharnef the dark pontifex kidnapped the twins to blackmail the king they were taken to khadein the city of magic and locked away in a pitch black room at great personal risk pontifex wendell saved them he took them to a monastery to protect them
general lorenz took the royal children from lord wendell and raised them in grust the empire demanded their extradition but lorenz was afraid they would be killed and hid them the empire branded lorenz a traitor and sent general lang here lang did horrible things to find the royal children thats why we rose up but we lost and now lang is going to kill everyone in this entire country
i heard that general lorenz lived in talys when he was young talys wasnt unified at the time so there were a number of noble houses contending for control lorenz lent his power to the young patriarch of one house and together they unified talys into one country lorenz and that patriarch  now the king of talys  remain close friends to this day
i only saw him briefly but that knight arran looked awfully pale you know hes probably hit the wall so to speak i doubt hell get any stronger no matter how much he fights 
oh  please show mercy to just this child shes only ten years old
maam please calm yourself i am not here to take any children
what  youre not imperial soldiers
no  were not we didnt come to fight if theres anything you need please ask its not much but we can give you food
wait  please take me with you 
huh  youre  are you really ten
no  im a grown woman but granny lied so that i wouldnt be taken away by the soldiers langs soldiers are all monstrous but youre different you have very sweet eyes please take me with you i want you to take me away from this country and take me to yours
its not safe for her to stay here please take her with you and protect her you can marry her too if you like marisha is a beautiful good natured lady just like me im sure shell make a fine wife
no no no granny its far too early for that now youve made marisha all flustered
oh a battle is it were in luck boys lets loot em villages before ey realize whats hit em
alright that will do for now  sir ogma please forgive me for getting you involved in this mess
i am here on king talyss orders as such i will do everything in my power to help
i see  then i have a favor to ask of you i want you to escort these children to macedon these children  prince jubelo and princess yuliya are king grusts orphans please take them safely to lord wendell in macedon
understood  i will guard these two with my life
thank you sir ogma  now prince jubelo princess yuliya you will be leaving with sir ogma
no im not going i wont leave you behind
princess  i cannot go with this wound i can barely even walk it saddens me but you two must go on without me
you took that grievous wound to protect us  how can you tell us to just leave you behind now i will never leave we will never leave your side lorenz
what shall i do general
hmm  this is most troublesome princess yuliya is not one to change her mind easily  we will remain here
in that case i will find some other way to help you i will find lang and bring him down  i will bury him with this sword i swear on it general lorenz you must hold out until then 
prince marth so it is you  how unfortunate that i must fight  the altean army and its prince 
please wait i do not wish to fight with you i heard about everything from the villagers ive heard of all the atrocities archanea has committed i promise i will inform emperor hardin of the truth and rescue grust so please lower your weapons
prince  i am grateful for the offer but i am afraid that i cannot comply prince you know nothing do you think that a man of emperor hardins caliber would make a general out of a man as worthless as lang without good reason he called for an invasion to crush the kingdom of grust and make it a territory of the empire
no it cant be hardin would never do something like that
i know its hard to believe but im afraid that ever since he became emperor he has changed a great deal he is no longer the hardin you once knew prince i have one final request of you in this stronghold i am protecting the young prince and princess of grust please find a way to help them if you can do just that i will have no regrets
what  general lorenz what are you saying 
prince marth  my life in exchange for theirs  by any means necessary please help them  this is the last thing i will ask
general lorenz   this cant be happening  
what youre  the altean army so even altea has turned on us 
forgive me people of grust 
prince marth  general lorenz entrusted everything to you you spared his life and even heard him out we the people of grust thank you please let me offer you a token of our gratitude here were protecting prince jubelo and princess yuliya in this stronghold i beg you do what you must to protect our last fragments of hope 
you youre  grusts royal heirs  prince jubelo and princess yuliya
sniff  lorenz  hes gone  how can we live on without him
you monsters stay away youre going to murder us just like you murdered lorenz
no you have it all wrong we just 
ah  prince marth you finally caught these filthy traitors
general lang wait please these children have done nothing wrong allow me to take custody of them
dont make me laugh these brats are coming with me to my castle besides my dear prince you have other more important priorities i have received reports that there has been a military revolt in macedon and princess minerva has been imprisoned
what  how could that happen to macedon i understand my obligations general lang still these children  let them stay with me please
prince do not try my patience listen up you two youre coming with me
no let me go jubelo  help me
yuliya  yuliya 
wait lang release them at once
sire give me the order and ill get them safely back at once
sire dont do it you too kris if we oppose lang right here right now we run the risk of being branded traitors by archanea
but jagen are you telling me to simply allow lang to take them i cannot stand for that 
i understand how you feel sire  but please remain patient for a little longer if we head to macedon  then rescue princess minerva macedon will surely lend us its strength

to avoid needless battle the altean army decided to cross the central mountain range said to be impassable for a large army going through adria pass one will soon reach the city of pales hurry we cant let the enemy spot us we must charge straight through marth and the others were anxious but they carried on advancing across the narrow mountain road but they didnt expect in the middle of the cliff to be ambushed by an unfathomable enemy they were the northern kingdom of aurelis elite squad the wolfguard who had headed south to aid archanea
wolf sedgar vyland is this really okay  can we really fight this battle
roshea what are you trying to say look the altean army is marching long the narrow mountain road nows our only chance to defeat them
yes roshea we swore that we could sacrifice our lives for lord hardin lord hardin was the one who freed us plains people from slavery if we dont fight altea now millennium court will fall do you want lord hardin to be defeated by them
thats right prince marth wants to destroy archanea and conquer the world and thats why he joined forces with macedon to crust grust now he even has gra under his rule if we dont do something the whole world will fall under his control
i still dont believe it i cannot believe prince marth would have such ambitions
what are you saying that emperor hardin lied do you think that he would stoop to such a low enough roshea you disappoint me if you want to betray us then go ahead sedgar vyland lets go if were too slow they will pass us
hey wait i wont betray you i understand  ill go
oh prince marth it is good to see you
huh arent you king aurelis what are you doing here
i came here to stop my countrys army also i must apologise to your highness i believed hardins words and followed archanea but i now realize my wrongs archaneas empress nyna secretly sent me a letter saying that hardin isnt normal and is ill  my country will remain neutral and its knights will return to aurelis i hope you wont attack my men anymore
i understand your highness i dont want to fight with you please forgive me for taking so many of your knights lives
oh you really are like what the rumors say my body is frail and i have no children and even hardin my younger brother has completely changed prince marth please protect aurelis in my place i will hand my whole country to you i give this jewel to you as a gift this is a magical jewel containing the divine power of life i spent a lot of gold to buy it from a travelling merchant i believe it will be useful to you dont worry about hardin since he is a knight it is natural for him to die in battle that is his fate well prince marth i will go on ahead i hop you will all be safe 
i am roshea of the aurelis knights i dont want to fight but i cant betray my companions please forgive me 
as long as were here we wont let you get to millennium court if you dont want to die run back to your country
you  why are you invading other countries have you been blinded by ambition
the leader of aurelis knights wolf is here for your head
lord hardin 
jagen it seems weve finally crossed the peak millennium court isnt far from here
yes if we go down from here we will reach the capital of millennium court in an instant also your highness i just received news of an attempted coup in millennium court the knights and civilians who opposed hardins actions rebelled against him it seems their leader was lady midia
what midia  what happened
unfortunately lady midia was defeated and was captured  each day many people are executed it is only a matter of time before lady midia shares the same fate
damn hardin  i cant believe that he would do that alright lets go and rescue midia we must hurry to millennium court and end this once and for all jagen lets go

marth and the others were transported to alteas outskirts by gotohs magic they were ready to begin the battle to reclaim their homeland the commander of archaneas army general eibel had ordered the gra knights to charge to buy time at the same time he prepared many dishonorable tactics and waited for the chance to defeat alteas army in one swift blow before his fond homeland marths battles were about to begin once again we will reclaim our captical of anri we will reclaim our homeland prince marths voice resounded through alteas skies they had travelled a difficult journey but their destination was finally reached
general the missing altean remnants have finally returned
really haha  what good timing we will follow our original plan have gras soldiers move out to lure them and then defeat them in one go
understood but what about him
the paladin abel it doesnt matter if he betrays me if he does you will kill the female hostage he has already retired from the army he wont swear loyalty to the prince again ha ha  how will they avoid fighting abel  this will be very interesting to watch 
in the forts are many enemies dont be careless
oh you  where did you all go to you all went missing for so long that everyone became very worried about you
the kingdom of gra views altea as its enemy but in reality they were forced to fight because of their alliance with archanea
after altea fell elice was taken to an unknown place by a black robed bishop  oh  princess elice  i pray that you are safe and well 
since being ruled by the imperial army our days have been difficultly passed but we all believed that lord marth would definitely come back for us he would rescue us all from our suffering  because our lord marth is the warrior of light chosen by the deities  the starlord
nearby are enemy spies be careful they will come from the forts
the mercenaries protecting the castle are alteas elites it would be great if they could become your allies
oh your highness youve finally come i have been waiting to give this to you however this village and the neighboring village 
mmm i understand but for the sake of everyone you should start to make up with them 
your highness  please forgive me  i dont want to lose est 
est 
abel why are you  i dont believe this youre betraying your homeland
lord marth  please forgive me  they took est  if i didnt fight  they would kill her  but after meeting your highness i can no longer  fight  against altea  est  im sorry please forgive me
abel  im sorry you must have suffered
est youre safe
yes lord marth rescued me im alright now
really  damn archanea  but how should i apologize to lord marth 
im sorry  it was all because of me
no est it was nothing to do with you those fools  i wont forgive them  ill show them how deep my anger is
what being able to defeat my great army are you even human
my archanea army could be defeated 
that was a fierce battle is everybody alright
dont worry they have been awaiting this day for a long time
archaneas actions were too cold hearted they even had innocent citizens killed how can i apologise to the citizens  i only bring trouble to everybody  perhaps im not fit to protect this country
no your highness youre wrong your highness you have a gentle heart so that is why no matter what hardships we can endure them we believe in your highness so that is why we follow you your highness please raise your spirit we still havent reclaimed altea castle there are probably many enemies awaiting us but this is our castle we already know how to fight this battle well lord marth lets go
/***EOF***/
this was a fierce battle like no other but their homeland of altea has been liberated all that remains is the castle  if i could regain altea castle where i was born  everybody thank you  i really must thank you all for placing your trust in me  before marths face flowed shimmering tears  even the girl who gently wiped his tears away couldnt prevent her own tears 
whats going on  even thieves have managed to find their way in could the geosphere have been taken by them
your highness a suspicious thief is escaping towards the north we should send somebody in pursuit before its too late
mmm but we cant use horses or pegasi inside so what should we do 
you foul traitors taste the might of my mercurius
midia 
astram how are you doing
so its the traitor jeorge what do you want with me
wait astram general eibel has already fallen you wont be able to win even if you continue fighting
you want me to surrender  never even if i am the last one standing i am a warrior of archanea to the end
why are you  who are you fighting for are you fighting for emperor hardin
no its not because of that man but because of nyna  and for archanea
but did nyna tell you to fight here do you really think that nyna would hope for this kind of battle
well  i hadnt seen nyna for a while i was told that she fell ill and that i couldnt see her but  since hardin is emperor of archanea i have no choice if i dont follow his orders i will become a traitor and i will be betraying nyna
astram nyna already entrusted the emblem to prince marth do you understand the meaning of her actions
wh what when did this happen jeorge nyna requested prince marth for help
i believe that is the only explanation astram if you want to find out the truth then come with us  if you die here what will midia do you must live on for her you must live on so you can confirm with your eyes what is happening
hmm  i guess i have no choice but jeorge if this war is as hardin said and was caused by prince marths ambitions i will never forgive you remember that
hahaha  its time for me to show you  the destructive power of my meteor magic 
emperor hardin forgive me 
prince marth the enemies in the castle have been vanquished altea is finally in our hands again
really thats great but i stil dont see my sister 
your highness princess elice was taken by gharnef
huh gotoh is that true
he ordered the dark priests to search for clerics of noble birth lena maria  and even your sister elice they have all been taken by gharnef 
is that so  but what is he planning on doing by capturing them
that i dont know but i bet its not anything good the chain of events so far was all the doing of gharnef
gotoh where is he now
i dont know but i bet gharnefs next target will be princess nyna so he is probably at millennium court 
i see we will go to millennium court i will rescue hardin from the darkspheres influence i will defeat gharnef and the dark priests  and i will rescue the captured clerics
